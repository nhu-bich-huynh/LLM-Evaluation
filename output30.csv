This single ""not"" flips the meaning. While both sentences discuss how to handle issues and in which level (local, regional, national), they are addressing *opposite* scenarios. Sentence 2 refers to when they are *not* cross-border, and Sentence 3 when they *are*. Because the key semantic point is switched by the one negating word, there is almost no similarity, as issues cannot simultaneously be ""cross-border"" and ""not cross-border"".Therefore, the similarity is very low, close to 0.```python(0.05, 0.95)```",0.9299238452109287,0.9762,1.0,0.9666666666666668,0.9830508424590636,0.9696969696969696,0.9411764705882352,0.9552238755981288,1.0,0.9666666666666668,0.9830508424590636,"Here'smyanalysis:ThekeydifferencebetweenSentence2andSentence3liesinthephrase""notclearlyofacross-bordernature""Sentence2versus""clearlyofacross-bordernature""Sentence3.Thissingle""not""flipsthemeaning.Whilebothsentencesdiscusshowtohandleissuesandinwhichlevellocal",regional,en
