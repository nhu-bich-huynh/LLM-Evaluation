Text
"I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday."
"We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings."
"But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met."
"Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?"
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced? It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.
"Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done."
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.
"I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case."
"The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November."
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.
We do not know what is happening.
"In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday."
"Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it."
"Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting."
"In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it."
I am not criticising this; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them.
"This means that all the Groups with the exception of the non-attached Members - but, of course, they are not a Group - were in agreement; only your Group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here."
"We believe, however, that the Commission's strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework, not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament, but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the Commission and which describes this programme over the five-year period."
"We have said, very well, if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February."
"After all, we do not wish to quarrel with the Commission; if at all possible, we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tread the same path."
"However, we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission."
You cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content.
"I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already."
"We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it."
It is not a lot to ask.
"Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card."
That did not happen.
"Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion."
You did not call me either.
"I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak."
"When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments."
"Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that."
"If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations."
"If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary."
"Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly."
"They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions."
"By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay."
"Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster."
"All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety."
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.
"I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done."
"In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale."
"Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment."
"There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors."
"With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time."
"This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states."
"This, however, does not seem feasible."
"This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well."
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.
"But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not."
"In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves."
"Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster."
"As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem."
"In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments."
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.
"The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure."
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.
"The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions."
"The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive."
"Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes."
"If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country."
"Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority."
"For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them."
"We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union."
"A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero."
"I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded."
"We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality."
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.
"In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue."
"I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
The consequences do not inspire hope.
"For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment."
"If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly."
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.
"They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement."
"The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service."
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.
"Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months."
"Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion."
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.
"I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives."
"I do not think, however, that this report has come too late."
"Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic."
"I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity."
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.
"This time, however, I actually agree with her. Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say."
"Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee."
"Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far."
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves.
"I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity."
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.
"Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want."
"For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States."
"But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them."
"That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide."
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.
"Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad."
"If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a ""hand-up""."
"Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life."
"Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland."
"Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made."
"Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions."
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.
"The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales."
"Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation."
"The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past."
"Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999."
"I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document."
"I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations."
"Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes."
"You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration."
"And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture."
"The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities."
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.
"For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes."
"Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects."
"This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all."
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.
"From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect."
"The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth."
"Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part."
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.
"Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training."
"If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed."
"By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will."
"Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe."
"Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union."
"This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality."
"The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism."
"If these do not materialise, then, unfortunately, convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions, despite the size of the amounts committed, will end in failure."
"You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports."
"I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed."
"Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past."
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.
"On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context."
"I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy."
"All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds."
"We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were."
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.
"I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem."
"Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned."
"Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned."
"The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon."
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.
"With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself."
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.
"But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation."
"Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition."
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party.
"And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion."
"By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough."
"Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market."
"The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament."
"However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report."
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.
"We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete."
"Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly."
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.
"If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts."
"We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty."
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.
"My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now."
"To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe."
"Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world."
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.
"The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion."
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.
"The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army."
"I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM."
"Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market."
"I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro."
"We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything."
Should we not be discussing this issue?
"As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints."
"Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction."
"The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all."
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.
"First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes."
"Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option."
"What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient."
"But, at the same time, this is not understandable because bad management and non-viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers' money."
"In principle, only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort, or hardly distort, competition."
Amendments Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society.
"Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave. It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that."
"I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless."
"In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market."
"The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application."
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.
"In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?"
"Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules."
"Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit."
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.
"However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1)."
"The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform."
"As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market."
"Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight."
"Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market."
"In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union."
"Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc."
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.
"So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address."
"We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission."
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.
"We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need."
"European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public."
"Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context."
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.
"Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too."
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.
The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.
"Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid."
"Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code."
"We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code."
"I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it."
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.
"In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement"
Not to save jobs.
"Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse."
"State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders."
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.
"The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy."
"Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union' s enlargement."
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.
"Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment."
This is not in question.
"It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience."
"The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term ""foolhardy,"" and this is not allowed."
"Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal."
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.
"Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence."
"It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty."
"In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon."
"I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law."
"What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call ""le parcours du combatant"", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment."
"I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome. The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty."
"The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter."
"The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation."
"At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified."
"The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers."
"So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same."
"Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law."
"The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated."
"As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems."
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).
"Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe."
"I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important."
"I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector."
"Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration."
"As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy."
"As the French say, ""ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain"" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees."
"One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement."
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.
"A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done."
"People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment."
"This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment."
"So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied."
"Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front."
"Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?"
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.
"Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly."
I do not believe so.
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!
"There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted."
"Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces."
"This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage."
"Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics."
"Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level."
"Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system."
"Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force."
"On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights."
"As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?"
"On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime."
"The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered."
"The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration."
"It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF."
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.
"Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?"
"Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general."
"It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system."
"I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first?"
"All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025."
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.
"Not only the difference in income per capita but, above all, large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern."
"I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively."
"Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland."
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.
"This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding."
"Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law."
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.
"Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight."
"The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives."
"(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined."
"In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration."
"In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent."
"They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries."
"That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive."
"While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary."
"We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention."
"In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing."
"Nonetheless, the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made therein. Paragraph 26, for example, ""Draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union"" ."
"Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained."
"- (FR) The Commission' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any ""renationalisation"" of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear."
"Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?"
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.
"Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity."
"We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations."
"This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century."
"We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive."
"Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid."
"Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid."
"Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code."
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.
"A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?"
"If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred."
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.
Why not?
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.
"Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year."
"How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?"
"Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea."
"As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice."
"Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?"
"And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime."
"What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future."
"Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals."
"The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select."
"If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters."
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?
"Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning."
"It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time."
The 15 clearly do not suffice.
"The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money."
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place.
"Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used."
But this is not in place.
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.
"Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate."
"Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future."
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.
"Just you go home and say: "" we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date"" ."
"We need to have a long memory when we say: "" for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."""
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.
"Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing."
"It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards."
"How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?"
"How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?"
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.
I cannot accept this.
"The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue."
"It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing."
"You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list."
"Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!"
"It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks."
"In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them."
"Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union."
"We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones."
"Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry."
"It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources."
"Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks."
"However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct."
"I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact."
"Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks."
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.
"I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport."
"Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms."
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?
"Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience."
"Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?"
"Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there."
"This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional."
"Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations."
"Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure."
"They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through."
"When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge."
"Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone."
"Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion."
"I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem."
"Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one."
"The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience."
"According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors."
"The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags."
"With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately."
"Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States."
I will end now. I will not expand further.
"But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done."
"I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it."
"In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid."
"You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one."
"We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more."
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.
"Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate."
"On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years."
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.
"As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change."
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.
"We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so."
"But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms."
"I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction."
"I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over."
"I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this."
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.
"Hurricane ""Lothar"" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too."
"The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!"
"What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?"
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.
"""We do not have the wherewithal for that,"" they said."
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.
"I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will."
"It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!"
"But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes."
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.
"These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it."
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.
"It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity."
"For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have."
"In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions."
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.
"We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way."
"Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century."
"However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability."
"I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!"
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.
"However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough."
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.
"In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified."
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.
"However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible."
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.
That cannot continue.
"Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority."
"The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one."
"Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?"
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.
"I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved."
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.
"It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them."
"Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them."
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.
"Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was."
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.
"That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future."
"Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged."
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence.
"I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!"
"Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda."
"As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session."
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.
"According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet."
"The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option."
"However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy."
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.
The plant is not yet there. I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.
"If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria."
"Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?"
I do not have these concerns.
"If not, why not?"
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.
"However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium."
"I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?"
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?
I cannot answer that question.
"When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer."
"What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that."
"But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts."
"If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve."
"Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues. I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union."
"We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans."
"It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well."
"It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue."
"Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service."
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.
"As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply."
Mr Nielson cannot be present today since he is in South Africa.
"Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives."
"The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis."
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.
"It is not to be brought in as a ""sort of optional add-on"" ."
"Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies."
"If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority."
"As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject."
"I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia."
"Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential."
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.
"He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible."
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.
This is not the usual state of affairs.
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.
"Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies."
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.
"The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies."
"However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment."
"If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before."
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.
"It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council."
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.
"I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been."
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.
"The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system."
"Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify."
"There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies."
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.
"Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment."
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.
"For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian."
"Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held."
"I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason."
"However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions."
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.
"With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions."
"Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty."
"Since the author is not present, Question No 43 lapses."
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.
"Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed."
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.
"However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis."
"Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?"
"If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?"
"Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers."
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.
"The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements."
"As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark."
It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.
"The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes."
"Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise."
"I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation."
"Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future."
"In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission."
"These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly."
"This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen."
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.
"Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion."
"It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it."
"However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place."
"Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up."
But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.
"As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union."
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.
"Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so."
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.
"But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy."
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.
"We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge."
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.
"A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect."
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.
"Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament."
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.
"In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals."
"At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit."
"At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so."
"I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value."
"In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997."
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.
"It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned."
"The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated."
"We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past."
"In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made."
"If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque."
"In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997."
"Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it."
"1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability."
"The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all."
"I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly."
"I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information."
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.
"Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work."
"But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia."
"Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive."
"Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission."
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.
"It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States."
"Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms."
"This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about."
"I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive."
"I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should."
"Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else."
"In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse."
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.
"Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March."
Have the lessons not been learnt?
"But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination."
"Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation."
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.
"Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow."
"We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service."
It is clear that is not acceptable.
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.
"From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly."
"We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out."
"Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen."
"This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue."
"So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable."
"I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not."
"Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere."
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.
"Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently."
"Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report."
"Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk."
"I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information."
"There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks."
"Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points."
We do not want financial control to be abolished.
"The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise."
"I do not have exact figures, but the Community' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office."
"This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee."
"A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature."
"I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed."
"A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending."
"However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council."
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.
"Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting."
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.
"I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed."
"We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present."
"Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes."
"What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval."
"It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want."
"Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?"
"You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!"
"Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool."
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.
"We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing."
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.
"We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs."
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.
The Commission does not have enough staff.
"As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it."
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs. The staffing system is too rigid.
"Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned."
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.
"The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough."
"The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action."
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.
"Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight."
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.
"I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock."
"Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view."
"First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised."
"According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts."
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.
"Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept."
"Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this."
"It is the responsibility of this Parliament. That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum."
I am not going to mention the length of this report.
"I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does."
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.
"That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report."
"And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy."
"The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough."
"This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens."
"Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative."
"However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control."
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.
"Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations. The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does."
"This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public."
"I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning."
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.
"I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called ""a big bang approach""."
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.
"In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997."
"""The Commission's internal control"" he said ""is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation."
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.
"Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control."
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.
"Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure."
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.
"My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki."
"I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do."
"It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of."
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.
But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace.
"I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing."
"Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening."
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.
"This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised."
"On the other hand, the decision to delay the second round of talks, initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic, is undoubtedly significant, but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed."
"But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public."
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.
"How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know."
"Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date."
"The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility."
"Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process."
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm.
"This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given."
"However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security."
"But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory."
"We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said."
"Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of ""banker"" for the entire operation."
"Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late."
"The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted, as well as not approving new ones, pose further obstacles."
"These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely."
"It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question, which no one discusses anymore, thereby relegating the problems of millions of women, elderly people and children, the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked, to oblivion."
"I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality, but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold, colourless, artificial neon bulbs in our lamps, which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium."
Surely Assad would be Barak' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister.
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown. His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.
"It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron, the United States, not to mention the heavy, equally costly, security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan."
"Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people."
"It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923."
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas."
"However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe."
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.
"But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves."
"This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image, and this is a fact, not a judgement."
"Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged. Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so."
"Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament, you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes."
And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.
"This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime."
"With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council. If this is not to be a mere media event, it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee, the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed."
"The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present."
"Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions, I have to say that I am not moved, rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!"
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.
"I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and, as a consequence, the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities."
"This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning."
"The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity."
"We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives, so that the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible, thus allowing us all to contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which is, without a doubt, the ""jewel in the crown"" of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent."
"However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities."
"We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is ""Less is sometimes more!"""
"If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens."
"We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them."
It has not quite taken off in the European Parliament and the Council meets behind closed doors.
"If the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is kept secret, then we shall not win the citizens over to it."
"This is why I frequently get so worked up, but not over the Council of Ministers."
I should just like to mention another aspect briefly because I do not have much time.
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.
The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals.
"Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression."
"However, it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union."
"Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action."
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees.
"There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union."
"Nevertheless, to avoid the customary circus, which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council, maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years."
"And who is not in favour of security, freedom and justice?"
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society' s sustaining damage as a result.
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen.
"The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community."
"In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured."
"Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying."
"My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well."
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants.
"The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough."
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard' .
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.
"There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived."
"We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard."
"But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of ""normalisation"" and ""harm reduction"" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people."
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.
"From what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer."
"In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN, is it not about time you abandoned your traditional, conservative views on refugees and immigrants?"
"We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg."
"We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security."
"I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation, chaos and confusion."
"In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances."
"However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible."
"With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes."
"Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union."
"This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account."
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.
"Mr Newton Dunn, I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question, and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future."
"With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency."
"We have no problem, Mr Newton Dunn, in repeating this information to you in writing, but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here, because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly."
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question.
"I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled. Instead, my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?
"Does the Council consider that, on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty, national legislation on transparency can be regulated, that is to say legislation not relating to the EU' s institutions?"
"At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter."
"In any event, Article 255 does not, at first sight, allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity."
"How is this to be done when, at the same time, the Commission' s proposal - which has been leaked, so the general public is aware of it - says that employees' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts etc?"
Does not the Council' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process?
"I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions ""outwards"" , it also applies between the institutions."
"By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission' s relationship with the Council."
"It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress. The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency."
"I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all."
"It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay."
"I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular."
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France' s at 10%.
"Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain."
"The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc."
"It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately."
"Nevertheless, Mr Alavanos, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount, in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise, and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground."
"Mr Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner' s responsibilities, and I would like to make two very important points here. The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations."
"There is one thing, however, that we cannot deny, and that is that Mr Kouchner' s efforts to return Kosovo' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive. This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be."
"What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used."
"The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244."
"Since the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses."
"Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG?"
"I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply."
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field.
"We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency."
"I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers. What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth?"
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters.
"The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed."
"We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months."
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.
"At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread."
"First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development."
"Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations."
"You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better."
"Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context."
"Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses."
"Unfortunately, in my case, he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer."
"My question, which has not been answered, is why, when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union, the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether."
"Mr Marinos, we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency, and therefore, the cultural dimension is, I am sure you will appreciate, one of our main concerns."
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.
"I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it."
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.
I cannot think of a better way to do it.
"It is therefore not out of the question that these issues, which crop up again and again, and which are passed from one conference to another, may be addressed."
"As I suspected, it was not exactly a procedural motion, but more a closing of the debate."
"It is not the Portuguese Presidency' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants, especially those that the European Parliament is asking for."
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.
"The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions."
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members.
"If the Union takes the initiative, this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world, including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions."
"Madam President, I do not have a great deal to add on this subject."
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested.
"This is a creative initiative, which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics, but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue."
"As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative, the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue."
"But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency, then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market."
"Finally, even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies, there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected, and that is not the intention."
"For the reasons set out above, I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax."
"Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism, and not just the economic and financial policy experts."
"But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability, as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us, is the result of speculation."
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997.
"The initiators of this question do not propose a solution; instead they are calling for a new burden, they are calling for more bureaucracy, for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee, contrary to several resolutions by Parliament."
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands.
"The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us, they want clarity; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote."
"Madam President, the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one."
"We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union."
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice.
"Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox."
"We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive."
"On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level."
"Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level?"
"However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements."
"I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives."
"As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature."
"In this respect, Mr Bolkestein, the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax."
"Secondly, the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative."
"There should be no confusion in this debate. As environmentalists, we do not want an excuse for a motion."
"Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available."
This argument is therefore not relevant.
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.
"However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10."
"It is not enough that all the world' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries."
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.
"With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation."
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.
"Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will."
"For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy."
"Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation."
"Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow."
"Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue."
"There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: ""It has not been done before""."
"In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past."
"One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance."
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.
"Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days."
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.
"Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?"
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.
"Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago."
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.
"If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment."
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains.
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it.
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.
"The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe."
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored.
"In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results."
"Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new."
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.
"It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect. The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today."
"The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead."
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.
"Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening."
"If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners."
"I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome."
That is not always the case.
"My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax."
"Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language."
"But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours."
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.
"It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that."
"Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least."
"Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together."
"This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria' s integration process."
We should not be so politically partisan.
"We all took part in it, not just one group."
"Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind."
"Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?"
"As early as 1986, we had cause to believe that Mr Jörg Haider was not a man whose principles or attitudes were consistent with decency and modern liberalism."
I hasten to add that our quarrel is not with the Austrian people.
"We must promote and defend those rights, all the while saying to the people of Austria: our quarrel is not with you."
"It may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure but we accept Mr President-in-Office, that it is rooted in idealism and for that reason we are inclined to support it."
"On this continent, of all places, with the experience of hateful racism that we have suffered from in the past and at such great cost, we have to insist that today' s debate is not about interference with the sovereign rights of a State."
It is a dogged insistence by the democratically elected part of the institutions of this Union that we will not as Europeans countenance turning the clock back.
"Going along with such a prospect would be tantamount to testifying, albeit unwillingly, to the respectability of a political force which is not respectable."
"Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist."
"No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union' s credibility."
"Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government."
"(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles."
"Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this."
"This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions."
"We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights."
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.
"We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics."
"If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them."
"We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich."
"My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well."
"Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion."
"Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt."
My country' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...
"Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto, and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media."
Not even Mr Sichrovsky' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that.
"I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate."
"You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party' s summit meeting."
"We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values."
"I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s."
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.
"This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe."
"We are talking about us, not Austria."
"We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe."
"Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat."
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.
"However, that is not the problem."
"Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price."
"It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty."
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.
"In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire.'"
"So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point."
"If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement."
"European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner."
"Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today."
"That should be our task, not political posturing."
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.
"The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened."
And this is not pure chance.
"I feel that today' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider' s party."
"This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money."
"Well, we cannot accept such statements."
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?
"One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did."
"It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty."
"It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!"
"Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation' ."
"However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct."
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.
"It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action."
"Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear."
"As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics."
"Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut."
"They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin."
"For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on. Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban."
"This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use."
"There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions."
"However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle."
"It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base."
"Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not."
"So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today."
"I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative."
"Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban."
"It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban."
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.
"In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first."
"In other words, a product' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous."
"No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals."
"It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis."
"Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this."
"When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?"
"Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case."
"The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that."
"Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided."
"I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa."
"As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis."
"How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?"
"How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?"
"That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!"
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.
"We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily."
"From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent."
"I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows."
"Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions."
"Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public."
"Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end."
"All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki."
"Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference."
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.
"However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself."
"However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union."
"The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves."
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.
"It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months."
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.
"I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said."
"We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session."
"It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events."
"We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful."
"After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future."
"How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?"
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.
"I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties."
"We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent."
"We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future."
"We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny."
"This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system."
"The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending."
"It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues."
"In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised. Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come."
"Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman."
"I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public."
"The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s motions are anything to go by."
"Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank."
"The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor."
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.
"The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences."
", chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager."
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor' s book.
"It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission."
"Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves."
"Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation."
"Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda."
"Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union."
"It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union."
"The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world."
"The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?"
"And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this."
"I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values."
"The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base."
"I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe."
"You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process."
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.
"In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions."
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone.
"Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state."
"Of course they do, but they are not unlimited."
"I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions."
"Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones."
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not.
"It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place."
"We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one."
"Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference."
"We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label."
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.
"It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth."
"As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now."
"They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with."
"This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details."
"Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying."
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.
"Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same."
"This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union."
"Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency."
"We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000."
"Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing."
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully.
"We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions."
"These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain."
"However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue."
"Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies."
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement.
"Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned."
"An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter."
"What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States."
"I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them."
"However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State."
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.
"Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided."
"If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive."
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law.
"We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver ""EC service provision card"" and not ""EU service provision card"" ."
"This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that."
"If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them."
"I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low."
"So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation."
"It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended."
"Personally, I am rather in favour of the term ""EU service provision card"" which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this."
"In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate."
"It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth."
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.
"This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court."
"This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union."
"Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice."
"In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve."
"In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance."
"Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied."
"Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid."
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration.
This is not our opinion.
The other parties are not paying.
"This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors."
"It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid."
"In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either."
"In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place."
"There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources."
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.
"It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner' s outstanding bills."
"I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie."
"Let us make this clear, however much some people may not wish to believe it."
"I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin."
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.
"Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed."
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.
"However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process."
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents.
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.
"One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims. In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres."
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations.
"This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there."
"Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!"
"Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months."
"Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so."
"The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random."
"Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place."
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise.
"I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally."
"That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources."
"In other words, we should not establish conditionality, or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start, but, nevertheless, we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage."
"In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing."
"There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council."
"Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects."
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.
"If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned."
"It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal."
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear.
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up.
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources.
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale.
"In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion."
"In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term."
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone.
"An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million."
"We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament."
"In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to."
"Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive."
"However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case."
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region.
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change. If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do.
"Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate."
"We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect."
What kind of horse-trading system is this? Certainly not a fair one!
"We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access."
"However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union' s most important programmes."
"It is also of great importance to citizens. We should, above all, not lose sight of this."
"The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view."
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.
"The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result."
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.
"I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen."
"Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council."
"When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end."
"As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this."
"Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important."
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.
"However, it is not under threat from Europe."
"We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat."
"Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can."
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s goals.
"There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness."
"It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests."
"The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished."
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro!
"Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm!"
"Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions."
"Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone."
"I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause."
"This is not rhetoric, but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission."
"We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past."
"Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community."
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver.
"I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper."
"I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union."
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.
"I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union."
"Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union."
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive.
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either.
"We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point."
"Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction."
"Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many."
"Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves."
"It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment."
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House.
"I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers' expense."
The principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied.
"Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles."
"It has not, however, been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle."
"In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens."
"Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill."
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe.
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.
"So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of."
"Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way."
"There is, however, one thing we should not overlook."
"After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making. Quite the reverse, in fact."
"It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses. Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity."
"I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it."
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things.
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence.
"In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons."
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work.
"Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45."
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists.
"With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it."
"Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force."
"If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues."
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.
"To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity."
"Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case."
"Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe."
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.
"Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive."
"Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic."
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling.
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.
Do not continue in this vein!
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!
"Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues."
"Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC."
"In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken."
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not.
"It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development."
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation.
"Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved."
"Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy."
"Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position. I would like to comment on two things."
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way.
These costs are not very high.
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise.
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers' liability.
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers!
"Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think."
"In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies."
We cannot accept this.
"It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough."
"Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended."
"The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said."
That is not unreasonable.
I cannot accept that.
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it.
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.
"Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy."
"Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process."
"Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved."
"There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies."
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.
"It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!"
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation.
"If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order."
"I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly."
"In anticipation of this EU directive' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied."
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.
"Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market."
"I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate."
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.
"I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically."
"The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles."
"I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market."
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either.
I do not think so.
"The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million. In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition unequal but, in terms of environmental protection, I want freedom from costs for the last owner, to be financed by a special fund, and manufacturer responsibility for new cars, which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars!"
"The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost."
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that.
"Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive."
Why would it not work elsewhere?
"We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it, and there is no excuse for not taking action."
"This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled."
"It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle."
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car.
"Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive?"
"The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed."
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it?
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?
"No, of course not."
"Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment."
"We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars."
The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one.
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry.
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.
It is still not an insurmountable problem.
"If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters.
They cannot therefore be approved.
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.
"The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions."
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.
"So, whatever has been stated in this regard, vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive."
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.
This is not covered by the directive.
"Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage."
"Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive' s area of applicability."
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4.
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.
It should not be in the amendment.
"Madam President, I would simply like to point out that during the procedure, we were not allowed either to table or, consequently, adopt amendments in the Committee."
"I do not know whether this is in order, and I would therefore ask you to verify the accuracy of the procedure which was followed before this report reached the House."
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.
"This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic."
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.
And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?
It is not a quota!
"It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States."
"Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions."
"By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour."
"I have rejected the entire directive, not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House."
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.
"I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system."
"I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility."
"I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries."
"Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included."
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.
"We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone."
This should not in any way be jeopardised.
"We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays."
"These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities."
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.
"In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good."
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.
"No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity."
"Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials."
"Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction."
"However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure."
"Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good."
"Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union. Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh."
"This means that this proposal' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services."
We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems.
"The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent."
"That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension. We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding."
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.
"It is therefore easy to understand the public' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them."
"Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned."
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us.
"The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the ""Amsterdam left-overs"" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these."
"extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended"
"Beyond this, we have concerns that the ""flexibility"" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present."
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.
"Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party."
"I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party, because it does not do to kick a man when he is down, still less when he is dead and gone."
"It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve."
This is not the way to fight extremism.
The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered.
"Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government."
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics.
"However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy."
"However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition."
Leopards do not change their spots.
"Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken."
"I respect Parliament' s wish, as it has been expressed, but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question, even by the European Parliament."
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens' indifference to Europe.
"However, recent events - firstly, what were really threats by the Council of Ministers, then Mr Prodi' s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and, finally, the present decision - are things I cannot support."
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises.
"Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive."
"They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ. On the contrary, they will strengthen them."
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.
". (DA) The Left' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that, with today' s decision, Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers' diplomatic sanctions against Austria."
"In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution."
"We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery."
"More generally, those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy, devoted exclusively to the interests of big business, has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders, and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right."
"By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jörg Haider' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a ""Europe of shopkeepers"" ."
"I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter."
"Do not count on me to keep quiet, without doing or saying anything."
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government.
"Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous."
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider.
"However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem."
"""He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."""
"It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, ""the brown plague"" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory."
"Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control."
"As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, ""In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"""
"This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers."
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service.
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye.
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values.
"On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed."
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.
"However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State."
"I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right."
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.
"I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this."
"The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are."
"Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?"
"I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices, because that would be a very serious matter indeed."
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC?
"Gentlemen, obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes."
"I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point."
"If it is of any comfort to her, the Irish have not got their channel yet either."
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.
"Madam President, I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that, until proved otherwise, we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable."
"Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France."
"Madam President, it is hugely important to the Liberal Group that we talk about the situation in Cambodia, and that this is done at this particular time, not only on account of the letter which UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has written to the government in Cambodia, asking it to take steps, at long last, to set up a special tribunal in order to call the leaders of the Khmer Rouge to account, but also because the Hun Sen regime, obviously not content with the attempted assassinations of the leader of the opposition, Mr Sam Raninsy, has now considered that his parliamentary immunity should be lifted to boot, so that he can simply be brought before the court."
"Here we are not adding any more sub-items under the 'Human Rights' heading, we are introducing new items."
"Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued."
"Since the Belgian Government' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial."
"We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist."
"I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure."
"We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure."
"It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin."
"It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays."
"Relating to Friday, on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels, as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda."
"We already have a directive. It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997."
"At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter. My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate."
"Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time."
"Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced."
"I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way."
"The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C."
"I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation."
"LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million."
"I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities."
"However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday."
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor.
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.
"That is why again, in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have single, ""mono"" problems."
"Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential."
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.
"In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects."
"We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion."
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!
I think that it is important not to stick rigidly to this arbitrary quantitative restriction and instead to leave it to the Member States to decide between how many projects they each wish to divide the support funds to which they are entitled.
In any case it is necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it is not only areas of large cities which are again in receipt of the support.
Just as important in my view is not to broaden the selection criteria for URBAN II too much and thus water them down.
"Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either."
"This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it."
"It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions."
"Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries."
"The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not."
"The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time."
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!
"Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval."
"In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union' s blessing."
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.
"But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet."
"As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils."
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.
"Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting."
"When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation."
"According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998, this is not an imagined risk."
"The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds."
"I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case."
"In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit."
"Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II. However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway."
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.
"It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage."
"This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland."
"I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone."
"I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all."
"Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees."
"This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy."
"It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation."
"The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough."
"The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned."
This is not very good at all.
"Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud."
"They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role."
"As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities."
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country."
"Only, the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped."
"This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date."
"I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them."
"It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group."
This is not the case!
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister' s treasury funds.
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.
"So far, some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes, while others have not."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance."
"I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density."
"In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most."
"However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory."
"We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute."
"Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies."
"Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment."
"This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone."
"It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean."
My group will not be supporting those amendments.
"For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings."
"INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory."
"Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year."
"Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality."
"For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job."
"If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times."
"Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction."
"I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on."
"That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas. Of course this is also the basic idea."
"There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy."
"That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!"
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.
"They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1."
"It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered."
"I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II."
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.
"The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds."
"Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect."
"That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution, to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group."
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.
"As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole."
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU.
"Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament."
"We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic."
This is not policy; it is life' s simple logic.
"Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources."
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.
"There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment."
"I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs."
"Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man."
"I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her, for all you owe her as far as this is initiative, as well as, more generally, all we owe Parliament."
"Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name."
"I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did."
"This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit."
"This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage."
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.
"I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency."
"I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain."
"According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23."
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.
"I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union."
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.
"I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed."
"Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13."
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow.
"I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala."
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane. I did not hide behind any immunity.
"If not, then we will proceed to the vote."
"Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification."
"This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go."
"Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself."
"This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world."
"Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature."
"Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present."
"The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now."
"This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union."
"With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document."
"But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself."
"One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe."
"We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001."
"It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals."
"When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on."
"I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid."
"Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all."
"My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia."
"If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty."
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.
"Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans."
"In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes."
"Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice."
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.
"I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together."
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.
"Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development."
"Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace."
"For us, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years. We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact."
"If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law."
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi' s fault.
"When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household. We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme."
"Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society."
"We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development."
"Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round."
"Above all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible."
"Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective."
"We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify."
"I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge."
"We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society."
"That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority."
"We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of ""them and us""."
"I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today."
"I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi."
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone.
"It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric."
"Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding."
But all is not lost.
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.
"I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level."
"Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed."
"So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s duty."
"In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union."
"Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty."
"It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has been the case in the past."
"If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard."
"As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective."
"If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do."
We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further.
"Like yourself, he promised ""less and better"" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered ""much more and much worse"" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise."
"Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels."
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high?
"We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society."
"Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement."
The Commission is not in fact today a European government.
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament.
"Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent."
That does not apply to Austria alone.
"When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough."
"The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation."
"What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances."
"In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model."
"We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only."
"It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed."
"I myself want to refer to a subject which has not been mentioned but which is on the agenda, namely the Commission' s work programme for 2000."
"I am aware of the limitations of the exercise given that we have to work within the current Treaty and are therefore restricted by its operational rules. I am thinking in this respect of the important issue of taxation which I am not, however, going to talk about."
"For example, in the social area, it is not enough to announce a communication on a programme of social action."
We are working on the basis of a directive whose limitations have been clearly demonstrated. I therefore propose that this should be reviewed in order to produce a directive which is more effective in protecting employment and also in imposing penalties on those who do not comply.
This is all very well but it seems that the text to be proposed will not contain any specific objectives or a timetable for implementation. Perhaps you can correct me on this.
"Finally, on the subject of the WTO, the idea of relaunching a new global round is not necessarily bad. However, in the first place, the Commission should make proposals on changing the operational rules of the WTO."
"Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks."
"The applicant countries' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems."
"Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics."
"Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases."
"Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm."
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few.
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket?
"Is it not rather melodramatic to say that ""the world looks up to Europe"" ?"
"It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less?"
We could not agree more with the latter.
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?"
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.
"Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right."
"Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly."
"Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate."
"If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid."
"It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union."
"Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together."
"A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example."
"That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions."
"The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community."
"So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all."
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat.
This is not impossible.
"This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there."
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.
"You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government."
"Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position."
"Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you."
"Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre."
"Your sabre-rattling fools no one because, as you know perfectly well, whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax."
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.
"Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you."
You could not care less what the people of Europe want.
"In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level."
"It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone."
"Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion."
"They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual, without forgetting, naturally, that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business, to invest and risk, and in an ordered and focused system, entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity."
"In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man."
"Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union."
"My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously."
"That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic."
"You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals."
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.
"My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'."
"For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price."
"In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed."
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic.
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.
"Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed."
"You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health."
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this.
"Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life."
"In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others."
"You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice."
Not a euro more or a euro less.
It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council.
"I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones."
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system.
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.
"Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment."
You still have not finished that agenda.
"Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage."
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.
"What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy."
I do not necessarily mean financial resources.
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.
It is not easy to combine those aims.
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ?
"The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions."
"Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe."
"They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation."
"In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world."
"What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out."
"We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world' s most dynamic and competitive regions."
"Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank."
"We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world."
"It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002."
"However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification."
Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.
"I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy."
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured.
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme."
"Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission."
"Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe."
Declarations of principle are not enough.
"When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?"
"No, it does not!"
"No, you have not done so."
"You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement."
You have not integrated it anywhere.
"Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about."
". (ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all."
"I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening."
"Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP."
"I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required."
"You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation."
Certainly not!
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious.
"This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating. You must therefore listen to our opinions, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech."
"You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be."
"The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else."
"However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe."
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.
"I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand."
"If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately."
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again?
Without them we would not be able to function.
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament.
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants.
"There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People' s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent."
"For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States."
Disparate actions are not effective.
