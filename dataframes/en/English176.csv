"Text"
"The Commission supports this, but I have been informed that there may be some legal obstacles to the subsequent text on reporting on the Community and national legislation and so we will have to look at this more closely."
"The amendment also refers to enforcement, and this really takes us back to previous debates."
"The Agency's main role is to provide the institutions of the Community and Member States with information on what is happening with our environment."
"This can be achieved by working closely with Member States."
"If we start to mix the information role with an enforcement role and incorporate this in the regulations, we risk undermining the cooperation and hence the effectiveness of the Agency."
"In fact, this may mean that we risk not getting the information we need, and that also makes it clear that I do not share the view which Ian White expressed in his contribution."
"I do not feel we should include enforcement in the Agency's tasks, because it is assumed that the conclusions which the Agency reaches on the environmental situation will tell us more about whether our legislation and mechanisms are being effective."
"And, as Parliament knows, I have not been backward when it comes to enforcement."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 6 are useful proposals which the Commission accepts."
"As far as Amendment No 4 is concerned, we can only accept the wording that the Agency will ensure that environmental information is widely distributed if we can add a note to the effect that, in particular, this includes information on the environmental situation."
"This will help focus work on the Agency's skills and knowledge without preventing work in other fields."
"We accept the demand for enabling the use of all official languages which both Mr Collins and Mrs Diez de Rivera wanted."
"However, we think the reference to a new article 2.14 is superfluous."
"As far as Amendment No 5 is concerned, the legal department informs us that Parliament's proposals should not propose amendments to articles which have already been amended in the Commission's proposals."
"Having said that, we can support the point on IMPEL which Mr Collins also brought up today, and I can tell you that cooperation is already in place, as was confirmed at the last IMPEL meeting."
"I can also state that the Council's environmental working party is considering how this specific reference can be included in the regulations."
"Amendment Nos 7 and 8 are understandable, but we believe they are unnecessary."
"Finally, as regards Amendment No 9, we can support the comment that the next audit of the Agency's work should be carried out as part of developing the EU's environmental policy in general."
"The Agency can help us considerably by establishing itself as an independent, objective supplier of reliable information: this could be on greenhouse gas emissions, coolant tanks and so on."
"In view of this, I cannot rule out assessing profitability, and the Commission's proposals therefore include a demand for an assessment of results and effectiveness in 1999."
"However, profitability will be examined in terms of the Agency's own targets, roles and results and not in any wider context such as the Commission's targets."
"Finally, I would like to say that we can also accept the comment in Amendment No 9 that Parliament should also receive the audit report by 15 September 1999, and I would like to end by giving my thanks once more for the debate we have had today and thanking Mr Collins, the rapporteur, for all the work on the proposals."
"Once again, the focus has been on the Agency's work, and that is good."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Ionized food"
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz on her long involvement in this matter which far preceded my coming into this Parliament and may well go on long after I have left it."
"Apparently the international radura label is sending Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz blind."
"There are many things that might send you blind, but I would not have thought this innocent label is one of them."
"It is one of the issues on which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection took a different view in its own debate from the point of view the rapporteur has put today."
"Opinion is still divided on when and how irradiation can be used for the preservation of food."
"What has changed, of course, in these eight years - and this makes it impossible for us to go back to a renewed first reading - is the arrival of the Single Market."
"In many Member States now, which have set their face against irradiation, there is a probability that they will now have to admit irradiated foods whether they like it or not."
"Tesco, in my country, has shown that a not insignificant percentage of foodstuffs not declared as irradiated have been found to be so."
"So I think one of the first principles which is in the proposals that have come back to us in this long-delayed common position which we have been presented with is that you should put consumer safety - and first, and foremost, information - at the head of our agenda."
"The principles which should guide us today have been clear since that first reading debate."
"They are: only irradiate when public health gains and the consumer benefits; label with accuracy but not with hysteria; and strictly limit the products which are so treated with additions subject to codecision."
"Frogs' legs, which Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz mentioned, are now struck off from the list of products, and quite rightly so."
"We are now down to three products."
"We do not want to see further additions without a quite specific procedure subject to codecision once more before they are authorized."
"This is what the Environment Committee's own amendments have attempted."
"The consensus that we have built there, supplemented tonight, I hope, by agreement on the radura label - I look forward to hearing what the spokesman of the EPP says on this because they have been very reluctant to have any proper warning labelling - is the best approach, rather than the skull and cross-bones approach which we have had from the rapporteur."
"I do not know which of the amendments will be ruled in order because a number were struck out in the Environment Committee."
"So it is hard to argue a hypothesis."
"We do not know what you will accept at this stage."
"We cannot support Amendments Nos 29, 31, 32 and 33 because the key cautionary words there - what the rapporteur wishes to say - have been absorbed into the other committee amendments or by alternative symbols or the careful wording we have put in our Amendment No 30."
"In conclusion, what we want is a precautionary framework and not a prohibitive diatribe."
"I appeal to colleagues to support the amendments of the Environment Committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can understand the rapporteur's dissatisfaction at the rejection of these amendments which are only made necessary in the first place because of a new report from the Council."
"I urge the President to reconsider this, because we really need these amendments."
"They concern new issues that we need to vote on, in my opinion."
"So I too believe it is high time we made some headway on the directive on the irradiation of foodstuffs."
"A start was made many years back."
"The previous speakers have already mentioned that it took the Council eight years to reach a decision."
"Of course national regulations range from a complete ban on irradiation to its unrestricted use."
"That means there will naturally be problems in reaching a consensus, but eight years seems a bit too long to me."
"At the heart of all this are the people who ultimately consume these foodstuffs, the consumers."
"I believe that they should be able to tell if a product has been irradiated or not."
"The labelling requirement takes account of this and is therefore an essential component of this directive."
"Mr Whitehead, we need to clearly follow the labelling directive here, as it shows us the way forward."
"Madam rapporteur, you yourself have seen the problems with new signs and symbols."
"They will not work."
"Let us stick to what the consumer knows and write it on the label."
"As far as I am concerned we could also stipulate the dimensions in centimetres or some other unit."
"But consumers are used to the label showing how a product has been treated."
"So I would like to make a plea that we should proceed along the lines of the labelling directive, which seems far better."
"Another extremely important issue is the detectability of irradiation."
"Without it, how can we spot any inaccurate information on labels?"
"If we are to allow foodstuffs to be irradiated, we must ensure that the interests of the consumer are protected and that proper monitoring is possible."
"These proposals would guarantee that."
"Furthermore, we must stick to the principle that hygiene and health provisions, and satisfactory production and farming methods, in accordance with European standards should always be given priority over irradiating foodstuffs."
"We must veto any attempts to rely on irradiation instead because it might be cheaper."
"We have our consumers' health in our hands here today."
"We take this responsibility seriously and call for compulsory labelling and for checks on irradiated products, in order to protect Europe's consumers."
"We in this Parliament naturally want to take part in the important decision-making process that lies ahead."
"Nothing inspires more confidence in consumers than open discussion in Parliament."
"We will certainly have enough to discuss when it comes to the list of approved foods."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal regarding the ionization of food was presented for first reading in 1989."
"It raised so many problems, so many fears on the part of the general public, Parliament and the Council, that the latter did not adopt a common position until 27 October 1997, eight years later!"
"To clarify the debate, two quite distinct parts have been proposed: on the one hand, a framework directive regarding the general conditions for food ionization, and on the other, an implementing directive establishing the list of food products which may be ionized, a list which currently consists of only one category of product: herbs and spices."
"We can congratulate ourselves on the adoption of this directive, whose objective is firstly to safeguard health, but also to provide the consumer with sufficient information."
"Indeed, all the studies carried out up until now have unambiguously demonstrated that ionization of food products poses no risk whatsoever to the health and safety of the consumer."
"The ionization of food, of products susceptible to contamination, for example, must even be considered as beneficial to the consumer by providing safer, healthier food and by preserving the nutritional quality of the product better than other techniques."
"However, this method must not serve to cover up defective preparation of a food product, nor be employed when it is not necessary."
"In conclusion, this directive brings every possible guarantee of clear information and control of the different stages of food ionization."
"It can be voted for without the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, which bring no improvement and which, on the contrary, risk causing detrimental confusion by using a symbol, which is misleadingly worrying, which would label food as ""radura' when an unambiguous label has already been provided for."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this report."
"In the common position irradiation is accepted as a possible method of preserving foodstuffs."
"Even though at present there is only one category, which was mentioned earlier, namely herbs and spices, it is still the idea that it should be possible to use it for considerably more foodstuffs."
"I believe that is what people must take into consideration when they decide on this issue."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has put its finger on the health aspects."
"I think that is important and would appeal to the Members of this House to support the amendments from the Committee on the Environment."
"Then there will be an opportunity to further strengthen the opinions in the common position."
"We know that in today's EU it is the case that certain countries allow the irradiation of foodstuffs, while other countries do not allow it, such as Sweden and Germany."
"Personally I am of the opinion that radiation does not belong together with food and foodstuffs."
"It should therefore not be allowed to happen."
"In itself, what has been said here may be true, that it does not present any risk to human health."
"There are also tough requirements so that it is not allowed to present any risk."
"However, there is another aspect, namely the false impression of freshness which irradiated foodstuffs can give."
"Food can look as if it is quite fresh, even though underneath it is old and quite bad."
"That is a way to mislead consumers."
"In this respect, it does not help no matter how many labels are put on food because the appearance itself misleads consumers."
"For my part, I am going to support the rapporteur's amendments in this House, even though my group is limiting itself mainly to supporting the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment."
"I see it as two steps: first and foremost that we support the Committee on the Environment; but the same time it would make sense to go a step further and support the amendments which have been presented to the parliamentary debate by the Green Group."
"Mr President, the fact that several Member States have already been imposing a ban on the irradiation of foodstuffs for many years, and that this has worked very well, shows that irradiation is fundamentally unnecessary as a method of preserving food."
"There are also clear disadvantages with losses in nutritional value when you extend the shelf life of foodstuffs."
"The best thing in this situation would be if we could decide on a ban on the irradiation of foodstuffs with the exception of herbs and spices, but we do not have that option here."
"The choice between the Council's position and the proposals of the Committee on the Environment is simple."
"The Committee on the Environment tightens the rules in this area on a number of points, not least with regard to labelling, the view on hygiene and health practices which cannot be substituted by irradiation, and methods of analysis."
"My group is therefore going to vote in favour, not only of the Committee on the Environment's amendments, but also most of the amendments proposed by the Green Group."
"Mr President, in October 1989 I was amongst those who voted for my colleague, Mrs Block von Blottnitz's report, who at the time was no longer here. She had been replaced by Mrs Quistoudt-Rowohl but in fact it was she who had drawn up the report."
"This report, which was voted for by a very large majority, proposed the banning of the principle of food irradiation, with the exception of herbs and spices."
"The position of the Council, which is a double one, and which has taken eight years to reach us, is based on the opposite logic."
"Now it is setting up this method as a method of food conservation with, firstly, the possibility of irradiating herbs and spices."
"Given the enormous amount of time that has lapsed, I therefore find it logical to accept all the amendments which move in the direction of re-establishing the position at the time of the first reading."
"I note that some of the amendments will not be put to the vote, unless the Presidency changes its mind before tomorrow, in particular Amendment No 27, but also two amendments which were approved by the Committee on the Environment, numbers 10 and 13."
"Nevertheless, there is a problem with this."
"The Chairman of the Committee on the Environment rejected certain amendments but accepted others and the Presidency of the Parliament has taken another position."
"You must admit that this makes things a bit messy."
"In such conditions, wisdom would suggest that all of the amendments are accepted and submitted to the vote, in the knowledge that some will not be voted for."
"I would though like to ask for two types of amendment: those which recommend a logo."
"I have furthermore cosigned, with Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, an amendment requesting that there should be a very clear logo."
"Indeed, the labelling as it is anticipated is insufficient, we all know that, and does not enable the consumer to be seriously informed."
"In addition, I believe that it is necessary to have a systematic method of analysis."
"How can we accept that irradiated products may be put on the market when a standardized and effective method of analysis does not exist?"
"It is unacceptable."
"You cannot have a ruling which has no method of verifying whether it has been respected or not."
"It is incoherent."
"I therefore propose that we vote for these amendments through a concern for coherence, in particular, Amendment No 27."
"Mr President, common consumption rules in the EU are good in principle, as there is a considerable volume of goods in circulation."
"When goods cross frontiers, we risk having to accept irradiated products in practice, unless this field is regulated."
"Irradiating food must not become the solution to long distance haulage and poor storage."
"An irradiated apple may look fresh, but actually be old."
"Shops can continue to sell food past its sell-by date if irradiation is allowed."
"The Council proposes that very few foods may be irradiated - only spices."
"I am satisfied with that. But, unfortunately, gradually extending the allowed list could alter this situation."
"The requirements are stringent, that must be admitted, but it is essential that things happen out in the open, with Parliament's involvement and in accordance with important health and consumer principles."
"One of the main principles of the EU's consumer legislation is that consumers must not be misled."
"They would be if we allowed irradiation, because food would appear to be different from how it actually is."
"The need for irradiation as a way of preserving food is also hard to see."
"Europe has mountains of food."
"If food can be irradiated, it must be marked in any case."
"Consumers must be able to choose, even in the cases which pass the health test;"
"I support the studies of the health risks from irradiation."
"Nor does irradiation deal with all the toxins in food."
"On the contrary, some of them thrive on it."
"It is also important to say what methods of irradiation may be used."
"This is an aspect the Council has overlooked, but which the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment will be taking up."
"Mr President, I can agree wholeheartedly with my party colleague, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz."
"The irradiation of foodstuffs is risky and unnecessary, at least for all foodstuffs with the possible exception of certain herbs and spices."
"That is also the official view of the Swedish government."
"Under current Swedish rules, irradiation is banned except for certain herbs and spices."
"That makes this a very special case for Sweden."
"One of the most important promises given before Sweden's membership of the EU was that no rules for the protection of health and the environment would have to be weakened."
"I repeat: no such rules would have to be weakened."
"If Parliament does not follow Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' amendments, Sweden will be forced to weaken its legislation."
"That would further intensify the crisis which exists, for many reasons, between Sweden and the EU."
"If that happens, it would be the most serious weakening of Swedish health rules, so I really hope that Parliament supports Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' amendments."
"Mr President, I find myself having to take part in this second reading debate and vote, despite the fact that the first reading took place before my country joined the European Union, so that neither I nor anyone else from my country had an opportunity then to bring forward ideas or modifications that could be reintroduced as amendments now."
"I really think that in view of all the changes in the European Community and given its enlargement, we need to rethink the rules for first and second readings and conciliation, so that all Member States are on the same footing."
"As for the subject matter itself, my view is that we should avoid irradiating foodstuffs, because I am afraid that it will be used to give an appearance of freshness and as a substitute for other hygiene measures, thus misleading consumers."
"Nevertheless, I believe that we need to proceed with this second reading and that the vote in the part-session should mirror the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, because information, labelling and above all checks on irradiated products need to be prescribed in the interests of consumers throughout the internal market. That is the only way to guarantee that consumers have a free choice of foodstuffs."
"I also think it is particularly important that we should be able to follow the deliberations of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs in public, that we should have a say, and I do not mean just having an influence on which foodstuffs are added to the herbs and spices already on the list. We also need to have information on the duration and strength of the irradiation of individual foodstuffs, which is also important."
"Only openness and labelling will convince consumers that the European Parliament and the European Union are concerned about preventive health protection and are working on it."
"Mr President, the Commission's 1989 proposals were aimed at establishing a system of close checks on irradiated food, right through from producers' use of the process to sales of products to end-users."
"To make it easier to get legislation passed on this subject, the Council divided the proposals into two parts, namely a framework directive and an implementation directive, with a list of the foodstuffs which could be irradiated."
"The eight category of foods in the Commission's proposals as amended were reduced to one in the common position, namely dried, aromatic spices, including roots."
"On the proposal's position on whether it is necessary to use standardised methods of inspection to detect if food has been irradiated, I must point out that controls on many other preservation processes involve administrative and not laboratory checks."
"As you will know, the standardisation work is being carried out by an independent body, the CEN."
"Like other foods, irradiated food is covered by the control directives, namely Directives 89/397 and 93/99."
"This means that Amendments Nos 9, the second part of 11, 13, 27 and 32 to the framework directive cannot be accepted, nor can the corresponding amendments to the implementation directive, namely Nos 2, 3 and the second part of 1."
"As far as the selection procedure is concerned, it should be remembered that any amendments of a political nature must be approved at this meeting."
"So any criticism of the draft to the effect that the regulatory committee has too much influence on this directive is unjustified."
"The Standing Committee can only take political decisions in cases where a Member State has implemented protective measures."
"So the Commission must stand by the Council's wording and reject Amendments Nos 8 and 19."
"To deal with technical questions, the recommendation states that the Standing Committee should have advisory status, as the Commission originally proposed."
"To ensure that the directive is not blocked, although according to the White Paper, it should already have been adopted, the Commission has been forced to accept a regulatory committee."
"It is therefore impossible to accept Amendments Nos 14, 16 and 17, which deal with the appointment procedure, or Amendment No 15 on the internal rules of the committee, which it passes itself."
"As far as the obligation to consult the Scientific Committee on Food in Article 13 is concerned, this should not be confused with the joint decision-making procedure which the directive lays down for passing further provisions affecting public health."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 18 are therefore unnecessary and are rejected."
"As marking is now obligatory in all cases, consumers will always be able to make an informed choice between products which contain and do not contain irradiated ingredients."
"Amendments Nos 5, 26 and 29, introducing a symbol to indicate food which has been treated, are therefore superfluous and cannot be accepted."
"Many of the amendments are designed to supplement and clarify the text."
"I am referring here to Amendments Nos 1, 2, the first part of 3, 4, 7 and 12 to the framework directive and the first part of Amendment No 1 to the implementing directive."
"Amendments Nos 30, 31 and 33 cannot be accepted, as there cannot be any doubt that the procedure is safe."
"Amendment No 10 links the conditions for permitting irradiation of food to the obligation on Member States to provide the Commission with information."
"There is no close connection between the two subjects, and so the proposal cannot be accepted."
"The first part of Amendment No 11 is unacceptable as the question is covered by section 1 of Article 1."
"Amendment No 24 reduces the time available for withdrawing irradiated products which do not meet the terms of the directive from 24 to 12 months."
"Such a short period would make implementing the directive very difficult, and the amendment proposed must therefore be rejected."
"Amendments Nos 21, 22 and 28 restrict the opportunities for using and exploiting the irradiation of food."
"It is difficult to justify why consumers, who must finally decide what is beneficial or necessary to them, should not be able to take decisions for themselves, but have certain conditions imposed on them instead."
"This amendment cannot therefore be accepted."
"Thank you, Madam Commissioner."
"I have heard the statements of several Members in connection with the amendments declared inadmissible by the President."
"As I imagine that the matter will be raised tomorrow as well, I would like to remind you of its content."
"Article 125 states that, ""the President shall decide' : Mr Lannoye, not the Presidency, but the President, in other words, not the President at the time but the President of Parliament."
"The end of Article 125 states, ""The President's decision...concerning the admissibility of amendments is not based exclusively on the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Rule but on the provisions of the Rules in general' ."
"Article 72 states that, ""The President's discretion to declare an amendment admissible or inadmissible cannot be questioned' , on which account the doors seem to be closed."
"However, I would also like to read, just for information and out of curiosity, paragraph 2 of Article 70, which states that, ""In the light of the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee, Parliament's delegation may recommend that consideration of the common position and any amendments tabled to it be resumed or, in consultation with the committee responsible, propose new amendments for consideration by Parliament in accordance with Rule 72' ."
"Naturally, behind this paragraph of the Rules of Procedure lies an entirely politico-institutional question relating to the conciliation procedure and the merits of the results of conciliation, but I still seem to sense a slight possibility there, at least in the Rules of Procedure, for later on."
"I have also read these articles because I think I will have to chair the conciliation, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, on which account we will have to discuss this problem again."
"Mr President, I am pleased that we shall be sitting on the Conciliation Committee together; that makes me more optimistic."
"However, I think that what the Commission has just told me is absolutely scandalous."
"You are telling us you are accepting no amendments whatsoever!"
"You are saying that it is simply not possible."
"To me, it is absolutely incomprehensible, scandalous and brazen that you can say straight to our faces that according to Article 100a we have no further role in the process."
"That is exactly the point of Amendment No 19, to make sure that Parliament still has a say under Article 100a when the positive list is received."
"You have just denied that here, Commissioner!"
"That means that we will be mere spectators for the rest of the proceedings, that when it comes to the election campaign out there we will have to face the music for things fixed by wheeling and dealing in smoke-filled rooms."
"I am telling you straight: I refuse to play ball!"
"It is simply not on."
"It is outrageous!"
"We are supposed to have a share in decision-making."
"This Parliament is supposed to have its rights, but these rights are constantly being insidiously undermined."
"This whole business of irradiating foodstuffs is only any good for whiskey drinkers in the end, because it makes whiskey age quicker!"
"Are we supposed to defend all this?"
"Up to now, I have gone along with this, because I have said there may well be good reasons for irradiation."
"But now I have heard what the Commission has to say, I will not accept it. I will not accept it."
"I will not accept it. I have had enough!"
"Maybe you will put me right, maybe I have just got the wrong end of the stick."
"Yet again we are being treated just like stupid children who have to clear up the mess when we do not even have a say in things. I will not stand for it!"
"It makes a mockery of democracy, shared decision-making and the internal market."
"Why should we get the stick for your actions?"
"It is not on! Or perhaps I have misunderstood."
"You, Mr President, have given us some very good tips, but before tomorrow's vote, I shall take the liberty of invoking Rule 62, second indent."
"I shall not quote it now, because it is already so late, but I shall refer to it tomorrow."
"It states that amendments can indeed be tabled on matters not previously dealt with at first reading."
"We can and will do that."
"I know that it is not your decision; you cannot help it."
"You just have the misfortune to be in the chair now."
"Many thanks for your patience, and goodbye!"
"Mr President, I would like to comment on the point about whiskey; I find that interesting."
"I have discovered this evening that whiskey can be artificially aged by irradiating it."
"It is not your fault, but I would nevertheless like you to convey the mood of this House to the President, who is responsible for this matter."
"I am referring to Rule 72, not to the sentence that you referred to, but to Rule 72, 2c. It states that amendments are only admissible if they seek to amend a part of a text which was not included in the proposal submitted in first reading, etcetera."
"I have checked with various colleagues on a cross-party basis, and they agree that the text does contain new points, because there have been developments in this field in recent years."
"What we have before us today did not exist then, probably not even in people's wildest dreams."
"So it is not only logical or possible, but urgently necessary to allow these amendments to be tabled."
"Everyone agrees on this, there is no dissent."
"Please convey this to the President."
"Secondly, I would like you to clarify what happens in a situation when the chairman of the Committee on the Environment decides, by virtue of his office and personal views, not to accept amendments, and the President then refuses to admit quite different amendments by virtue of his own prerogatives."
"There is a mismatch, a lack of consistency."
"What happens then?"
"There is obviously a real muddle between these two gentlemen."
"I would be grateful if you could clarify this."
"What is the right thing to do now? Do we have to have a total rethink?"
"Thirdly, I would like to refer to Rule 125, according to which the President has the last word and his decisions cannot be contested."
"I ask you seriously, is there a limit to what cannot be contested?"
"For example, is there a limit such as logic, intelligence or doing the obvious?"
"Are there any such limits, or are we in that Grimm's fairy tale, the Emperor's New Clothes?"
"The one where everyone says, wow, he looks great, the President has got brilliant clothes, until someone comes along - a little child - and says that the President is in the altogether!"
"Are there no limits to the inviolability of the President's decisions?"
"I am asking you, because I know that you are very democratic, Mr President!"
"Mr President, I do not want to strain your tolerance further. I think you are showing substantial tolerance - at least in listening, though not in your rulings."
"What I want to say to the Commission representative and to you, as our representative here, is that if this proposal does not go to conciliation in which the view of Parliament is heard, including the views of those Member States who were not members of the Union when this proposal first came forward, then we make a mockery of our right to be consulted and to be absorbed into this discussion."
"We have consistently counselled against amendments that simply allow Parliament to meddle."
"For Parliament not to be consulted or not to have any appropriate say at the next stage of proceedings would be a total absurdity and I hope that this will be taken into account when you consider the rulings you are giving tomorrow and when the Commission reflects on what it said in removing almost all of these amendments from the book."
"To conclude this impromptu debate, I have to add that I understand Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' state of mind, because her previous comments have received a reply from the Commission that has certainly not been entirely accepted on its merits."
"We all know what it means when the Commission does not agree to any amendment: the entire conciliation stage becomes more complicated for Parliament."
"With regard to the Rules of Procedure in the strict sense, I would like to tell Mr Roth that President Gil-Robles is as democratic as I am, and that he will obviously be informed of the debate this evening."
"It seems I should tell you that the issue raised by Mr Graenitz and Mr Whitehead should not be emphasized repeatedly because it is of no significance, other than of a general nature, and certainly not with regard to the Rules of Procedure."
"New Member States have joined since then and this has not had any effect from the point of view of the debate we are holding on the Rules of Procedure: the Rules of Procedure do not change with each new accession."
"You should remember, not for now but for the future, that a discussion is underway for the post-Amsterdam period. The Committee on the Rules of Procedure is already discussing its amendments to the Rules of Procedure after and as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz has already pointed out that reference will be made to Article 62, and there do not seem to be many margins; however, it is obviously within her rights to raise this problem with the President tomorrow, when it is put to the vote."
"I repeat, however, that the President will be informed of this debate to make the appropriate decisions, for which there are no limits, other than those of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Roth!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Landfill of waste"
"The next item is Mr Jackson's report (A4-0026/98), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Directive on the landfill of waste (COM(97)0105 - C4-0160/97-97/0085(SYN))."
"Mr President, the European Union's waste policy is at an earlier stage in its development than European policy on air and water quality."
"We see the characteristics of what is still rather an experimental policy in the landfill directive."
"I must ask some rather fundamental questions about this directive in the hope of getting some answers from the Commission."
"Firstly, it is important to recognize that this directive, if it is fully implemented - and that is a big 'if' - would result in a switch of emphasis away from landfill as a means of waste disposal."
"This is because it incorporates the progressive introduction of limits on the volume of biodegradable waste going to landfill set out in Article 5."
"This is a new section of the directive, new since its rejection by us in 1996."
"In many countries the limits will mean a switch to incineration."
"My fundamental question here is whether a directive which would impel such a universal switch in emphasis fully respects the principle of subsidiarity."
"I do not believe that it does."
"The targets set out in Article 5 are very precise even if they are national ones and not designed to apply to specific sites."
"One consequence of ignoring subsidiarity is that a universal solution is proposed for very different situations in the Member States."
"Some countries now have sophisticated landfill systems and geological structures which make landfill a sustainable option and perhaps the best practicable environmental option."
"In others unregulated landfills in inappropriate places are a health hazard."
"For all its protests about local option, the directive removes far too many key decisions to the European level from the national and the local."
"Secondly, it is important to recognize that the directive, if fully implemented, would mean that several Member States would need to spend very considerable amounts of money on finding alternative means of waste disposal and putting in place the systems of control that would enable them to prove they are abiding by the directive."
"My fundamental question here is whether there is any hope at all that the Member States will be able to comply with the directive, as drafted, within the time limits set?"
"The clear answer is no."
"99 % of Ireland's waste goes to landfill."
"There is no prospect of any rapid switch to an alternative there."
"54 % of Portugal's waste goes to an 'unknown destination' ."
"In Greece the Commission tells us that there are from 3, 000 to 6, 500 illegal landfills."
"None of these countries will be able to comply with the directive as drafted."
"If it is agreed as drafted, they will be pursued through the Court of Justice for years by the Commission."
"In my own country, the United Kingdom, the Department of the Environment, Mr Prescott's department, has estimated that as many as 70 waste incinerators would have to be built at a possible cost of as much as £7 billion."
"Where will Mr Blair find that?"
"As rapporteur, I have to report that my committee has supported the directive and in one respect has strengthened its detailed provisions by making the 2002 limits mandatory rather than optional."
"If that were all, I might have had a problem in continuing to represent my committee's point of view but the committee did something else."
"For the first time the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has at every stage passed amendments to tie the Member States down to the commitment they will make by agreeing such a directive."
"We want them to put their money where their mouths are."
"In our amendments we want to use the directive first to make the Member States apply the existing law by shutting down illegal landfills which do not comply with existing directives."
"We want to use the directive to ensure that the Member States report frequently on implementation of the law, in particular during the progressive application of targets to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste going to landfill."
"We also want to make sure that we do not forget the exempted sites where the directive will not apply."
"Information on them too should be sent to the Commission and hence made available to Parliament."
"Finally, we should not forget that the Member States voted unanimously for the former version of this directive which effectively excluded 50 % of EU territory from its scope."
"If it was acceptable to them then, how can we realistically hope that they will fully implement this much more stringent directive."
"I do not believe that Parliament should connive at the passing of laws which are little more than the self-indulgent aspirations of environment ministers."
"I hope Parliament keeps a very tight check on what happens to this directive and I look forward to doing so. I also hope that at some stage Mrs Bjerregaard might actually involve herself in a debate on this directive, perhaps with us here tonight."
"There is very little point in coming all the way to Strasbourg to act as a sort of sophisticated speak-your-weight machine, which is all we are getting from Mrs Bjerregaard when she simply reads out lists of amendments which are acceptable and not acceptable to the Commission."
"This is a parliament and a parliament expects debate."
"Mr President, we all know the significance of this proposal to the many industrial sectors within the economies of the states of the Union which is perhaps one of the reasons why we have taken so long already to reach an agreement about the provisions of the proposal and why we find ourselves at this point in the legislative process."
"I do think, however, that we are near the beginning of the end rather than the end of the beginning."
"The new Commission proposal meets many of the concerns expressed by Parliament the last time it was presented to Parliament."
"It has risen like a phoenix from the ashes and Parliament must congratulate the Commission, in part, on the proposal."
"At the same time, I would extend my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, for the work that she has done on it."
"In response to some of the points that she has made I would say, first of all, that European-wide standards that can be enforced are absolutely necessary to regulate what is, in truth, a European-wide business in many cases."
"Incineration is not inevitable."
"There are many other technologies available and, in particular, steps in the development of large-scale composting as an alternative to dealing with organic waste in the last few years have meant that this is a real and genuine alternative if energy and effort - and other resources - are put into bringing this into regular practice across the Union."
"I have to correct her by telling her that the last time this proposal was dealt with by the Council of Ministers it did not vote it by unanimity, which was why when we rejected it in Parliament they could not reinstate it."
"They agreed it by a majority."
"This time, when you look at the political agreement they have arrived at - which looks astonishingly like a common position already - we will possibly find it harder to change it."
"Nevertheless, I and the Socialists think that we need a set of practicable, sensible, enforceable Community-wide standards which will deliver us a landfill industry which gets rid of many of the evils of the past."
"We should also recognize that this is not just an important economic directive, but also one that is important for the protection of the environment and public health."
"In particular, the harmful impact of bad landfill practices on groundwater resources and on global warming by the emission of methane from landfills is, in itself, a very good and strong reason why we need to take the actions that we are proposing in this proposal."
"I would urge Parliament to support the Environment Committee's amendments that we will see in front of us tomorrow."
"It is a step forward in what has already been a very long process, but it is a step forward towards what I hope to see will be a completed proposal before the end of this year."
"Mr President, waste disposal must be based on a certain hierarchy, the Ladder of Lansink, as we call it in the Netherlands, as Mr Lansink, a member of parliament came up with the idea that this hierarchy must be actively applied."
"This hierarchy comprises above all prevention, then re-use and subsequently treatment, and in this treatment phase landfill is the last option."
"To achieve this and cut back the amount of biodegradable waste going into landfills, Mr Jackson's report contains important targets."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has expressed its confidence in the original standards set by the European Commission."
"This is the only way we can arrive at uniform European measures."
"Some Member States will have some catching up to do if they want to meet these targets."
"This is the only way we can offer the high environmental protection the European Union professes to aspire to."
"Economic incentives are also a part of this."
"All this does not mean, of course, that there may not be any exceptions."
"Non-harmful dredged material is a good example of this."
"Certain countries, including my own, the Netherlands, have very effective environmentally friendly treatments which make an exception possible."
"To conclude, Mr President, we support the report."
"Environmental policy occupies centre stage in European legislation."
"This directive on the landfill of waste should most certainly form part of this."
"Mr President, this proposal on the landfill of waste has taken a long time, but hopefully the end is in sight now."
"Still, I think it has been worth the wait, because what the Commission has put on the table is a considerable improvement compared to the rejected common position of 1995."
"In all sorts of ways, new developments have been taken into account."
"Separating biodegradable waste has been given a place, and the territory to which the directive applies comprises virtually the entire Union."
"These are big improvements."
"Likewise, the introduction of the cost aspect and after-care of landfill sites are positive points."
"And now the reality."
"How will it all work?"
"The packaging directive contains incentives to stay as highly as possible within the waste hierarchy, but real life is often more unmanageable than the theory."
"In other words, it will depend on the efforts of the national and local authorities whether prevention and re-use will be given genuine priority."
"What concerns us particularly is the transport of waste to the cheap incinerators, and to the cheap landfill sites."
"The introduction of new costings for landfills must get under way very soon in the Member States."
"Although this directive looks a lot more pleasant than the earlier versions, we have to acknowledge the fact that billions of tonnes of waste are still dumped illegally, or are burnt with too many dirty emissions."
"Implementation is therefore urgent, but there is still a big hiatus in the waste treatment chain."
"In the very short term there must be a review of the directive for the incinerators with new standards for emissions."
"My question to the Commissioner is: when will the proposal for this be ready?"
"There is far too great an incongruity between incinerators."
"It is pleasing to see the Council of Ministers taking note of the European Parliament's amendments in its otherwise slightly doubtful political agreement."
"The Commission's original proposals exempted about half of Europe from the directive's aims, which was rather absurd."
"Dumps are well down in the waste hierarchy, and there are specific rules dealing with restricting dumping, restricting waste tourism and ensuring environmentally sound dumping if that is the only option available."
"The Committee on the Environment proposes that groundwater is the main factor to consider when finding new dumping sites."
"As groundwater resources are the drinking water supplies in some countries, it is essential that they be protected as far as possible."
"In Denmark, about 90 % of drinking water comes from groundwater."
"It is pleasing to note that the proposals include demands for processing biodegradable waste."
"This can produce gas at landfill sites, and in fact this kind of waste should be sorted and some of it composted."
"It is also pleasing to note that the proposals are now on their way through the decision-making process, as waste is one of the areas where legislative protection is still incomplete."
"Mr President, the Liberal group favours reducing the amount of waste and making the treatment of waste safer."
"There are two approaches to waste disposal: incineration where geographical conditions and population density mean that landfill is inappropriate; and landfill itself."
"Both have their problems."
"Incineration can cause air pollution, landfill can cause groundwater pollution and the production of methane, a greenhouse gas."
"But technology is minimizing those problems."
"In my view this directive is biased in favour of incineration but it allows both approaches to continue."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has made it rather more one-sided and some of its amendments would effectively change policy to incineration only."
"My group favours a gradual move towards incineration, particularly of waste which is not biodegradable."
"But we do not wish to overlook the new, green growth industry which involves methane collection and the production of energy from waste."
"The Commission document published recently on methane gas recognizes the importance of this."
"The Liberal group will vote against certain amendments put forward by the Committee on the Environment: those which would effectively outlaw landfill; those which we regard as over-prescriptive; and those which we regard as impractical."
"Nonetheless, we support the aims of this directive and the work the Commissioner has done on it."
"We regret the position taken and the somewhat uncharitable remarks made by the rapporteur in this debate tonight."
"We believe this directive constitutes a move forward for the Union in terms of disposing of waste more effectively and taking greater care of the environment."
"Mr President, this directive is a fine example of how the European Parliament's influence on environmental legislation is increasing; our rejection of the original proposal led the Commission to amend it, for the better, and prompted the Council of Ministers itself to adopt a new approach and strategy."
"The need for such a strategy was particularly pressing given that, as mentioned previously, in Member States such as Portugal, 54 % of waste until very recently went to unmonitored tips, approximately 10 % to controlled tips, and only 36 % to landfills."
"Meanwhile, however, a new government has taken office, a new majority has assumed legislative power and executive power, and a new strategic orientation has been adopted, as the Commission is aware. This includes the submission of a national waste administration plan, which is currently being implemented and under which some regions of the country, particularly the Algarve - Portugal's leading tourist region - will be depositing all their waste in landfills by next summer."
"In connection with the proposal currently under discussion, I would like to draw attention to the objectives of reducing methane gas emissions, prohibiting the combined disposal of dangerous and non-dangerous waste and the pre-treatment obligation which I consider to be very positive aspects which deserve to be highlighted."
"I would also like to emphasize the discrepancy between the position of the European Parliament which advocates a reduction of 25 % by the year 2002, and the Council's position which refers to the year 2006."
"Finally, I would like to draw attention to the temporary exemptions granted to the islands; for example, in the Portuguese case, the islands of the Azores and Madeira which are exempted from the pre-treatment of waste in the main landfill on each island up to a ceiling of 15, 000 tonnes."
"But I would like to stress the temporary nature of these regimes because, since the islands constitute an immense natural heritage of great value for tourism and the environment, they have everything to gain from implementing environmental policies that are not based on dispensations."
"The main landfill in the autonomous region of the Azores' application to the Cohesion Fund constitutes a policy that could well serve as an example to be followed."
"Mr President, I thought I would congratulate everyone tonight as well."
"Let me start by congratulating the smiling Mr Bowe, whose courage in the last Parliament in rejecting the former landfill directive had to be experienced to be believed."
"He did a very good job on that occasion in saying that we would not accept a defective directive."
"He was right to do that."
"I also congratulate the Commission as well."
"They have come forward with something which is necessarily stronger than it was the last time round."
"I congratulate Mrs Jackson."
"I do not know whether she wants to be congratulated by me."
"From the tone of the contribution she made at the beginning, I thought that there was some reluctance on her part in the presentation of the report."
"However, it is right that she should be congratulated because she has accepted wholly now the principle of abolition of co-disposal."
"That is something which is an argument made and accepted both in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and by Parliament as a whole."
"However, it will mean in the United Kingdom a massive change in landfill practice."
"One of the reasons why it is important to stress that is that the European Parliament, when this is finally seen through to a directive, will have been responsible for a change in domestic practice in the United Kingdom about which so few people yet know."
"Therefore it is important when Mrs Jackson, in the explanatory statement, asks for a cost estimate for us in Parliament to provide that to those landfill operators and local authorities in the United Kingdom who are going to have to look at this as a progressive proposal."
"Mrs Jackson tells us rightly that in committee we are always met with the response that it is a greater cost if we do nothing than if we do something."
"Despite the uncharitable remarks made, as Mr Watson said, about the Commissioner being a speaking weight machine, I ask the Commissioner to be more charitable herself and tell us how much money there is in the landfill bank and what the cost of this proposal will be."
"Mr President, in general let me say that in its present shape the directive on waste disposal at landfill sites is satisfactory."
"There are, however, far too few proposals coming from the EU on how the targets can be achieved."
"A separate waste tax or payment is a necessary device for consumers, whether small or massive producers of waste, to cut down on the amount of waste they create that has to be taken to landfill sites."
"The tax or payment should be such that clean, sorted waste will be cheapest, and unsorted waste to be taken to landfill sites will be the most expensive to produce."
"This will obviously mean that local authorities and other responsible bodies will organize proper methods of sorting waste."
"The EU must go further and take examples from the more enlightened Member States."
"We must support the use of landside waste, for example, as a source of energy or soil improvement agent, but at the same time new technology must be developed to ensure that the process will not harm the environment or health."
"We must make sure that seepage from both old and new landfill sites is handled in such a way that it does not pose a threat to both groundwater and surface water."
"I think it is very important that the proposals for amendments concerning the protection of water, approved in the Committee on the Environment, be carried in tomorrow's vote."
"Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to see that the European Parliament has put waste disposal on the agenda for today."
"The Community should long since have passed a directive to ensure that waste is disposed of in an environmentally responsible way."
"As has been mentioned, this is the second time we are dealing with a proposal for a directive on waste disposal."
"The Commission put forward its first proposals in July 1991, and as we remember and have been reminded during the course of the debate, the European Parliament rejected that proposal in May 1996 on the grounds that the level of environmental protection was not high enough and that there were too many exemptions."
"The proposals we have before us today have been completely amended."
"That was not a very easy task, but I think we can be satisfied with the results."
"The new proposals contain a lot of new elements reflecting the developments which have occurred since the Commission's last proposals."
"There have been major changes in the procedures, methods and strategies for waste processing in many Member States."
"In line with the Community's waste processing policy, some Member States now believe that dumping should be the last resort when it comes to disposing of waste."
"The main new points in the Commission's proposals are as follows: reduction targets for disposing biodegradable municipal waste with a view to reducing the global greenhouse effect; pre-treatment - that is, not incineration, but pre-treatment of all waste prior to disposal; an increase in the costs of waste disposal - as proposed by Mrs Myller; a ban on dumping toxic and non-toxic waste together, which was of course part of the previous proposals which Parliament criticized; and finally more stringent conditions on existing landfill sites."
"I am convinced that the new proposals will make it easier for us to prevent and reduce the effects of waste disposal on the environment."
"And we need to take action in this field as soon as possible."
"The many complaints which the Commission receives concerning the disposal of waste emphasize that the Community needs to act."
"I have of course looked with great interest at the draft report which the Committee on the Environment adopted."
"There are many important and useful amendments which will tighten up the Commission's proposals and make the procedures clearer."
"I am therefore pleased to be able to say that the Commission can accept 16 of the amendments."
"But I must also admit that I am concerned about some sections of the report, and I will need to take some time over them."
"I am pleased to see that the European Parliament is able to support our efforts to reduce the landfill of biodegradable waste."
"We have established long-term reduction targets for Member States: these targets must remain unchanged, however, to ensure that Member States have the best possible conditions for planning and implementing alternative methods of dealing with this waste."
"The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 16."
"As far as Amendments Nos 12 and 31 are concerned, I would like to emphasize that the Commission does not believe it would be right to grant more exemptions than those already proposed."
"I am particularly concerned about exempting underground disposal."
"There are no environmentally responsible grounds for exempting this kind of disposal."
"All landfill sites - whether above or underground - should meet the directive's conditions and so be safe and controlled."
"I cannot agree with the current approach in Germany where 1.7 million tonnes of waste, including 350 000 tonnes of toxic waste, was stored in old mines in 1994."
"In Germany, this is defined as recycling, not as disposal, and so waste disposal legislation does not apply."
"This is not environmentally responsible practice."
"I am not against storing waste underground in general, but I think we should be certain that the underground storage facilities in question are covered by the provisions of the proposals on landfill sites."
"And so I cannot accept that exempting regulations should be introduced for underground disposal."
"It was precisely because of all the exemptions that the European Parliament rejected the Council's previous common position, whereas Parliament now wishes to introduce more exemptions."
"In the case of Amendment No 13, Parliament is trying to introduce yet another exemption."
"I cannot at this stage accept that spreading limestone and gypsum should be exempted, but I can promise Parliament that the Commission will take a closer look at this amendment and consider the possibilities."
"Today, the Community has serious problems with landfill sites which are not monitored: this is clear from the large numbers of complaints and applications which the Commission receives."
"This situation must change."
"Existing landfill sites must meet the new requirements of the Commission's proposals and so obtain new licences before they can continue to operate."
"The approval requirements of the old framework directive on waste are not in line with developments in this field and cannot ensure that waste is disposed of under safe, controlled conditions."
"So the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 25."
"This brings us finally to Amendments Nos 27, 30, 33 and 36, where the Commission believes that the provisions of the annexes should be laid down by the technical committee referred to in Article 16 of the Commission's proposals."
"As regards Amendment No 7, the Commission cannot be obliged to forward Member States' reports, but wishes to be able to produce reports based on information from Member States and pass it on to the European Parliament."
"Some people may see this as being rather semantic, but we believe we can handle problems this way."
"As regards Amendments Nos 2 and 3 on changes to the views that the Commission should present new proposals within a period of time to be specified, we already have plans to submit a proposal on incinerating non-toxic waste and we intend to produce a composting proposal as part of the work schedule."
"I cannot however approve of the way in which this amendment formulates the Commission's obligations."
"There are a whole host of other amendments which ought to be commented on, but it is now late in the evening so I will leave it at that, unless there are any specific amendments which other Members of Parliament present wish to comment on in particular."
"Ian White asked me if I could say anything about the overall costs, but I am not in a position to do so as yet."
"That of course depends on developments in the Member States which are now under way."
"And may I say to Mrs Jackson that I think the remarks she made at the end of her speech were particularly unkind."
"Having been here in Parliament since 3.00 p.m. today, which I set aside solely for discussing with Members of Parliament, I fail to understand her comments at all."
"Mr President, I wonder whether I could ask for your help on Amendment No 16."
"Amendment No 16 was one of those which Mrs Bjerregaard said she was not prepared to accept."
"In fact there are two elements to Amendment No 16: one is the question of the targets for 2002, and Parliament and the committee would like to remove the words 'as far as possible' so that the 2002 targets become mandatory and not, as it were, optional."
"The other parts of that amendment deal with reporting."
"There are two distinct bits to that amendment, I wonder whether Mrs Bjerregaard could clarify which bits she is not prepared to accept."
"I think it is very sad if the Commission does not accept - even at this early stage - amendments regarding the reporting requirement where essentially, for once, I agree with her advisor, in other words that Parliament should reinforce reporting."
"I would beg the Commissioner to accept that but if she will not accept it, I hope that Parliament will stick to its guns and go into conciliation on those points."
"I would be grateful just for clarification on that."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner, Mrs Bjerregaard, for clarification."
"In fact, both Amendment No 16 and Amendment No 23 contain parts that relate to the altered texts."
"I would like the Commissioner to clarify whether she is referring to the entire Amendments or to just a certain section, when she says that the Commission does not accept Amendments Nos 16 and 23."
"Mr President, in fact I was actually making a distinction, because I referred to Amendment No 16 twice in my answer."
"As far as the reporting is concerned, I said that we were concerned about the way the question on reporting was worded."
"But I will be happy to see if we in the Community can find some other wording."
"As far as the question of making it mandatory in the year 2000, we do not believe we are in a position to decide this at present."
"We feel this would force Member States into a policy - in that sense, this is in line with the arguments which Mrs Jackson used herself - and we are not therefore in favour of making it mandatory in the year 2000."
"As far as reporting is concerned, we are support the idea, as has been said."
"What was the Commission's opinion on Amendment No 23."
"This is vital because these are the sites which would not have to comply with the directive."
"It is very simple."
"Does the Commissioner agree with Amendment No 23 or not?"
"I hope that she does."
"I am almost minded to take back my earlier remarks but I do not think I will."
"I had already asked the Commissioner for her opinion on Amendment No 23, but she did not have her headphones on, nor does she now, and so she could not hear me."
"That was one of the amendments I missed out because I thought time was getting on a bit."
"We can accept Amendment No 23."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I refer to pages 12 and 13 of the English version of the Minutes and matters that were raised subsequently."
"This refers to the concern expressed by Members about the impact in the Chamber of the new arrangements for tying the payment of Members' expenses to voting requirements."
"I am not challenging this whole question of whether this is a proper system or not."
"I do not think it is, but that is not my purpose."
"Mr Falconer raised a number of points of order, and I was very concerned that the President in the Chair yesterday seemed to give him some kind of blanket exemption from the rules I understood had been decided."
"Mr Falconer quite properly asked for the opportunity to state his intention before every vote in which he did not participate."
"The President declared that should not be the case."
"He gave him a blanket exemption, which would make nonsense of the whole system."
"All I ask is that all the Vice-Presidents follow a consistent policy, observe the rules that have been laid down for Members and give Members an opportunity at every stage to raise the question of whether they vote or not."
"If this system is to work, it has to be seen to be working properly and with the agreement of all the Vice-Presidents."
"Mr Megahy, I would not want to begin a new discussion about yesterday's debate."
"You are a former Vice-President of Parliament and you can well understand that when a new measure is first applied, it is impossible for us to have sorted out all the details in advance."
"What I can confirm, and I saw it yesterday too when Mr Jean-Pierre Cot was in the Chair, is that there is every intention to apply it in the best possible way."
"Mr President, after the intervention of Mr Megahy and the events of yesterday I would like to ask you to take the opportunity to discuss in the Bureau how such occurrences can be prevented in future in the interests of the entire Parliament by using the agenda."
"That would mean that the whole Parliament has to decide on a rule which prevents such occurrences."
"I request sincerely that this should be moved forward very quickly."
"Mrs Hoff, I have no doubt that the Bureau will look at the problem you have mentioned."
"I hope it reaches the right decisions."
"Mr President, I have one or two very simple corrections to the Minutes."
"I refer to the first paragraph of page 12."
"I did not say that I did not intend to take part in the vote."
"I agreed with Mr Falconer's position but said that I might or might not take part in the vote."
"On page 22 it states that I did not vote."
"In fact I voted every time, except once when the machine did not work."
"On page 11, my name should be alongside Mr Macartney's as abstaining in the roll-call vote."
"I called to the attention of the Chair the fact that my machine did not work."
"I got a nod and thought it was in order but, quite clearly, the nod did not mean that it was in order."
"Lastly, on page 17 - which is a little more complicated - I am wrongly described in the last paragraph as requesting 'that the matter be referred to the Rules Committee' ."
"What I said was that this change amounted to an amendment of the Rules and, therefore, would have to be referred to the Rules Committee."
"I also corrected what the Vice-President said when he declared that we had a duty to vote."
"I said that we do not have a duty to vote, we have a duty to understand what the votes are about."
"We have the right not to vote or vote, as we wish."
"I would like the Minutes to be corrected in that way."
"Mrs Ewing, I take note of what you have said."
"Mr President, it is important that we try to clarify this."
"Everybody in this House, yesterday and this morning, has been desperately trying to shuffle off responsibility for what happened here yesterday."
"I am not ashamed to stand here and say that I have been one of the group leaders, and every one of them in this room with me should perhaps stand up so you can see who we all are."
"We have been driving the process of reform in this House."
"We are not ashamed to say so."
"Let us be clear how this reform came about."
"The idea of linking attendance with roll-call votes came out of the working group established under the chairmanship of Nicole Pery."
"That was where these proposals came from."
"Every group in this House was represented on that working group."
"The Conference of Presidents does not establish these proposals or the way in which they are carried out."
"We kept pursuing the need for reform and putting pressure on the President and his predecessor, Klaus Hänsch, who have both been supportive of the process of reform."
"That is our role and we stand here absolutely and take our political responsibility for insisting that reform is carried through."
"Yesterday, Mr Killilea stood up on behalf of the Quaestors and said: ' It is not us, the Quaestors, the Bureau is responsible' ."
"The Bureau, I understand, is trying to say it is the Conference of Presidents."
"I accept my responsibility for the reform."
"We did not lay down the detail of these proposals."
"(Interruptions) If the detail is wrong, it needs to be adjusted."
"But I do not back down or retract one bit on the need for reform."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I want to make it clear to the House that establishing the method for control and transparency is not a matter for the Conference of Presidents. We were invited to a meeting in Luxembourg so that we could give our opinion, but we did not stay in the room because we were invited to leave when Parliament's Bureau made the decision."
"And I have to say that in my group we do not agree with this system of control, which does not guarantee transparency or that Parliament will work well."
"We are happy to sign in each morning and afternoon - that is the reasonable method of control that can be used in this House."
"However, we do not wish to be demagogic."
"The Bureau should have another meeting to think about this, and should take some reasonable measure that can be supported by a wide majority of the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the working group mentioned by Mrs Green had spent a long time preparing this reform."
"When Parliament's Bureau had to take a decision in Luxembourg, it asked for our assistance."
"The group leaders did indeed take part in the Bureau's discussion."
"We worked for and promoted a reform in anticipation of a statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"It is clear that after what happened yesterday the concrete implementation of this measure ought to be discussed anew."
"But I also wish to say that I was in favour of a reform in anticipation of a statute, and that this does not alter the responsibility which I have taken on this issue in the past, and which I maintain."
"I also believe, and on behalf of our group, that after the events of yesterday, the system needs to be looked at again, adjusted and perfected, without detracting from the responsibility we all have to accept."
"Mr President, it is obvious that the technical system which became operational yesterday, does not function properly, and it is provoking debates which damage the dignity and standing of this House."
"It is therefore obvious that the concrete measures which were decided must be reviewed."
"I would like to remind you that the deputy chairman of my group, Mr Haarder, made a proposal to the Bureau which was simple, transparent, clear and not bureaucratic, namely one check per voting period, and not an average of a number of checks."
"I would like to ask the Bureau to have another look at this."
"But I would like to say to the colleagues: the implementation of the reform must be reviewed, but not the principle of the reform measure."
"This House does many things well."
"We are having an increasing legislative influence."
"Our delegation's visit to Algeria was a success."
"The committees of inquiry this Parliament set up into BSE and cigarette fraud were a great success."
"But the media does not see us as an important, successful and authoritative Parliament."
"Why not?"
"Because the media quite rightly continue to reproach Members of this House who are somewhat casual in their financial mores."
"We should have the courage to search our consciences."
"We should have the courage to review matters that damage this House."
"Yes, colleagues, that includes you!"
"Mr President, the details of the regulation should be reviewed."
"But I refuse to bring the principle up for discussion."
"This House must reform itself so that the voters can have the confidence that everything that happens in this House is correct and pure."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the incidents of yesterday could easily have been foreseen; and I would contest the method."
"I think we could have avoided these incidents if we had proceeded differently, in other words, if we had sought a greater consensus within the House."
"If the system had first been applied experimentally, we would have noted its shortcomings before putting in place a permanent solution."
"Furthermore, I would suggest a joint meeting of the Conference of Presidents and the Bureau after the group chairmen have held in-depth debates within their groups, and that together we settle on methods which are practical, acceptable, transparent and which do not damage the image of Parliament."
"Mr Pasty, I would like to point out that the President of the European Parliament will of course be informed of the views both of the leaders of the political groups and of the Members."
"All of us here have listened very attentively to what has been said, and I have no doubt that we will look into the matter with the intention of reaching the best possible result."
"Mr President, I admire this House's form of elitism, when someone stands up to make a point arising from the Minutes and then leaders of groups are called into some kind of confessional in order to admit their sins."
"Mrs Hoff made a point when she said: ' Let us look at the Rules to see if we can prevent what happened yesterday' ."
"Well, let us look at the Rules to ensure that any changes which affect Members are brought to the Members and that Members have a right to vote on those changes."
"That would prevent the nonsense that went on yesterday."
"I return to the business of today - the Minutes."
"Page 12 is wrong."
"As far as I am concerned, I asked to be called, as Mrs Ewing quite rightly said, on each roll-call vote."
"I was not given that opportunity by the President."
"Page 22 states again that I did not vote."
"I remind the President that I did participate in certain votes, particularly human rights."
"I participated and am recorded as such."
"The Minutes are wrong in both areas. I ask that they be corrected."
"Lastly, if we are to have a rule that comes down on high from the Bureau, then it has to be carried through by the House."
"The Bureau's ruling was that, prior to each roll-call vote, the Members would indicate whether they wished to participate or not."
"That is what I hope we will continue to do until such time as this House begins to grasp some sense of reality and reverts back to some normality."
"Mr Falconer, I understand that the President in the Chair yesterday did not give you the floor every time you asked for it."
"But it has been noted in the Minutes that you did not participate in the vote every time."
"So, in practice, the result was exactly the same."
"Mr President, I just wish to state that I was here yesterday but did not vote."
"On page 22, Mr Cassidy pointed out that the members of this group would not be voting in the final vote."
"My name is not included in the list of Members in the Minutes."
"I would ask you to correct that, please."
"Mr President, one of the troubles with this procedure is that it draws attention to the fact that Members attend the votes because they are paid for it but they do not attend the debates."
"I refer to the Minutes last night."
"If Members had attended the debate last night on the final report, which was my report on landfill, they would have heard the Commissioner say that she was reluctant to give in full her speech with all the opinions of the Commission on the amendments tabled by Members of this House because it was late and she was rather tired."
"That is not good enough. Mr President, I would like you, if you could, to communicate with the Commissioner this morning to say that before we vote at 12.00 noon, it is essential that the Commission makes known to me, as rapporteur, to the committee chairmen and to all Members of this House exactly what its view was on the amendments tabled by Parliament."
"It is not enough that the Commissioner should say that she was tired and therefore unable to speak to us."
"Mrs Jackson, I take note of your comment."
"You are of course aware - and there is no need for me to remind you, since you are an old and experienced colleague - that if we cannot have that explanation, it is open to you, as rapporteur, to react."
"Mr President, on the same point in the Minutes."
"As somebody who was there throughout the debate on Mrs Jackson's report last night and who was the last person to leave the Chamber, I do not recall those words from the Commissioner."
"I suggest to Mrs Jackson that if she is really doing her job as rapporteur, all she has to do is to ask for the Commissioner's speaking note."
"Mr President, it is an oddity of the system that the Vice-President was here yesterday and led the discussion, but cannot be paid because his name does not appear on the list."
"I would suggest on his behalf that his name be added to the list of those present who did not vote."
"Mr President, I request that my name be added to the list of those present."
"Well, that is the best I have heard yet."
"Mr President, I would like to make a suggestion."
"It would perhaps be useful to add to the end of the Minutes a list of Members who do not meet the criteria, so that, on the following day, we are aware of what is before us and could justify any problem and sort things out."
"This would mean that we would have the results earlier than the end of the month, or after several weeks."
"Mr President, I have slept on the problem and think this is an excellent idea."
"So I propose that at each desk we should install a little device and when we vote, coins would fall."
"This would be very pleasant and would encourage us greatly."
"Mr President, I asked if I could speak twenty minutes ago; I pressed the button, and it is still alight, so I can prove it."
"I would like the debate about money to stop, so that we can start with the debate on Iraq!"
"That is what we are here for this morning!"
"Secondly, I would like to say that I am 100 % behind what Mr de Vries said."
"I have to conclude that the courage to put through reforms is lacking in this House, especially amongst the Members."
"I note this with shame!"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Topical and urgent debate (objections)"
"Mr President, I believe it is the first time in this House that a properly introduced motion was refused even during its introduction - in fact we originally wanted to introduce it as an additional point under human rights, and only one opportunity was granted to us to find an alternative in the case of these nuclear tests."
"I think in the case of this point it is a question of Members and colleagues being frightened."
"In my office in recent weeks, three colleagues have been attacked."
"I have spoken with a large number of Members who have also been attacked and I believe we must discuss this subject."
"It is not sufficient for us to draw a veil of silence over the matter but we must tackle this problem honestly and frankly."
"For this we need to have a discussion in this House and I believe that the President's decision not to permit this discussion here is no guarantee of the safety of our colleagues."
"Mr Rübig, I must tell you, since you are one of our more recent Members, that this is not the first time an objection has been declared unacceptable. It has happened several times before."
"The President of this Parliament informed me by letter that the question I submitted, also on behalf of our group, is inadmissible on the basis of Rule 47(2) of the Rules."
"The President adds: ""I share your concern, and promise to take the necessary steps with the Belgian authorities to reach a satisfactory solution for the problem of security of the Members and the personnel of the European Parliament' ."
"Mr Martens, in his letter to Mr Rübig, a copy of which I sent to President Martens, the President of Parliament did indeed say that he would make all necessary approaches to the Belgian authorities to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of security, and that he shares the concern of the Members who have raised the matter."
"Situation in Iraq"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and Commission on the situation in Iraq, followed by the debate."
"Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to address Parliament on this important issue."
"The debate takes place at a crucial moment in the crisis with Iraq."
"European Union Member States are united in being deeply concerned at this crisis."
"The Presidency has ensured that Iraq has been covered frequently during European Union meetings."
"Most recently the Foreign Secretary briefed partners during an informal session held in Panama in the margins of the European Union real group meeting on the 12 February."
"On the same day the issue was discussed by European Union political directors at a meeting of the political committee."
"Iraq was also discussed at political committee meetings on the 13 January and 3 February and at expert working group level."
"The Presidency has also had contacts at a high level with many European Union partners."
"The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have both been in frequent touch with their European counterparts to discuss the issue."
"I have been in contact with my counterparts in other European Union states in recent days."
"We will continue to promote discussion of the issue and will keep partners informed of developments at the United Nations."
"European Union Member States are united in believing that Iraq must allow the United Nations Special Commission to continue its vital work as laid down in Security Council Resolution 687 which was the resolution that provided a ceasefire for the end of the Gulf War."
"Under the terms of that Resolution, which Iraq accepted, the UN inspectors who form UNSCOM are given a mandate to remove all of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction."
"UNSCOM and the associated inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency have scored major successes in removing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction."
"They have halted Iraq's longrange missile programme which could have brought Europe within range of Saddam's arsenals."
"They have dismantled the nuclear programme which could have led to Iraq developing a nuclear bomb."
"Through a process of inspection and verified destruction, UNSCOM has demolished more weapons capability than was ever destroyed by allied forces during the Gulf War."
"However, there are other areas of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction on which further work is required: namely, chemical and biological weapons."
"Saddam's chemical weapons include the VX nerve agent."
"He has not accounted to UNSCOM for 600 tonnes of chemical precursors for that nerve agent."
"One drop of the agent is enough to kill."
"The victims die in agony by suffocation as their nervous system ignores the signals to breathe."
"Saddam's biological weapons include anthrax."
"Experts say that 100 kilograms of anthrax released from the top of a tall building could kill up to 3 million people."
"Saddam has also produced aflatoxin which causes liver cancer and clostridium which results in gas gangrene."
"All of these weapons represent a serious threat to international peace and security."
"Three years ago, Saddam Hussein's sons-in-law, Hussein and Saddam Kamil, defected to Jordan."
"They brought with them evidence of a coordinated and sustained programme of concealment by Saddam of his chemical and biological weapons."
"Since then, UNSCOM has been working to uncover key points in the supply chain of the weapons programmes."
"Saddam has been equally determined to obstruct their work."
"In the last 20 months UNSCOM has sought access to 63 sites where it believed concealment was taking place."
"It was obstructed and delayed from carrying out inspections at 38 sites and was flatly refused access to a further 14 sites."
"Despite Security Council Resolution 687, Iraq only permitted prompt access at 20 % of sites under suspicion."
"We must remember that the only reason the UNSCOM regime and the sanctions to enforce it remain in place seven years after the Gulf War is because Saddam will not dismantle weapons of mass destruction, nor will he allow UNSCOM to do the job it has been mandated to do by the United Nations Security Council."
"People naturally ask: why is this important?"
"The answer I believe is clear."
"Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction before."
"He did so against his neighbour, Iran, during the Iraq-Iran war in the 1980s."
"He did so against his own people."
"Ten years ago next month, he dropped chemical weapons on a town in North East Iraq."
"The 5 000 people in the town of Halabja, including many women, children and old men, were killed."
"European Union Member States are united in their hope that a diplomatic solution to the present crisis can be found."
"We surely support all initiatives aimed at achieving that end."
"This morning, now the United Nations Secretary General has been given the backing of the Security Council for his mission to Baghdad, we all wish him every success."
"But we know that until now, Saddam has not appeared to be looking for a diplomatic solution."
"He persists in his obstruction of UNSCOM."
"He persists in his obstruction of the wish of the international community."
"He demands that inspections of so-called presidential sites must be one-off not continuing as required under Security Council Resolution 687."
"European Union Member States believe that any diplomatic solution must allow UNSCOM full and unconditional access to all sites as mandated by United Nations Security Council resolutions."
"We believe that Saddam Hussein must comply with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions."
"The present dispute over presidential sites exposes the Iraqi propaganda that it is sanctions that are the cause of the hardship and the suffering of the Iraqi people."
"We reject that."
"There are no sanctions, nor have there ever been. against the import of food and medicine."
"These are items in short supply in Iraq because Saddam Hussein has consistently refused to spend money on his own people, preferring instead to spend it on his own comforts and on his weapons programmes."
"The European Union is united in its concern for the humanitarian suffering of the Iraqi people."
"European Union countries on the Security Council in New York have taken the lead in trying to alleviate the worst of this suffering."
"The oil-for-food programme under which Iraq is allowed to export limited quantities of oil in return for humanitarian goods was first offered to Iraq in the summer of 1991 as United Nations Security Council Resolution 706 indicates."
"It was not until five years later that Saddam Hussein was shamed into accepting UN Security Council Resolution 986 which set up the present oil-for-food programme."
"Those European Union Member States at present on the Security Council have taken the lead in taking the recent recommendations of the UN Secretary General to more than double the amount of oil that Iraq can sell under this programme and turning them into a Security Council resolution."
"I very much hope that this resolution will be adopted this week."
"It will bring further humanitarian benefits to the Iraqi people."
"However, let us not forget that it is the United Nations, not Saddam, that is responsible for this."
"This is not surprising."
"One does not need to look far for evidence of the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime."
"I recommend that Members study the report of Max van der Stoel, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Iraq."
"During the last six years he has catalogued a terrifying list of human rights violations by Saddam Hussein and his clique."
"Mr van der Stoel's most recent report describes human rights in Iraq as 'terrible' ."
"He concludes: ' The system of military dictatorship effectively requires that human rights violations occur in order to retain the position and privileges of those in power."
"Murder is routine."
"The price of criticizing the regime is execution."
"Recently Saddam Hussein decided that his prisons were over-crowded."
"His solution was to execute all those serving longer than fifteen years."
"Over a thousand people were murdered.'"
"Let me reiterate that European Union Member States are united in their desire to see this present crisis resolved diplomatically."
"This is the message that Kofi Annan takes to Baghdad on behalf of all of us."
"Let us hope that Saddam responds and cooperates fully with the United Nations Special Commission."
"Mr President, the Commission's view on this conflict is that we all think the international community's first priority at the moment is to be able to reach an agreement with the Iraqi Government within the next few days, in order to avoid military intervention which basically nobody wants."
"There is no doubt that the correct authority for resolving the dispute is the United Nations."
"Therefore, as the President-in-Office of the Council has just said, the Commission also fully supports the activities of the United Nations Security Council, and especially its Secretary General, in their efforts to ensure that the Iraqi authorities comply fully with the Security Council resolutions."
"We hope the Secretary General's current negotiations can prevent the conflict, so that UNSCOM can resume unrestricted and effective inspections in accordance with those resolutions."
"Mr Marín, I have not seen so brief a statement for some time in this House. I think others too will be amazed by the European Commission's brevity."
"Mr President, my group is very aware of the responsibility it bears in this debate today."
"Within this group we have Members of Parliament who represent nine socialist and social democrat-led governments in this Union, and these parties are in government in three more of the 15."
"We do not pretend that it is easy to find a common position, given the range of views which are represented not just in those 12 governments but also amongst the people of the European Union whom we represent."
"But I want to pay tribute to my colleagues who have striven to find principles which are common to us all and which unite us in this, one of the most difficult life-and-death decisions this present Parliament has had to confront since 1994."
"Firstly, we must remember that we, in the European Parliament, do not dispose of armies, aeroplanes, bombs or aircraft carriers."
"Let us be entirely honest; we do not even have a common foreign and security policy worth its name."
"We have made our criticism about the lack of progress of the CFSP quite clear in recent years and, particularly, our dissatisfaction at the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty in this respect."
"So I think we need to demonstrate a little humility when it comes to decision-making in this field, and show some support for those of our colleagues, of all political persuasions, who will be confronted with the decisionmaking on this issue in national parliaments; those who will really have the awesome responsibility for the lives of their fellow citizens under arms and those of the many thousands of Iraqi citizens who are at risk."
"With all of this in mind, my group has just three main strategic political points which it wants to make in this debate."
"Firstly, we insist absolutely that Saddam Hussein must comply fully with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and allow the unrestricted and unconditional access of the UN weapons inspection teams to all locations on Iraqi territory."
"There can be no compromise on this."
"These UN resolutions on Iraq represented a real step forward by beginning the process of monitoring and verifying disarmament."
"The UN showed what the future could hold in determining a safer world."
"If we were then, and are now, serious about this work, we must not allow Saddam Hussein to flout the international community."
"Secondly, my group believes that the only body legitimately responsible for this policy is the United Nations."
"We want to give our wholesale support to the UN and, in particular, we thank the Secretary General for the hard work and commitment he has shown in his attempt to solve this crisis through diplomatic and political pressure."
"We wish him well on his mission to Baghdad. We believe that it is the role of the United Nations Security Council to come together at this time to reconsider the Iraqi problem."
"I must tell you that there are some in my group who believe passionately that the United Nations, and only the United Nations, should decide what happens next."
"They argue against any military action without the sanction of the United Nations Security Council."
"Whilst they do not represent the majority in my group, be in no doubt that they do not argue that case from any weakening resolve to enforce existing UN resolutions; nor because they want to give Saddam Hussein any hope that he will be able to escape our determination to remove from him any potential to damn the region and the world with his weapons of mass destruction."
"Rather, they argue the need for a fresh UN mandate because they fear to inflict death and destruction on Iraqi civilians, who are the real losers in this; because they also fail to understand the objectives of a military strike against Iraq; and because they genuinely fear that a precipitate military strike may initiate a conflagration in the Middle East that would kill and destroy on scale not seen for many years."
"There is not one member of my group who does not share those dreads."
"For the great majority, however, we believe that the United Nations-led drive for a political and diplomatic solution must be the focus for our parliamentary action at this moment."
"Thirdly, my group is committed to the food-for-oil programme and the additional programme which Kofi Annan has proposed to support the Iraqi people."
"I know that next Monday, 23 February, the General Affairs Council has the situation of Iraq on its agenda."
"I hear you saying that the Presidency has kept partners in the European Union informed."
"In our view, information is not enough."
"Parliament needs the Council to find a common position for the European Union."
"We recognize the difficulties; we recognize the lack of precision and real competence in the Treaty on European Union; but our Union is, if anything, a real model of conflict resolution."
"Please use every ounce of strength and vision which the Presidency can muster to give the European Union a leading role in the world on this issue."
"Give us a European Union of which its people can be proud."
"And please show us that the European Union means more than words in a treaty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the brevity of the speech by the Commissioner Marín should perhaps be a symbolic expression of the fact that we have not much time left."
"I believe Mr President-in-Office of the Council that we should not lose sight of one thing: if the European Union were able to work out a common position then perhaps the message to Saddam Hussein would be clear, that he cannot play around with the world community."
"This is further proof that our inability to formulate common foreign and security policies does not lead to the avoidance of war but in fact makes it even more probable."
"Therefore, a greater ability on the part of Europeans to take action on such questions would be a gain for peace."
"I hope that will finally be understood by political directors and foreign ministers, so that sensible mechanisms can come into force for a common foreign and security policy."
"We would all like to have diplomatic solutions."
"A military conflict should be avoided."
"Therefore my group, too, is totally convinced that the mission to be undertaken on Friday by Kofi Annan must receive full support, in order to render a military conflict impossible."
"We wish him every success with it."
"But it must be clear that this must result in all United Nations resolutions being complied with and that there can be no compromise in the implementation of inspections designed to remove all weapons of mass destruction from Iraq."
"Iraq has biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction, associated with the development of rocket programmes which represent a danger not only to the immediate locality in the Middle East but in the medium and long term can be a great danger to ourselves and our peoples."
"For this reason there is great interest in their removal."
"We have the difficulty of choosing between options, not all of which are pleasant."
"But in my opinion, to do nothing and to let Saddam Hussein carry on ducking and diving as he has done for seven years with the world community, would lead to the spread of weapons of mass destruction and we sit there like paper tigers, who have lost any claim to authority in this world."
"For this reason it must be possible, if the resolutions of the United Nations are not fully recognised and implemented in the near future, to take further steps to compel Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions."
"If this should lead to military conflict it will not be the responsibility of those who want compliance with the will of the international community but of those who do not comply with decisions of the United Nations, that is Saddam Hussein."
"We should make this responsibility quite clear and stand behind these decisions."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give an example of consistency, but also one of cohesion, by both emulating Commissioner Marín and confirming everything that has been said, word for word, by Mrs Green. We have supported his resolution while preparing our own resolution on the same subject, because the appropriateness and validity of the things he has said are inevitable."
"Moreover, on certain subjects, we in this House must be determined, informed and responsible."
"Despite the exercises in dialectics and the ability we all have to provide our colleagues with comments and appraisals that certainly make the debate richer, at the end of our conversation there can only be one solution: to make everyone respect the resolutions of the UN Security Council."
"I believe that Saddam Hussein's violation of such a resolution would seriously jeopardize the balances of civilian life and would bring further harm to a nation that is already suffering restrictions and facing uncertainties: this is another aspect we need to consider."
"On another occasion, we will have to assess such aspects, but at the moment, we should, above all, confirm that the resolutions of the UN Security Council will be respected by everyone."
"The occasion of today's debate and in-depth consideration of the matter also leads me to make an additional assessment that will not be the first and, unfortunately, I fear, not the last: the inadequacy, pointed out by Mrs Green, of our common foreign and security policy."
"This is a serious deficit which our institution should be able to face up to, particularly on account of the complementarity evident within the Union."
"We should invite each Registry of our Member States to reflect and to realize that this is a necessity, often highlighted for us by the events which occur from time to time."
"So what should we do?"
"On behalf of my group, I hope that the Annan mission will be successful and, above all, I hope we will reflect on how we can rectify this inadequacy."
"We can reflect all the difficulties experienced by our continent, but we can also provide a significant, definitive example of what dialectics and, above all, peace and political and social cohesion mean."
"Mr President, the Liberal group attaches great importance to respect for international rule of law, and to the opinions and resolutions of the Security Council."
"This does not only apply to Iraq, but to other cases as well, in particular those near Iraq."
"It should be made clear to Saddam Hussein, persuasively, that he must allow unconditional and unrestricted access to the inspection teams."
"The integrity and independence of UNSCOM must be fully respected by Iraq."
"Saddam must have realized - yet he still manages to get away with it after years of obstruction - that we have reached our limits."
"The international community must act as unanimously as possible to give diplomatic pressure maximum effect."
"It would be better if military intervention were avoided, but effective pressure on people or dictators such as the one in Iraq is not possible without a credible military threat, and it is this military threat which can make a diplomatic success possible."
"Europe must play its part in this successful international approach."
"I must confess that it is just a touch embarrassing to note yet again that Europe is deeply divided on this."
"With all respect to the British Presidency, their role has not quite been played as we thought it should."
"The General Affairs Council will not speak about Iraq until Monday, and up until now the Presidency clearly did not think it was necessary to make the Union the forum for this matter."
"Of course, we still have not got a CSFP, and this kind of European unity might have made the difference."
"In the meantime, Iraq and Saddam are laughing up their sleeve."
"Let today's opinion in this House be a first impulse towards a policy for joint European action which is propagated effectively and credibly, including within the context of the UN."
"France and Russia will have to understand that we cannot wait indefinitely for Iraq concessions which are not forthcoming."
"This undermines the international rule of law, creates a dangerous precedent, and saddles the world with large numbers of weapons of mass destruction."
"That is why the Union as a whole must support the US explicitly, exert credible pressure on Iraq and provide a clear strategy and contingency planning in case of military intervention."
"A longer term strategy therefore also requires that attention be focused on other countries in the region."
"There is no need for a new UN resolution for such intervention."
"Mr President, if the bombardment and invasion of Iraq by the United States and allied forces go ahead unilaterally as is planned this will be a multiple injustice."
"Firstly, it will kill many Iraqi citizens who are wholly innocent of any offence against the United States or its real or imagined interests."
"Secondly, if it is claimed that the dictatorial nature of the regime is the reason for military action, then there are significant numbers of other dictatorships against which action is not envisaged."
"Similarly, if a failure to respect United Nations resolutions were the criterion for war, then there are numerous other states to which the same reproach would apply."
"Thirdly, unilateral action will undermine and discredit the United Nations organization because only a Security Council decision can legitimate action against any Member State."
"Selective unilateral punishment missions have nothing to do with the development of international law."
"Further, the failure to explore the possibility of joint decisions by the European Union enfeebles and discredits the Union and exposes the institution of the Presidency-in-Office to serious reproach."
"In this case, the Presidency has unilaterally chosen what to do regardless of any other opinions which might exist in other Member States."
"All these serious problems are undermining the institutions of international law."
"The GUE group has proposed a joint resolution with the Greens and why we are launching an appeal to members of other political groups in this Parliament and to political parties, civil associations, churches and cultural bodies throughout Europe to oppose this military escalation and to urge all EC Member States to refuse to support it."
"Supporters of this appeal will be invited to come together to agree upon their plans to campaign for the condemnation of violent and illegal actions by individual states and to establish the sovereignty of the UN framework."
"Mr President, during the Gulf War in 1991, the USA and its allies dropped 277 000 tonnes of bombs over Iraq in 42 days."
"That did not dislodge Saddam Hussein's despotic totalitarian regime."
"Over the following seven years, Iraq has been subject to a massive international blockade."
"That has also failed to dislodge the military dictatorship."
"On the other hand, according to UNICEF, these measures have led to 4 500 children under the age of five dying each month."
"The infant mortality rate has increased from 24 to 98 per 1000 births."
"Cases of diseases like cholera, polio and jaundice have increased several times over."
"In a new survey, the Middle East Council of Churches says: ' The West wants to punish the leaders of Iraq, but the ones bearing all the burden are ordinary people' ."
"Now the USA wants to hide its President's domestic problems through a new bombing war against Iraq, a war which is going to increase the suffering of the civilian population without solving the problem of weapons of mass destruction, and without paying any regard to the UN, which the USA systematically sabotages."
"Of course the Green group supports Kofi Annan."
"Of course we think that Iraq should comply with the UN's resolutions, but the same also applies to other states which are the subject of UN resolutions."
"Of course we want weapons of mass destruction out of Iraq. They should be out of all other countries too."
"We seek a just world order in which there may be a need for policing actions."
"However, that should be done by the UN, not unilaterally by the USA."
"How often have representatives of the party groups, which are now supporting the wishy-washy, war-mongering majority text, complained about the USA's world hegemony?"
"How stubbornly have they demanded an effective EU alternative?"
"But now, when the moment of truth has come, when the American master whistles, Green and Brok, Bertens and the others obediently wag their tales."
"That means that the EU is now helping the war of the civilizations: the West against the Arab-Muslim world, because that is what it is going to be."
"The whole of the Arab world is now supporting Iraq, even its arch enemy Syria, not because they like Saddam Hussein, but because they see what is happening as an attack by the West against all of Arab-Muslim culture."
"The EU could have played an important, strategic role for peace."
"The EU could have come forward with a real alternative to the USA's 'gunboat diplomacy' ."
"But when it comes to the crunch, certain EU countries' old colonial cloven hooves peep out."
"The historical hatred of the Arabs wells up."
"The stale religious prejudices against Islam reach out and transform the EU's powerful elite into obedient slaves on the American triumphal chariot."
"That also means that the EU's good name - it has actually had a good name in the Arab world - will disappear."
"The trust in the EU in Palestine, where we have made a constructive contribution, will be sacrificed."
"The whole Mediterranean cooperation will be put at risk."
"It is tragic, it is deplorable, it is shameful."
"Support for the joint resolution from the Green group and GUE/NGL would be able to avoid all this."
"Mr President, we are all aware that the political groups within our House are weighing up the exceptional responsibility they bear."
"Parliament has real power to influence peace or war, and I want to tell you why the Group of the European Radical Alliance took the decision unenthusiastically, but in full conscience of the various implications, to add its voice to the resolution which four groups have already supported."
"We have three motivating factors."
"Firstly we reject the caricature description of the Iraqi dictatorship on one hand, and the American imperialism on the other hand and do not come out in favour of either."
"Secondly, we believe that the European Union is not neutral in this conflict which has its beginnings in 1990, and that the question of our basic conception of liberty is at issue."
"Thirdly, whatever the cost to us, we consider that if Iraq does not fall into line with the UN resolutions as a result of diplomatic efforts, we should resort to military action, for if we do not, international law is no longer valid."
"And yet we are reluctant to go down this road, as are a number of Member States, as well as the Arab and Turkish allies of the United States."
"We know that those who are seeking to disarm Iraq were those who armed it in the first place, and that those who condemned the Iraqi exploits in Kuwait put up with the double protectorate imposed on Lebanon. We are also aware that the UNSCOM mission, in the eyes of many observers, is an American venture rather than a tool of the United Nations, that the current embargo and the future war influences or will influence the ordinary people much more than those in charge of them, and that the allies of the United States would suffer much more than America from a new international crisis."
"We know all this and we also deplore the British Presidency for believing it could express, without even a formal meeting of the General Affairs Council, its national prejudices and thereby stress the vacuity of the diplomacy of the Union."
"We know all this, but we take responsibility by voting for the resolution and insisting on the following points."
"Firstly, the UN alone has the power to force Iraq to observe the resolutions it has made."
"Secondly, any military intervention would only be legitimate if preceded by a decision by the Security Council."
"Thirdly, the Union should wholeheartedly support the mission of the UN Secretary General and reaffirm the absolute priority which it accords to diplomatic efforts."
"It is on the condition of these three points that our group will approve a text which explicitly includes the military solution as the only one capable of lending credibility to diplomatic pressure."
"Mr President, nations must be respected and peoples must not be humiliated; this is the basic rule of international life."
"This should be applied to all, and particularly to more fragile and less assured nations which the international community should not set out to weaken or destabilize but rather to strengthen, and which, in the Arab-Muslim world, are the best counterweights which can be set against the development of Islamism."
"Beyond the person of Saddam Hussein, the international community must take into consideration above all Iraq and its integrity, the Iraqi people and its sovereignty."
"The international community must take care not to launch irresponsible actions which would be perceived as singling Iraq out with a suspect determination in a disproportionate violation of its sovereignty."
"It would strengthen the bonds between the Iraqi people and a large part of Arab opinion surrounding Saddam Hussein."
"It would provoke very hostile reactions towards the West from the Arab world and would risk stirring up the occupied territories."
"These consequences would be entirely out of proportion with the objectives of the inspections which, moreover, would not be met by a military strike."
"If, in fact, the real objective is the full application by the Iraqi authorities of the United Nations resolutions which call for the complete disarmament of the country, we must first note that Iraq today no longer represents a threat to the security of its neighbours."
"It no longer has any nuclear capability and its ballistic potential is under control."
"If the Security Council thinks it necessary to reinforce the inspections and controls to detect as far as possible any chemical and biological weapons which Iraq has in its possession, it should be possible to settle this residual question by political dialogue."
"This does not rule out pressure on or threats to a wily and disturbing dictator who remained in power in 1991, elements which could be useful in negotiations."
"This pressure would be all the more effective if Iraqis were encouraged to cooperate positively with the United Nations. And how better to do this than by proposing to put an end in a structured way to the unhealthy imprisonment of Iraq, caused by an embargo which for seven years has hit the population hard and whose complete failure we would now do well to acknowledge."
"The embargo has destabilized society, but not Saddam Hussein, nor the political and military elite of the regime."
"It has destroyed production and trade channels and at the same time reinforced the links between Saddam Hussein and his people."
"Lifting the embargo is essential and I am delighted that some European diplomatic efforts are proposing just that whilst they are actively participating in the political dialogue with Iraq. At the same time, they recall that it is up to the Security Council alone to judge the degree to which Iraq has adopted its resolutions and to draw the appropriate conclusions about this."
"Of course, these diplomatic efforts do not all speak with one voice, but they speak loudly, and this is how Europe in all its diversity comes to be an important player in this crisis."
"Europe makes itself heard and intervenes with the aid of its most active Member States in such a way as to be much more effective than if it had tried hard to define a common position for all."
"Any such position would have risked being too weak and too slow to emerge when a crisis, such as the one we are facing at the moment, calls for a swift judgement and a rapid reaction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to point out that, once again, we are called upon to repeat a useless practice that risks, if it has not already done so, lacking any specific confirmation, owing to the total lack of a credible foreign policy common to the fifteen Member States."
"We realize that it is not easy to make the political strategies followed by the states in past decades compatible, with histories and interests that are often different if not hostile, but we regret the absence of any effort to minimize differences on the basis of common, irrenounceable principles."
"Firstly, as regards respect for international treaties and agreements, the American ally cannot be used when it is convenient and then discarded when appropriate."
"There is a saying in Italian: ""clear agreements and long friendship' ."
"So, we need clear agreements with all our allies."
"Secondly, we need to consider respect for human rights, a flower in the eye of Parliament. We should ensure that the bilateral agreements between individual states and countries which do not offer any guarantee to that effect, should no longer take place, particularly when they have to be made with countries such as Iraq that have destructive military arsenals which place the populations of an entire region in danger."
"Thirdly, the UN should have an ever more significant and important duty, particularly at diplomatic level, to ensure that its prerogative remains intact and that its resolutions are accepted without any hesitation or delay by all those who have signed the accession."
"Having said that, it is obvious that the National Alliance delegation can only hope for the successful outcome of the current diplomatic initiatives, particularly the initiative whose deadline is nearly up, led by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, whom no-one can consider to be under any influences."
"This is particularly so to avoid the catastrophic effects of a conflict that would force the civilian population into great discomfort, particularly the weaker sections - the children and the elderly - who are still paying harshly for the effects of the previous war."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President Marín, I believe that each and every one of us in this House feels revulsion for Saddam Hussein and his regime."
"There can be no doubt about that."
"Nevertheless, we must be clear, in view of the political climate, especially in the Arab world, when and on what conditions a military strike can be successful."
"In my view, Europe must insist on three things, in solidarity with but certainly not in subordination to the policy of America."
"Firstly, the aim of any military strike must be clear."
"So far, it has not become clear to me."
"We must be as sure as possible that after a military strike the situation will be better for peace and better for the development of the whole Middle East region."
"Secondly, there is no question that the situation in the Middle East is not improving but deteriorating. This has been pointed out frequently by the EU and in particular Commissioner Marín, as well as the President-in-Office of the Council."
"A few years ago it was still possible to organize as many Arab countries as possible in a coalition against Saddam Hussein, which is impossible today."
"It is a fact that we have a policy of obstruction by the Netanyahu government; it is a fact, without making comparisons, that even Israel does not recognise and does not implement a UN resolution concerning the Lebanon."
"This produces a negative atmosphere in the Arab world and we must be clear that any strike which is not properly thought out, extremely well considered and well supported will make this atmosphere even worse."
"Europe must bear that in mind."
"Lastly, as regards the role of the United Nations, I would not like to say now that it is essential to have a Security Council resolution."
"There are various legal interpretations there."
"But we must all be clear about one thing: the weaker the consensus in the Security Council and the United Nations, the more negative any effects will be, particularly on the relationship between the West and the Arab world."
"It must be Europe's task to get America to support the United Nations fully, now in the case of this mission, but also in the Security Council, to ensure as broad a consensus as possible; otherwise, the military strike becomes a slap in the face of the Arabs and ultimately also a slap in the face of the Europeans who seek a good relationship with this region."
"Mr President, I would like to say how nice it was to hear the President-in-Office of the Council give us an informative statement on the situation."
"We had already read this in the papers."
"We would rather have heard a few different things, because the more important and more critical the topic, the less visible the Foreign Affairs Council is."
"This is a dangerous situation."
"When something does come out of the Council, it seems to be fragile compromises which may be different again tomorrow and which are not really shared."
"As the world expects something a little better from the European Union since we are an economic giant, it is extremely dangerous that the Council is this invisible."
"The European citizens, according to the opinion polls, think that the European Union is above all responsible for foreign affairs. This is a very logical thought, really, but sadly a misunderstanding, because the Foreign Affairs Council and the Union do not really accept this responsibility."
"That is why the Council is usually not part of the solution, but part of the problem."
"The British Presidency - from which we had expected a fresh, new approach - could have made an attempt to avoid this being part of the problem."
"Unfortunately, the British Presidency has only acted nationally, and has actually forgotten its duty as leader of foreign policy of the Union."
"Like a proud terrier, Great Britain is walking next to the American elephant, and is saying: listen to us making all this noise."
"If there is anything that can contribute to avoiding war, it is a solid European Union action."
"This can achieve something."
"We need a solid European Union action that leaves no room for false hopes or manipulation by tyrants."
"There was certainly none of this clarity in Bosnia."
"The British position is clearer now; oil is involved."
"In Bosnia, British officers told me at the time, oil did not play a part."
"That was a terrible position, but it is clearer now."
"Thank God."
"But only as the position of the country itself."
"There is no European Union, or Council position regarding Iraq or regarding Algeria."
"Parliament's resolution must now add something to this unusual situation in order to fill the vacuum a little."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a euphemism, I believe, to state that the legitimacy of the Baghdad regime, suspected of crimes against humanity, crimes of war and crimes of genocide is doubtful at least."
"In a more general context, it is a fact that Saddam Hussein is trying to justify himself in the eyes of world public opinion, and the developing countries in particular, as a symbol of the combat against American imperialism, and Western imperialism more generally, in a black and white view of the world that belongs to another era."
"The point should be made that no-one in Europe wants or can want war with Iraq."
"The diplomatic solution to the crisis is certainly far more preferable. But it is for this precise reason that it is absolutely necessary, as already confirmed by several parties, that the European Union and the individual Member States should make up for the guilty and self-interested inertia of some authoritative members of the international Community with all their authority."
"At the same time, the European Union should not leave the United States and the United Kingdom the monopoly on handling the crisis on the Western side."
"For this reason, the elusive nature of the General Affairs Council and even the brevity of the declarations made by the representative for the Commission amaze me somewhat."
"Politics, particularly international politics, abhors a vacuum; we will not contribute towards creating it. Otherwise, if this vacuum is occupied by others, we will have to deal with it ourselves."
"Mr President, we are all quite clear that Iraq must comply with international resolutions."
"However, I would like to know whether we also share the view that the United Nations should be the only ones to make that happen, and whether we also agree that they should do it peacefully, through political and diplomatic means."
"Of course, we support the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, but I hope those efforts do not end up being the victim of friendly fire."
"In other words, Mr Annan's trip to Baghdad might end up being the excuse for US military action, which is unacceptable from every point of view, both because of the consequences it would have for the civilian population and, of course, because of the effects it would have on stability in the Middle East."
"The role of the European Union in this matter is quite frankly regrettable."
"The British Presidency is embarking upon an exercise in confusion in order to guarantee their national policy which, quite frankly, is to do what the White House says."
"And what can we say about other Member States of the European Union, beginning with my own country, Spain, where the Head of Government has witnessed his citizens receiving an explanation of Madrid's participation in a hypothetical US operation via Tony Blair through the CNN?"
"The Union should of course have a common position on this matter, which should include opposing any unilateral US action and, of course, lifting an embargo which is causing indescribable suffering to the ordinary citizens of Iraq. They are being punished twice over: they have to endure a brutal dictatorial regime, and they lack the foods and medicines to cope with daily life."
"We should support the democratic opposition in Iraq, of course."
"And this Parliament ought to make sure that if Clinton undertakes a military operation without the support of a United Nations Security Council resolution that he will not be able to end up finding support in a resolution from this Parliament."
"What a sad state of affairs that would be!"
"Mr President, let me first make it clear on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament that we hold no brief for Saddam Hussein."
"Some of us were opposing him when Britain and the US were arming him."
"This includes the chemical and biological warfare which Doug Henderson spoke about this morning."
"We know they have it, we sold it to them."
"Let us end all chemical and biological warfare and destroy all weapons around the world."
"Let us inspect all sites around the world including those in the USA and in Britain which still exist."
"Let us be clear what this crisis is about."
"It is not about the threat from Iraq."
"It is about Mr Clinton's domestic problems."
"This is the war of Mr Clinton's penis, designed to bolster his image in the face of allegations about his character back home."
"How ironic then that Mr Clinton's main backer is Mr Blair, Mr Clean the Christian socialist, and how disgraceful that Mr Blair, the President of the European Union, has made no attempt to represent the views of Europe but seeks to impose the views of Mr Clinton on Europe."
"How sad and pathetic it is to watch Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, instead of travelling around Europe to help stop the war, trailing around the Gulf States to persuade them to let the US and Britain bomb Baghdad."
"What an end to a man who made his name as a CND and peace campaigner!"
"The Financial Times this morning reports that Foreign Office officials brief that Britain is prepared to use nuclear weapons against Iraq if Saddam responds."
"Let this Parliament speak clearly against this unnecessary war."
"The joint resolution of the EPP and the PSE does not go far enough."
"I understand that Pauline Green has been privately critical of Mr Blair's belligerence over Iraq."
"Let us be openly critical of the British failure to act as the President of Europe rather than the fifty-second state of the US."
"Let us say that bombing Baghdad will not work and is morally unjustifiable."
"The Green amendments to the joint resolution will say all these things."
"I appeal to the Socialist group, and especially to the British Labour Members; forget your fears about reselection, listen to your conscience, follow the example of the British MPs who voted against the war at Westminster last night."
"Remember that not only will your Labour party members judge you, but history will judge how you vote on this issue."
"I appeal to you to vote for peace, for a diplomatic solution and against the war."
"Mr President, it seems as though the United States of America is preparing quite imperturbably to lead a new war in the Gulf and to strike Iraq, against international law, against the United Nations Charter, against the resolutions of the Security Council and particularly resolution 687 which refutes their mandate to do so."
"What can justify this sudden, unilateral, arrogant and cynical policy?"
"And why now when the situation seemed to be improving?"
"Is Mr Clinton trying to forget the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky affairs, where the shocking and the sordid have competed for our attention?"
"Or is it on orders from Mr Netanyahu, whose disregard for the Security Council resolutions does not arouse any emotion from you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council?"
"Or again, is it a question of preserving the profitability of American oil-wells, half of which would have to close if, as forecast, Iraqi oil came back onto the world market?"
"In any case, contrary to the official lies, one thing is sure: these threats are not justified by the danger which Iraq would represent."
"No prima facie evidence on this subject has even begun to be provided."
"This country with 20 million inhabitants has been methodically starved for seven years."
"There are no more spare parts."
"For seven years, no aeroplanes or helicopters have taken off."
"Industry is paralyzed."
"To get to the capital, you have to cross 900 kilometres of desert in terrible conditions."
"There are no more electric bulbs, there is no more bread, there is no more milk."
"Pencils have even been confiscated from schools because it is said that Saddam Hussein would make atomic bombs from graphite mines!"
"The most upsetting thing about it all is not the American lies, but your servility, Mr President of the Council."
"Let us at least get rid of your loathsome morals."
"Let us get rid of your alibi."
"Let us get rid of the political and media montages which took place during the Gulf War."
"If you wish to go to war with your American friends, go ahead, but go without us!"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am sorry that the British Government has unilaterally and immediately declared that it is prepared to take part in a military action, without consulting the European governments and seeking a common position."
"At a time when it is responsible for the Presidency of the European Union, this is a harsh blow to the role and credibility of the Union."
"The joint resolution of several political groups calls us to this responsibility today; it calls us to define a common position, to support all diplomatic means, particularly the missions of the UN and its Secretary General, and its proposal of oil in return for food directed at the population."
"Finally, and this is the central point, the resolution asks for any further action that is not diplomatic to require the formal decision of the UN Security Council, the sole interpreter."
"This is an essential point."
"We are convinced of the extreme danger Saddam Hussein poses and the need to force him to observe the UN resolutions. However, the Security Council has to decide how and when, assessing the situation which is different in both military and political terms today than it was during the Gulf War."
"The situation is different today as regards military resources."
"I can give two examples of this: what effects will striking chemical arms deposits have?"
"Minister Primakoff talks of devastating effects over the entire region."
"This is a point that should be assessed."
"Another example is that UN sources indicate that Saddam has hidden chemical missiles and arms in Algeria, Libya and Sudan."
"If that is true, what does he intend to do with those countries and how can it help to bombard Iraq?"
"The situation is also different in terms of politics."
"All the Arab countries, and first and foremost our allies, are against this."
"Why?"
"We can take action against them, but with what consequences throughout the Middle East?"
"The Security Council should assess all this and then its decisions will be applied."
"Each of us will then do our parts."
"Madam President, Kofi Annan's trip to Baghdad gives us a glimpse of rationality and hope: rationality because, in the last few weeks, war has been considered inevitable on almost all sides, in view of Saddam Hussein's unacceptable arrogance."
"As Clinton said yesterday, war is never the first option, even if it may be the only option in certain situations."
"Thanks to the persistence of some countries, to the attitude of UN public union, to the strong calls from the solitary moral authority of the Pope in Rome, to the worrying and foreseeable agreement between Russia and China and to the resistance of the Arab countries, the policy seems to be taking over its responsibility very recently."
"Unfortunately, we cannot thank Europe for this because, once again, Europe, which is preparing to become a monetary power, is not managing to become a political power, not even when faced with a crisis that could provide it with more than we believe today."
"For this reason, I am joining all those who have criticized the inexplicable and unacceptable behaviour of the British Presidency in these circumstances."
"Let it be clear that no-one doubts the need for the Baghdad dictator to be forced to observe all the UN resolutions. However, the usefulness and effectiveness of the methods used to achieve the result, the balance of foreseeable human costs and the simulation of subsequent political scenarios can never be considered indisputable and inevitable."
"When the alternative is war, indisputable limits to the patience of diplomacy and politics cannot be invoked."
"This is not a weakness, but is the strength that shows us the old moral and political wisdom of this ancient continent and the only serious lesson left behind by the century that is drawing to a close."
"Madam President, we cannot but express astonishment and dismay about what we have heard today, particularly from the British Foreign Office gentleman."
"We read the same papers he reads about the weapons of mass destruction, British-developed anthrax and the inflated threats against humanity."
"We also know the role his government has played, first to block, then to hinder the mission in Iraq of the Secretary General, Kofi Annan."
"We learn that the use of incredible force to produce a diplomatic solution has long ceased to be a threat to achieve anything at all, as the juggernaut of American military power moves inexorably and with devastating force against the Iraqi people: there are one and a half million victims of the embargo, an embargo that somebody in this House wants to prolong forever."
"On this side of the House, we nurture no sympathy for the Baghdad dictator."
"We still hope that Mr Annan might perform a miracle."
"We deplore, in the strongest terms, the veil of hypocrisy and mystification drawn over this pre-planned massacre, over this tragedy of major proportions and, more than anything else, over the attempted use of this Union to support blind instruments of Anglo- American military and foreign policies at their worst."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is totally disgraceful to claim that Iraq would really threaten its neighbours with what remains of an arsenal which has been voluntarily overestimated by Israeli-American disinformation."
"There can be no doubt that this country, if it were to launch a war of aggression, would suffer dreadful destructive reprisals from Israel and the United States immediately."
"Having led Saddam Hussein into the trap of recapturing Kuwait, the United States hammered the derisory Iraqi army with their might."
"And since then, they have been starving the Iraqi people and causing the deaths of children by the hundreds of thousands, soon to reach two million, using a procedure which constitutes a crime against humanity. It is all the more terrible in that it is perpetrated coldly, calmly and clinically and has operated down the years under the cover of moral pacifist motivations which claim human rights as their inspiration."
"We know that the reality is that with cynicism covered in a thick layer of hypocrisy, Mr Clinton is obeying first and foremost the cold interests of oil mercantilism which Iraqi production must not threaten, not to mention his own murky personal motivations."
"Finally, and above all, if Saddam Hussein did not exist, he would have to be invented."
"Israel and the United States think they need a constant virtual enemy and a war which might always break out."
"Today Saddam, tomorrow someone else."
"Comprehension of this is the key to the whole situation, but it also brings understanding of the danger for world peace."
"So who could negate the legitimacy of Palestinian exasperation and the rising anger of the most moderate and responsible Arab movements?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my contribution I would like to say something about the role of the European Union and our House in this conflict."
"The question is, do we play a part at all, or do we do it justice?"
"The fact is that we do not play an active role, but nevertheless I think that our debate and the joint resolution which we present today are an important contribution, for we in the European Parliament will reach a decision before the Council and the Commission have been able to work out a common position."
"This is the umpteenth time that the Council and the Commission have not been able to find a common position and if the Commission, as we have heard this morning, limits itself to wishing and hoping then the Commission appears to be in a bad way."
"In our resolution we demand a common position on a common foreign and security policy, but we also say in this resolution how we view this."
"In any case, it involves a resolution put forward by a majority in our House and, as already mentioned, adopted before the Council and the Commission are in a position to put forward some kind of common text for discussion."
"I would like to make a comment on the UN resolution. The Americans hold the view that we must intervene if all diplomatic efforts fail, and that we shall intervene."
"In our House, and this has been said, there are some who dispute this."
"It is to be hoped that further measures against the dictator will be supported by the whole international community."
"It would also be desirable for the UN Security Council to confirm such a measure."
"But this effort must not lead to some members of the international community, such as Russia and China, bringing the Security Council into a position whereby the pressure on Saddam can be reduced, which would mean state terrorism being victorious in Iraq."
"We do not want that."
"We want, if possible, a peaceful solution, and hopefully a common one, which will mean that all those things indicated some time ago by the British Presidency disappear from the world."
"Chemical and biological weapons cannot be accepted anywhere in the world, and certainly not in a country where there is state terrorism."
"Mr President-in-Office, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the refusal of Iraq to comply with the decisions of the UN can only be condemned firmly and without ambiguity by any country or parliament."
"Respect for international law is the condition for peace, all the more so because in this case we are dealing with highly dangerous weapons."
"But who could refuse or regret exhausting all possible diplomatic and political efforts before using force to put these weapons out of action to prevent them causing harm in case negotiations failed?"
"I congratulate and approve of the efforts of those who push negotiation to its limits, especially the French government and the Secretary General of the UN."
"We could already make a number of observations about this crisis."
"Firstly, was Iraq capable of manufacturing these terrible arms on its own, or was it aided by other members of the UN?"
"Secondly, once again Europe is incapable of adopting a European position."
"In terms of international politics, Europe does not exist, and this shortcoming can only be compensated for by the Member States."
"They do this in the light of their individual histories and respective sensibilities, and these are not identical."
"And so they are forced to draw up policies, not in terms of their common analysis, but which relate to those of the United States."
"Your attitude, Mr President-in-Office, that of your government, was of particular significance in this respect, and I would like to know what you have done in your role as President of the European Council, and not as the British government, with regard to the Arab countries, with regard to the Soviet Union, with regard to China, with regard to the UN and in general within the European Union."
"Thirdly, must we go to war with Iraq every ten years, or will we learn from the first Gulf War and from the present situation to reflect on the issues of the balance of forces in the region, the law of each country and its security, the role of oil in this crisis, the influence of blocking the peace process on the general situation in the Middle East, the use of an embargo on Iraq, and the situation of the Iraqi population which is hostage both to its dictator and to the West?"
"If Europe existed, it would certainly have been able to do something to direct the situation during the past ten years in order to avoid the current tragic deadlock."
"But we persist in deploring our impotence without taking decisions which are of the same order as the stakes."
"Do you not agree, for example, that the election of the President of the European Council for a period of four years would be a first practical step in drawing up a real common and foreign security policy?"
"Madam President, Mr Clinton has lit the pipe of war, and, accompanied by the drumbeats of the armaments industries and the oil multinationals, he is doing what he wants."
"I fear that we are talking too much here and looking for excuses that there is no common foreign policy, and that is why there is none or rather, through the current Presidency, that it is a party to Clinton's war games."
"Madam President, I think that notwithstanding the above, this Parliament could pass a resolution which firstly categorically opposes any military intervention in Iraq - regardless of the situation, whether reprehensible, etcetera - and secondly, defends in the same integrated way a political and diplomatic solution."
"Instead of that, however, the four groups have a resolution which in one way or another very cunningly creates the prerequisites for its use as a fig-leaf for military intervention by the Americans. Meanwhile, the resolution by the Greens and our own group totally condemns, in fact, any military intervention and supports a political and diplomatic solution, which is the best form of support for Annan in the mission he has now undertaken by going to Baghdad."
"Madam President, the hope kindled in these last few hours does not lessen the gravity of this Iraqi crisis and I believe that, as it is impossible for Europe to have a common policy as such, the duty of the European Parliament is to express the requirements and needs of our nations, which seek reassurance on many points."
"This is worrying, a very worrying crisis!"
"Just think that seven years ago Saddam Hussein could have been calmly removed from power and yet the power that could have done so did not do it; things have progressed over the years and now we are in this situation."
"We have the duty to reassure our nations that there will be no ecological disasters; we all know how bombardment starts: it is hoped to be surgical but then becomes devastating."
"We cannot even hold a nation hostage in the hope that this nation will cause the dictator to fall, because this is not the right way of seeing things."
"Unfortunately, there are too many people like Saddam Hussein and the dictators who oppress the rights of their nations in the world today."
"In this specific case, as well as the risk of bacteriological or any other type of warfare, Saddam also has the grave responsibility of holding one-fifth of the population of his country, the Kurds, under a humanely unacceptable regime."
"I ask Parliament to declare this and, with regard to the people I represent, the people of the Po Valley, we are against the use of any base that is situated in our territory."
"From this House, I warn the Italian government not to use bases in the Po Valley for attacks which we cannot accept."
"Mr President, it is a good thing that the European Parliament is defining its position on the Iraq crisis."
"It appears that the Council has not really managed to do so."
"The starting position as regards Iraq is fairly clear."
"We have a pariah state which does not take any notice of the international community, and refuses to meet UN declarations which demand that the weapons of mass destruction be inspected and destroyed."
"This is simply unacceptable."
"It requires international action: that is what we are discussing here."
"What action is the world taking to rid Saddam Hussein of his deadly arsenal?"
"This issue concerns everyone, not just America."
"The compromise resolution before us deals with a number of fundamental questions."
"Should you threaten violence in a situation like this?"
"Should it be used as a last resort, if diplomacy fails?"
"Yes."
"Should you use all peaceful means for a solution?"
"Again, I believe so, and I am also glad that there is agreement about a last attempt by Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General."
"Should you be prepared to use violence if a diplomatic avenue does not lead to the concessions demanded of Saddam Hussein?"
"My answer is, albeit reluctantly, yes."
"Should the Security Council approve such an action?"
"It is desirable, but not an absolute condition."
"The Security Council should play a part, but there is a difference of opinion about the interpretation of the UN resolutions on Iraq."
"Saddam Hussein should not be allowed to benefit from the confusion."
"The compromise resolution before us is a perfect expression of this notion."
"Our aim is not war, but there are limits to the international community's patience."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say first of all that I find it extraordinarily regrettable that Commissioner Marín has already left the House."
"In any case, he was here for the commentary."
"He could easily be here and speak in somewhat greater detail in a final speech on certain humanitarian measures and suchlike;"
"I very much regret that he did not feel that this was necessary."
"On the other hand, I am of course very happy that the discussion is being held here today, since it is simply high time that we in Europe speak with one voice - I am very happy, Commissioner Marín, that you are again with us -, that we speak with one voice on a subject that has already been described by CNN as the ""showdown in the Gulf' ."
"I sometimes wish that this one voice were rather more harmonious and somewhat louder."
"Nevertheless, it is good that it is actually happening."
"I am also sure that many colleagues present yesterday saw two things on television which were interesting: on the one hand, the permanent members of the Security Council dispatching Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and the good advice which he has taken with him; and on the other hand, the speech which President Bill Clinton made to officers in the Pentagon, in which he very clearly threatened Saddam Hussein."
"We must be clear on one point: the journey of this Secretary General must undoubtedly not turn into a flop like the one made by the Secretary General in 1991, which was practically the introduction to the Gulf War."
"I can only hope that lessons were learned from these mistakes."
"We should also make our opinion clear in the sense that only on the basis of clear concessions can we really exhaust all diplomatic possibilities of preventing this war."
"However, we must make quite clear our attitude to those states which are using biological weapons."
"Here I would point out that Iraq itself has anthrax at its disposal as its main weapon."
"Anyone who has observed in our own continent the effects of anthrax over 50 years ago in Scotland on Anthrax Island, understands that it is really necessary for us to speak with one voice here, because we cannot foresee these effects, nor do we want to foresee them."
"Madam President, coming from Northern Ireland as I do, I have to say that there is hypocrisy in both President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair."
"They tell the IRA terrorists in my country that they can hold on to their weapons which have murdered my constituents, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, and be welcomed at the White House and Downing Street."
"Yet they tell us today that Iraq must have its weapons destroyed."
"I want to put on record that none of us dare forget that Saddam has proved by the murderous slaughter of his own people that he would use mass destruction weapons if he had the chance."
"I do not know whether an air strike can take out all these weapons, but for us to start again without finishing would be disastrous."
"That is what happened before."
"It must not happen again."
"Madam President, after ""Desert Storm' here we are again on the brink of a new intervention in Iraq led by the United States of America."
"The Iraqi dictator is flouting the international community once more."
"He refuses to comply with the UN resolutions."
"He has brought about plans for a formidable threat to the region."
"There my parallel ends."
"In 1990, the UN authorized force to be used under Chapter 7."
"Intervention was implemented by a broad coalition which included in particular neighbouring Arab countries and also many non-aligned countries."
"And Europe as such was present, active notably through the voice of the Presidency and of the troika which did not carefully handle its efforts and turned up in Baghdad in spite of certain reservations shown particularly in this Parliament."
"Today I note that Europe has been obliterated, as spectacularly indicated, Mr Marín, by the terseness of your remarks earlier."
"I note especially the obliteration of the British Presidency, Mr President-in-Office."
"Prime Minister Blair is doubtless very active and omnipresent, however President Blair has disappeared."
"It seems as if the common foreign and security policy no longer exists when things become serious."
"I would add that the coalition comes from the West alone and that the United States seems to have decided to act without any mandate from the UN, despite a half-hearted blessing given to the last chance mission of the Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan, which we obviously hope will be fruitful."
"Under these conditions, an intervention would indicate a serious weakening of the authority of the United Nations and of the presence of the European Union, which has become a negligible quantity in world terms."
"Some of us are not prepared under these conditions to give carte blanche to the United States of America for this operation."
"Madam President, it is quite clear that there is a consensus emerging in the Chamber, which gives me no pleasure, and that is the criticism of the Presidency."
"We have just heard from a leading French socialist the sort of words I might use myself."
"There is confusion."
"I remember the last time we debated Iraq in substance during the Gulf War."
"At that time, all but six of the Labour Members signed a resolution condemning the military action in the Gulf."
"This time, only six would sign up to one."
"So, this is the sort of changing pattern one sees on the socialist side of this House."
"It is regrettable and deplorable that, so far, the Presidency has failed to arrive at a common position."
"But it reflects the lack of certainty in foreign policy, both in Washington and London, and, I regret, elsewhere in Europe."
"The sort of certainty that was so evident in the days of Mrs Thatcher and President Bush; the sort of certainty that was brought to the European Union by Douglas Hurd, when he was Foreign Secretary; the sort of certainty we actually need today."
"I regret, therefore, that Robin Cook has not found it possible to come here, although he spent the whole of yesterday afternoon in the House of Commons."
"These are shifting sands."
"We do not know how the next few days are going to turn out."
"We know that in that part of the world there is little to choose between two despotic regimes, one in Iran and one in Iraq."
"Criticism has been made of the supply of material to the Iraqis."
"In the case of the United Kingdom, that stopped in 1988."
"But we are dealing here with a dictator, who has at his disposal weapons, some of which were invented as far back as the First World War."
"It is First World War technology with a barbarian mentality, and this needs to be dealt with by the international community."
"Therefore, we feel that the present diplomatic mission by Kofi Annan needs every support."
"We understand the position, reflected here on my own benches: by Mr Castagnetti and Mr Bernard-Reymond, from Italy and France, and other Mediterranean countries in particular are deeply concerned about the dangers of the present situation."
"But we cannot allow Saddam Hussein to continue to have the ability to threaten not only his own people but those neighbouring his country and even much further afield with the technology he has been trying to develop."
"We deeply sympathize with the people of Iraq."
"We hope the humanitarian efforts will continue and if it is necessary in the coming days to take further measures, as enjoined by the resolution we are about to adopt, then I believe the House here and the people of Europe should stand behind those forces, as I do, whether they are American, British or others, if the time comes - and the time is coming - when we must finish the job we began in 1991."
"Madam President, in my nine years in this Parliament I have never before heard a speech of such distorted, selfindulgent drivel as that which Mr Kerr gave a short while ago."
"I now know that care in the community in the United Kingdom does not work."
"I ask this Chamber to consider for one moment the effect of just one Scud missile with chemical weapons aimed at Israel."
"The conflagration in the Middle East resulting from that Scud missile is beyond imagination."
"We must be clear in this Chamber that international law must be adhered to."
"There should be no comfort for Saddam Hussein in our debate."
"He is the person not adhering to UN resolutions."
"It is no good claiming that in other areas the UN has been less rigorous."
"Two wrongs do not make a right."
"I am also perturbed by the weeping and gnashing of teeth by Members of Parliament over the CFSP."
"CFSP does not mean, as Mr Bertens says, that we should be united on every issue."
"It means that we should have a common strategy towards common threats to the European Union."
"It is clear that the European Union has been moving in that direction."
"The common text we have before us is united in making sure that Saddam Hussein is clearly identified as being in the wrong; that there has to be implementation of UN resolutions."
"There has to be an exhaustive search for a diplomatic solution."
"We have to support the UN Secretary General in his mission."
"Can Mr Henderson confirm that, in fact, that is also the common position of the Council?"
"Could he also confirm that the Presidency has acted entirely in conformity with Article J.5 of the Treaty on European Union and, in addition, that the British government has adhered to its obligations under Article J.5, paragraph 4, as a member of the Security Council?"
"We must be clear: Saddam Hussein must be stopped."
"We must have a diplomatic solution to this problem."
"But at the end, if there is no possibility of a diplomatic solution, the military option must be considered as a very last resort."
"Madam President, Saddam Hussein has inflicted vast suffering on huge numbers of people."
"Full pressure must be maintained to deprive him of all weapons of mass destruction."
"It would, however, be a massive mistake for the United States to bomb Iraq."
"It is not certain to eliminate the weaponry; it could inflict casualties and further suffering on innocent civilians; it would alienate supporters, divide the European Union and inflame Arab opinion, already aggrieved at the different standards applied to Israel; fundamentalism and terrorism will gain and could escalate."
"No military action should be taken anyway without the explicit and full agreement of the United Nations Security Council, which must meet again on this issue."
"We also need to increase food and medical supplies to the Iraqi people by extending the oil-for-food programme."
"The European Union must formulate its own foreign policy, not supinely follow the United States, particularly when the United States is wrong."
"Madam President, I welcome the mandate of the Secretary General of the UN to seek a peaceful solution to this dangerous conflict."
"Any attempt to restrict this mandate, as is happening on the part of the USA at the moment, must be rejected."
"The task and the obligation of the European Union, and specifically of its British Presidency, will be to strengthen the Secretary General's hand and to show confidence in his negotiating skills."
"The military option must really remain the undesirable ultima ratio and this only when the following conditions apply: firstly, a military strike must not be a punitive action and must offer the guarantee that all weapons of mass destruction will be eliminated by this strike; and secondly, the formal discussions in the Security Council must lead to an appropriate resolution."
"Mr President of the Council, in recent weeks I have admired the determination with which your government has demonstrated its solidarity and loyalty towards the USA."
"This strengthens me in my hope and desire that the other 14 members of the European Union will soon be able to count on this same solidarity and loyalty."
"Madam President, please permit me one more point of order."
"I very much regret that this morning I did not have the opportunity to speak on the roll-call vote and its financial implications."
"Then I would have also had one and a half minutes speaking time like my 15 colleagues who this morning took away half an hour from this important debate on Iraq in order to talk about the new regulation and the roll-call vote."
"Madam President, I welcome the joint resolution supported by my group which is before the House today."
"It gives a clear signal to Saddam Hussein that Europe is united in its condemnation of Iraq's failure to comply with UN Security Council resolutions."
"This House seeks a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis and welcomes the work Kofi Annan is undertaking to resolve it."
"But Iraq should know that if it does not allow UNSCOM to continue its vital work, the real threat of military action will remain."
"Saddam must destroy all remaining stocks of chemical and biological weapons and the potential to develop other weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons."
"This includes some 31 000 chemical weapons and 45 missiles unaccounted for."
"Saddam has used these weapons before, as we have heard, both against his own people and Iran."
"He must never be allowed to use weapons of mass destruction again."
"Madam President, countries should be founded on law."
"That also applies to the international community."
"International law must be respected by everyone, not just by some."
"Saddam Hussein should, of course, comply with the Security Council's resolution."
"The UN Charter permits the use of force as a last resort, but only after a resolution by the UN Security Council."
"Therefore, it is important that no green light be given for any military bombing by the USA."
"Every intelligent general should ask himself this question: what is the objective?"
"Is it to remove weapons or to remove Saddam Hussein?"
"Will this be achieved through bombs?"
"The answer is certainly no."
"What will happen after the bombing?"
"What will happen to Iraq's population?"
"Will Saddam Hussein's position not in fact be stronger after a bombing?"
"It is excellent that all five permanent members of the Security Council support Kofi Annan's journey to Iraq and diplomatic solutions."
"Diplomacy works slowly."
"The UN has removed a lot of weapons and will also be able to do so in future."
"We must, as former President Carter said, have patience, patience, patience."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the unfortunate matter we are discussing should lead us to reflect on certain things. It is true, none of these things are particularly useful as regards the actual situation, because it is not in our power to decide, or almost not even to comment."
"However, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think there is one aspect which we should be very concerned about: the way we Europeans have acted so ineffectively in regard to this serious issue."
"In your speech, Mr President-in-Office, you spoke several times of a united Europe."
"There can be no doubt that this has been a disunited Europe."
"I have the impression that the Council, under its worthy Presidency, has not taken the necessary steps to achieve a certain common position, far less a joint action."
"And it seems to me - and to many other Europeans - that this has been a wasted opportunity in that respect."
"It would have been perfectly feasible to have formed a common opinion because the interests of all Europeans are largely the same, apart from the natural entrepreneurial exploits which may sometimes be inspired by lust for Iraq's oil, for example."
"I think the Council - its President - should take advantage of this opportunity to analyse why, when faced with such dramatic and urgent circumstances, it was really not possible to formulate a rough outline which a truly united Europe - that united Europe you have mentioned so often, Mr President-in-Office - could have used to respond to the crisis situation we are all so worried and upset about."
"Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to reply to this very important debate."
"I would firstly confirm that our Presidency has fulfilled its obligations under Article J.5(4) in the Treaty of Maastricht in that we have kept other members of the Union fully informed of positions on which we have expressed a view and, where it has been possible to identify European Union positions, we have defended those positions in our representations."
"Secondly, I confirm that many actions have been taken by the Presidency to try to build a common position within the European Union."
"In my introductory address I outlined a number of initiatives which have been taken, including those by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, myself and many of our officials."
"That process has taken place over a period of time in the build-up to this week."
"In Panama last week the Foreign Secretary, in his capacity as President-in-Office, held a meeting with other Member States who were represented there."
"This informal meeting was to go over the ground where a common position could be identified."
"As it was not a formal Council, it was not possible to have formal conclusions but the Presidency, in representing the European Union in the various forums where the problem of Iraq has been discussed, has stuck to the text which was agreed at the end of that meeting, as one on which the Presidency could express a common view."
"If one had listened to this debate from outside Parliament, one might have the impression that there were huge divisions among European Union states on how to deal with Iraq."
"One might also have the impression that there are substantial divisions within this Parliament."
"But it is worth identifying the very large areas of common ground among the European Union states and in this Parliament, as is identified in the joint resolution which will come before Parliament at a later stage in the proceedings."
"That resolution covers the same ground which has been identified as important common ground by European Union members of the Council, such as the need for international law to be upheld."
"Otherwise the whole order in the international world comes crumbling down."
"That is a crucially important objective where we all agree."
"In that regard, Security Council Resolution 687 has not been adhered to and that is a clear breach of international law."
"Further, we agree that Saddam Hussein has very many dangerous weapons of a biological and chemical nature and that those dangerous weapons are a danger, not only to neighbouring states in the Middle East and to the international community, but also the people of Iraq."
"Any settlement must include unconditional and unrestricted access for the representatives of the United Nations through UNSCOM."
"And, importantly, every effort must be made to try to seek a diplomatic solution to the problems we face."
"That is a very large area of common ground that will be shared not only by the European Union members of the Council and the Members of this Parliament but will be seen outside by the peoples of Europe as a very important, reasonable position in trying to face up to the dangers in Iraq."
"I want to conclude by mentioning the other important common position, namely that we all recognize the crucially important role that Kofi Annan will play on behalf of us all in taking the backing of the Security Council to Baghdad to identify all those common positions and to say to Saddam Hussein that we want to negotiate a diplomatic solution."
"Nobody wants war but if a solution is to be achieved, there has to be movement by the Iraqi government to guarantee those important points which I have identified and which I know are included in the backing Kofi Annan has from the Security Council."
"I hope by the time the General Affairs Council meets next Monday we are able to see that real progress has been made."
"We will then be able to understand how important those common positions were in achieving what I hope will be a settlement."
"In accordance with paragraph 2 of Rule 37, I have received seven motions for resolution."
"Madam President, if the President-in-Office has a strong standpoint as the representative of the Council, why does he not publish it?"
"Everybody is asking for a strong standpoint but it has never been seen."
"Madam President, I asked Mr Henderson to make a statement on whether, as the Foreign Office officials reported in The Financial Times today are saying, that Britain is prepared to use nuclear weapons in Iraq."
"Would he give a confirmation on that?"
"Madam President, Mr Chairman of the Council, I would also like to know what concrete proposals the British Presidency has presented within the European Union to support the mission of Kofi Annan and not to undermine it."
"Madam President, there are a certain number of issues on which we would have liked the President-inOffice or the President of the Commission to speak."
"Why this conflict so suddenly now, when we are told that it is some three years since a son-in-law of the Iraqi president revealed the existence of these armaments?"
"Why did an American minister appear on American television with a box of sugar to say that a box of this kind would contain enough germs to destroy an entire town?"
"Does this mean that we must forever inspect every cupboard in Iraq?"
"What proof, what hint of proof do you have of the existence of the weapons which are said to have been discovered now?"
"These are the questions of interest and on which we would have liked some clarification both from the Commission and from the Council."
"I am very happy to try to deal with the four questions which have been raised."
"In relation to the last question raised by the Member opposite - why now? - the answer to that is because it is now seven years since the commitment was given by Saddam Hussein in 1991 that he would honour the terms of the UN resolution that concluded the military activity."
"UNSCOM have been trying to do their work."
"They have been obstructed."
"There is all this evidence that I referred to in my opening address, and other evidence, that there is a great danger that those large stockpiles of very serious weapons could ignite a problem. Therefore, action has to be taken."
"I hope that a diplomatic solution can be found to it."
"In relation to the point raised by Mr Kerr, the Foreign Secretary - in his British capacity - made a statement to the House of Commons ruling out any use of nuclear weapons in the context that was raised."
"I would have thought that Mr Kerr might have been aware of that."
"Regarding Mr Oostlander's very valid point, it would have been preferable to have had a text after the Panama meeting but because of the nature of the informal Council, it was not possible to have a binding text."
"That will be possible from Monday's GAC."
"I hope that the basis, which was understood and recognized at Panama can form some of the substance of what might be agreed on Monday."
"Events are moving very quickly."
"On Monday, many of us will be concentrating our minds on Kofi Annan's mission and how that has resulted."
"Regarding the question by Mr Wolf on which specific points arising out of Panama have been raised by the British Presidency at the United Nations, the answer is that all of the points which were covered are part of the British position in the United Nations."
"As I said in my winding up, I believe that we have honoured our obligations under the Maastricht Treaty in that regard."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to have your full attention."
"As you know, this morning we have a sitting and vote which is rather difficult to manage in that, as announced, we must break at midday precisely to welcome the President of the Republic of Portugal and then resume afterwards."
"It is all the more difficult since, as you are aware, we have a number of highly sensitive votes."
"So, in order to organize the situation as well as possible, I would like to take up the proposal again which I made this morning and which has been amended very timely by the considerations which some Members have forwarded to me."
"So, for this morning and this morning only, I repeat while we are waiting, we should reorganize things - I am sure everyone is aware that this is necessary and, furthermore, the suggestion made by a colleague this morning that the group chairmen and the members of the Bureau meet to review the whole situation is an excellent one. So before we reorganize things, I propose that this morning only, following the votes - I hope you are all listening - that those among you who believe in their heart and conscience that they do not need to participate in some of the votes should indicate this quite simply in the course of the day to the Clerk's Office."
"This would allow us to vote in a dignified way on this morning's very important reports."
"It goes without saying of course that if Members prefer to indicate their intention at each roll-call vote, they have every right to do so and I will respect this right."
"So again, the aim of my proposal is to allow us to work as effectively as possible this morning."
"Madam President, I can understand your desire to speed up the agenda, but my problem is that if we accept what you are proposing then it will be a set precedent for the future."
"I do think that the Bureau, in its wisdom, after hearing this confession this morning would wish to reconsider these matters."
"We would like an assurance that this would be for this session only and that we would have the right to return to the Bureau's previous guidelines."
"Secondly, we would like an assurance that the Bureau will not wait three months to review these matters but will review them within the next three days."
"That would be another assurance which I think would go a long way to pacify this House and allow us to proceed."
"Mr Falconer, I thought it was clear, but thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify once more."
"The proposal which I made to you, whilst I am aware that it is not perfect - although no system is perfect - applies only to this morning, and also, taking into account the exceptional situation this morning, requires us to interrupt our votes for half an hour for the reasons everyone is aware of."
"Madam President, you are absolutely right, there is no point pursuing the debate but there is a very easy solution to this."
"You can remind Members who feel that they cannot vote in favour of or against a particular proposal that we do have in fact a third button on our voting machine that they can press, namely the abstention button."
"It is very easy to reach out and press this button, it should not be difficult for any Member."
"No, Mr Corbett, abstention and the fact of not participating in the vote do not have the same significance."
"I think this is very clear, and everyone should be aware of this."
"Madam President, I wish to speak about the events of this morning, during which our emergency resolution on crime in Brussels was rejected."
"The fear of Members, employees and the public should be taken seriously."
"About 50 Members have signed for this motion to be dealt with in Parliament."
"It was rejected."
"I therefore ask the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to concern itself with this matter in order to evaluate how this situation is to be assessed."
"Thank you, Mr Rübig."
"I am happy to formally record your motion."
"(The President noted that there were no objections to her proposal)"
"Votes"
"Madam President, we submitted a request yesterday to vote on the Hautala report first."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have received a request to amend the order of votes on the Lange and Hautala reports."
"I will put it to the vote."
"The Parliament is sovereign."
"(Parliament gave its assent to changing the order of the votes)"
"Madam President, I wanted to inquire if the fact of having listened to the excellent speech by the President of Portugal can be taken into account when calculating allowances and how the Presidency intends to deal with this."
"For example, those who applauded will be registered as being present and those who did not applaud will not."
"Mr Dell'Alba, I am sorry, but we have exactly twenty minutes to hold some very important votes."
"Madam President, during the speech by the Portuguese President, telephones rang within the Hemicycle on at least two occasions."
"One of them even rang nine times."
"I think this is disgraceful. It is a lack of respect for this House to allow phones to ring while it is deliberating."
"Mr Valdivielso de Cué, you are absolutely right, to the extent that I can tell you that the Quaestors have already made a recommendation to all the Members."
"They heard what you said and will certainly repeat this recommendation even more firmly."
"Madam President, I apologize for wasting your time, but as one of the two telephones was mine, and I am therefore one of the guilty parties, I wish to apologize to the Chamber."
"I left the Chamber temporarily because I was called out urgently and I had left my bag here; I was not here when the telephone rang."
"Normally, when I go into Chamber, I switch it off, but this morning, unfortunately, I had not done so."
"I apologize again."
"Thank you, Mrs Marinucci."
"I think I can say your confession has been heard and you are pardoned."
"Madam President, you will not have expected otherwise than for me at this point to make the sharpest possible protest, not against you, dear Madame President, but against our President, because I regard this procedure as absolutely unacceptable."
"I shall explain why."
"I quote paragraph 2© of Rule 72: "" An amendment' , and that is what we are talking about here, ' shall be admissible if it seeks to amend a part of the text of a common position which was not included in - of differs in content from - the proposal submitted in first reading and which does not amount to a substantial change within the meaning of Rule 62.'"
"Allow me to refer to the fact that firstly, we are in fact at the second reading of the Framework Directive, but that there has never actually been a first reading, because at the time no framework directive was even on the table, That is the first thing."
"Secondly, if we had at the time introduced amendments to the implementing directive on spices, containing the stipulation that the irradiation should be analytically provable or that we would have to have standardized methods, then everybody would have been justified in thinking we were stupid. And they would all have said - I was also the rapporteur at the time, of course - that that Blottnitz woman had gone crazy, for at that time, eight and a half years ago - and many still think so today - these methods did not even exist."
"Consequently, we cannot demand them."
"It is absolutely necessary that we demand them today; it is a Framework Directive."
"We cannot allow irradiation to take place without then stipulating analytical test methods. Why do we need a label if we cannot check whether there has been irradiation or not?"
"This is extremely important."
"For spices it is not important, but it is important for the positive list which will be established after the Framework Directive is drawn up, and which will then apply."
"It can never again be rectified, whether they protest now or not."
"It is a question..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, we have heard what you say and everyone understands the problem we face since the Council took several years to produce the common position following our first reading."
"I think this is where the difficulties started and we are all well aware of it."
"I would like to hear the President of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, Mr Kenneth Collins, if he is in agreement of course."
"Madam President, I must say that one cannot but admire Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz's tenacity."
"Without going into the substance of the matter, the problem lies in Rules 72 and 62."
"The relevant part of Rule 62 states: ' where, through the passage of time or changes in circumstances, the nature of the problem with which the proposal is concerned substantially changes' , then we take a particular course of action."
"It was my judgement in committee that the nature of the problem had not changed between the first reading and now: we still have problems with radiation, we know what these problems potentially are, and we need a directive in order to control this."
"So the nature of the problem did not change."
"Then we come to Rule 72, which concerns amendments to the Council's common position."
"We are not allowed to take amendments that did not receive majorities at first reading unless these are new items that are raised by the Council in reaching its common position."
"It was my view in committee that, sad though it might have been for Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, the amendments she was seeking to table did not receive a majority at first reading, were not reintroduced, were not introduced freshly by the Council, were not relating to changed circumstances or changed problems since the beginning and, therefore, they were inadmissible."
"Mr President, I wish to draw the House's and your attention to one of the most wonderful sentences in the Rules of Procedure."
"The very end of Rule 72(2) states: ' The President's discretion to declare an amendment admissible or inadmissible cannot be questioned.'"
"I commend that sentence to the House and to you."
"Madam President, I do not wish to delay proceedings but having heard both speakers before me with regard to the problems associated with the amendments and so on, I propose to the House that we refer this report back to the committee until such time as they come up with a proper text that we can all accept."
"Mr Crowley, I have not received any request of this nature."
"(The President declared the two common positions approved (as amended) )"
"We support the initiative to increase checks on foodstuffs in production and at the place of destination."
"The focus here should be on consumer safety; but it is essential that these checks do not replace border controls."
"Border controls are important, as the BSE affair has shown amongst other things; they cannot be replaced by checks during production or at the destination."
"Recommendation for second reading (A4-0038/98) Hautala"
"We Swedish social democrats welcome the initiative to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles which the whole Auto-Oil package represents."
"The outcome is of the utmost importance both for human health and for the environment."
"Both the Commission's and the Council's decisions on limit values for the sulphur content of petrol and diesel are a long way from what is possible and desirable."
"It is therefore with disappointment that we note that Parliament's rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, has felt obliged to compromise with the values proposed by the Council."
"We would have preferred Parliament to stick to the decisions made at first reading."
"In addition, we think that the very strict proposals on aromatics, which are unchanged in spite of the compromise on sulphur content, are very misleading."
"We consider the limit values for sulphur to be much more important and fear that Parliament's decision gives the wrong signal to the oil industry. This is not the right priority when considering the question of health and the environment."
"I have studied in detail the report by Mrs Heidi Hautala."
"I would congratulate her on the broad scope of her work."
"However, I am inclined to distance myself from certain clauses which I consider to be a little maximalist, despite the fact that I consider the protection of the environment to be very important."
"And so I do not agree with the examples given by the rapporteur since the cost borne by industry would be much too great compared with the environmental benefit gained."
"I am convinced that there are other solutions."
"So what we must do is keep the proposals made by the Auto-Oil programme, as they set out a restrictive framework for the short term."
"What is most important is to implement them."
"We must take into account the impact of these measures on the oil industry, which, although likely to adapt to the initial requirements, could run into difficulties if Parliament toughened the provisions of the programme."
"It is not a question, as far as I am concerned, of accepting the use of employment as blackmail, but only of confirming a desire to preserve industrial competitiveness in a sector which experiences fierce global competition."
"I believe we must take into account three factors: cost, effectiveness and competitiveness, and it would be best to apply these within a fixed time frame."
"Furthermore, we must not lose sight of the fact that the result depends greatly on the number of cars on Europe's roads, and that if extra expenditure is to be made, the priority would be to increase the proportion of newer cars on the road."
"Regrettably I cannot support all the recommendations on this report because of the cost implications for Irish consumers."
"The original Commission proposal supported by the Council was acceptable but, as amended by this report, would increase the costs by a factor of six."
"I should also point out that Ireland is already operating well within current target limits, although I am certain we will still want to improve upon this provided the financial burden is not too heavy."
"I fail to understand the vote from one of the southern parts of the Union, since nobody put forward a single line of reasoning in support of this negative position during last night's debate."
"That position was notable for its absence."
"Why?"
"My vote agrees with the opinions expressed yesterday."
"On the request of the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission adopted the Auto-Oil programme to improve air quality by reducing pollution from road traffic in the years to come."
"With this in mind, the Commission presented two directives which aim to reduce car emissions and to improve the quality of fuels."
"At first reading, the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments which aim to strengthen the standards proposed by the Commission."
"The Council retained some of these but did not go so far as to go back to the restrictive clauses demanded by the European Parliament for 2005."
"At the moment we are at second reading and trying to work out an agreement on the common position of the Council."
"The Committee on the Environment, which thinks that the Council's progress is still not sufficient, has repeated almost all of the amendments adopted at first reading by the European Parliament."
"I am in favour of strengthening the measures to reduce pollution and improve air quality, but I think that some of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment do not sufficiently take into account economic and social factors."
"The application of these amendments runs the risk of having a high cost and bringing with it job losses."
"In my opinion, the Council's common position represents a fair balance between the need for better protection of the environment and safeguarding jobs; measures which are overly restrictive and expensive risk compromising this."
"I also propose that measures are taken to speed up the replacement of the oldest cars and to increase research, notably on engine design, engine improvement and maintenance and the use of new fuels."
"It would, of course, have been best for the environment and for the inhabitants of the EU countries and the world if the European Parliament's proposals at first reading had been adopted."
"Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission yielded to pressure from the oil industry and did not accept these necessary requirements."
"At second reading, the rapporteur has also been forced to modify a number of the requirements, particularly under pressure from the conservative party groups in the European Parliament, in order to be able to achieve the required majority in the House."
"Therefore, the proposal is not absolutely ideal from our point of view, but it is still quite acceptable."
"Today's vote clearly showed that the compromise has a lot of support in the European Parliament."
"Hopefully the outcome will also encourage the Council and the Commission to abandon their opposition to the European Parliament's proposals."
"We assume that in the Council of Ministers the Swedish government will support and vote for the European Parliament's demands."
"The improvement in the quality of petrol will have immediate and major effects on the environment."
"Mrs Hautala's proposals will reduce pollution from cars by more than 20 %."
"We cannot accept what large oil companies say when they try to make their employees believe that they will close refineries because our organizations are exacting ambitious standards."
"The assessments these companies have carried out are clearly overvalued."
"All the studies and ministers concerned considerably reduce the inferred costs."
"But one thing is certain: the large companies have made substantial profits which enable them to make investments to modernize refineries, which at times were left to become more or less obsolete, in response to environmental needs."
"They also know well that, from now on, the global petrol market will not be able to escape these developments - they are already underway in the United States."
"All too often our fellow citizens see Europe as being too distant or too restrictive."
"Today, in dealing with a subject of the future which affects all our daily lives, Europe can bear the hope of the people, the well-being and the progress of the majority."
"We must vote for the Lange and Hautala reports."
"In this way the European Parliament will mark its place in history."
"This matter involves the same political situation as in the question of emissions from motor vehicles. The Commission is putting on the brakes while Parliament wants to press on towards more long-term sustainable environmental requirements for petrol and diesel fuels."
"The same situation also applies to industry. When requirements have been tightened for reduced emissions and additives, such as lead in petrol, these have quickly been met by the petrol and oil industry."
"The Commission's proposal is not sufficiently far-reaching and needs to be strengthened."
"We need better quality standards for fuels, tough requirements for urban traffic and different tax rates which encourage the use of electric cars and new, environmentally friendly fuels like ethanol."
"As Mr Lange's report stated, the limit values and times must be obligatory for the year 2000 and 2005, and exceptions should be very strict."
"Requirements for limit values should be as tough as possible."
"For sulphur it should be 30 mg/kg for both petrol and diesel."
"I consider the rapporteur's proposal to be realistic and entirely feasible, which is why it could have great significance for environmental policy."
"French and European public opinion is very sensitive to the effects on health of pollutant emissions from cars."
"In order to reduce this pollution, we must both improve the technique of engines and strengthen the standards set for fuel."
"A real reduction in the contents of sulphur and aromatic compounds permitted must be encouraged through the introduction of oxygenated compounds which come amongst other things from biofuels."
"The addition of biofuels enables immediate reduction in pollution thanks to their zero sulphur compound content and their capacity to improve combustion."
"The production of renewable raw materials destined for the production of biofuels is providing an important channel of diversification for the agricultural sector, thus facilitating the use of rural areas."
"For these reasons I have voted, like most of my colleagues, in favour of strengthening the standards set for fuels, thus allowing the development of biofuels, on the condition, of course, that the European Union accepts that the Member States can adapt their indirect taxation in order to promote cleaner energy."
"If we are to combat air pollution from cars, we must act both on the technical standards for vehicles and on the composition of fuels."
"Putting vehicles into service which meet the new technical standards will only have staggered effects in the medium term, and means the progressive renewal of all vehicles on the road in the Member States of the European Union."
"However, the use of fuels which meet standards which are more respectful of the environment will have an immediate effect."
"In this light, a real reduction in the levels of sulphur and aromatic compounds - notably benzene - allowed in relation to the levels currently recorded must come top of the research list."
"The introduction of oxygen from fossils or plants should also be encouraged, given its positive and immediate effect on air quality."
"As a source of renewable energy, biofuels or oxygenated compounds from plants - ester from vegetable oil incorporated in diesel oil, or ethanol derivative incorporated in petrol - can provide a suitable response to the problems of pollution immediately, particularly in sensitive urban areas, whilst limiting the greenhouse effect whose effects were highlighted at the Kyoto conference in December 1997."
"Finally, the agricultural sector can benefit from this important channel of diversification by producing renewable raw materials for the production of biofuels, and this could contribute to preserving an important use for rural areas."
"The production of renewable raw materials should be considered as an economically viable activity for agriculture and can contribute to changing the negative image some people may have of agricultural activities in terms of respect for the environment."
"The development of biofuels will respond to the needs of the cities, whilst also favouring the expansion of agriculture which is more respectful of the environment."
"Madam President, it is essential to have tough targets for reductions in car emission limits."
"Rapid and real progress must be made to protect the environment."
"Whilst the modern car is 40 times cleaner than its equivalent in the 1980s, air quality will be greatly enhanced by the implementation of the proposals before the House."
"Improvements to car standards and cleaner fuels are a necessity."
"Along with my two colleagues from Northern Ireland, I recently brought a representative of a company in Northern Ireland to meet Commission officials about a new product which can significantly reduce emission levels now, with the additional benefit of reducing overall fuel consumption."
"This shows the concern in Northern Ireland to ensure action is taken on this issue as quickly as possible."
"I welcome the initiative of those in my constituency who are proactively working on developing a product to meet the necessary stringent demands of European legislation."
"The report by Mr Lange is interesting from more than one point of view."
"This report will really shed light on the technical progress of the European car industry, especially in the area of engine output."
"These developments have undeniably had an impact on the reduction of harmful emissions, both for diesel and internal combustion engines."
"Our desire to legislate in this area is legitimate."
"However, we should be careful to avoid the pitfall of wanting to do too much."
"As regards air quality and emissions from new vehicles, most of our work is done."
"There is the risk of eventually heading towards a reduction in air quality by wishing to impose standards for emissions which are too severe."
"An increase in these standards would lead to a rise in the costs borne by the consumer. This, in turn, would decrease the chances of the renewal of cars on the roads today, which are already too old throughout the world."
"This additional ageing would have a negative impact on the environment and would oppose the fixed objectives which we all agree on."
"So when we have set new standards, we must reach them before proposing more."
"We must also devise a financial plan of action to increase the proportion of younger cars on the roads throughout Europe: this would benefit both employment and the environment."
"These two reports set out the European Parliament's view of the Auto-Oil programme drawn up by industry and the Commission."
"The point of this programme is to determine the best possible fuel mixture together with secondary technical measures in the manufacture and maintenance of car engines in order to maintain clear air."
"In the EU at this time, there are about 200 million cars of all different varieties."
"They represent an enormous burden on the environment, now as well as in the future, and they reveal the great economic concerns which have arisen with the vehicles."
"There has therefore been intensive lobbying activity relating to Mr Lange's reports, particularly by the car industry and the fuel producers."
"In my opinion, these reports represent no acceptable compromise between environmental policy and economic interests."
"Mr Lange rightly emphasizes the need for coherent exhaust gas legislation, Euro-3, with the deadline of 2000 for the first stage, A, and 2005 for the second stage, B. Industry is said to be complaining about the excessively high costs of conversion to new higher values; not included in these are of course the entire economic costs and the harmful emissions which are bad for the health of the people."
"I am also convinced that high environmental standards present technical and economic challenges to industry."
"Since 8 % of the overall motor vehicle fleet is renewed every year it is of course going to take years before the innovations to engines and exhaust systems take full effect: hence the necessity for an immediate improvement in fuel quality which has a direct effect on the whole stock of motor vehicles."
"As for the specific problems of the on board diagnostic systems, there is a concern that such systems could be used by the vehicle manufacturers to restrict, by means of secret codes, the maintenance and repair of cars to those who have access to these codes."
"This would seriously restrict the maintenance and repair market, which have called, for instance, service organizations like those of the Luxembourg Automobile Club into action."
"Here too the European Parliament wants standardized and free access to the OBD systems, which I fully support."
"This report shows a strong political opinion in favour of tightening emissions from new cars."
"Here the Commission represents the old world which supports the vehicle and oil industries, while Parliament is making environmental and sustainable demands of the companies and industrial products of the future."
"Earlier requirements on industry, such as in the introduction of catalytic converters, clearly showed that if the requirements are clear, industry adapts to the reality and converts its production to meet the requirements."
"That is also going to be the case for emission requirements for new vehicles."
"It is therefore very important that the requirements are clearly given in figures and years."
"In this case, demands for binding legislation are justified."
"Financial means of control, such as tax concessions to support the production of vehicles with low emissions, are positive, and controls and monitoring in the Member States are necessary for the regulations to have their desired effect."
"This is one of the areas of environmental policy in which EU decisions could have a major impact."
"This is a welcome report which underscores our endeavours to reduce pollution."
"Reducing environmental destruction is one of the priorities of the British Presidency and so it is timely that we are discussing this report now."
"In Parliament there is a broad consensus, representative of the views of the public, that damage to the environment caused by vehicle emissions must be severely reduced."
"The motor industry themselves accept that there must be improvement and it is a welcome sign that their arguments have moved on to the detail of time scales for reducing pollution."
"The Union should be as proactive as possible in encouraging the development of means by which pollution by emissions can be reduced."
"One way of doing this would be to make the Commission more user-friendly towards organizations and individuals who feel that they can contribute to the battle against pollution."
"I have recently been involved in assisting a Northern Ireland organization, which is trying to develop a European market for an emission-reducing additive, in finding its way around the maze of Commission bureaucracy."
"The additive is widely used elsewhere and has recently been positively assessed by experts at Queen's University, Belfast."
"We are well aware that the Commission cannot approve or endorse any individual products but I believe that means should be sought whereby it can be made easier for those working in this field to have their products assessed with a minimum of bureaucracy."
"Recommendation for second reading (A4-0038/98) Hautala and (A4-0043/98) Lange"
"These two reports are absolutely inextricable since there is a close technical connection between engines and fuel and this explains my joint explanation of vote."
"How could we build vehicles with a ""clean' engine which would have to operate using pollutant fuel?"
"I cannot imagine it."
"The European Parliament must be consistent and strengthen its vote from first reading."
"It is essential that fuels are ""depolluted' and that the sulphur content is reduced."
"We must go further than the Council's common position and demand mandatory, not indicative limits for emissions in 2005."
"This is what will improve air quality."
"In line with this, we must call for a similar effort from car manufacturers."
"From the year 2000, all cars must be equipped with on board diagnostic systems, whilst manufacturers must also monitor the conformity of services."
"These are heavy demands and we are aware of the efforts required, but we have waited for too long. After all, this affects the future of our planet and our children!"
"I am in favour of the two reports by Mrs Hautala and Mr Lange as they represent a coherent and ambitious response to the problem of car pollution."
"It is a matter of great urgency that we combat the greenhouse effect and atmospheric pollution in our towns."
"It affects our planet and the health and quality of life of millions of Europeans."
"Our developed societies must put into use all their scientific and technological know-how and make available the necessary financial means in the name of this cause."
"At first reading, Parliament rightly indicated its intention to toughen standards by the year 2000, both for petrol and for exhaust gas emissions, along with its commitment to establishing a restrictive framework for 2005."
"This position of our House enabled the Council to improve the Commission's initial text."
"But the technical situation and social and environmental urgency enable us to go further; it is up the European Parliament to go one step further within the framework of codecision."
"As all too often is the case, a certain number of voices were raised in the name of defending employment and competitiveness against standards going as far as possible."
"But in this case, these arguments have no foundation."
"Looking first at the car industry, which is of great importance for employment and our economies, technological innovation is imperative and it also represents an opportunity."
"Moreover, we must pay tribute to the efforts and the results which have been achieved for some time now by the manufacturers."
"They know that environmental quality will be a decisive stake, as much in terms of world competition as in terms of the expectations of buyers."
"The car industry in Europe is faced with the relative saturation of the European market."
"So it needs the rate of renewal of the cars on the road to accelerate."
"But this can only really be justified by a significant technological change of course towards cleaner and safer cars."
"The demanding and restrictive standards for new vehicles proposed for 2005 in the Lange report provide a definite form for this movement and allow research measures to be implemented straight away - essential developments given full knowledge of the facts."
"The clarity of the framework and of the objectives acts as a guarantee for manufacturers."
"European institutions must give greater attention to the pollution caused by the number of old cars on the road."
"So in this sense, a meaningful improvement in petrol quality is an important point, and the proposals in the report by Mrs Hautala alone would bring about a reduction of over 20 % in car pollution."
"Improvements in petrol affect both new and old vehicles."
"But I believe that the European Union should also look into the support which the Member States could provide to help get rid of old vehicles on the road which are severe pollutants."
"Owners of these dilapidated vehicles often only have a modest income, so it is essential to find effective solutions which do not penalize them, such as a scrap subsidy."
"I would genuinely like to see the European Parliament committing itself to promoting this type of proposal."
"During the conciliation which could take place following the vote, we should also closely examine the two questions of the durability of the standards imposed and monitoring in use, taking into account the prospect of an accelerated renewal of cars."
"The new procedures we have retained will also help create jobs in sectors such as chemistry, catalysis, etcetera."
"This phenomenon has already been observed with the introduction of standards for lead-free petrol and the catalytic converter."
"I am in favour of the Lange report."
"With increasing numbers of cars in Europe and increasing air pollution, the reduction of exhaust gases is quite definitely in the interest of consumers."
"Both reports seek to address two aspects of this complex problem: fuel quality and the reduction of exhaust gases."
"The improvement of fuel is rejected by the oil industry on the grounds of cost."
"Against this it must be said that a few years ago the industry resisted the catalytic converter, but these are to be found in all new cars."
"The reduction of exhaust gases, however, is also significantly influenced by the technological equipment in the vehicles."
"In this, the on board diagnostic systems (OBD) will play an important role by checking the exhaust emissions and drawing the owner's attention to defects."
"It cannot be sufficient to buy years of freedom from environmental worries by purchasing a new car with a catalytic converter."
"The OBD systems will require greater discipline on the part of the consumer, who must keep his vehicle constantly in tiptop condition."
"If the OBD discovers a defect in the exhaust system, the fault must be removed."
"As a countermove the marketing of this technological progress must be so regulated that no hidden monopolies can be created which harm the consumer. We must prevent the encoding of diagnostic systems precluding independent workshops from carrying out maintenance and repairs."
"In addition, these systems must permit the incorporation of parts which are not made by the car manufacturer but which meet their quality standards."
"This will guarantee that the consumer will have the choice of having his vehicle maintained at a favourable price and to a high standard in the interests of the environment."
"Atmospheric pollution has become a political issue quite simply because cities and the large European metropolises have experienced or are currently experiencing this type of problem."
"Now the most visible enemy and the one which everyone points the finger at immediately is, of course, the car, forgetting in that instant factory fumes, aeroplane discharges and so on."
"I do not want to deny the problem - it is a real one - and Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala were right to take a firm line regarding the car and oil industries, both at first and second reading."
"Car manufacturers and oil magnates were quick to draw our attention to the effects which these decisions could have on employment."
"But they must also understand that in responding to the expectations of public opinion on pollution, they will benefit from a better image and this could lead to them gaining new sectors of the market."
"This is why we will defend the emission limits proposed by Mr Lange."
"This is why we will also support the standards proposed by Mrs Hautala."
"Taking the example of diesel, it is clear that its commercial success in certain countries in the Union condemns it to reducing its pollution levels simply in order to preserve its image and its sales."
"For example, the injection technique ought to resolve this type of problem."
"It has also been proven that diesel oil has an important role to play in reducing exhaust emissions from diesel engines."
"Car manufacturers who were not much in favour at the start have decided to make considerable efforts to respect emission standards."
"It is true that there is still some disagreement particularly concerning durability: it is unrealistic, even irresponsible, to raise the durability of vehicles from 80 000 to 160 000 km, and I would like to make clear my formal opposition to this."
"This represents a much too stringent requirement on top of the implementation of the necessary limits and will generate additional costs."
"Other contentious points include on board diagnostics and service monitoring."
"I think it may be possible to resolve this type of issue in the Conciliation Committee."
"I am aware that oil magnates are very unhappy with last week's unanimous vote from the Committee on the Environment last week."
"Clearly this sector is suffering from an overcapacity for refining and the ageing of its production equipment."
"But this difficult situation is not at all due to environmental standards."
"I have to say that the use of employment as blackmail has not succeeded, simply because Parliamentary representatives, just like public opinion, are highly mobilized."
"We must not wave the red rag on this issue, but should first inform opinion about the consequences of the measures we are recommending would have, and especially on the following subject: in people's minds for some time now as well as in the press, even diesel causes pollution which causes asthma or causes cancer."
"This was true of old diesel, but, with these new measures, diesel will be less polluting than lead-free petrol, thus turning the whole situation on its head."
"Lastly, and I will end here, the key point which Parliament must deal with is the issue of increasing the proportion of newer cars on our roads."
"This is the most effective way of greatly reducing the degree of pollution in Europe."
"Estimates indicate that 20 % of the cars on the road cause around 80 % of the pollution."
"Any measure aimed at speeding up the process of renewal would have an immediate effect."
"What we must do is think of both the original measures and of new ones which have not been one of the long line of errors made in France."
"It is not a question of dressing up a way to facilitate the purchase of a new car, but a way of replacing an old one, all of which would be financed at national and European level."
"This will be the subject of future discussions."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament, which always tends to go further than the other European institutions, is going too far this time with the measures aiming to reduce road traffic pollution."
"In their reports, both Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala call for more restrictive clauses for the protection of the environment."
"But my difficulty is when Parliament's Committee on the Environment goes further, much further than the common position of the Council."
"Of course I, too, am convinced that the critical thing for Europe is to find a balance between the various proposals for cleaning up the air and their real impact on the environment, and with this in mind, I have to say that the European oil industry has done a great deal to improve air quality up to now."
"But we must recognize that in order to reach the fixed objectives for cleaning up the air, the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment is proposing standards which are certainly amongst the most ambitious in the world."
"But if we consider the costs of the different proposals, ECU 11.5 billion for the Commission, ECU 20 billion for the Council and ECU 60 billion for the European Parliament, I think that in the current state of affairs, it would be unreasonable to go beyond the measures in the Council's common position."
"I agree on supporting the Commission's second Auto-Oil programme, which must serve as a basis for establishing limits for fuel emissions for the year 2000. However, I think that car drivers in most European countries already do enough via the high rates of taxation on using their vehicles, and we must stop once and for all increasing taxes or constantly inventing claimed new ecological costs for cars."
"This Parliament has always responded very sensitively to the problems of climate change and the need to limit emissions and achieve healthier air for the people of Europe."
"Nevertheless, when it comes to taking concrete measures, the European Union is less resolute."
"It is not easy for the Members of this House to adopt a position."
"The situation we see is complex and not reassuring."
"All our cities, both large and small, are full of traffic jams."
"On some days, certain European cities exceed all the health safety limits."
"On the other hand, fuel quality is essential for engine performance and to reduce vehicle emissions."
"In Parliament we have always defended the view that economic development and the protection of the environment are not two opposing objectives, but are complementary."
"However, the automobile and refinery sectors seem to do little to help achieve these objectives."
"We must demand the greatest possible technical effort in order to protect the health of our citizens."
"Otherwise, there will be a blatant clash of citizens' interests."
"Faced with this situation, the governments have reached a difficult common position, showing that changes are not easy at the moment, as Mr Lange has confirmed."
"The European Parliament does not have many alternatives left."
"All we can do is hope that the Council is on the right track on this occasion and that it will look on this common position as a temporary stage on the way towards stricter measures."
"Recommendation for second reading (A4-0042/98) Bloch von Blottnitz"
"Madam President, I must say that today we have done a great disservice to the cause of consumer protection."
"It is really incredible what has happened in this House."
"I would just like to read something which a section of the House has rejected."
"Afterwards, I do not know how we will be able to take part in an honest election campaign in which we keep saying: Europe is working on behalf of consumers."
"I would just like to tell you what has been deleted. The treatment of goods with ionizing rays, we have said, must meet completely the requirements of human health."
"Their use must be absolutely safe in terms of health and may not act as a replacement for health and hygiene measures or for good manufacturing or agricultural methods."
"That is surely the minimum and the most logical requirement."
"We have not even stated in the document that there must be no loss of nutritional value or loss of vitamins."
"It is already bad enough that this happens."
"But we have demanded the simplest solution and it was not accepted."
"Nor has it been accepted that analytical control procedures must be carried out."
"I wonder, why are we bothering to insist on compulsory marking?"
"This is utterly monstrous; what are we supposed to tell our people."
"It is not even true to say that the Standing Committee on Food meets in public; it meets far more undemocratically behind closed doors."
"I ask you: what are they up to?"
"We always say that we want the best, and most of all we want to protect health."
"We spend huge amounts of money on better health provision and then we make mistakes concerning the most basic matters!"
"For a start, legalistic nitpicking drives normal motions into secondary importance, in other words, they become inadmissible, and this then leads to the most logical proposals being rejected."
"So I really do not understand the world."
"I cannot tell you how embarrassing that is or how we are going to go into a public election campaign."
"They will all keep saying: Europe makes everything worse, it makes our food worse, etcetera."
"Madam President, although I am of the opinion that the irradiation of food is to be avoided in principle, I have made up my mind to vote for the Bloch von Bottnitz' report, so that in the Single Market there can be better information, better monitoring and thus better protection of the health of consumers."
"I am extremely sorry that not all colleagues have followed this path and that the required majority has not been achieved."
"I am afraid that we have thereby done a great disservice to the consumers of Europe."
"I am in favour of the very restrictive conclusions of this report, which will allow the irradiation of foods exclusively as a method of preservation for spices."
"In Luxembourg, the irradiation of food with the aim of preservation is actually forbidden."
"In only three countries - Belgium, the Netherlands and France - may irradiated foods be sold."
"Whereas the EP, since it was first concerned with this problem, that is, since 1987, has been determined to gradually ban completely the irradiation of foods, the Commission has tried to regulate jointly this kind of preservation."
"A compromise has thus become an opening to more foods being allowed for irradiation."
"For the present common position, the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has drawn the abovementioned conclusions, which are similar to the Swedish position in the Council; consequently, food other than spices cannot, in principle, be irradiated."
"I share this view, which I already put forward in this House in October 1989 and in December 1993."
"I am deeply concerned about the plan contained in the common position of the Council and the Commission to issue both a framework directive and an implementing directive containing a positive list which is gradually being extended - it currently includes only the aforementioned aromatic herbs and spices."
"In this way, under the guise of regulating something positively, we are simultaneously allowing for the possibility of extending radiation to as many foods as possible."
"The excuse that no regulation is worse than a minimum regulation is unacceptable, for the regulation we have before us will gradually lead all the EU countries to tolerate irradiated foods on their markets."
"The report by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz accepts a limited use of irradiation for certain foodstuffs, including dried herbs and certain spices, with a suggestion of a further increase in products."
"It is appropriate that it is stressed that irradiation cannot be used as a substitute for good, hygienic handling of products, but irradiation of foodstuffs in general cannot be accepted."
"To start with, I am against treating foods and food ingredients with ionizing radiation."
"So it is good that Parliament's requirements for approval are so stringent that the positive list will be limited to spices and roots where no other method of preservation is available."
"We must ensure that fresh foods are preferred and so restrict irradiation to the absolute minimum."
"Because the European Parliament takes the same sceptical approach to ionising radiation, I am in favour of Parliament being given the authority to assess any extension of the positive list of foods which may be irradiated."
"It should also be possible for individual Member States to impose tighter rules."
"I cannot support the Committee on the Environment's amendment to approve an analytical method of control only."
"There are a number of different methods available and it is essential that the method used depends on what is to be examined."
"On the other hand, it would be beneficial to limit as far as possible the number of different methods of irradiation."
"This would make controls easier."
"Finally, I would like to emphasize that the marking of the foods irradiated must be transparent."
"If we cannot ban irradiation completely, we can at least ensure consumers have a proper opportunity of selecting these products."
"The environment has gradually taken on an increasing importance in the construction of the European Union."
"Regulation (EEC) 1210/90, which is to be amended through this report, had allowed us, in this respect, to comply with the initiative taken in 1989 by Jacques Delors to create a European Environment Agency."
"Today's report must present us with the opportunity to debate what lies at the root of all changes in European legislation on the environment, that is, the collection and distribution of objective and accurate information gathered in all the countries of the Union."
"Established in 1995, the EEA has until now undertaken valuable work concerning the environmental situation in the countries of the Union in terms of the collection and distribution of objective data and perfecting techniques to aid forecasting and prevention."
"I am therefore taking the opportunity that this report has presented to congratulate the Agency on its progress in fulfilling its duties."
"The Agency has notably drawn up reports on problems such as climate change and taxes on the environment, and has established several networks to collect and distribute information in this field."
"But the Agency cannot work alone!"
"As the rapporteur points out, the Agency has still changes to make and it must move towards greater cooperation with all of the Community institutions, in particular the European Parliament. This would improve the transparency of information among the different countries of the Union, thereby showing the Agency to be a true instrument in helping to make political decisions in this area."
"Moreover, in future, the Commission should systematically ask the Agency for reports before implementing even minor new Community policies."
"In this sense, I agree with my colleague, Mr Collins, who, wondering why there is no mention in the Commission's report of the importance of Parliament's role in the legislative process, asks that the obligation to report its results to Parliament be included in the draft revision."
"The European Environment Agency must also, within the framework of its duties, take into account other aspects such as forests, waste products and chemical products on the one hand, and on the other, the Union's future time scales, particularly its enlargement and the environmental problems that this will undoubtedly entail."
"Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that while some people are discussing the dismantling of environmental standards or clauses on the planet under the draft Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), to the benefit of multinational companies, I, on the contrary, am defending the enhancement of environmental cooperation with third countries."
"I welcome discussion on this report."
"Obviously the Committee agrees with the Commission assessment that it would be unrealistic to allocate the European Environmental Agency any major new tasks at the moment."
"The Commission is nonetheless proposing to extend the scope of the Agency's activities with a view to establishing a European Environment Information Centre."
"It is also important that greater cooperation is achieved between the Agency and Member States and of course applicant states."
"I would hope that there will be a positive response to the rapporteur's proposal for a closer working relationship between the Agency and the Commission and also for the establishment of a data register by the Agency which would include legislation and information to improve the enforcement of EU environmental policy including a cost/benefit analysis."
"Finally it is important that the Agency's multi-annual work programme should be complemented by a multi-annual budget in order to enable the Agency to plan its work more effectively."
"Madam President, I have asked to speak on a point of order, as follows: yesterday, at exactly this point of the proceedings, I submitted an explanation of vote in writing, specifically on the Blak report."
"Madam President, today, with great surprise, I saw in the Minutes that there is no mention of my written statement."
"As I consider that explanation of vote to be particularly important, I ask you to look into the matter."
"We will indeed check that, Mr Papakyriazis, and if, as you say, this was not done, we will insert your explanation of vote in writing."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Mr President, before the debate starts I need to put on record a rather banal matter, namely that I was not able to vote at all this morning - and the new Rules presumably apply - the reason being that my plane was due to leave at 7.55 a.m. from London Airport and, in the event, it left at 10.30 a.m., so I arrived just as the vote was finishing."
"But I feel sure that you, Sir, as a distinguished member of the Bureau, having taken a most wise decision, will find it possible to adjust the situation to meet cases like mine, and that is why I rather expanded on the position."
"Thank you, Mr Moorhouse."
"You may rest assured that the Bureau has taken note of what you say and that it will take the necessary steps to ensure that you do not suffer any disadvantage."
"Nigeria and Burma - UN Human Rights Commission"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"B4-0012/99 - O-0009/98 and B4-0013/98 - O-0010/98, by Mrs Maij-Weggen and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to the Council and the Commission, on the EU's attitude to Nigeria; -B4-0020/98 - O-0028/98 and B4-0122/98 - O-0029/98, by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, to the Council and to the Commission, on the EU's attitude to Nigeria; -B4-0123/98 - O-0030/98 and B4-0124/98 - O-0031/98, by Mr Müller and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the European Union's attitude to Nigeria; -B4-0127/98 - O-0035/98 by Mr Carnero González and Mr Pettinari, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, to the Council, on relations between the European Union and Nigeria; -B4-0128/98 - O-0036/98 and B4-0129/98 - O-0037/98, by Mr Macartney and Mr Hory, to the Council and to the Commission, on the European Union's attitude to Nigeria; -B4-0134/98 - O-0042/98 and B4-0135/98 - O-0043/98, by Mr Andrews and Mr Girão Pereira, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, to the Council and to the Commission, on the European Union's attitude to Nigeria; -B4-0137/98 - O-0046/98 and B4-0169/98 - O-0051/98, by Mrs Kinnock and Mr Vecchi, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Council and to the Commission, on the situation in Nigeria; -B4-0014/98 - O-0011/98 and B4-0015/98 - O-0012/98 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to the Council and to the Commission, on human rights violations in Burma; -B4-0018/98 - O-0026/98 and B4-0019/98 - O-0027/98, by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, to the Council and to the Commission, on human rights violations in Burma; -B4-0126/98 - O-0034/98 by Mr Pettinari and Mr Vinci, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, to the Council, on relations between the European Union and Burma; -B4-0131/98 - O-0039/98 by Mr Dupuis, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, to the Commission, on human rights violations in Burma; -B4-0133/98 - O-0041/98 by Mr Telkämper and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, to the Commission, on human rights violations in Burma; -B4-0136/98 - O-0045/98 and B4-0141/98 - O-0050/98, by Mrs Kinnock and Mr Vecchi, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Council and to the Commission, on the situation in Burma; -B4-0139/98 - O-0048/98 by Mrs van Bladel, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, to the Council, on the human rights situation in Burma; -B4-0011/98 - O-0182/98 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, to the Council, on the EU position at the 54th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva; -B4-0125/98 - O-0033/98 by Mr Carnero González and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, to the Council, on the United Nations Human Rights Commission; -B4-0130/98 - O-0038/98 by Mr Dupuis, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, to the Council, on the EU's position at the 54th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva; -B4-0132/98 - O-0040/98 by Mrs Aglietta and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, to the Council, on the EU's position at the 54th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva; -B4-0138/98 - O-0047/98 by Mrs van Bladel, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, to the Council, on the 54th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission; -B4-0140/98 - O-0049/98 by Mr Barros Moura, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Council, on the EU's position at the 54th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva."
"Mr President, with increasing frequency the European Union is acting in a divided manner towards the outside world in crucial foreign policy issues."
"This is unfortunate."
"We saw it in the Iraq affair which was discussed at length here this morning, and we are seeing it again in a number of human rights issues. Again, this is unfortunate."
"Last year, during the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights we saw a terrible display of 15 EU nations towards China."
"Whilst the Netherlands as President rightly tried to get European support for a critical stance, four EU countries pulled out."
"It was a sad spectacle of disagreement and Europe was exposed."
"This is why we are making an urgent plea to the United Kingdom to be very active during the coming weeks, so that the ranks of EU Member States will be united in Geneva in March, and so that serious violations of human rights will not be sacrificed to the golden calf of economic interests."
"We wish to draw particular attention to two countries, Nigeria and Burma."
"On the subject of Nigeria, the elected President has been overthrown and put into prison during a military coup."
"It was followed by massive intimidations and a great deal of violence during which the supporters of Abiola, relevant politicians, soldiers, officials and other citizens were tried in often secret tribunals and killed, or treated so badly in prison that they died subsequently."
"We all know the story of Ken Saro-Wiwa, and we also know that Adua died in similar circumstances."
"Now there is another general standing in front of a secret tribunal, and we all know how that will end."
"Meanwhile, the rulers get rich at the expense of the ordinary people, and the number of people living in absolute poverty in Nigeria has increased from 35 to 44 million."
"50 million people are illiterate, and 70 million are without drinking water."
"The average life expectancy has fallen from 54 to 47."
"Mr President, we believe that Nigeria needs a firm approach, and in spite of all earlier statements we are asking that we should steer towards an economic boycott."
"This is the wish of our group - and we are no radical left wingers - and is the wish of a large section of this Parliament."
"As regards Burma, Mr President, there, too, a President who was elected by 80 % of the population was removed by military force."
"There, the opposition was also imprisoned and killed."
"There, parts of the population are also terrorized and - worse still - sections of minorities are used for slave labour."
"Mr President, the United States have introduced an investment ban."
"Dutch companies, such as Heineken, have also withdrawn, but we are seeing, to our annoyance, that other firms, such as Total, are establishing themselves in Nigeria to fill a gap in the market."
"Here, too, we are asking for tough action, and as far as we are concerned for an economic boycott, and most definitely an investment ban."
"Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that we believe that the European Union should speak with one voice on human rights issues."
"We believe that the Presidency should do its utmost to get the Member States into one line."
"We also believe that those countries that do not wish to cooperate should be seriously called to account on this."
"We do not wish to see a repeat of last year in the next session in Geneva, and we hope that the British Presidency will manage to see to it there is one line, and to see to it that there is tough action, especially as far as the two countries mentioned earlier are concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has far too often been accused, not entirely wrongly, of being strong with the weak and weak with the strong, in other words, of energetically pointing out the violations of human rights in countries of little geopolitical significance and of closing its eyes to the violations of the stronger countries."
"This is certainly not the case with Nigeria."
"This is a great regional power with economic and military strength; and so, if possible, it has greater responsibilities towards the other States in the region."
"We should not forget that Nigeria is constantly seeking to assert its political weight on the other countries in the region, and on the developing countries in general, to oppose the constant appeals of the international Community to restore democracy, an independent legal system, the lawful state and respect for human rights."
"It is therefore impossible to remain silent in view of the arrests of those opposed to the current regime, the most authoritative members of the civilian society of that country, nor can we tolerate lightheartedly the fact that several international oil companies are still working in the Ogoni region, despite the violations of human rights and environmental pollution."
"As I said this morning, politics, particularly international politics, abhors a vacuum."
"The European Union and its individual states cannot fail to exert strong pressure on the Abacha regime to make it perform a serious about-turn, not hesitating, in the extreme, to deprive the current military junta of its principal financial means, by applying a total embargo on the oil trade of that country."
"Faced with extreme situations, such as that of Nigeria, we can only use extreme measures."
"Mr President, I would like to echo the points made by colleagues and it is good to see the House uniting."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen said that her group was not radical, my group is called the Radical group and naturally we associate ourselves with radical policies."
"I think what is important is that we have compromised to produce a joint resolution which I hope the House will pass overwhelmingly."
"I also agree totally with the remarks made by my colleague Mr Fassa."
"We have to remember sometimes just how big the prize of Nigeria is or how big the challenge."
"This is the giant of Africa, the country with one hundred million people which dominates the continent."
"As my colleague Mr Fassa has just said if we ignore the giants and pick on the pygmies then people will conclude that the European Union is not serious about its foreign policy."
"We have all been exercised about the problems of Iraq and the dictatorship there, but it would be a lot easier to bring about the overthrow of the Abacha dictatorship than that of Saddam Hussein."
"Sanni Abacha overthrew the elected government."
"He rules with a ring of steel around him but he is not supported by the people of Nigeria."
"They are looking to us for a lead to see in what ways the European Union is prepared to put democracy first and its own economic short-term interests second."
"In the long term, I think we have an interest in a free, democratic Nigeria with which we can trade as a full member of the ACP Lomé Convention."
"In the meantime, we have set out in this resolution a series of practical steps which the European Union could take and I hope that the Council of Ministers will respond to this and see whether they will go along with each of these."
"This is a very carefully calibrated practical series of proposals from this Parliament and I think that they are a very fitting response to the challenge."
"But at the end of the day the final sanction which has got to be contemplated, and this Parliament has already supported it in the past, is an oil embargo."
"That is the one thing which Nigeria above all fears."
"It is the one thing which could bring down the regime so we have to keep that up our sleeve as the last resort and in the meantime put the pressure on the regime to transfer to democratic government which is what the Nigerian people deserve."
"Mr President, Burma and Nigeria are obviously, geographically, thousands of miles apart."
"However, the people in those two countries both endure the most tyrannical military juntas and suffer systematic abuses of human rights."
"Unfortunately, as others have said, Europe's response is often perceived as being guided too much by our own commercial advantage, rather than the need to respond to the misery of the people in those countries where we risk undermining the very credibility of any claim that Europe is, in fact, genuinely committed to human rights."
"Democracy and good governance and our commitments to those two issues are also called into question by people in Burma and Nigeria who say that fine words will not, in themselves, assist their struggles."
"Should we not respond to the calls that have been made repeatedly by Aung San Suu Kyi for political and economic isolation of the SPDC."
"Is it not time other Member States followed the initiative undertaken by Britain, that has at least outlawed trade promotion in Burma?"
"Would the President-in-Office of the Council please give me some information as to whether it has made any progress on this matter?"
"Also, will he report to me whether the European Union is doing anything about the large numbers of Burmese people who are being forcibly repatriated into Burma, from Thailand, as a result of the financial crisis?"
"Similarly, on Nigeria, will the Council give us a commitment that it will implement the measures already agreed in the common position, particularly on visas, which have been regularly flouted by generals?"
"The sports boycott has been flouted due to pressure from the French government to allow the Nigerian football team to take part in the World Cup in June."
"That is an extremely regrettable initiative."
"The President-in-Office will be aware that at the Commonwealth Conference the foreign ministers agreed that if the promised return to civilian rule in Nigeria was not credible, then a mandatory oil embargo, a ban on airlines, an arms embargo and a freezing of financial assets would take place."
"Will the President-in-Office confirm that the Council will take similar actions at such time?"
"Will he spell out the terms and the timetable on which the proposed transition would be acceptable, including the unimpeded registration of genuine political parties, the release of Chief Abiola and other detainees and international monitoring of elections?"
"Would the President-in-Office agree with me that if the Council were to set these clear benchmarks, which we have laid out in our resolution, then we would avoid risking acquiescence in the process which Abacha is so clearly engaged in and that will result in a civilian glove covering the military fist that Abacha has applied for so long?"
"Mr President, the regime in Burma may have changed its name, but the policy has stayed exactly the same."
"The State Peace Development Council, as it is called now, continues its policy of suppression."
"It is the same old story."
"I invite the British Presidency to make it clear that human rights policy is a joint policy, and that it forms an important part of their political thinking."
"How does the President-in-Office of the Council think he will do this?"
"How does the President-in-Office of the Council think he will respond to Premier Oil's decision to invest in Burma?"
"What instrument does ASEM offer this situation?"
"The Liberal group hopes that the President-in-Office of the Council will stick to the Union policy not to invite Burma to London."
"Only what I would like to call pariah treatment will have effect."
"How are the ASEM partners responding to this?"
"How does the President-in-Office of the Council think he will convince the ASEM partners of the need for a policy which is based more on respect for human rights?"
"Finally, has the dialogue with ASEM countries yielded any results yet, and will this be brought up during the coming meeting of ministers?"
"Mr President, we asked for this debate with the Commission and the Council on topics of major importance concerning the specific principle the Community institutions and the EU countries should adopt in the presence of countries which are very seriously violating the most fundamental human and democratic rights of their citizens."
"The case of Burma is certainly today one of the most serious in the world."
"The ""list' of problems is, unfortunately, sadly known and runs from generalized political and social repression to the exploitation of forced and child labour, from drugs trafficking to violation of human rights."
"This situation is constantly deteriorating and the government is not showing any signs of finally wanting to begin a process of democratization in the country."
"In the Burmese State's budget for 1997-98, defence costs officially amount to 43 % of the total."
"These resources are used for internal repression and in the interests of the military establishment in power."
"The Burmese civilian society has shown its desire for democracy on numerous occasions that have always received our firm support, as shown when the Sakharov Prize was awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi several years ago."
"However, the amount the international Community can do, starting with the EU and its Member States, becomes a deciding factor."
"For this reason, while supporting the measures already adopted by the Commission and Council, we ask for pressure to be increased on the Burmese government, accentuating its political and economic isolation."
"It is from within Burma itself that the EU is asked to block any economic relations with the government, ending investments, trade and tourism and taking restrictive measures on entry visas, as well as strictly controlling the embargo on arms sales."
"The attitude of the large private companies, with numerous direct or indirect interests in Burma, is decisive."
"A pressure policy should be applied to these companies to freeze their business in the country, business that is only beneficial to the Government."
"The opinion the citizens of Europe and those of the rest of the world will have on the European structure also depends on the firm and responsible way in which we manage to deal with the Burmese question and the other democratic emergencies throughout the world."
"Thank you, Mr Vecchi."
"Meanwhile, the Bureau has noted that Mr Telkämper, whom I had said was absent, has just entered the Chamber and it is therefore with great pleasure that I invite him to take the floor, if the House has no objection."
"My questions relate to Burma."
"We have presented and discussed various resolutions on Burma and we were usually in agreement with the Commission and the Council that we must do everything to push forward the democratization process."
"This, however, has just not happened."
"My question is therefore how the British Presidency intends to present a common foreign policy position on Burma and perhaps to get this process in motion."
"The question relates in particular to how the Presidency intends to deal with adherence to the ILO Convention on slave labour."
"We know that slave labour prevails in Burma."
"How can we ensure this directive is successfully implemented?"
"I also have a specific question concerning the oil company Premier Oil, which in September 1997 announced its intention to buy the shares of the US firm Texaco from a natural gas company."
"Will the British Presidency support that or do you advise them, on the basis of resolutions passed here to desist from doing so?"
"The third point is that, as we have said, whilst the circumstances in Burma remain as they are, we will be against Burma being included here, on the basis of the treaty arrangements between the European Union and the ASEAN countries. This is because, as we of course repeatedly emphasize, human rights must be respected and this is also a condition or a part of the treaties."
"What will be the attitude of the British Presidency in the continuation of relations between the EU and ASEAN?"
"Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, I must confess I am more familiar with human rights violations of the fundamental rights within the European Union, which, as you know, come under the authority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, rather than human rights violations outside the European Union, about which my colleagues know a lot more than I do."
"But as I know the region quite well, including Burma, I was suddenly asked to speak."
"I have tried to catch up on human rights violations outside the European Union, because situations in my own country prompt me to a certain degree of modesty in this respect."
"If you consider that the Netherlands had been denounced by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for not having an independent judiciary, for not having a perfectly organized defence system and for not having properly functioning freedom of speech, then I say that I am quite willing to consider human rights as a problem, but rather as a ""we problem' than a ""you problem' ."
"This is my first point."
"When Burma joined ASEAN, I immediately paid a visit to Rangoon for strictly personal reasons, and used the opportunity to lay a wreath at the British war cemetery for those who died on the railroad during the Japanese occupation."
"I was very impressed with how civilized the people in that country were - and I can fully see why the British considered it as one of its most advanced colonies, when it was still a colonial power. I therefore went back over Christmas, and I also visited the Anglican Church - and I can recommended this to my British colleagues - where the war chapel has a handwritten record of all the British people who gave their lives for the freedom of this country, and for my own church, the Anglican Church."
"And I am now delivering to you a plea from the bishops of the Anglican and Lutheran Church, regarding the fact that all economic measures affect first and foremost the poor members of the population."
"That is the message I wanted to pass on."
"It has to be said, and this struck me yesterday during my intensive research of human rights violations, that we apply a kind of selection process - and I must ask my expert colleagues about this -, because a country like Brunei, which has no parliament at all, one of the nine ASEAN members, has never been on our hit list."
"I have one last comment, Mr President, and that is that religious beliefs, which do exist, as I experienced in Burma, are always judged harshly by this Parliament."
"These are my last words; maybe we can pay some attention to this from within Christian circles."
"Mr President, I only want to point out that the country's President elected by 80 % of the population asked for economic measures."
"I think that should suffice."
"Thank you, Mrs Maij-Weggen, for your clarification."
"I will give the floor once more to Mr Bertens and I would take this opportunity to explain to the House that, as I am sure you are aware, we are conducting a joint debate on a number of oral questions."
"That is why Mr Bertens appears on the list of speakers a second time, and indeed, he will be taking the floor for a third time later on."
"Mr President, Mrs Maij-Weggen already made the point at the beginning of the debate that the UN Commission on Human Rights, which took place when the Dutch held the Presidency last year, was a black page in the Union's human rights history."
"Unfortunately, international attention was focused on how extremely divided we were; this division was chiefly based on economic advantage."
"The Council promised better, and why not in fact?"
"The Union, acting jointly at UN level in this area, might achieve something."
"This applies especially to larger countries, and in this respect, I would like to mention China."
"The balance between open and silent diplomacy is right, but what will the result bring?"
"I do not think we should be obsessed with China."
"We must also remember Nigeria, Burma, Cambodia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Algeria, and perhaps Cuba, because the Pope does not sanctify everything."
"UN resolutions should be followed up to the letter."
"My question to the Council is: does he think he might achieve a better system for monitoring UN resolutions and for strengthening the follow-up structure?"
"This year the opportunity to reinforce the UN position must be seized, since it was fifty years ago in Lake Success that the United Nations was founded."
"Any attempts to not take the United Nations resolutions seriously will obviously achieve the opposite."
"How does the President-inOffice of the Council think he might give the decisive push for the realization of a powerful UN declaration on the protection of human rights defenders?"
"After all these years there should at last be a powerful agreement on this."
"Defenders of human rights deserve a declaration as an appreciation of all their work, and the Member States are morally committed to that in this important year for the UN."
"I hope that this Presidency will interpret that in the right way in any case."
"Mr President, as the chairman of the delegation for relations with China, I am the first to admit that it is not easy to know how to influence this huge country."
"We often discuss that within the delegation. We are even going to have a special seminar about it."
"It is clear that we should not break off relations. And it is clear that we should continue to strengthen our contacts and continue with dialogue."
"But should we really stop criticizing China completely?"
"That seems to be the Council's view, since it is now going to dispense entirely with proposing a resolution in Geneva."
"It is true that a convention on social rights has been adopted, or at least signed. It is true that Mary Robinson has been invited there and it is true that the Sakharov prize winner Wei Jingsheng has been released."
"But is that really enough to give China approval?"
"Human Rights Watch does not think so. Nor does Wei Jingsheng, whom I had the occasion to meet in Brussels a while ago."
"They think that pressure should be maintained too."
"I would like to ask this: is it really the case that the Council has a strategy for human rights in China?"
"Or is it just commercial considerations that have led to this new passive approach?"
"Mr President, this Parliament resolution is important."
"I have the same doubts as Mr Gahrton as regards the Council's desire to adopt a position which I hope will be Parliament's position tomorrow."
"There are certain precedents, particularly that of the past year."
"I also have some doubts as regards the Commission."
"There are some issues concerning China which are quite worrying."
"Some projects have been blocked for two years and I have just learned that, following a restructuring of the services of the Commission, the projects which DG VIII had examined and organized were transferred to DG 1B. This will force us to restart the whole process and lose more precious months."
"Some projects have been blocked for two years."
"The Council may have reservations, but so too has the Commission."
"There is one point as regards the United Nations resolution on which I absolutely do not agree: that of ""Algeria' ."
"This morning, Parliament succeeded in adopting a dignified stance on Iraq although this is not the case for other institutions."
"Thanks to the subcommittee chaired by Mr Soulier, in Algeria's case, Parliament is moving in the right direction towards adopting a dignified position, so it will not contradict itself by adopting a paragraph which demands that an international committee of inquiry be set up on Algeria tomorrow."
"It was a huge job to get Parliament to move on this; I hope and I am fairly convinced that we have succeeded."
"Now we must try to influence the Council and the Commission."
"Parliament will not go back on its word by calling for an international conference; that would be absurd."
"Mr President, sadly, I could fill the minutes allocated to me listing countries which flagrantly violate human rights, but I will mention a few which are not often highlighted."
"Firstly, I would like to mention Angola."
"The government rules over the largest part of the country now and, sadly, murders of the opposition leaders are increasing, including in the Cabinda region."
"The international community is doing nothing, tempted by oil and the generous sale of arms to the country."
"Secondly, I would like to take the case of Cuba."
"Seven prisoners have been released, who incidently were forced to leave the country immediately, but that still leaves 500 political prisoners."
"Because of the internal split in this Parliament, we rarely discuss this."
"No Cuban dissident has ever been important enough to this Parliament to receive the Sakharov Prize."
"This is incredible and selective, Mr President."
"Apart from looking critically at this Parliament, I also want to look critically at the Council."
"How has the Council put into effect the human rights resolutions which were accepted in the UN last year?"
"What has been done to promote and guarantee the work of the special rapporteurs?"
"How is the Council going to organize a strong and cohesive EU position for the coming 54th Session of the UN?"
"Is the Council prepared to give clear signals during the Session to countries like China, Mexico, Nigeria, Syria and Cuba, countries which are totally obstructive during the negotiation and decision-making process?"
"Will the Council not let itself be influenced by China's one step forward, two steps back policy?"
"Does the Council really see the exclusion of Burma at the coming ASEM summit as a useful contribution to compliance of human rights?"
"To conclude, for over a year some resolutions in this Parliament and some political factions have been calling for an oil boycott in Nigeria."
"Is the Council truly prepared and does it intend to raise this with the Security Council?"
"Because otherwise we are sitting here producing hot air, and that is not what this Parliament is here for."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the honourable Members for their questions and their interventions."
"I am pleased to address the questions they submitted."
"I would like to deal with this in three parts plus an addendum."
"The first part will deal with Nigeria, the second with Burma, the third with human rights and I will then make an announcement in relation to Azerbaijan on human rights."
"Firstly, on Nigeria, the Council has been following the situation in Nigeria with concern since the annulment of 12 June 1993 presidential elections."
"It has had measures in place against the Nigerian regime since then as a mark of its concerns about the lack of respect for human rights and democratic rule."
"This concern intensified throughout 1995 which saw the trial and harsh sentencing of 43 alleged coup plotters, including former Head of State General Obasanjo and a number of other high-profile civilians, Abacha's announcement of a three-year transition to civilian rule and finally the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants after a flawed judicial process."
"The two common positions adopted on 20 November 1995 and 4 December 1995 strengthened the European Union measures to include, among others, visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian regime and their families, including those in possession of long-term visas, a full scale arms embargo and a sports ban."
"As the honourable Members have noted, on 28 November 1997 the Council of the European Union extended the common position on Nigeria of 4 December 1995 until 1 November 1998."
"At the same time the Council reiterated its concern about the abuse of human rights in Nigeria, including the detention of political prisoners as well as the slow pace of democratization."
"It also underlined its willingness to support the transition process."
"Since then the Council has followed with considerable concern developments in Nigeria, including the tragic death of Shehu Yar'Adua in detention, the further arrest and detention without charge of journalists and pro-democracy activists, plus the arrest on 21 December 1997 of General Diya and a number of others in connection with an alleged coup attempt."
"On 26 December 1997, the Luxembourg Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the European Union appealing urgently to the Nigerian authorities to treat those arrested in accordance with the legal principles corresponding to international standards."
"This declaration also made clear that the European Union could not accept a repetition of the events of 1995."
"The Council has noted that a seven-man military tribunal has been constituted under the chairmanship of Major General Malu to try 26 people held under suspicion of coup plotting."
"On 14 February the press were allowed to witness the inauguration and see the accused but we understand that the proceedings will be held in camera ."
"The European Union successfully co-sponsored further critical resolutions on Nigeria at the 1997 sessions of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights and the United Nations General Assembly."
"The UNCHR resolution led to the appointment on 16 October of a special rapporteur on Nigeria with a mandate to make contact with the Nigerian authorities and people and report on the human rights situation in that country."
"His first report will be submitted to this year's Commission."
"We will be pressing for a further tough resolution based on his report."
"I want now to move to Burma."
"I applaud the sustained interest which Members of the European Parliament continue to take in the appalling human rights situation in Burma."
"The Council strongly shares Members' concerns."
"Its working groups at all levels regularly discuss ways in which to promote change in that country."
"The Council's message on Burma is simple."
"The people of Burma have expressed democratically their wish for a fairer deal and their voice must be heard by their government."
"To reinforce that message and encourage reform, the European Union has introduced a package of tough measures against the Burmese regime."
"The common position on Burma first adopted in October 1996 includes a full-scale arms embargo, a ban on the issuing of visas for members of the regime and their families, a ban on defence links and aid except for humanitarian aid and a ban on high-level official visits."
"The European Union has also suspended preferential trading terms for Burmese exports to the Union of agricultural and industrial goods."
"Some Member States have introduced additional measures on a national basis."
"The Council regularly reviews whether there is a consensus for them to be adopted by all Member States."
"There is no question of any relaxation of these measures without a substantial improvement in the human rights situation in Burma."
"We are conscious that in some circumstances such sanctions can hurt the very people they are designed to help."
"To help relieve the suffering which Burmese government policies cause to ordinary Burmese people, the European Union partners are considering a package of positive measures to strengthen civil society in Burma and to reinforce the excellent humanitarian work which is already being done there."
"I want to pay tribute to the many European and other non-governmental organizations which work tirelessly to improve conditions on the ground."
"The Council is working with non-governmental organizations to tackle the problem of Burma's refugees from both sides of the border."
"European Union ambassadors in Bangkok are in touch with the government of Thailand about the need to provide shelter and protection for refugees."
"We continue to monitor the situation closely and stand ready to take swift further action if necessary."
"We also work to promote improvements in Burma through close coordination of policy with our international partners."
"The Council keeps Burma high on its agenda for intergovernmental discussions."
"We firmly believe that governments in Asia have a particularly important role to play in using their influence with the regime to press for reform in Burma and we continue to urge them to do so."
"Our international partners cooperate closely in the UN."
"For example, the United Nations General Assembly in December adopted by consensus a tough resolution on human rights in Burma."
"Several European Union Member States were co-sponsors, and the text is stronger than last year's resolution in key areas."
"We look to the Burmese authorities to respect their obligations, as a UN member, and implement the resolution immediately."
"The Union will also introduce a resolution on Burma at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva next month."
"The Council has taken concrete measures to address human rights abuses in Burma."
"It is keeping the situation under very regular review and stands ready to consider further measures, positive or negative, as the situation on the ground demands."
"I should like to move on more generally to human rights."
"From mid-March to the end of April the Presidency will lead the European Union at the 54th session of the UN Commission of Human Rights in Geneva."
"Those rights are an issue for the whole year, not just for the annual sessions of the Commission."
"But the Commission is certainly the most important single opportunity in the international calendar to demonstrate our commitment to human rights and to work towards a realization around the world."
"We are conscious though that the Commission is not always an easy environment: many different viewpoints are represented."
"There will be those present who will seek to hamstring the work of the international community to promote human rights."
"Many countries automatically oppose intrusive mechanisms and the realization by their citizens of their inalienable rights."
"We will do our utmost, with other like-minded countries, to ensure that such disruptive and indefensible opposition does not prevail."
"A major focus of this year's Commission will be the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"The Declaration established universal standards of human rights."
"Fifty years on, the standards remain as relevant as they were when the Declaration was adopted."
"But we remain a long way from their full realization."
"The 50th anniversary is a time for implementation of those standards."
"It is not a time to unpick existing texts, and we will resist firmly any attempts to do so."
"We will pay particular attention at the Commission to ensuring that it takes effective action to promote the rights of children."
"So often children's rights are forgotten or ignored."
"Children's rights must be a cross-cutting element in all the work of the Commission."
"There is near-universal ratification of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, and the time has come for implementation."
"Another key cross-cutting issue for the Council is the human rights of women."
"We will ensure that women's rights are given their due place in the work of the Commission, not just in the resolutions which specifically cover women's rights, but in other Commission action."
"The EU will play a full role across all the work of the Commission."
"In particular there is already agreement within the Union that the Presidency, on behalf of the Union, will table resolutions on Nigeria, Burma, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Israeli settlements, Iran, East Timor and Iraq."
"We will also take the initiative on Colombia, where the welcome decision to set up a human rights office in Bogota stems from Union action."
"The Union will, in addition, make an intervention setting out our position on other countries where we have major human rights concerns."
"The Council is still considering how to address other countries' situations at the Commission, including China."
"We regret the breakdown of the European Union consensus on a CHR resolution in 1997."
"We are still considering action at the Commission on Human Rights."
"But it will depend on developments and progress made in the bilateral and European Union human rights dialogues."
"We expect to make a decision shortly."
"We have concerns about the human rights situation in China and are seeking to address these in a cooperative way with the Chinese government."
"China has demonstrated a willingness to discuss human rights with us and the European Union as a whole."
"China has also entered into a dialogue with others."
"These discussions have produced results, information on individual cases and agreement on technical cooperation programmes."
"The Presidency will also make interventions in debates on racism, democracy and development, detention and rule of law issues, women's rights, advisory services, the rights of the child, human rights' defenders, as well as on Israeli settlements."
"We will support the Commission's various independent mechanisms, including special rapporteurs and working groups."
"They play a crucial role in monitoring violations and advising governments on human rights improvements."
"The Council, as you may imagine, does not expect an easy session."
"But we know what we want to achieve: real progress towards the realization of all human rights for all people, and we will be working hard to make sure that we achieve it."
"As I indicated at the beginning of my contribution, I can today, as a result of pressure by the Union, announce that Azerbaijan has abolished the death penalty."
"I believe it is a helpful step forward in promoting human rights, and we call on other countries to follow that example."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Bureau has received a number of requests for the floor from Members who have already taken part in the debate."
"Given that some ten more speakers are already down for this joint debate, the Bureau's criteria will be to avoid disturbing the normal course of the debate."
"The Members who have now requested the floor in connection with the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council will be able to put their questions at the end, because I do not think that this will be the last time that the President-in-Office of the Council takes the floor."
"Therefore, he will have an opportunity to answer any questions later."
"Mr President, can you assure me that the President-in-Office will be here if we want to ask him questions because I specifically wanted to ask for an answer to a very specific question that I asked."
"Mrs Kinnock, it seems that you did not hear what I said earlier."
"Like yourself, others have requested the floor in response to the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Moreover, we have a list of speakers and a series of speakers who have not yet had the opportunity to take the floor, and who have as much right to receive answers from the President of the Council and from Commissioner Marín as those who have already spoken."
"Therefore, I would ask for your understanding and ask you to present your question to the President-in-Office of the Council when the debate has ended, because we still have another ten speakers on our list, and we cannot favour any Member to the detriment of others."
"I hope you understand that I cannot proceed in any other way."
"Mr President, in general terms the Commission completely accepts the position expressed by the British Presidency with respect to Nigeria and Burma."
"I just want to explain a few points."
"It is true that Nigeria is at a critical juncture because presidential elections are due to be held in the next six months, and we hope they will lead to the installation of a civilian government in that country, under a civilian president."
"So there is a lot at stake."
"If, for whatever reason, the process of democratic transition were to founder, it could result in a reappearance of the spectre of violence and bloodshed, which could perhaps spread to other countries, with very serious human and economic consequences."
"We are convinced that the Nigerian people would not peacefully accept another military regime."
"On the other hand, the many questions which Members have raised about the Nigeria issue show the concern within the European Union to see the democratic process firmly established in that country, and the economic benefits of its resources finally distributed fairly amongst the population, which is increasing all the time and becoming poorer and poorer."
"As has been said, Nigeria is too big and important a country, both within Africa and globally, to be marginalized."
"Let me state quite categorically that the Commission will do everything within its power and the limits of its authority, to assist and mobilize the necessary resources to strengthen Nigerian civilian society, and particularly its most vulnerable groups."
"Twenty-seven years of successive military governments have left an indelible mark on Nigerian civilian society, which will take a long time to disappear."
"The apathy and fatalism which characterize a large part of civilian society should be reversed somehow. We are convinced that Nigeria's well-known spirit of enterprise and dynamism can be reawakened for this purpose."
"Finally, I want to say that the Commission intends to continue its efforts towards dialogue with the Nigerian government, giving special priority to measures designed precisely to combat human rights violations, strengthen the independence and training of the courts and the legal professions, improve governability and assist the process of supporting democracy."
"As for Burma - and this is not the first time we have discussed these matters in Parliament - the Commission wishes to clarify the following points: to the best of our ability, and following the common position adopted by the Council, we have tried to establish what is known as ""critical dialogue' with the military junta."
"Apart from the ASEAN meetings at the United Nations in New York, our attempt at critical dialogue has not worked and is still not working, for the simple reason that it has been rejected."
"At the moment there is no significant contact between the Commission and the military junta."
"It is true that the common position calls on us to initiate that political dialogue but, I repeat, with the military junta this has not been possible."
"With the democratic movements it is a different matter, and we have set in motion a whole series of decisions."
"I do not understand how Mr Dupuis can talk about delays."
"That is not true."
"The Commission has set in motion a programme of support for the opposition, for the Burmese dissident movement which has been established in Europe, and in that sense we have launched a project with the aim of strengthening the democratic movements and training members of the opposition and future leaders."
"We have opened a Europe-Burma office in Brussels."
"In other words, we have made contact with the opposition and with the dissidents within that opposition living in Europe, and we are helping them."
"As for the military junta, I cannot tell them anything, for the simple reason that we have no form of contact with them."
"The only chance is the forthcoming visit by Kofi Annan's special envoy, Mr Álvarez Soto, the aim of which is precisely to attempt that critical dialogue, on behalf of Kofi Annan."
"Finally, the European Union's position on the ASEAN question is very clear."
"Firstly, the fact that Burma has been accepted into ASEAN's regional framework is a matter for ASEAN itself."
"They accepted that country in the belief that by means of what they call ""constructive engagement' - which turns out to be the English version of the Asian translation of ""critical dialogue' - they would demonstrate that dialogue really has been strengthened."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, I first want to point out once again in Parliament that Burma is not included in the 1980 cooperation agreement which was extended to Brunei and Vietnam."
"In any case, the Commission does not intend to propose to the Council that the ASEAN-EU regional cooperation protocol of 1980 should be extended."
"In that sense, we are maintaining our position, apart from the fact that it was confirmed in the Council's common position."
"Furthermore, Burma is also excluded from all the cooperation programmes being implemented with ASEAN."
"So there is no need to worry, because as things stand and until such time as the common position changed, we are strictly complying both with what the Council called for in its common position and with what this Parliament has so often called for."
"That is the latest news I can give you on these two problems."
"Thank you, Commissioner Marín."
"I have received twenty motions for resolutions, submitted pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, over two years since the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa, when his son, Ken, came to Brussels three days later and generated total and absolute support from every part of this House for a return to democracy and human rights in Nigeria, we are forced once again to ask the European Parliament to condemn the Abacha regime's continuing disregard for these principles."
"Abacha's presidential candidacy from four out of five parties and the continued house arrest of Chief Abiola do not constitute a transition to civilian rule, Commissioner Marín."
"The arrests of alleged coup plotters last December, threats against journalists who report them, and the arrest of 30 perceived activists preceding the Ogoni Day celebrations last month are all testimony to the abandonment of even token efforts by the Nigerian government towards democratic transition."
"I ask the Commission and the Council to respond to Mrs Kinnock's points about clear benchmarks for this transition process."
"We say again, today, that oil sanctions remain the only instrument available to the international community which will guarantee change; oil earnings, which account for 96 % of all Nigeria's export earnings, with 40 % of all federal government revenue provided by one European company: Shell."
"The European Parliament should condemn the Nigerian government for its announcement this month that it is seeking to resume oil operations in Ogoniland by force."
"We should join calls on Shell to publicly denounce this."
"Last year we held discussions with Shell in this House on their business principles."
"We accept that they have the potential to be a force for good in Nigeria, but they must accept greater responsibility in response to the latest crisis."
"Batom Mitee, brother of the acting president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop) told The Times : ' Farmers are struggling for land and space with oil exploration."
"They do not see the government."
"They see Shell."
"They want Shell to show some concern.' On 3 January this year, Batom's car was stalked and searched by members of the same internal security force set up to repress anti-Shell protests."
"A report about the struggle against Shell was found on the back seat."
"Batom was dragged out of his car and severely beaten."
"He was detained and severely tortured, denied food, medical care or access to a lawyer."
"Ken Saro-Wiwa believed he would die 'all for Shell' ."
"Let us, let Shell, let every Member State who trades in oil act now to save the life of Batom Mitee, of the thirty others arrested with him, and of all oppressed Nigerian people who they represent."
"Mr President, as one of the co-authors of the resolutions on Nigeria and Burma, I am particularly pleased that we are having this debate this afternoon using the oral question with debate rather than the normal urgency procedure."
"I am grateful to the President-in-Office and to Mr Marín for their respective statements which I think probably take the matter as far as possible, bearing in mind in particular that the President-in-Office has, so to speak, to represent the fourteen other Member States."
"On Nigeria, he referred to the sports ban."
"This has to be considered somewhat ironic in view of the fact that Nigeria has been given the go-ahead to take part in the World Cup."
"It tears a hole in the whole system and allows a number of Nigerians to come to Paris and other places to take part in the World Cup."
"I do not know whether he is able to offer an explanation but it is an illustration of how one Member State can drive a cart horse through the whole system."
"On Burma, the only point I can make in one minute, since I was not able to be present this morning for reasons beyond my control, is the extent to which investment is still going on there."
"A company like Total, for instance is making substantial investments. We correspond with them and they send an arrogant reply that they will have nothing to do with us and give no information whatsoever."
"I wish that the President-in-Office could ask some very pointed questions of certain Member States and of certain companies."
"There are a lot of others involved as well."
"I have made my two points concerning the World Cup and the extent of investment in Burma."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened attentively to what Commissioner Marín had to say, albeit in a cool manner, and attentively because this shows, once again, how Europe is totally powerless on two contrasting issues - Nigeria and Burma."
"What is happening in Nigeria?"
"The military power of this bloodthirsty junta - for it was called a junta by Commissioner Marín, rather than a dictatorship - with a president who had been elected and of whom we know nothing, with Ken Saro-Wiwa and other Ogoni representatives who have been executed, is now extending to other African countries."
"And now we have news that the Nigerian military have invaded Sierra Leone; refugees are already escaping from their land on account of this military intervention, brought forward under the pretext that they, the Nigerians, are the peacemakers in Africa."
"I have not heard you say anything about this, Mr Commissioner."
"I would like to know whether, in this critical dialogue the Commission intended to hold with Nigeria, the possibility that Nigeria may become the peacemaker with the arms of Africa and the African region is also implied."
"The second question relates to Burma."
"It is true that we cannot allow this country to join the ASEAN, and therefore there is no dialogue between Europe and Burma, but it is also true that there is a creeping legitimization of the Burmese dictatorship, although it has wiped out, tortured, incarcerated and summarily executed the opposition, while putting Nobel Prize winners under house arrests and so on and so forth."
"We have not had much reassurance on this either, Mr Commissioner, from you or from the Commission."
"Mr President, I am just back from Algeria where I went to discuss human rights. This is a country in the grip of terrorism, and I would like to pay my respects to all the victims of the barbarous acts there."
"Clearly, I do not agree with Mr Dupuis. I am not at all reassured as regards the fate of the numerous people who have disappeared, nor as regards the practice of torture and the secret detention camps."
"I call on the Council and the Member States to list Algeria amongst the priorities for debate at the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and remain convinced that sending a special rapporteur does not represent a punishment or a condemnation of this country."
"On the contrary, this mechanism, which was provided for by the United Nations and used for countries where the situation is less worrying than in Algeria, will enable us to shed light on the situation and break the deadlock."
"Algeria is really on the road to democracy - we have noted this before."
"So it should be able to accept that transparency is brought to those areas which remain opaque, at least for the moment."
"And it is also up to us to encourage this country to accept the promotion of universal values and respect for individuals."
"In clarification, the joint resolution does not mention the call for an international committee of inquiry, contrary to what Mr Dupuis says."
"Mr President, Nigeria is a particularly bad apple in a basket of not too sound fruit."
"Democratically elected presidents are deposed and political opponents imprisoned or hanged."
"The Nigerian regime is also active outside its own borders."
"Under the ECOMOG flag, Nigerian soldiers are fighting against the military junta in Sierra Leone, supposedly to reinstate the democratically elected president, but Sierra Leone's diamond fields must be the primary reason."
"The question is, what can the EU do against the regime in Nigeria?"
"In November 1995, the Council suspended military cooperation and development aid."
"In December of that year these measures were strengthened."
"Now that three years later these measures have had not any effect, some people in this House are arguing for an oil boycott."
"This would hit the regime hard, because oil exports account for 90 % of its income."
"However, the experience we have gained with boycotts of this kind shows that it is above all the people who suffer, whilst the regime the boycott is targeted at, is often able to keep its position for years to come."
"Because of the largely poor majority in Nigeria, I question the use of an oil boycott."
"That is why I am investigating the feasibility and consequences of an oil embargo."
"After that, it can be decided whether an embargo of this kind should be imposed."
"I do believe that the existing sanctions the Council introduced against Nigeria should be closely observed."
"Mr President, the people of Burma deserve a vote in favour of the statement being debated here today."
"The Burmese regime is one of the most unpleasant dictatorships in the world."
"The people are being brutally suppressed, and the military dictatorship has not the slightest respect for human rights."
"Burma is the centre of the Asian narcotics trade: it produces more than 2 000 tonnes of raw opium a year, and another 250 tonnes of heroin, which are exported to the West."
"The dictatorship uses the income to tighten its grip on power."
"The proposal we are debating here today demands in very clear terms that foreign companies stop investing in Burma immediately and that the EU introduces economic sanctions against Burma as soon as possible."
"Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the European Parliament's Sakharov prize, has called on the EU take this action."
"During the era of apartheid in South Africa, it was again those who spoke for the oppressed who demanded that the rest of the world should put economic pressure on the regime, but business in the West fought against this."
"Now business is making profits in the country where the anti-apartheid movement has gone furthest."
"People must understand that investing in Burma amounts to direct support for the military regime."
"It would be better for the Burmese if this regime were overthrown and economic sanctions have proved to be more effective in the past than critical dialogue with someone who does not understand the meaning of the words."
"I heard Mr Marín say that critical dialogue has failed, so I am expecting a statement from the Commission saying that, now that we have totally failed in this area, economic sanctions will be applied."
"That would suit both the Commission but also, in particular, the Council because I think Mr Henderson's answer on Burma was rather meaningless."
"Mr President, I have a preliminary remark to make."
"I would like to ask the Bureau to try to arrange even joint debates as thematically as possible, for it is rather complicated to trace a common thread of meaning between Burma, Nigeria and the 54th session of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva."
"I say this in view of the fact that we have an audience."
"But allow me to say something about the 54th session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva."
"For many people it represents hope, but it also disappoints many people."
"For us, however, for the European Union - and therefore I would like to underline this very clearly here - it is a test case, to show to what extent the Union is serious about its own human rights policy and how it converts its own theories into practice."
"Many countries, particularly Denmark, were all the more dismayed when some states of the European Union no longer supported the resolution on China introduced with great difficulty a year before."
"Of course, no country is prevented from improving the situation of human rights in their own territory."
"If that is really the case then we shall not be the last to confirm it."
"This year, too, another proposed resolution is before the European Parliament, which calls on the Council to define joint priorities in Geneva."
"The list of countries criticized because of their human rights policies is still very long, much too long, in fact, and just a few examples are Algeria, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"In addition there are problems such as the international trade in human cargo, namely in women and children."
"Nevertheless, we are not abandoning hope that the European Union will show a common strong front, for only then can we do anything."
"This is directed equally at the President of the Council and the representative of the Commission."
"Given, in particular, the enlargement towards the east of the European Union, we should take these questions very seriously and measure our own attitude against the criteria which we apply to other countries."
"This applies above all in the year of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which we want to see extended by an international Court of Human Rights."
"In my opinion it is an exhortation to ourselves."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have so often taken up the question of crimes against human rights perpetrated by the military junta in Burma, but we must return once again to the subject."
"We are not alone in our criticism."
"Both the United Nations and the USA along with many other countries have recently made renewed protests in this respect."
"Aung San Suu Kyi was democratically elected by an overwhelming majority of more than 80 %, but is being prevented from taking over responsibility and is still under house arrest."
"Many politicians are in prison for political reasons and are being denied their democratic rights."
"Political meetings are banned and there are continued attacks on ethnic minorities. Among other things, 400 villagers were killed in May and June last year."
"There is also a strong link between the military regime and drugs producers: most of the world's heroin comes from Burma."
"On several occasions, Aung San Suu Kyi has asked the international community to introduce political and economic sanctions against Burma, which is something President Clinton decided on in May last year when new investments in Burma were banned."
"But multinational oil companies, including European ones such as Total, continue to support the military regime."
"The oil companies' investments account for the largest amount of foreign exchange in the country."
"Therefore, it is important that Parliament again strongly condemns the dictatorship in Burma and demands that human rights are guaranteed so that Aung San Suu Kyi is released from house arrest and the UN's inspectors can unconditionally carry out their assignment."
"It is appropriate that the Council has decided not to accept Burma's participation in the meeting between the EU and ASEAN until the human rights situation has improved in Burma."
"But Parliament now demands that the Council respond to Aung San Suu Kyi's call for economic sanctions against the military junta by breaking off all trading and tourist links between the EU and Burma, and by stopping investment in Burma by European companies."
"The Council's representative, Mr Henderson, said earlier that the Council was prepared to adopt further measures."
"What initiatives is the Presidency prepared to take for effective economic sanctions and to promote democracy in Burma?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here in the European Union we are neither the government of the world, nor the policemen of the world."
"At this particular moment in time, this government and policing falls to another union."
"But, within our bounds, the European Union and, more particularly, the European Parliament have contributed a great deal to the policy of defending human rights."
"However, this policy has not been coordinated in such a way as to represent a consensus of the parties of the European Union during the United Nations debates on this subject."
"Often, a chorus of small voices carries less weight than a single, stronger voice."
"This is not the example that has been given by the European Union."
"Moreover, the United Nations resolutions are frequently flouted, which often detracts from the credibility of its decisions."
"This attitude is exemplified by the current situation in Iraq and Portugal's own historical case of East Timor."
"I could cite dozens more, but you are better acquainted with this subject than I am."
"I consider that the European Union has the right and, indeed, the duty to work actively to enhance the prestige of the United Nations, by drawing attention to these facts."
"The questions submitted by some of my colleagues to the Council and to the Commission have that positive end in view."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, what effect do European Parliament debates on human rights actually have?"
"Do they just make people aware of problems and then disappear into archives or do they emphatically pursue attempted solutions far beyond the shores of Europe?"
"Do they prosecute regard for human rights, do they contribute to the elimination of deplorable situations, do they offer any encouragement at all to those forces whose humanitarian, ecological or economical work needs to be supported?"
"The abuses of human rights in Burma continue unabated."
"There is illtreatment, imprisonment, enforced labour and slave trading."
"The woman who won the democratic elections over 9 years ago, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Madame Sun Kyi, is still de facto under house arrest."
"Burma is today probably the biggest producer of opium in the world and is miles away from cooperating with other countries in the fight against drugs."
"I can therefore only repeat the demand I made in my speech of March last year: cancel the tariff preferences for Burma."
"Even if this measure is financially very small it must be extended for the fourth time. But it will not be enough on its own."
"The European Union is and remains a Community of values."
"The maintenance of democracy and human rights is one of our highest principles."
"We are not a movable object which allows itself to be misused for tactical ruses."
"Anyone who gets involved in the battle against the abuse of human rights is in no way subject to the law of non-intervention in so-called internal affairs."
"We must use economic pressure to exert political pressure on the revolutionary government."
"We must impose more far-reaching sanctions."
"Like the Americans, the Europeans must get companies to stop investing in Burma."
"This gives rise to three questions to the European Commission."
"Commissioner Marín, firstly, what chance do you give such an embargo on investment?"
"Secondly, in your view, are firms in Europe ready to take such measures?"
"Thirdly, what possibility do you see of preventing European firms from filling the vacuum caused by the withdrawal of American firms?"
"Thank you, Mr Thomas Mann."
"As agreed, I will now give the floor to those who requested it although, since this is a relatively novel process, I would ask Members kindly to frame simple, concise and clear questions relating preferably to matters that the Council has not yet addressed."
"Mr President, I would just like to ask the President-in-Office if he would please be so kind as to answer my question regarding the importance of benchmarks by which we will judge the transition process in Nigeria."
"I enjoyed the history of what has occurred but I would really like to know what the Council intends to do next."
"I know that the Commission is very keen that we have these benchmarks, and I wonder if the Council supports this view."
"I would also like to ask the Commission whether it understands what it means to say we are going to have a great deal of new NGO activity in Burma."
"I find that deeply worrying and I would like the Commissioner to explain exactly what that means."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office has attractive surveys, facts, figures on the countries we have discussed, but he has not given any answers."
"I hope he will read the Verbatim Report carefully, and, having done so, will respond differently."
"I think it is a shame that it all ended somewhat unfortunately this way."
"The specific question about Burma I did not receive an answer to was: what is the Presidency intending to do with the invitation to the ASEM countries for the ASEM ministerial meeting?"
"Or at least what he is intending to do with Burma in this respect?"
"My additional question is also about Burma."
"It seems as though the United States have decided to introduce a investment ban, in other words a run up to an economic boycott."
"The result is that European companies are beginning to take over the contracts the Americans are leaving behind."
"Where American companies are withdrawing, European ones are entering."
"What is the minister going to do, together with his colleagues in the European Council of Ministers, to stop this, and to come into line with America on the Burmese issue?"
"Mr President, I must repeat a part of my question because the Council has not answered it."
"I had asked whether the British oil company, Premier Oil, announced in September 1997 its intention to buy shares in a natural gas firm in Yetagun from the US firm Texaco after the latter decided to pull out of Burma."
"Now of course we have again universally confirmed our condemnation of the regime."
"What is the attitude of the British Presidency of the Council - this was my question before - to this possible purchase?"
"We really would like an answer on this issue."
"Equally - this is a supplementary question to the Commission -, on the issue of the compulsory return of refugees from Thailand to Burma, is humanitarian aid continuing there, guaranteed by the EU?"
"Mr President, just to revert to the points I made earlier, how does the President-in-Office reconcile a sports ban on Nigeria with the go-ahead for the World Cup which has opened up a whole plethora of contacts with Nigeria?"
"It must be very pleasing to Abacha!"
"In regard to Burma, would he care to volunteer some explanation about European companies investing with fervour in Burma?"
"I cited Total as one example."
"How does that tally with the statement of Mr Robin Cook in regard to new ethics and human rights?"
"Mr President, I would like to back up the questions asked by Mrs Kinnock over benchmarks."
"There were also in the resolution, which we have agreed amongst the groups, a series of measures which we want the European Council to agree to take."
"I am referring in particular to paragraph 9 of the resolution which I am sure the President-in-Office has in front of him."
"I want to know whether we are going to have some action or whether we are just going to talk about prolonging the present situation."
"I should like to make a procedural point."
"I was told that Parliament would like me to answer the written questions and that there was an opportunity for debate on those matters."
"I answered the written questions but then, supplementary questions were raised by the original questioners."
"I was given no notice that I would be required to answer them."
"I am not complaining about it, but I suggest I take the questions as we do in Question Time and answer them like that, as I do not propose to give any written answers in future, for the rest of the Presidency."
"I do not want to bind future presidencies to this procedure, but I am not going to do both."
"I am either going to answer the questions as they are asked or I am going to answer the written questions because what I am being asked to do is to go over the same ground again."
"I am happy to do it today, but I will not be doing it again in the future - with your support, Mr President."
"I would like to do one or the other."
"It is an extension of Question Time."
"If Parliament wants Question Time to be longer and have less time for debate, that is fine with me."
"But we really have to smarten up the procedure."
"I shall now take the various issues which have been raised, and there are quite a large number of them."
"I will try and link them where I can."
"Firstly, as regards the sports ban on Nigeria, an exception has been made for Nigeria in the World Cup because the French government had a prior arrangement with FIFA which contractually bound them."
"They supported a sports ban on the basis that the prior agreement with FIFA would continue to be upheld."
"That was agreed by the Council."
"The next question put on Nigeria by Mrs André-Léonard was: would Nigeria be top of the human rights agenda?"
"The answer to that is that it should be, and I hope it will be."
"We will endeavour to put it at the top of the agenda in discussions in Geneva later this year."
"On the question from Mrs Lenz on enlargement, the Copenhagen criteria make it quite clear that meeting democratic targets and meeting human rights commitments are part of the enlargement process."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam takes the whole question of human rights further in the preamble and reinforces the need for upholding the highest standards of human rights for all EU countries."
"That is part of the enlargement dialogue."
"All the countries who wish to accede to the European Union are aware of that procedure."
"When I visited some of those countries that wish to accede, in preparation for the UK Presidency, I raised those issues with them."
"If they were not aware of them before, they are certainly aware of them now."
"On the question of Burma, there is no investment ban."
"There are a number of policies which are in place."
"I did, in my initial introduction, refer to the suspension of preferential trading for Burmese agricultural and industrial exports into the European Union."
"In as much as that is a ban, it is an encouragement to Burma to mend its ways."
"There are no further bans in place though I can mention, from a UK point of view, that we would certainly be receptive to toughening-up our approach to Burma."
"If other colleagues wish to join us in the Council on that, then it could be carried further."
"Discouraging tourism and stopping trade promotion is a starting-point here."
"We would certainly want to push that agenda at the Council and hope to achieve in the future support from our other colleagues."
"Again, as regards relations with the United States, we would want to cooperate with them so that any initiative which was taken by the European Union would not be undermined by the United States."
"It is important to have that dialogue."
"I now move to the question of benchmarks, which was raised by Mrs Kinnock, Mr Macartney and Mr Howitt."
"That is a very sensible proposal."
"I can let the House know that the issue will be on the agenda at the next EU-Nigeria experts meeting, which is being convened by the Commission in March in Brussels."
"The outcome of that meeting will be a basis for the Council to take decisions in this matter at a later Council meeting."
"Regarding the question that was asked by Mr Bertens on ASEAN, I do not believe that Burma is attending the ASEAN conference, so the matter does not arise."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen raised the question of the US link."
"I have already covered that point."
"Regarding the question raised by Mr Telkämper about whether aid will be affected, the answer to that is 'no' , but I would want to consult officials and then I can give a definitive answer to him in writing later."
"Indeed the Commission may be able to provide further information on that."
"Thank you, Commissioner Marín."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Situation in Albania"
"The next item is the Council and the Commission statements relating to the situation in Albania and the results of the visit by the tripartite delegation."
"Mr President, the European Union is committed to helping Albania achieve reconciliation and a return to normality."
"The Union's political dialogue meeting with Albania last month is an important sign of this."
"But the primary responsibility for this recovery rests with the Albanians themselves, the government, the opposition and, indeed, the people of Albania."
"The Union welcomes the positive steps taken so far by the government and its commitment to restoring law and order and political and economic reform."
"The agreement with the IMF is an important step forward."
"The Union encourages the continuing process of democratic reform including the judicial system."
"It is important that a new constitution is adopted after a wide-ranging discussion and the Union welcomes the constructive approach Albania is playing in regional issues and, in particular, in Kosovo."
"It is important that the government works to build a genuinely non-political civil service."
"The necessary cuts in public administration agreed with the IMF should be even-handed and aim to promote a high degree of professionalism and impartiality."
"But the European Union is concerned at the continued refusal of important groups within the Albanian opposition to engage in the democratic process and to contribute to a common approach to rebuilding their country."
"The Union calls on the Democratic Party and its allies to participate fully in Parliament including the adoption of a new Albanian Constitution."
"The Union welcomes the visit of the troika parliamentarians to Tirana last month and urges the government and the opposition to live up to its recommendations."
"It is important that the cooperation offered by Berisha is fulfilled."
"The Albanian authorities must work closely with the European Union to ensure the most effective delivery of aid."
"European Community assistance to Albania between 1991 and 1996 amounted to ECU 557 million."
"The European Community pledged around ECU 100 million more at the October 1997 international donors conference."
"The PHARE Programme of 1998 will make an additional ECU 42 million available."
"The European Union Humanitarian Office has contributed substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to Albania."
"Last December it announced projects of more than ECU 10 million to help vulnerable sections of the population."
"This is in addition to the hundreds of millions of US dollars pledged nationally by European Union Member States at the Brussels donors conference."
"Mr President, the Commission is of the exact same opinion as the UK Presidency with respect to the situation in Albania."
"It is true that there were great improvements in the second half of 1997 as regards economic stabilization and public order."
"However, in questions of security the situation is still worrying, and the collecting up of weapons has not been very effective so far."
"Most important of all, there are still major political tensions between the main parties, and it must be realized that, for the moment, Albania is still a long way from being a genuinely democratic culture."
"Nevertheless, it is critical that the main opposition party, the Albanian Democratic Party, should participate in the Albanian Parliament and in the drafting of the constitution."
"Without the necessary political stability, all the country's forces for recovery and reform, both those from Albania and those from the international donors, would be seriously threatened."
"In that context, the Commission is pleased with the recent joint mission of the European Parliament, the Parliamentary Assemblies of the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"We think that mission was necessary, and it has confirmed acceptance of the June-July 1997 elections and the legitimacy of the current parliament, and has given ample support to the process of drafting the constitution, which the government has set in motion."
"As a result of the mission, the Democratic Party is finally considering returning to parliament, and the government seems to be firmly committed to helping with political normalization, but the pressure will certainly have to be kept up on all the parties in order to further political and parliamentary cooperation."
"The Commission completely agrees with the proposals made by the tri-parliamentary mission."
"And in the context of the third joint European Community-/Council of Europe programme for Albania, with a value of ECU 1.5 million, there is a desire to support the work of the Venice Commission towards the preparation of the constitution."
"This programme also includes aid for training judges, developing the legislative framework, maintaining law, progress in human rights law, and reforming the judicial system and local administration."
"All this has an obvious link with the administrative reform programme, which is another key option in the PHARE programme."
"As regards the agreed measures, an encouraging first result is the government's approval of a law to transform the state service into a superior auditing institution."
"Also in preparation is a law concerning the basis of the reorganization of the Ministry of Justice, and a constitutional budgetary law. These two advances - concerning the judiciary and the budget - will be fundamental in reforming public administration."
"On the other hand, it is important that personnel cuts are carried out as part of the public administration reform process. These cuts have already been agreed with the Bretton Woods institutions, and maintain the necessary criteria of professionalism."
"In this context, a decree is being approved which deals with transitional measures relating to contracts and dismissals, and it will be revised by experts."
"If implemented, all this legislation - which I am describing in detail because it is a condition for budgetary aid through the PHARE programme - would release a first sum of ECU 9 million."
"Just last week there was a Commission identification mission to see how the country's political normalization is progressing."
"As for the dramatic problem created by the pyramid scam and the bank fraud in Albania, administrators and auditors have been appointed for those companies which suffered bankruptcy, within the framework of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and they have started work already."
"Nevertheless, it must be realized that there are quite a few problems in applying the measures being taken to remedy this situation, which was created by the pyramid fraud."
"It is difficult to carry out inspections and audits because the companies are not keen to cooperate with the administrators and auditors."
"This issue, which is very sensitive and has a huge social impact, will be thoroughly dealt with during the next coordination meeting, to be held on 23 February and due to be chaired by the World Bank in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund."
"The Commission is insisting that the Albanian government should facilitate the work of the international administrators, and it is very important that these audits should produce results."
"That would allow the International Monetary Fund's emergency programme and the negotiations with the Fund to become a reality, which would of course set Albania into a pattern of normalization, at least with respect to its international economic relations."
"Mr President, I had the honour of taking part in this mission with Mrs Pack, which I believe was the first tri-parliamentary mission in the history of our Parliament."
"It is an extraordinary event and we can certainly be satisfied with it, but satisfaction with the result of this mission should not be confused with a calm state of mind in relation to the internal situation in Albania because, as Commissioner Marín has just recalled, the situation remains worrying from an economic and safety point of view."
"We have to realize that a race is taking place in Albania and we do not yet know who the winner will be."
"On the one hand, there are those who want a process of national reconciliation and an effective democracy and, on the other, there are those who still want revenge over the electoral process."
"It is true that in Albania, compared with a year ago when there was a kind of civil war, there is now a parliament and a government and constant efforts are being made to put things back in their places. It is true that the situation has improved, but if the government and the opposition do not soon work together to cooperate and complete the new constitution in the parliament and if there is no cooperation within the parliament itself, then conflicts will emerge outside parliament, throughout the country, and the arms used will not be those of deliberation and democracy."
"Every day, the press reports news that, luckily, does not end up on the international pages, because it concerns local incidents of deaths and injuries, and fights for which those responsible are often not easy to trace."
"The constitutional block in Albania was the fundamental reason for this mission."
"The cooperation of all the political powers is required to draw up a constitution."
"The opposition, however, has not yet participated in the work of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, giving as a reason, the fact that the parliament does not have the moral authority to rewrite the new constitution, and this gives us cause for concern."
"With our tri-parliamentary mission, we sought to convince all our partners that a parliament, formed as a result of a laborious response from the ballot-boxes but also universally recognized as acceptable, is a parliament that is also legitimized to draw up the new constitution."
"We said, however, that we needed to overcome this block; it seemed to us that our words had been heeded with renewed attention and we had the feeling, as Commissioner Marín pointed out a short while ago, that in the days immediately following our visit, new political events took place."
"Nevertheless, there was no specific or material follow-up to the declarations made immediately after our visit and, since our return, there has still been no follow-up within parliament and the Committee on Institutional Affairs as regards working together on the new constitution."
"Simple declarations must be made: we need to insist that the Council and the Commission follow our tri-parliamentary mission with further measures."
"I have heard positive comments in this respect."
"We, as members of this Parliament, will have to comply with two commitments we have assumed in this respect: firstly, the formation of an international group of advisers with the task of contributing towards the definition of the status and content of the new constitution; and secondly, the observation of the parliamentary work in Albania."
"In a fairly delicate context, we wanted to illustrate the requirement that the three organizations should dedicate themselves to observing the parliamentary work, with the agreement of the Albanian parliament."
"Having said that, other things are also useful."
"To give an example, and addressing Commissioner Marín and the President-inOffice of Council in particular, I believe that we should establish roots in the territory because, although the national government has good intentions, we cannot take it for granted that its supporters throughout the country have the same good intentions of working towards national reconciliation."
"To use an image, there is still fire smouldering under the ashes!"
"We therefore need to ensure that democracy flourishes in the territory, at local level. I have heard talk of initiatives the Commission would support financially."
"In this context, I would suggest that financing be assigned to a particular twinning project between the Albanian local authorities and the local authorities of our Member States. This would create a network of connections that would allow democracy to exist at local level throughout Albania, and would help overcome the temptation to resort to arms, by establishing a common desire for reconciliation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can subscribe fully to 98 % of your statement."
"That does not happen very often, that our two sides are in such agreement, but on what you said about Albania I am almost completely in agreement with you."
"The fact is, Renzo and I were the two participants from this Parliament in this tripartite attempt at reconciliation. The fact is, however, that reconciliation in this country between the two hostile camps has not yet been achieved and will not be achieved for some time to come."
"It is constantly being undermined by both sides."
"The language alone is revealing."
"There, the leader of the opposition calls the parliament a Kalashnikov parliament."
"The Prime Minister publicly calls the opposition a terrorist group and their leaders are called criminals with immunity."
"It is therefore hard for a fruitful coexistence to flourish."
"As the then socialist opposition did two years ago, the conservative opposition is now boycotting the Parliament."
"We have always made it unmistakeably clear that a return to parliament is absolutely essential and it is also important for the opposition party, for it is only there that we shall listen to them."
"The joint action, as Mr Imbeni has said already, was important."
"It was unique in its cooperation and therefore it was of major significance to the Albanian public and the political representatives."
"We all listened and our conclusions took into consideration all points of view on the internal politics."
"The results included the fact that, firstly, amongst other things, the democratic place for decision-making was in the parliament and therefore the Democratic Party should finally return there."
"Secondly, the parliament must, however, observe the dignity of the individual member and adhere to the democratic rules of the game, and in this respect the observation carried out by representatives of the OSCE or the Council of Europe should be helpful."
"Thirdly, we also of course expect that the middle management staff, particularly in the legal field - and you referred to this earlier, Commissioner - which in recent years was trained with our money, are not arbitrarily thrown out into the street, but that use is made of their experience."
"Fourthly, Albania needs a constitution, particularly for important investment projects."
"According to existing law, the parliamentary committee should draw up the draft constitution, it should be accepted with a majority of two thirds and them - as they have committed themselves - a referendum by the public should decide."
"I think that the composition of the committee destined to carry out all these procedures must be somewhat improved."
"News in recent days reports, on the one hand, illegal police attacks on supporters of the Democratic Party, while on the other hand, the same event is represented as deliberate provocation of the police by the Democratic Party."
"I find myself unable to say which of these is right."
"It is very difficult to know from here but it proves one thing, that the fronts between the political camps are very firm and appear almost insurmountable and that force is the language of the politicians."
"A joint action, such as we have undertaken can only be implemented once."
"We do not churn them out on a conveyor belt."
"As you have rightly said Commissioner, it is the job of politicians in Albania now to take their own fate into their hands at last and, if it is at all possible - and I address this both to the Council and the Commission - I would make a heartfelt request for pressure from both sides. I do not mean gentle pressure but really energetic pressure, so that they finally get together in reconciliation and in the interests of the tormented people of Albania."
"Mr President, the situation and lot of Albania has often been debated in this House, and frequently with some intensity."
"Today, we are here with balanced and constructive common positions."
"These are mainly due to the successful mission of the ad hoc delegation which, with Mr Imbeni and Mrs Pack, recently visited Tirana. hey tried to bring the opposition back into parliament and succeeded in a first approach on issues of exceptional sensitivity, such as the working out of the new constitution amongst others."
"Special congratulations are due to them both."
"In any case, we have all expressed them on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and we meant it very sincerely."
"As has already been said many times, the situation in Albania remains fragile and fraught with tensions, even though some progressive steps have been taken."
"There are always incidents, as Mrs Pack also said earlier."
"Democratic awareness according to the Western European model is not yet the main factor in public life, and never has been, to this day."
"As for the European Parliament, regardless of any preference we may have for one side or the other, we must continue to support truly democratic procedures in Albania, offering our experience and assistance to the extent that we can, to help that country find its European orientation as soon as possible."
"In this respect, our joint motion expresses that intention and wish, and defines the objectives that must be achieved."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like to ask whether the European Parliament is to be informed about the talks you said were to take place on Monday regarding Albania at the World Bank."
"I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I must say that the joint resolution which has been circulated is a text which, I think, will attract wholehearted support from Parliament because it is well balanced and reflects not only common positions but also the common anxiety of us all about what is going on in Albania."
"In my view, the problem has become focused solely on the restoration of normal relations between the political forces in Albania."
"My opinion is that this can only be achieved through the correct operation of the Albanian parliament."
"Events or investigations which concern penal injustices that took place before the events of last year can often be used as a means to persecute political opponents, and that must be avoided."
"I must say that a very important proposal is the one included among those agreed by the tripartite delegation in which Mrs Pack and Mr Imbeni took part with parliamentarians from the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that is, the proposal that an advisory group should be formed."
"I would like to go still further and say that the advisory group in question should comprise not academics, not ex-cathedra specialists, but Members of Parliament who would alternate and could advise, in my view, on a day to day basis, how the Albanian Parliament ought to function."
"Albania must be approached very carefully, mainly because of the religious differences that exist."
"Despite its various religious persuasions, however, the people of Albania have lived for centuries as a single entity."
"Having lived in that area, I think that if the advisory group is set up it will be able to achieve a great deal on a day to day basis, giving advice about the operation of parliamentary committees, about what issues to put before the plenary Chamber, etcetera."
"It will also have the opportunity to make contacts, and most importantly, to offer advice about the formulation of a constitution which, as we have been told, the present government intends to submit to the Albanian people in a referendum."
"I hope all will go well."
"I hope this, because I am an optimist."
"Those people deserve better luck and wholehearted and devoted support from Europe's peoples and governments."
"It is not enough for the Commission and the Council to tell us how much money they are giving, they must also back the European Parliament's initiatives."
"Mr President, I think we all agree on one point, and that is that Albania is still in an emergency situation: the problems remain serious, arms are widespread - around one and a half million -, the Mafia continues to benefit - it is calculated that US$6 billion are handled by the Albanian Mafia - and the situation is still precarious from the point of view of reconstructing democracy."
"I believe that the road to be followed, as indicated by Mr Imbeni and strongly supported by Mr Pack, is to insist that the transition to democracy, which has just been delicately begun, can be followed, starting with the parliament, and therefore the insistence that the parliament explains its own tendencies."
"I would like to tell the President-in-Office of Council that we can also help a return to normality with a more complex, more fundamental policy."
"The Albanian question cannot be separated from the other questions in a particularly delicate area."
"When, at the recent Madrid Summit, the Balkans and Albania are, so to speak, cut off from a policy of safety, a policy of attention, that should be considered globally, mistakes are made."
"We are not without the means: the means are there."
"The other economic and financial questions should be aimed at implementing the programme presented by the government."
"They relate to socio-democratic infrastructures that should be established and I believe that, with the means we have made available, we can pressurize all parties into bringing Albania into a greater period of normality."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that, as the Members have shown, the state of emergency is, unfortunately, not yet over in Albania."
"The situation is anything but resolved and, for these reasons, we have to say that the action carried out by our representatives, Mr Imbeni and Mr Pack, together with the OECD and the Council of Europe, has been excellent, and the agreement signed by the parties, namely, the government powers and the opposition, is an important starting point."
"Unfortunately, however, we cannot be under the illusion that this is the answer to the problems."
"I repeat, it is an essential starting point for drawing up a new constitution, which is necessary at the moment; but a new constitution is not drawn up without the involvement of the opposition and, at the moment, the signs are unfortunately anything but favourable."
"One opposition party is currently saying that the agreement is a partial agreement, an agreement that can only be observed provided the Fatos Nano government nullifies all the measures it has taken since it came to power."
"This is obviously an impossible condition for the government to accept when the government has been prepared to ensure maximum transparency in the parliamentary action so that every right is provided for the opposition, an opposition which is entitled to one-third of the chairmanship and two-thirds of the deputy chairmanship of the parliamentary committees."
"The signs are not favourable at the moment: incidents and further use of arms have been seen in the north, while in the south the territory is still not under the control of the police force; the region around Tirana is beginning to show signs of intolerance owing to the shortage of adequate consumer goods and the lack of solutions to the economic problems it was hoped the new government would be able to resolve."
"In view of all this, the EU should commit itself much further to offering economic aid and aid aimed at restoring democracy and control in the region."
"Without this, there is a further risk that civil war will break out again."
"Thank you very much, Mr Tamino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.15 p.m., while awaiting Question Time scheduled at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is questions to the Council (B4-0017/98)."
"Question No 1 by Jens-Peter Bonde (H-0001/98)"
"Subject: Ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty"
"Is it true that the Amsterdam Treaty can enter into force only if all the Member States ratify the agreement? Will the Council of Ministers respect referendums held in several Member States?"
"In accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union, specifically Article N, the Treaty of Amsterdam shall come into force after being ratified by all the Member States, in accordance with the respective constitutional requirements."
"In certain countries this will indeed involve a referendum."
"I would like to thank Doug Henderson for a very clear reply, which I can recognise as a repeat of the reply which Mr Henderson gave to a previous question in the British House of Commons."
"It is of course enlightening that the Treaty has to be accepted by all countries to become law, and if a country does not ratify the Treaty, the countries which are interested in doing something new must call an Intergovernmental Conference. Then, 15 countries must sign to do something new, as has already happened when it was impossible for all the countries to agree to have a social protocol, but 12 signatures established closer cooperation for 11 countries."
"But everyone must sign to amend the Treaty."
"I am grateful to Mr Henderson for giving such a clear answer today."
"You say that the Treaty has to be ratified in accordance with the constitutional requirements of Member States."
"I would like people to know that in Ireland we will have a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty and already the EU Commission is interfering by sending out propaganda to members of the public."
"I would like some sort of assurance from the Council that this will not actually happen because it is an interference in the democratic process of a Member State."
"There should be no undue influence using European taxpayers' money to promote propaganda forcing people to vote in favour of the Treaty."
"It is up to the Irish people themselves to decide whether they want to vote in favour or against."
"I would like an assurance from the Council that the EU Commission will actually step aside from the process on this and allow the people to make up their own mind and that it will be in accordance with the constitution of Ireland which prohibits the use of public money to promote one side of the argument in a referendum."
"Can I say to Ms McKenna that this is not a matter for the Council; this is a matter that persons in Ireland including the government or the political parties who felt affected by it should raise with the Commission."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Question No 2 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0004/98)"
"Subject: Information gathering by the Member States"
"A number of authoritative European newspapers have reported that the British secret services gather information of a diplomatic, economic, technological and commercial nature in other Member States of the Union which is used, among other things, to improve the Government's negotiating position at meetings of Community bodies."
"In the Council's view, to what extent and in what manner are the final outcomes of meetings of Community bodies and their decisions, including those of the Council itself, distorted by such practices which enable certain Member States to be briefed in advance of the negotiating positions of their partners?"
"Can it confirm that such sensitive information is not passed on to third countries, particularly in the context of international trade and other negotiations or final preparations for the euro (e.g. ideas and proposals on the definitive rates of exchange of Community currencies against the euro), since if such information became public knowledge, it could have a huge impact on the international money markets?"
"In the Council's estimation, how many other Member States, and which, engage in similar information gathering?"
"Question No 3 by Nel van Dijk (H-0035/98)"
"Subject: Is MI6 spying on Britain's European partners?"
"Is MI6, the British foreign security service, spying on Britain's European partners with a view to collecting information which the British Government can use to its advantage in international negotiations?"
"Does MI6 record confidential conversations, and does it tap telephone calls ?"
"In what way are MI6's espionage activities directed at civil servants from other EU Member States consistent with the British Government's aspiration towards ""moral leadership' in Europe?"
"Does the Council share my view that a government which uses its security services to gather confidential information on its EU partners and their positions in international negotiations undermines the trust which Member States might have in each other and abuses the solidarity which the Member States might expect from each other in an ""ever closer union' ?"
"Are there other Member States which instruct, or allow, their security services to spy on their European partners?"
"Can the Council give an assurance that the European Parliament and the Commission are not the target of activities by MI6 or any other security service of any other Member State?"
"I am glad to link the questions."
"In my Presidency capacity, I have to say that intelligence matters are within the exclusive competence of national authorities."
"The Council has no information on such matters and is not in a position to respond."
"Mr President, brevity such as that of the President-in-Office's answers was characteristic of the Spartans in my country in ancient times."
"The Spartans were not regarded as models for civilization, nor for dialogue and debate."
"I ask the President-in-Office, and not of course in his capacity as a British minister, to tell me the Council's assessment of such practices, whether they take place, whether he has ever heard of that in his life."
"What is the Council's assessment? How does he characterize such activities and how can I, as a Member of this Parliament, have faith in the accuracy, seriousness and untaintedness of the debates taking place in the Council?"
"I was not a Spartan, I am much more an Athenian."
"I can only say that this is not a matter for the Council, whether it be from the Spartans, the Athenians, the new Spartans or the new Athenians."
"It is not a matter for the Council, and I just reiterate my previous response."
"You will understand that I can only interpret Minister Henderson's remarks to mean that he wishes to neither confirm, nor deny."
"Perhaps I should interpret this as a tacit confirmation of what is happening."
"But surely it cannot be the case, and I would really like to hear Mr Henderson's view on this - that the Presidency of the European Union has nothing to say, and has no opinion about the fact that one of its Member States is spying on the others to determine its strategy during negotiations?"
"I would really like to have a very clear answer on this."
"If Mr Henderson thinks the Presidency should have no opinion on this, then I would like know what the other ministers in the Council think about it."
"Secondly, much commotion has arisen over the échalon in which the United Kingdom and the United States are creating one strong line in order to eavesdrop on the whole world."
"Is this related, Mr President?"
"Does this échalon exist?"
"It is not a matter for the Council to speculate whether there is any new alliance between the United Kingdom or the United States."
"I can only say that the matter raised is not a matter for the Council and that Members of the House should not believe from my previous reply that a confirmation or denial was involved."
"Question No 4 by Angela Kokkola (H-0008/98)"
"Subject: Human cloning"
"Public opinion is disturbed at the decision taken by the American scientist, Richard Seed, to undertake experiments aimed at creating human clones, which is morally and scientifically unacceptable."
"In view of the above, will the Council say whether the necessary legislation exists at EU level to ban the cloning of human beings?"
"Even if it does, this is still not enough."
"Will it therefore also say whether it intends to launch an initiative to establish an international convention banning the cloning of human beings in order to protect citizens from the ""brilliant discoveries' of scientists who sacrifice the ethical dimension of the issue on the altar of scientific research and prestige?"
"I am pleased, in relation to Question No 3, to acknowledge the important influence and responsibility of the Council on this matter."
"The question of bioethics, and in particular protection of human dignity and of the individual, is a key consideration in Community research policy."
"Research into modification of the human gene is among the most sensitive ethical issues in the field of science and therefore requires constant scrutiny and clear limitations."
"This fact has been well understood in the European Union and its Member States for many years and has given rise to arrangements for the ethical supervision of human gene research, as well as to legal safeguards and limitations."
"The Community's Fourth Framework Programme on research contains an explicit provision that no support will be provided to projects which may contravene the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations or the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine."
"The provisions on biomedical ethics provide that no research into modification of the genetic constitution of human beings, or into human cloning, may be carried out."
"The Commission's proposal for the fifth research Framework Programme would extend the scope of this exclusion."
"The proposal is still under consideration in the Council but the honourable Member may rest assured that the rights and dignity of human beings will continue to be the guiding principle behind all decisions."
"As regards international initiatives, the Council will consider with interest any proposals which the Commission may make on this subject."
"My thanks to the Council's representative for his answer."
"With all due respect, allow me to say that I find it a little vague."
"You refer in some way to future plans."
"We see in the press every day how rapidly such experiments are progressing."
"And with all my esteem for research and biology and for the development of science, when these issues touch upon ethics and we may be approaching the cloning of humans, I do not hide the fact that it frightens me and I am not alone in this respect."
"Very many people and many scientists have expressed their opposition."
"I would therefore like to ask you, to the extent possible during your Presidency, to speed up the use of the means at your disposal, because otherwise I think it will be too late."
"I am aware of the concerns of the honourable Member on this matter and, indeed, of many others in this House and elsewhere."
"I can only draw attention to a sentence in my previous reply where I said that the provisions on biomedical ethics provide that no research into modification of the genetic constitution of human beings or into human cloning may be carried out."
"I hope that provides the assurance the honourable Member was looking for."
"I would like the President-in-Office to give the Council's position on the existing Commission arrangement whereby a group of advisers has been established to advise on the ethics of biotechnology and has already formed an opinion on cloning."
"Does the Council support the principle of a Europe-wide ethics committee being eventually established?"
"I say 'eventually' rather than 'immediately' , which gives some scope for the Minister to reply in a positive way."
"I can say to the honourable Member that I do not rule that out."
"It may be that is one way we can proceed on this matter."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 5 and 6 lapse."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Question No 7 by Glenys Kinnock (H-0017/98)"
"Subject: Arms trafficking in Burundi"
"What steps are being taken by the Council to halt the flow of arms from the European Union into Burundi, where they are likely to be used for the continuation of fratricidal fighting between armed groups and the perpetration of further massacres of civilians?"
"Question No 8 by Tony Cunningham (H-0018/98)"
"Subject: Arms trafficking in Burundi"
"Is the Council aware of allegations made in the Human Rights Watch Arms Project report: ""Stoking the Fires - Military Assistance and Arms Trafficking in Burundi' about the export of arms and military equipment, frequently originating in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, to the armed parties in Burundi via western Europe, and will it make a statement?Question No 9 by Arthur Newens (H-0019/98)"
"Subject: Arms trafficking in Burundi"
"Will the Council investigate allegations that arms manufacturers based in the European Union have supplied Hutu or Tutsi armed groups in Burundi and that the ammunition factory at Eldoret in Kenya, which was originally built by the Fabrique d'Armes de Guerre, a subsidiary of the GIAT Industries Group based in France, supplied ammunition to the Hutu militia in eastern Zaire?"
"The Council shares the honourable Members' concern about the effect on the situation in Burundi of the flow of arms from third countries and has noted the resolution on Burundi adopted by the European Parliament at its 15-19 December 1997 part-session."
"The Council has issued similar statements and declarations about the situation in Burundi, most recently on 7 January 1998."
"The Council has also noted the resolution on a code of conduct on arms exports adopted by the European Parliament at its 12-16 January 1998 part-session."
"The European Council in Amsterdam on 16-17 June 1997 underlined the vital role of concerted international efforts towards proper regulation of arms exports and called for the development of a coherent arms export control policy throughout the Union on the basis of the common criteria identified in the conclusions of the European Councils of 29 June 1991 and 26-27 June 1992."
"These criteria include, notably, respect for human rights in the country of destination."
"To this end the United Kingdom, in conjunction with France, has put forward a draft text for a European Union code of conduct setting high common standards for arms exports by Member States."
"The text is in two parts."
"Firstly, an elaboration of the eight common criteria agreed in 1991 and 1992 in line with the United Kingdom's national criteria which were then announced by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom on 28 July 1997."
"Secondly, a consultation mechanism providing for partners to circulate information about denials of export licences and requiring a partner to consult the denying partner before coming to a decision on whether to issue an export licence for essentially the same goods to the same client."
"Initial reactions have been strongly supportive and the aim is for the code to be adopted by a Council declaration during this Presidency."
"I thank the President-in-Office for doing a sterling job all day here in Parliament."
"I am not sure it has been entirely easy or pleasurable at all times."
"I should like to return to the issue of Burundi, which my question addressed."
"It is a fact that 36 % of Burundi's budget is currently being spent on defence; far more than they spend on health and education combined."
"Could the President-in-Office confirm that a Member State which has colonial links with that Great Lakes region of Africa is still unwilling to agree to either an international or a European arms sale embargo on Burundi?"
"Also, I should like to ask the President-in-Office whether it might not be a good idea to reactivate UNICOI, which was a commission of inquiry set up when we had the crisis in Rwanda?"
"Would it not be appropriate for us to extend its mandate to Burundi?"
"In my view - and I hope it would be the Council's view as well - it would assist us in our efforts to stop arms trafficking into Burundi and, indeed, within the Great Lakes area."
"I thank the honourable Member for her kind tribute."
"It is always particularly pleasurable to attempt to answer her questions."
"On the specific question that she raised, I am not aware of any European Union country that knowingly exports arms to Burundi and would block any measure taken to prevent such sales."
"If Mrs Kinnock has any information that could confirm the point that she was suggesting, then I would be very pleased to look at that information with a view to giving it further consideration."
"I should also like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"I would like to ask him if he has seen the information provided by Human Rights Watch showing that a great deal of activity has been going on, based in Ostend?"
"Does he not think that it is important that drastic action should be taken immediately to prevent any further arms from being supplied from Europe and that those people who are involved in this deadly trade should be brought before the courts forthwith?"
"We have spoken early today about the difficulties of arms suppliers to Iraq."
"They are just as bad in this case."
"Will the President-in-Office agree to pursue this matter directly?"
"I thank the honourable Member for his question."
"I can only refer him to my previous reply to the previous questioner."
"We are not aware that any sale of arms in the manner which he is suggesting is taking place."
"If he has information I would be very willing to look at it and make an assessment of it for further consideration."
"I know there are other questions on the agenda today about the overall question of arms control and I may be straying into that territory, but the reason why the Presidency believes that the conclusion of a European Union agreement on arms is particularly important is, among other things, to attempt to deal with the situation which has been suggested by the honourable Member."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Question No 10 by Patricia McKenna (H-0020/98)"
"Subject: Proposal for an EU code of conduct on the arms trade"
"The British Government has pledged to work for a European code of conduct ""setting high common standards governing arms exports' during its EU presidency."
"Four non-governmental organizations (NGOs) - Oxfam, Amnesty International, Safeworld and the British American Society Information Council - recently published a briefing document, outlining the essential standards which such a code of conduct should establish."
"The briefing argues that there should be no exports of military equipment to states with poor records on respect for human rights and to states which spend more of their GDP on the military than on health and education."
"Can the Council give details of what progress it has made in formulating a code of conduct on the arms trade?"
"When does it expect to have such a code of conduct completed?"
"Question No 11 by Elisabeth Schroedter (H-0116/98)"
"Subject: Introduction of an EU code of conduct on the arms trade by the British Presidency"
"Britain and France have been developing a common text for the code which has now been agreed."
"The proposed code is weak on consultation mechanisms, asking only for consultation between Member States directly involved in specific arms exports, and not between all fifteen Member States."
"What effect do you envisage the code as having on arms exports from the EU?"
"For example, will it stop the transfer of light weapons and armoured personnel vehicles to Indonesia or military attack helicopters to Turkey?"
"Unless there are rigorous controls on the end-use of arms and military equipment, legitimate exports can be diverted to repressive regimes and countries in regions of instability."
"End-use agreements should be legally binding contracts and a system of monitoring end-use should be implemented."
"What provisions will the EU code of conduct include for controlling the end-use for arms and military equipment?Question No 12 by Karin Riis-Jørgensen (H-0153/98)"
"Subject: Common EU code of practice for arms exports"
"What initiatives does the Presidency intend to take during the first half of the year to ensure that a common EU code of practice is drawn up for arms exports?"
"Will it explain the purpose and contents of a common EU code of practice for arms exports?"
"Will it also explain when it can be expected that any common EU code of practice will be implemented?Question No 13 by Jan Bertens (H-0161/98)"
"Subject: European policy on arms export controls"
"I welcome the initiative taken by the British Presidency with a view to tightening up the rules on arms export controls."
"The existing criteria, which date back to 1991/92, have been interpreted very broadly and diversely, with the result that there has been no question of a coordinated European policy on arms exports."
"Does the Council share my view that the criteria must be more concrete and less open to interpretation and that their implementation must be binding in order to eliminate the shortcomings of the existing criteria?"
"Does the Council also agree that multilateral consultation among the Member States is necessary to achieve effective implementation of the European export criteria?"
"What role has the Council assigned to the European Parliament with regard to the formulation of the new export control policy and practical implementation of the relevant rules?"
"What steps will the Council take to encourage the Member States to reach agreements on promoting the transparency and parliamentary supervision of arms exports policy?"
"As regards this proposed code of conduct, there are quite a number of deficiencies in it, for example the fact that only arms exporting countries will be able to call the shots on who buys their arms if this code of conduct is adopted."
"That means countries like Ireland, which has no major arms industry, will have little say in how the EU arms policy would be implemented."
"This seems to be a version of 'honour amongst thieves' in that it is the countries involved in the arms industry which will make the decisions, and countries which have an ethical position as regards arms exports will have no say."
"As well as that, there is a need for transparency, because commercial confidentiality means this subject will remain secret."
"With regard to the delivery of arms, they would be allowed into countries which have not signed international human rights conventions."
"The export to regimes with poor human rights records would be allowed if the weapons were to be used to protect the police."
"There are many oppressive regimes, such as Turkey and Indonesia, which could take advantage of this."
"I should like the President-in-Office to say that the Council is going to address these issues and will bring these points of concern into a code of conduct, otherwise it is just window-dressing."
"There are a lot of points raised in the honourable lady's questions."
"I do not accept that there are any major deficiencies in the code that is being proposed."
"This code is a major step forward which concentrates the minds of European Union countries on what their responsibilities are in relation to the sale of arms."
"It provides for a transparency so that those countries know what is happening in relation to the arm sales of other European Union countries."
"It also provides a mechanism for preventing one country selling arms to a third country when that third country has already been denied an importation facility by another European Union country."
"In other words protecting the integrity of the policy."
"People will always look for ways of circumventing regulations, codes and so on."
"That will always be the case."
"There is now a huge moral pressure on all the European Union Members, assuming that a satisfactory code is concluded, to deal with this matter in a completely new fashion."
"The question of the criteria which decides whether or not an arms sale takes place is essentially a separate matter."
"Where the arms are likely to be used, for example, for internal repression or external aggression, then those arms sales should not take place."
"The problem at the moment is that it does not prevent another country making the sale if one country decides that the potential importer does not meet those criteria."
"There is a period of consultation which is now taking place within the Union."
"It is an opportunity for any Member State, or any lobby within a Member State, to look at ways in which the code can be more effective and make their views known."
"I believe that the Council will have an open mind on how the code can be improved."
"I invite all Members of the Parliament, if they have views, to submit them through the appropriate channels so that they can be made known."
"The purpose is to ensure that we have a system with an internal integrity and I believe that what is currently proposed is a major step forward."
"Mr President, I am rather disappointed by the Council's answer, because we submitted our questions in writing in good time."
"These questions were very much more concrete than your answer, which you have just repeated for the third time."
"It is in fact a matter of whether, for example, it is possible that in future the Turkish government will as ever get weapons to fight the Kurdish population and to bombard the Kurdish population."
"Is that, as ever, possible?"
"This specific question was asked and we would like a specific answer."
"We have also asked you, what is more, in writing, whether you provide a check on the route and also a check on the end user, and how this looks in real terms."
"I would like to ask you to answer these questions, which were before you in good time, in terms as specific as those in which they were asked."
"I have one final question. You said there are positive reactions."
"From whom did these positive reactions come?"
"From the arms industry, perhaps?"
"I thank the honourable lady for her question."
"The aim of having a policy at European Union level is to try to have a consistency across the Union with a view to eventually having a wider consistency outside the European Union which is equally as important."
"At the moment I understand there are some European Union countries who have taken a decision that where there is a likelihood that arms sales to Turkey would be used for internal repression, then those sales will not be made."
"As mentioned earlier, the aim of the code is to try to bring about a consistency across the European level."
"There will be arguments about what is internal repression and to what extent there is internal repression."
"It would be impossible to eliminate arguments among European Union Members on an issue like that."
"There will always be borderline decisions on which there will always be arguments."
"The important thing about the code is that it establishes a common criteria and a way of ensuring that those common criteria are applied, although it must always include an element of judgement."
"I think those who are involved in the detail of those decisions will recognize the need for that judgement."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"I congratulate him on the fact that the British Presidency now wholeheartedly agrees with what we have been requesting here for so long."
"Yet there was one question you did not answer: which role does he think he will give to the European Parliament when a new export control policy comes into being?"
"On that point I wanted to ask - because I know that the Italians have made a proposal to draw up an annual report on arms exports - if this will be adopted by the British Presidency?"
"If not, why not?"
"If so, then I think this would be excellent."
"I would like to say in conclusion that it would seem better to me, when it concerns consultation about which countries does what with another, that this should not be so much a bilateral consultation, but a multilateral consultation, because only then will the code of conduct become a code for all countries."
"I can say to the honourable gentlemen that I agree with him that it is important to have a multilateral approach which is why this code has been proposed by the Presidency in the first place."
"I have also indicated that eventually it has to have a wider application than purely within the European Union."
"Otherwise it could still be undermined."
"It is important, as a first stage, that those who have strong views on those matters, including the honourable gentleman who clearly does, should concentrate efforts on persuading the governments within the European Union to support a strong code."
"Once this has been established we can then look at where else there could be consideration of some of these matters within the institutions of the European Union, including the Parliament."
"Mr President of the Council, above all I would like to thank you for these clear and precise answers which you have given, which show how Westminster is a good apprenticeship for all parliamentarians, especially, when you have one of the best Presidents of the current Presidency of the Council."
"Therefore I would like to say - and pardon me if I also make this remark - that in fact if it carried on like this we could finally get rid of stupid rule we have, whereby we can only ask one single question for each general sitting."
"My question is as follows: would it not be sensible, when we see that the major proportion of arms exports really do go again and again to the developing countries, to finally link development aid to arms purchase and inform the developing countries that development aid will be reduced as long as they use it for arms purchases."
"Thank you very much, Mr von Habsburg."
"I must say I sympathize with your concern about the two questions."
"I have raised this matter with the Bureau, who will examine it during their March meeting."
"In any case, I am grateful for your cooperation, as always, in improving Question Time. I now invite Mr Henderson to reply to Mr von Habsburg."
"I understand the point that has been made about developing countries."
"It would obviously be a misuse of aid if aid given for other purposes were used to purchase military equipment."
"There is bound to be an element of military equipment in the purchasing portfolio of a developing country."
"They need to have law and order internally and there is a need for defence externally."
"A judgement has to be made about that."
"Clearly if a developing country is spending all of its other resources on the purchase of military equipment and then relying on a certain amount of aid for social expenditure then there is something wrong in the balance of that country's use of resources."
"I think it would be right to have a dialogue with that country to make it clear that a reasonable balance of resources for legitimate law and order or external defence expenditure is something which is acknowledged."
"Aid directed to that country should not, in normal circumstances, be used for that purpose."
"In some developing countries where there has been a period of crisis and anarchy one of the first things to establish any economic recovery is to bring about a degree of law and order and it may be appropriate for aid expenditure to help to bring about that process."
"It may be that some hardware has to be part of that and indeed I know of some examples where that is the case and I would say it was legitimate."
"But that would be the exception rather than the rule."
"I wonder whether this really is a job for the EU."
"Is there not a great risk that this could involve a militarization of the EU cooperation?"
"I do not think that is in line with what most citizens consider to be our job."
"I would also like to ask what this means for neutral states like Sweden which have tough rules on weapons exports."
"In the EU there would be different rules to those we have, not necessarily worse, but certainly different and with a different basis."
"I also have some additional questions: What rules are going to apply?"
"Will they call for majority decisions or unanimity?"
"Who will make the decisions?"
"Finally, is it intended that the EU regulations should replace national regulations on weapons exports to other countries, or will the national regulations even be taken over?"
"I can say to Mr Lindqvist that there was in fact a discussion on some of those matters in the working group which took place yesterday."
"Clearly, for a framework agreement to come about there would need to be unanimity among Union Members on the way that the code would work."
"If the current provisions are eventually agreed, and this is repetition to some extent, a country which felt that the export of arms would mean the likelihood of those arms being used for internal repression or external aggression and which therefore blocked the sale of those arms would then be able to say to other countries 'this is a position which we have adopted' ."
"If another country then decides that they wish to take up those export orders they will be bound by the Court to come back to the original country which would then stimulate a dialogue on the rights or wrongs of the arms sale taking place."
"The criterion should be the purpose of the arms, not the state of the domestic arms industry and that is a very important criterion which is built into the code."
"The problem of the current situation where there is no code which is effective arises when one country says 'we do not believe that arms should be sold to a third country because of the likelihood of internal repression or external aggression, but if we do not sell them somebody else will and it will be trading our jobs for somebody else's jobs and therefore we should not make the decision initially to block the sale' ."
"The purpose of the code is to get over that very important issue because the arms industry is a big industry in a number of European Union countries."
"The workpeople in that industry are saying 'why should it be our jobs that are sacrificed if someone else is going to jump in and take the order up in another country?' ."
"This code is intended to answer that question."
"It does not mean it is the end of the matter."
"There need to be other industrial policies which Member States adopt, or which might be part of an employment strategy for the Union itself, which would also address the needs of those workers who are no longer able to get employment in handling those export orders and who have to look for redeployment conversion and so on."
"It is an important starting point but it is not the end of the matter."
"Can I say to the President-in-Office that I welcome as a good first step the code of conduct for the arms trade which is designed to prevent arms being used for either internal repression or external aggression."
"The President-in-Office has answered my question about how undercutting can be prevented in Europe between EU Member States when they are selling arms to a third country, but perhaps the President-in-Office would like to consider the question of end use which has often created problems in the past in tracing the eventual recipient country."
"Would he like to perhaps give a response on the issue of end use?"
"I am grateful to the honourable Member for that question because it raises another very real problem which has to be addressed in the code."
"My current thinking - although I do not have a completely closed mind on it - is that there has to be an element of discretion."
"Judgments have to be made not only on the likelihood of those arms being used for internal repression or external aggression but the likelihood of where that will happen."
"In other words, will the arms be resold to some other party and, when they are resold, would there be a high likelihood of internal repression or external aggression?"
"It is probably extremely difficult to deal with that other than on the basis of giving discretion to the nation which would initially be making the export order."
"However, it may be that there can be some facility for an exchange of views on this matter so that as full information as possible is always made available to all European Union Member States."
"It may be that an obligation should be written into the code that where a Member State believes there is a further follow-through trade in arms, that information should be made available to European Union Member States."
"I too welcome the UK Presidency's proposal for establishing an EU Code of Conduct on the arms trade."
"It is the logical development and follow-on from the United Kingdom's new ethical foreign policy and, although nothing is ever good enough for the Greens, I wanted the UK President-in-Office to know that the majority of Members in this House think this is a very serious and historic first step."
"I want to know if the Presidency will take back to the troika the eagerness this House has for consultation, for being able to follow the guidelines, for being able to see where best practice is developing as the code is progressed throughout the year."
"This House may want at some point to establish an annual debate on the code."
"Would the President-in-Office assure us that our eagerness to be involved is taken back to the troika?"
"I am very grateful to the honourable lady for her recognition that the general thrust of the proposed code would be broadly supported across the political divide of Parliament."
"That reflects a very practical understanding of some of the very difficult issues."
"I am very aware of them myself, as there is a large tank factory on the edge of my old constituency back in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in northern England."
"The people working in that factory and the sub-contractors are very aware of this difficult problem."
"They have as ethical a view of foreign policy as any one else but it is their job which is at stake."
"I have always believed that people like them and in other similar positions will be prepared to make a sacrifice, to look for diversification, if they know that their efforts are not going to be undermined by others."
"That is where the code is, in a very practical way, extremely desirable."
"I wish that those in this House who have doubts would recognize the importance of that point."
"I can assure the honourable Member that I will come back on the matter she has raised as I think it is an important issue which should have the widest consideration."
"Question No 14 by Mark Watts (H-0022/98)"
"Subject: Slaughter of sheep in France for the Eid-El-Kabir festival"
"In the light of previous infringements of Community legislation, and in particular those occurring in April 1997 when the mass ritual slaughter of sheep in France for the Eid-El-Kabir festival caused enormous public outrage, what efforts will the Council be making to ensure that no further infringements are allowed to take place either this year or in subsequent years?"
"The Council has no knowledge of the events referred to in the honourable Member's question."
"It would, however, take this opportunity to point out that it is primarily for the Member State concerned to ensure compliance with Community legislation in its territory and, where appropriate, for the Commission, pursuant to Article 155 of the Treaty, to take the necessary measures to ensure that any infringements of that legislation are duly punished."
"As the honourable Member will no doubt deduce from these remarks, this is a question which clearly falls within the competence of the Commission and not primarily of the Council."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his most helpful answer."
"I know that the Presidency shares my concern about animal welfare but I recognize its dilemma which is that it operates as the Council while the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties."
"Nonetheless, I would invite the Council to become familiar with this outrage that took place last year."
"We fear that it will occur again on 7 April, although the Commissioner himself informed this House that the infringements that took place last year were in breach of regulations and promised to act."
"So far he has failed to do so."
"I urge the President-in-Office to do his utmost to put pressure on the Commissioner to do his duty."
"Mr President, after your kind remarks and further kind remarks from the honourable Member I am going to have to have a rather large dining-table the next time I am in Strasbourg."
"But all the better, I suppose, for the restaurant trade in this fine city, and the fine restaurants in it."
"I believe there is an awareness already of the issue he raised with me this afternoon and, on the basis of that information, it should be possible for action to follow."
"I would be delighted to have dinner with Mr Henderson."
"I am not so sure that Mr Watts is going to want to have dinner with me after my supplementary."
"While, of course, we are entirely opposed to any form of unnecessary animal cruelty, I welcome the President-in-Office's caution in this matter."
"The Minister is well aware that much of the public outrage in the United Kingdom over these kinds of issues is synthetic indignation manufactured by groups on the extreme right."
"Last year in France there were problems around this festival but they were much exaggerated by people like Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front national , a man who has more concern about animal welfare than the death of 6 000 000 Jews in the Second World War."
"So I urge him to proceed with care."
"Yes, we need to ensure that these things are dealt with, but let us not allow them to be used by political parties beyond the democratic pale as an excuse to beat the immigrant population."
"I thank the honourable Member for his contribution."
"All I can say to him is that when we next have dinner, I know one item that we will not be discussing, if it is going to cause such terrible division among good colleagues."
"This is a very difficult issue because it brings into conflict concern for animal welfare and the need to respect the religious views of ethnic minorities."
"But there has to be a limit somewhere."
"I would ask the President-in-Office to assure us that the Council, bearing in mind what was agreed in a new article in the Treaty of Amsterdam on respect for animal welfare, will make clear that if minority groups expect that we should respect their religious rights - and, of course, we should - then the views of those who hold that deliberate cruelty to animals is morally offensive and unacceptable will also be respected."
"It was very encouraging when we had the British minister responsible for animal welfare, Mr Elliot Morley, here last month at the Intergroup for Animal Welfare and heard the positive view he expressed on the initiatives that will be taken under the British Presidency."
"So I hope for a positive response."
"Question No 15 by Jaime Valdivielso de Cué (H-0026/98)"
"Subject: Consumer protection"
"In view of the announcement that one of the priorities of the British Presidency will be consumer protection, can the Council state what measures will be proposed and what their orientation will be?"
"The Presidency has three key priorities for the Consumer Council: the Consumer Guarantees Directive; more effective enforcement of existing consumer protection; and improvements to the European home and leisure accidents surveillance system."
"Progress in these areas will help consumers in all countries."
"Firstly, the Consumer Guarantees Directive will give basic rights to consumers faced by unsatisfactory goods."
"The remedies in the directive - repair, replacement, reduction in price, refund - are easy to understand."
"People need to understand their rights if they are to exercise them."
"Consumers should thus be able to take full advantage of the single market in the way businesses can."
"In some countries consumer rights would be improved by the directive."
"In the rest, existing high levels of protection would remain."
"We await the European Parliament's first reading on the directive and are aiming for a common position at the April Consumer Council."
"There is no point in having consumer protection rules if they are not properly implemented and enforced."
"We want the April Consumer Council to examine this on the basis of a Commission report."
"To give one example, mechanisms for Member States to share best practice should make it easier to act against trading scams and to identify unsafe products."
"Our third aim is to improve the European home and leisure accidents surveillance system."
"This is used to gather accident data on which to base health and safety policy."
"Doing that European Union-wide means a larger population sample and more useful data."
"We are committed to ensure the system's continuation and to improve it, building on the best current national practice."
"I hope that we can count on the European Parliament's support to achieve these goals."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think it is interesting the way a framework has been developed for possible consumer rights or measures, as regards guarantees, basic rights, legislation, improvements to the system and consumer advice."
"But could you please state what specific measures the British Presidency plans to take in favour of consumers?"
"I am grateful for the question from the honourable gentleman but I have to say that I am not pleading guilty to his allegation."
"There is a very positive agenda."
"There is certainly a very heavy agenda for the April Consumer Council."
"The general thrust of all the proposals is that there should be minimum standards."
"This does not prevent any particular Member State deciding that they want to have better standards."
"There needs to be discretion on some of those matters."
"The important thing is to make progress and to bring in improved minimum standards so that all European citizens across the whole of the European Union can benefit in the way that businesses can from the single market."
"This is a very important principle and I believe it is one that will receive a large area of support from consumers and citizens throughout the whole of the European Union."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Question No 16 by Sören Wibe (H-0029/98)"
"Subject: The end of tax-free sales and its impact on employment"
"Tax-free sales on journeys between EU Member States are to end in 1999."
"A study has shown that this will result in a great many jobs, about 50 000 altogether, being lost throughout the EU."
"Has the Council discussed this matter and does it intend to do anything about it?"
"Can it, for instance, try to obtain a derogation for tax-free sales on ferries or, even better, seek to have the entire decision re-examined?"
"Question No 17 by Jan Andersson (H-0062/98)"
"Subject: Tax-free sales"
"The Council has decided that tax-free sales should end in 1999."
"When this decision was taken, a commitment was given to carry out an analysis of the impact on employment."
"However, no analysis has been forthcoming."
"Does the Council intend to ensure that the promised impact analysis is carried out before the decision ending tax-free sales enters into force?Question No 18 by Pat Gallagher (H-0157/98)"
"Subject: Job losses because of indirect tax increases"
"Representatives of those employed in the duty- and tax-free industry claim that a considerable number of jobs, up to 140 000, are at risk should the planned abolition of this trade proceed as is currently planned, and stressed their concerns to MEPs during a demonstration in Brussels in December of last year."
"As the Commission continues to question the validity of these claims, and at a time when unemployment is a priority throughout the European Union, would the Council confirm what steps it is taking to quantify the number of jobs at risk and to evaluate possible remedial measures?"
"As the honourable Members will know, when the Council adopted directives abolishing fiscal frontiers from 1 January 1993, it decided to put an end to tax and duty-free sales for intra-European Community passengers because retaining such sales would be inconsistent with an internal market without frontiers."
"Knowing this decision would require major changes in the sectors concerned, Council provided for a lengthy adjustment period from 1 January 1993 to 30 June 1999 during which tax and duty-free sales for intra-EC travellers could be retained."
"The Council currently has no plans to revisit its decision."
"The effect on jobs of ending intra-European Community duty-free is hard to estimate accurately and depends in part on the nature of the successive regime."
"Some estimates probably overstate the effect."
"Whatever the successive regime's nature, operators will still be able to make sales on a duty and tax paid basis."
"I would like to thank Mr Henderson for his answer."
"It is quite correct that the abolition of duty-free sales is a step towards the creation of the single market, but the single market is being created to provide economic benefits."
"Whatever we say, it is still the case that the question of the existence of duty-free sales has extremely little to do with economic benefits."
"If we abolish duty-free sales, to begin with we would incur costs in the form of 50 000 to 100 000 lost jobs."
"Secondly, a number of ferry lines would be closed, including one which runs between Finland and Sweden and affects my home community, and which in turn has repercussions for tourism in both countries."
"On the positive side we have some abstract economic gains which perhaps amount to a hundredth or a thousandth of a per cent of the gross domestic product."
"I would like to ask Mr Henderson the following: Is it really worth it for the sake of this small gain to see so many people made unemployed, and to anger a large proportion of the Union's population?"
"I thank Mr Wibe for his question but he is not really introducing any new information."
"These matters were discussed thoroughly in the early 1990s when the debate took place."
"I cannot really add more to the debate than I remember hearing at the time and which no doubt the honourable gentleman heard at the time."
"Thank you Mr President-in-Office."
"Since it is the case that different countries in the EU have different duties on alcohol, tobacco and perfumes, I wonder whether you could tell me where the duty should be paid when a vessel travels between two or three countries."
"Should it be paid in the country which has the highest duty or in the country which has the lowest duty?"
"Or could people even buy goods in a third country in the EU and pay the duty in the country which has the lowest duty?"
"It that is the case, is there not then a risk of tax dumping, and is it in that case a desirable development?"
"I listened to John Prescott yesterday."
"He said that as an ex-seaman he was concerned about the consequences of abolishing dutyfree sales."
"On that basis I would like to put the following question: would it not be reasonable to investigate the consequences in the area of employment and in the area of taxes, so that we really know what will happen before the decision comes into effect?"
"Mr Andersson, like Mr Wibe, is asking me to revisit the issues that were all very well aired when these matters were first discussed in the early 1990s."
"There is no intention, currently, on the part of the Council to reopen these matters."
"Regarding the question of taxation, yes, there are, as the honourable Member will know, different levels of consumption taxes in different countries within the European Union."
"The answer, in theoretical terms, is that the tax which was appropriate would be paid on the purchase of the product."
"There will no doubt be books and more books of Treasury and commercial law on those definitions."
"At the outset I should like to say that I am extremely disappointed at the response of the President-in-Office who continues to say that this will not be revisited."
"I believe a new Presidency coming into office - a new government - should at least look at this."
"He referred to the major changes, the long derogation period because of the changes."
"He must also remember that there were commitments given over the years that a study would be carried out."
"It is rather alarming that the President-inOffice is not in a position to give us a clear view of the effects that this might have."
"It does not surprise me."
"I do not think any politician or any President-in-Office will be able to do that without a study."
"We have been given that commitment and we have a duty towards the European citizens to give them that study."
"But it is now becoming patently clear that considerable difficulties will arise should the abolition of duty-free sales within the EU proceed as planned in mid-1999."
"The rules for applying and collecting VAT, excise duties on products sold and consumed, duty and tax paid on board the few remaining ferries in existence on intra-EU routes - that he referred to - are unclear."
"New arrangements are required."
"Let the President-in-Office tell us what arrangements are required and will be made in view of these changes."
"I understand how strongly Members feel about this issue."
"But on a technical level, the way in which the regulation will be introduced - the notification of which has already been given to Member States - it would be possible to find out the details from them rather than from me."
"The Presidency has no intention to revisit this issue."
"There have been a number of new governments elected throughout the whole of the European Union in recent months."
"It would be open to any of those new governments to raise the issue at the Council of Ministers."
"It would then be a matter for the Council as to what kind of response would be given."
"Duty-free income is of major importance for ferry traffic between Sweden and Finland in the Baltic."
"North of the Stockholm area - you could say that Stockholm is in southern Sweden - there is only one scheduled ferry link."
"That goes between the beautiful city of Umeå in Sweden and Vasa in Finland."
"It is most uncertain whether this ferry traffic will survive a removal of duty-free sales."
"That would mean that the heavy lorry traffic which takes this route would have to travel hundreds of kilometres extra with great economic and environmental costs for this area in northern Sweden and Finland."
"In addition, old historic ties between these areas would be broken."
"Furthermore, interregional aid is being received for cooperation between these areas in Sweden and Finland."
"My question is this: does the Council have any objection to the Swedish and Finnish governments intervening and providing direct state aid to maintain this traffic if it cannot survive when duty-free sales are abolished?"
"I can say to the honourable Member that it would be a matter for the operators to decide whether or not they felt that a subsidy was necessary."
"It would then be a matter for the Finnish and Swedish governments to decide if a subsidy should be given to them, and it would then be for the Commission to decide whether or not the subsidy was in accordance with the rules of the European Union."
"This is really funny."
"Back home in Sweden the Social Democrats love to raise taxes both on work and alcohol."
"I am therefore a little surprised by the argument which we are listening to here."
"I would just like to tell the Council to stand firm."
"There should not be tax advantages for certain sectors. Instead, we must have competition on equal terms."
"It should not be the case that Europe should try to create new jobs through people getting drunk on a load of ferries."
"I have interpreted that as a comment rather than a question."
"I wish to congratulate the President-in-Office on the brevity with which he answers questions."
"If only colleagues were as brief in asking their questions."
"My question is brief."
"He will be aware of the status of the President-in-Office."
"Indeed he has used the very words Gordon Brown used when he attended the Economic Committee: ' no plans to revisit this issue' , he said, and I hope that the Presidency will long stick to that."
"My question, however, relates to the statement yesterday by Mr Prescott, also President-in-Office of the Council, that he is concerned about duty free and the consequential effects of its abolition."
"Who is speaking for the United Kingdom Presidency, Mr Prescott, the President-in-Office present today or the President-in-Office of the Economic and Finance Ministers?"
"I am not sure that brief answers will help me in future if it means I get these kinds of questions."
"I am speaking for the Presidency today, and on any occasion where there is an official event the responsible minister speaks for the British Presidency."
"The British Presidency's position is determined by the British government through its relationship with other European partners at all levels."
"Our colleague, Mr Sjöstedt, mentioned one of the most threatened ferry lines and spoke of the beautiful city of Umeå. I hope that you think the city of Vasa is equally beautiful."
"I would like to ask the Council if it is true that in the Commission there is a list of the most threatened ferry lines."
"Has there been a discussion about whether the Council could take up these issues?"
"In addition, I would like to ask the President-in-Office what attitude the Presidency has towards contributing to an extension if other countries raise this issue in Ecofin?"
"For example, the Irish government has expressed a desire to take such an initiative."
"I hope that you take into account that the situation has changed compared with the situation in 1991, particularly as far as unemployment is concerned, which is something Mr Wibe also raised."
"I can say to Mrs Thors that I am not aware of any list but we have a transparent Presidency and if there is a list I will be happy to see it."
"We are always happy to discuss any issue that any responsible Member wishes to raise."
"In view of what the President said earlier, I must declare an interest, in that I had dinner with the President-inOffice last night."
"I hope that will mean I get an even more detailed answer."
"The President-in-Office mentioned that the decision was taken some years ago leaving operators six or seven years to phase out duty-free."
"Does he therefore not agree that it is highly irresponsible of the tobacco and alcohol industries to be lobbying the way they have and spending millions to try to have this decision reversed?"
"They are also trying to whip up consumers to take part in their campaign."
"Does he agree that if governments have money to spare they should not use it as a tax break for the alcohol and tobacco industries, especially a ludicrous tax break which is only available to frequent international travellers, such as myself, who benefit disproportionately?"
"Does he not agree that would be a total misuse of public funds?"
"The clear conclusion for me is to take people for dinner after they have asked the question and not before."
"I have to say to the honourable Member that, like colleagues who raised matters at the beginning of this discussion - albeit from a different viewpoint - he is revisiting issues which were discussed in the early 1990s."
"The Council has no further comments to make at this time."
"I will try to be helpful to the President-in-Office by providing him with some arguments as to why this matter should be revisited."
"Firstly, excise duties have not been harmonized as promised."
"Secondly, independent studies are now showing that thousands of jobs will be lost throughout the Community."
"Thirdly, unemployment is now our top priority; it was not back in 1991."
"Although I accept that he cannot change the Council's position tonight, but could he not tonight agree to find space on a Council agenda to allow an opportunity for our Irish friends to put this issue to the Council with that fresh information so that it can be reviewed in the light of that information?"
"If abolition goes ahead, what advice would he give to the ferry companies operating in my constituency between Dover and Calais?"
"What tax rates do they apply?"
"French rates, British rates or international rates?"
"The Council has yet to really think about the post-1999 situation."
"I invite the President-in-Office to do that if he can."
"There were a number of issues raised by the honourable Member, most of which were returning to the debates, which took place in the early 1990s and have been covered in the past by the Presidency, and positions adopted."
"As far as I am aware, there was no link in the decision between the change in the regulations on duty-free and any consideration of taxation."
"They are two separate issues with no link."
"So I do not think that argument can be put."
"That is not to say that the issue of different levels of taxation should not be examined as an issue worthy of some consideration - but not linked to this particular issue."
"Different Member States within the European Union will have different views on those taxation questions."
"It would be open to any government within the European Union to raise the issue in Ecofin or at the General Affairs Council if they were so minded."
"It would be up to the other Members of whichever Council it was to make whatever response was appropriate at that time and in the circumstances of how the issue was being raised."
"But unless that happens, I can say that the Presidency has no intention of reopening this issue which we believe was settled."
"Mr President, this is something which cannot wait."
"I have been invited to Aberdeen Airport next Monday and I wondered whether the President-in-Office could give me advice as to what to say to the people there, or would he like to accompany me to explain to them what is going to happen to their fare structure and to the jobs they fear they will lose?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would request you that private invitations be made outside the Hemicycle, otherwise it wastes time."
"We have only four minutes left, and I hope we can deal with one more question without the President-in-Office missing his plane."
"Question No 19 by Ulla Sandbæk (H-0030/98)"
"Subject: Environmental quality of EU overseas aid"
"What plans has the UK Presidency of the Development Council to address the need to improve the environmental quality of EU overseas aid, particularly for projects in sectors such as energy, mining, transport and the private sector?"
"What means would it propose to achieve this improved environmental quality, in the light of the existing fundamental lack of capacity within the Commission?"
"The Presidency considers that environmental protection is an integral part of the development process."
"Lasting elimination of poverty requires environmentally sustainable solutions."
"Poor people are most reliant on natural resources and most vulnerable to environmental degradation and mismanagement."
"If natural resources are not managed sustainably, continued economic growth will not be possible."
"We need to help developing countries integrate environmental concerns into their decision-making."
"In particular we will support their efforts to prepare plans and policies for sound management of their natural resources and national strategies for sustainable development."
"The intermediate targets for sustainable development, based on United Nations conventions and resolutions, anticipate the implementation of these national strategies in all countries by the year 2005 so as to ensure that current trends in the loss of environmental resources are effectively reversed at both global and national levels by the year 2015."
"Relevant action planned under the Presidency of the European Union will include endeavouring to secure commitments from the Commission and Member States to promote national strategies for sustainable development in developing countries and to adopt measurable targets, especially in sustainable development and poverty reduction, and to help increase the effectiveness of these funds."
"A Council regulation was recently adopted on environmental measures in developing countries in the context of sustainable development, along with a resolution on environmental assessment in development cooperation."
"This provides for the mainstreaming of environmental concerns in project and programme preparation, as well as at the strategy and policy levels."
"In that case, I would like to repeat the last part of my question: ' What means would it propose to achieve this improved environmental quality, in light of the existing fundamental lack of capacity within the Commission?'"
"But I do not think that I was given any actual indication at all of how to remedy the situation, given the Commission's lack of capacity at present."
"In a nutshell, how can we ensure that priority will be given to integrating the environment in implementing the EU's overseas aid programmes and, in view of this, will there be incentives which will be sufficiently effective to ensure that integration also takes place in practice?"
"I thank the honourable Member for her question, but I can only refer her to my previous answer which is that there are a number of different ways in which improvement can be brought about."
"The Commission has an important role in identifying how they can monitor schemes where there is an environmental aspect to them, and how they can ensure that the best environmental practice is involved."
"All of us have an opportunity, when we begin to renegotiate the Lomé mandate, to include a consideration of the important matters which she raises."
"Since the time allocated to questions to the Council has now expired, Questions Nos 20 to 59 will be dealt with in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Air transport liberalization"
"The next item is the report (A4-0015/98) by Mr Seal, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the impact of the third package of air transport liberalization measures (COM(96)0514 - C4-0602/96)."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for this report, I have to say that it is a disappointing report; not in the way it is written - because that is very good - but because as rapporteur I cannot examine the success or failure of air transport liberalization fully without examining the social consequences."
"The Commission promised to publish results of a study they commissioned last October."
"I understand it has just been issued this week."
"So I ask the House to review the results of this report, to review the apparent results of liberalization, bearing in mind that the social effects of that liberalization have still to be taken into account."
"The rest of liberalization in the air transport industry is a bit like the curate's egg: it is good in parts."
"We have some cheaper fares, but we have also some increased fares."
"We have some increased competition; we have some new airlines coming forward; but we have a decline in safety and we have some frightening alliances on the horizon."
"If we look at cheaper fares, then several no-frills airlines are offering cheaper fares such as Easyjet, Debonair, Virgin Express."
"Even British Airways has set up a separate company to offer such no-frills deals."
"These, however, are mostly based around the United Kingdom."
"We need to extend some of these companies to the rest of the European Union."
"I wish them luck and I commend what they are offering."
"However, these lower fares must not be at the expense of cutting safety or worsening working conditions."
"That is why we need to examine the social effects of liberalization."
"Even with the larger airlines, business fares have dropped on routes where there is competition."
"But when you look at these fares, even though they have dropped, they are still too high."
"There is still an unbelievable complexity of fares."
"We have got PEX, superPEX, Euro-fares, economy, full economy, business class, and so it goes on."
"Buying an airline ticket should be simple; it should be straightforward."
"It is not."
"Passengers should be able easily to find information on the various service provided for different fares."
"They cannot."
"Even though we have got air traffic increasing globally by 7.9 % a year, most people flying are having more difficulty getting the right fares."
"Safety must be assured."
"If we look at some of the examples: British Airways removed safety doors from some of its planes to put in more seats."
"This was not a good move in terms of safety and it was a disastrous move for them as far as PR is concerned."
"We have a situation now where pilots are flying longer and longer hours."
"Some of them are flying 17 hours in a day."
"That must affect safety."
"Cabin crews are working longer hours for less money and that must compromise safety."
"This is the unacceptable face of liberalization."
"Liberalization does have its merits but it is not defect-free."
"We need controlled liberalization."
"By that, I mean we need to put in place preventive measures to avoid the cut-throat competition that would lead to monopolies the way it did in the United States and in Australia."
"Their services, consequently, deteriorated."
"We need a balanced liberalization that will benefit passengers, shareholders and workers in the industry."
"We need to encourage new entrants and to ensure they are not wiped out by the larger companies before they can get going."
"To do that we need to solve the slot problem - the problems at airports which they have too much traffic."
"This is the subject of a separate report that has come into this House, but it needs solving if liberalization is to continue."
"We need to ensure that the newly emerging airlines and the ones that are offering the reduced fares can get slots so that they can continue and can also fly between some of the regional airports."
"We also need to look at the alliances that are proposed and in place between the US and European carriers."
"We need to ensure that these alliances do not destroy our European airlines."
"Global arrangements must allow the European airlines to compete and passengers to enjoy the benefits of this competition, but not at the expense of their workforces."
"Liberalization has not been as effective as promised."
"But the slower, controlled approach is desirable and must extend to all parts of the European Union."
"If it is to continue, we need to solve the slot allocation problems and to protect new entrants."
"But we cannot - and I, as rapporteur, cannot - assess the impact of the third liberalization package until we know the social consequences of this stage of liberalization."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as draftsman of opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I agree with the basic statements in Mr Seal's report and I thank him sincerely for his report."
"In addition, even if, as he has rightly commented, the Commission knowingly, unknowingly, consciously, or unconsciously has concealed its report on the social consequences, his report is nevertheless a valuable one and I hold Mr Seal in very high esteem."
"It is true that the air transport liberalization finalized in the past year has completely opened the Single Market to this field and all of us, the actual consumers, are gradually noticing the advantages."
"National air transport markets were opened up, competition is allowed, even if it is sometimes a little bit strange that an airline from country A has flown cabotage for years in country B without covering its own costs, without making a profit and survives."
"Well, we shall see if this is actually possible in the long term."
"Also, the number of routes serviced has risen, the number of operating airlines has risen, yet nevertheless the planes have to a large extent been filled."
"In that respect, I believe that liberalization has succeeded."
"My dear Mr Seal, I do not believe that the safety of passengers has been put at risk in any way by the liberalization of the air transport market."
"All the accidents which have occurred have been outside the area of the European Community and not within it."
"Of course, the Commission also offers us a glimpse into the areas which have not yet been dealt with, into tariffs, the limitation of capacity, the cost of flight services and access to the market."
"The Commission is surely right when it says that on many intraCommunity routes, and above all the internal domestic routes, there is still no competition."
"But Commissioner, I believe that in the case of many routes which today are not even profitable for a single airline - particularly those in peripheral regions - we cannot expect competition, because nobody as it were wants to lose money."
"That is what we must realize."
"In that respect, I believe that the Commission has come to the wrong conclusions."
"I believe that many internal routes are simply not profitable because of insufficient passenger numbers and will not attract competition."
"What I also agree with in Barry Seal's report is that the tariff structure is something over which the normal consumer can have no overview."
"The various cheap and cheaper tariffs and special offers which the airlines offer are simply too difficult to understand."
"For clever business people and people who have a good travel agent, maybe they can cope, but not normal citizens."
"That, I believe, must change."
"I would also like to say something about competition and about the alliances."
"I do not completely share the view of my colleague, Barry Seal."
"I believe the European airlines only have a chance in alliances with other partners in other continents."
"I do share his view that we must be watchful that American partners do not drive our European lines to the wall in these alliances, but we also cannot let the Directorate-General IV see the Single Market as a total area in which it will judge the competition situation."
"We must look globally at the question of market restriction, competition and cartel rights, because air traffic also takes place globally in alliances."
"You all know that the airlines make most profit on the North Atlantic route and not on internal European routes."
"In this respect, we must ask the Commission - and Karel Van Miert will probably take this into account - to regard the alliances not only as a danger but also as an opportunity for the European airlines to join in global competition. I hope that Neil Kinnock will also say something on his view of the alliances."
"Finally, I would like to ask the Commission: when will we get the proposals for discussion and decision which are still outstanding?"
"I am referring here to the question of the slots."
"I am not yet sure when the long-since announced package on the slots will be placed before us, Commissioner."
"It needs to be discussed."
"We should, Mr President, also discuss the question of flight management."
"There are in fact still too many problems for the passengers and for the airlines, because air control in Europe is simply organized on a pre-Europe basis."
"That must be changed."
"Perhaps you can also say something about this, Commissioner, since the free market can only be effective for environmental protection and our citizens if the air space is used efficiently."
"Mr President, we welcome this opportunity to discuss the impact of the third package of our transport liberalization measures and, in particular, I wish to thank Mr Seal for the work he has done on this communication."
"I accept that some progress has been made but I would point out to the Commissioner that there is still no level playing field and the market remains distorted."
"The British Presidency of the Transport Council talks of a people's Europe."
"So perhaps within this people's Europe we could see a stop to state aids now to ensure that there is a level playing field and fair competition between the carriers."
"In their reports both Mr Seal and Mr Sindal have referred to the problems of slots, and it is recognized that generally the overall capacity of slots both in the air and at airports is a problem."
"I would make a plea to the Commissioner tonight on the question of new entrants."
"While I personally accept the priority should be to encourage new airlines on existing routes, I would argue that where there is no new airline which wishes to compete, an existing airline should be allowed to operate a new route."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could consider that in the context of his slot-allocation proposals."
"As the Member representing Stansted Airport in North Essex and South Suffolk, I particularly welcome the new entrant, the British Airways carrier which is to be called 'Go' , to operate from Stansted Airport."
"We are not sure yet where it is going but I am sure it is going to mean greater choice, lower fares and be the airline that we all welcome."
"All of us would like to see a people's Europe and true liberalization in air transport and I hope that both this Commissioner and the British Presidency will complete the single market by June, giving a greater choice of routes and carriers and lower fares for travellers."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commissioner and to thank the rapporteur for his report."
"I wish also to state that I speak this evening on behalf of Mr Niall Andrews who wanted to speak on this subject but had to return to Dublin unexpectedly."
"The free movement of labour is one of the basic tenets on which the European Union relies and it is therefore up to us, the elected representatives of the European Union, to ensure that all our citizens have assess to affordable and speedy transport between the Member States of the Union."
"Airport charges play a pivotal role in allowing airlines the financial scope to offer customers low cost travel."
"The issue is one of particular importance to Ireland, as it is the only island state in the Union and relies heavily on the availability of low cost airfares."
"Through the air transport liberalization programme the European Union has taken steps to create the climate necessary for airlines to offer competitively priced airfares to the citizens of Europe."
"The air transport liberalization programme, which culminated in full liberalization of the market in 1997, has undoubtedly brought many benefits to consumers both in terms of access and cost."
"However, a commercially successful Irish airline competing in the European market, Ryanair, is currently engaged in a protracted trade dispute with its employees arising from the company's refusal to recognize or negotiate with the trade union chosen by some of the employees to represent them or to cooperate with the national industrial conciliation procedures which have been established to resolve such disputes."
"Ryanair, whose owners and senior managers had been very substantial financial beneficiaries of air transport liberalization, must immediately enter into dialogue with these employees who seek to be represented by a trade union of their choice and to utilize the resources of the national procedures that exist."
"I am concerned that this employer's behaviour may be symptomatic of a wider problem whereby the rights of vulnerable groups of employees are being abused in the aftermath of market liberalization and in the absence of adequate corresponding enforceable social protection."
"Could I call on the Commission to conclude and publish as a matter of urgency its promised assessment of the social impact of liberalization of the air transport sector, including the right to free negotiation, free association and collective bargaining."
"Mr President, it is a pity that the rapporteur has sung his own praises because otherwise I would have done so and coming from me that would have been even more exceptional."
"However, I have to say that his report is excellent, even if in his contribution tonight he possibly concentrates a bit too much on the social consequences given that aircraft crews and pilots are among the best paid workers in the world."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the Commissioner's attention to a few things which to my mind require some improvements in this sector."
"Firstly, there is the issue of state aid."
"I recall the discussion Mr Kinnock had with us in the Committee on Transport and Tourism when he took office, and in which he promised emphatically - I would almost say, with his hand on his heart - to put an end to state aid."
"Well, Mr President, state support is still continuing, and I want to state this emphatically, unfair competition in particular is perpetrated by companies such as Iberia, which allows its subsidiary Viva Air to work below cost price, and in doing so makes the market situation almost impossible for all sorts of other commercially operating companies and companies operating without government support."
"It should also be said that Air France, time and time again, cannot resist making life very difficult for new entrants onto the market in France."
"But on that, at least, the Commission took some action."
"Secondly - and I here I would like to ask the attention of the Commissioner's staff, who are excellent, incidentally, because I would like a reply to my question if not during the next few days, then in writing if necessary - I am being told that in Italy the use of the seventh freedom, - I am not talking about cabotage, that is going reasonably well - the transport of a Community company to a third country, is alleged to be impossible. This is because the Italians are demanding that this should only be an option when a company is established formally and legally in Italy, and not only has a company there, but also permanent equipment, in other words, aircraft and staff."
"This contravenes what is being requested in the seventh freedom."
"If we have to meet these kinds of conditions, we would rather grant the transport to companies from third countries, such as Egypt and Senegal, for instance."
"Mr President, I would like to raise a last point, and this concerns airports."
"I believe that if in Europe we are going to have competition in the aviation sector under the kind of circumstances we have at the moment, and in particular the environmental circumstances, where there are no common standards on noise levels on and around airports; companies start to compete with each other at the expense of the people because certain airports can take on extra passengers, because they ignore environmental and noise standards, while others do not."
"I would also like see to some harmonization in this area in Europe."
"Mr President, I have one final point."
"I would ask the Commission to pay more attention in its competition policy to networks rather than to specific lines."
"Mr President, we would like to place the environmental considerations at the heart of the European Union's decision-making process."
"Integrating environmental issues into all policy areas of the European Union will be a major task, but one that we have to face."
"We believe we can deliver a more sustainable transport policy, and we are all agreed that it is essential to cut CO2 emissions from transport, which are growing faster than in any other sector."
"This is of course the Green group droning on about the environment again, is it not?"
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism is quite happy to integrate the environment into transport policy, as is rapporteur Seal."
"But let me tell you, Mr Seal, that I did not make up my first four lines: they were spoken yesterday by your fellow party member Mr Prescott, who was here as President-in-Office of the Council, and he mentioned transport and the environment as the most important environmental issue of the British Presidency."
"But you, on the other hand, Mr Seal, do not manage to mention the word environment even once in your report."
"You, who blame the Commission for devoting a mere nine lines to employment, seem to have quite a blind spot when it comes to the environment."
"And let no one claim that air transport liberalization and increase in pollution from aeroplanes are not related."
"Competition has made flying cheaper, and Mr Seal points this out in his explanatory statement."
"That is nice for travellers, but bad news for the descendants of the travellers, because cheap tickets lead to more passenger kilometres and that leads to more pollution."
"The resolution predicts an annual increase in air traffic of 6 or 7 %."
"If we assume optimistically that half of this growth can be absorbed by technological progress, then we are still left with an increase in CO2 emissions from aeroplanes of at least 3 % a year."
"Did we not agree in Kyoto that CO2 emissions should come down, and that aviation should do its bit towards this?"
"Clearly this all remained in Japanese to Mr Seal and my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I would like the Commission to tell us whether it has proposals to reduce CO2 emissions from aviation."
"And, by the way, how are the studies on kerosene tax and other levies progressing?"
"Are environmental agreements part of the additional measures which, according to page 22 of the Commission's statement, are missing in the present aviation agreements between the Member States and the US?"
"Will the Commission ask the Council for a mandate to negotiate with the US not only about open skys, but also about cleaner skies?"
"I would also like to know if the subject of aviation and the environment is on the agenda of the next two Environment and Transport Councils."
"If not, then I will have to conclude that although we may be trying the tame the car, the aeroplane has become Europe's holy cow."
"Mr President, on 1 April 1997, liberalization of the internal market for civil aviation was completed - at least on paper."
"This occurred without as much as a whimper, so that the Dutch press spoke of a 'whispered Big Bang'."
"No cutting competition broke out between the big carriers, and ticket prices did not drop dramatically."
"Still, the structure of the aviation market in Europe has altered fundamentally over the past ten years."
"In the European Union market the large airlines are regrouping."
"A number of associations have grown modestly, and the market has become more dynamic."
"This is evident from the emergence of low-budget companies, amongst other things."
"Tickets on routes where there is competition have now also become cheaper."
"The fact that liberalization passed off peacefully is also the result of the spectacular growth aviation has sadly undergone over the past few years."
"This meant that there were no large scale job losses, despite a constant drive for more efficiency."
"The Commission's report deals primarily with efficiency and competition in aviation."
"The Commission rightly states that substantial savings can be made in groundhandling and air traffic control."
"But I believe that in future fair competition between different modes of transports must be looked at."
"Compared to passenger transport by rail or bus, aviation is still subsidized in disguise through duty-free sales and cheap kerosene."
"I think it is right that duty-free sales are soon to be abolished for flights within the European Union, but more efforts are needed as regards fair competition between different means of transport modes."
"That is why the introduction of a tax on kerosene within the Union is urgently required."
"Tax-free kerosene in an internal market, with apologies to the interpreters, is truly ""swan mad' ."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"I believe that the report enables us to give a sound opinion on liberalization and to deal with the relevant subjects specifically."
"I would like to point out several aspects I believe to be important."
"It was said that numerous companies have entered the market, remaining there without being competitive."
"In actual fact, many have not survived."
"Although, from an economic point of view, this may be considered negative, from the point of view of security it may be considered positive."
"Liberalization has not completely shattered the security and social guarantee mechanisms."
"However, there are contradictions and problems, particularly as regards working hours, the relocation of companies - which can have a negative effect on human resources from third countries -, and the management of services with agencies outside the EU which we naturally have to monitor carefully."
"In effect, the system has had positive results."
"I am convinced that we should take into account the reorganization process begun by the national companies. This reorganization process has been favourable and has made it possible to face the competition specifically, even leading some to highly innovative ideas, such as the company Alitalia, whose operators and workers are personally committed to the company management and also take part in company activities."
"These are highly important and significant aspects."
"State aid has made this reorganization process possible."
"I believe that proper aid has been provided and that they now possess a market opening and the ability to withstand the competition."
"However, I would like to deal with another aspect that needs to be highlighted."
"In some ways, competition has been more focused on the ground services and airport services than on the specific system of airline liberalization."
"It has to be admitted that we still have major problems as regards the airlines: I am not convinced we need to continue in the same way, for example in relations with the USA."
"The open sky treaties should continue far more specifically because we need to extend the reorganization of the European airlines to the global market, to include therefore the competition within the American market, which we are prevented from doing at the moment."
"I believe that provides a strong limitation to the mechanisms of international competition."
"That is why the liberalization of the open sky systems and the ability to liberalize air space are important."
"We are faced with an air space that is strongly conditioned by the military systems, even today."
"Unfortunately, nowadays, we are still talking of war and the obstacles it might establish - I am referring to Iraq, of course. We will still have a complete violation of air space available."
"This is a dramatic point. It would be advisable for air space for the civilian system to be increasingly more available."
"The aspect of air traffic control has also been pointed out."
"We cannot go on like this any longer!"
"It is possible to make marked savings and establish strong coordination in the control sector."
"To conclude, Commissioner, I am in favour of the measures and I believe that the next action relating to airport duties will provide us with further capacity to face the market and to support the social mechanisms providing guarantees for workers."
"Mr President, the liberalization of the aviation industry has been taking place for decades."
"It is a positive and necessary development to satisfy the desire of a growing number of passengers."
"In the assessment now being made, the Commission does not see any dramatic changes in the development after liberalization."
"That means that the large airlines still remain and that foreign competitors have not ousted domestic operators to any large degree; nor have there been any dramatic price reductions."
"Clearly, if that is what we want to bring about through liberalization, we can say we have succeeded."
"But if prices have not been reduced and accessibility for passengers has not increased, I am drawn to the conclusion that liberalization needs to be taken further."
"There is a need for more competition and more operators in the European air transport market, not fewer."
"Today there are far too few airlines dominating far too many routes, and these airlines are constantly entering into increasingly sophisticated cooperation agreements."
"In practice, this continues to disable competition in the air transport market."
"I am convinced that the necessary development has only just begun."
"Satisfying the passengers' demands calls for increased accessibility and lower prices."
"We need to open up to competition and create the conditions for substantially more players than there are today in this sector."
"Together this will enable the development which will allow us to satisfy passengers' demands by the year 2000."
"Mr President, unlike Mr Stenmarck, I do not have the same faith in the possibilities of liberalization with regard to airlines and air transport."
"I think there is considerable over-confidence in what can be achieved through deregulation of air transport."
"Swedish domestic air services have been open to competition for a number of years, and this initially led to much price competition."
"However, today we have a quite different situation."
"There are sometimes two airlines on the most attractive routes, but these usually compete with the same timetables, the same prices and roughly the same service too."
"On the less attractive routes, however, there are higher prices and poorer services, and this strengthens the regional differences which were already considerable."
"Unfortunately, this is all happening in a country which is highly dependent on domestic air transport since there are often no alternatives."
"I also think it is important to ensure that an increase in air transport is not a goal in itself."
"It is in fact environmentally unsustainable to maintain the rate of growth which we have today."
"I have proposed a special amendment, Amendment No 3, which is based on the idea that competition must take place through socially acceptable methods."
"I have made particular reference to the Irish airline Ryanair, which has distinguished itself through its anti-union policies."
"The airline refuses to enter into agreements with unions, and this has led to a conflict which is currently taking place with baggage handlers at Dublin airport."
"The airline has refused to cooperate with the Irish Labour Court."
"I think it is quite unacceptable to employ such methods in competition between airlines."
"We must show that we do not accept anti-union attitudes or social dumping as a means of competition."
"It would be interesting to hear whether the Commissioner has any views on Ryanair's behaviour."
"Against this background I would like to say I support the GUE/NGL group's amendment as well as that of the Green group."
"Mr President, this obviously is not Ryanair's evening."
"I would also like to draw attention to the regrettable situation that has developed there."
"Mr Seal's report highly recommends many of the positive aspects of the aviation industry in recent years."
"Among the blessed, he mentions Ryanair, now the most profitable airline in Europe, more profitable as a percentage of turnover than the giant BA."
"As several previous speakers have mentioned, they have been locked in dispute on what many of us would regard as one of the basic human rights, that of the workers to join a trade union and be represented by a trade union."
"These workers were willing to work for considerably below the going rate when the airline started, recognising that the company could not afford the higher wages at the time."
"This is an airline that has made £IRL 35 million profit in the last year."
"Their chief executive recently earned a personal bonus of £IRL 17 million."
"Another company much smaller, much bigger are paying considerably higher wages than Ryanair."
"Let us not hand out kudos to a company whose industrial relations practices are unjust and whose profits are built on the generosity of their employees."
"This has been a very interesting debate."
"I should like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Seal, for his account of the evolution of aviation liberalization in the European Union."
"Producing a fair assessment of a new and ongoing process is always likely to be a testing experience."
"I compliment him on the approach that he has taken."
"As the House will know, civil aviation liberalization in the Union has been an intentionally progressive process, partly in order to take account of the conditions from which it started in the mid-1980s, and partly to avoid disruptions and losses of the kind which liberalization produced in the United States of America."
"In other words, it has been and is what Mr Seal is seeking: a balanced liberalization that has taken some pains to try to ensure that the interests of all legitimate concerns are taken into account."
"It is inevitable that while some of the main effects of liberalization were identified in our 1996 communication, others have only become clearly apparent since, as airlines have increasingly taken advantage of the possibilities offered."
"As we acknowledged in 1996, much remained to be done to ensure that the potential created by liberalization was fulfilled and fair competition conditions were achieved."
"That is certainly true of state aid."
"As the House will know, in the Commission's view, aid to airlines from Member State governments can only be justified, and must only be authorized, as an integral part of a consistent and timelimited programme to restore the financial viability and competitiveness of the recipient companies."
"I am certain that this approach has directly contributed to making the restructuring programmes credible and successful."
"I noticed Iberia's results in The Financial Times this morning and took some satisfaction from that."
"Our careful monitoring of the implementation of restructuring plans and the way in which they comply with the conditions laid down shows the productive results that are being achieved."
"It was on that basis that we were able to authorize final payment by the French and Portuguese governments to Air France and to TAP."
"Regrettably, it is also on that basis that we had to conclude that Olympic Airways was not complying with the essential conditions set out at the time of the agreement with the Greek Government in 1994."
"We consequently had to reopen the procedure on that case."
"In recent weeks we also had to take a very strict attitude towards the Italian Government and Alitalia who were in breach of basic conditions that were included in the Commission's state aid decision of last July."
"I am glad to say that we received a swift and effective response from the Italian Cabinet and, within a few days, further and binding undertakings were given which resolved the issues."
"On the other issues that I have listened to, in the claims made during the course of the debate, and relating to state aid in competitive conditions, I must say that if honourable Members have evidence upon which complaints can authoritatively be made, they are doing the complainants no service if they do not encourage them to make the appropriate complaint to the European Commission."
"I can say this: we respond with speed to all substantive complaints."
"The recent experience in the case of Alitalia is a further demonstration of that."
"If Members believe, therefore, that they have heard of complaints that have not been notified to us, they should say so; not to us, but to those who have voiced concerns to them."
"On the issue of globalization, we are now turning our efforts to ensuring that the consolidation of the market does not produce adverse and counterproductive effects."
"The rapporteur identifies the multiplication of mergers as being part of the globalization trend."
"It is worth noting, however, that because of the restrictive clauses on ownership and control in most existing bilateral agreements, mergers are practically impossible, and that is why we are witnessing a proliferation of airline alliances instead."
"The diversity and the disparity of regulatory regimes clearly inhibits the effective operation of the market and that, of course, is a major reason for the Commission's efforts to gain a negotiating mandate on market-access agreements with third countries, particularly the United States of America."
"It is obvious that if the Community does not take the opportunity to negotiate a comprehensive air-service agreement with the USA, United States Airlines will, by design or default, be disproportionate beneficiaries of our single market, of our liberalization, when our airlines have no effective comparable rights of access and operation to the United States' single market."
"I hope, therefore, that Member States of every kind will heed the reality and respond with alacrity to the challenge so that we can get on as a Community with negotiating a fair and balanced open-skies agreement across the Atlantic and on both sides of it."
"It would be extremely alarming if, by the cumulative effect of current bilateral agreements and future bilateral agreements, United States Airlines were effectively able to operate at will in our single market when there was absolutely no reciprocation to speak of in the United States' single market."
"Meanwhile, as the House will know, we opened investigations into three existing transatlantic airline alliances and into one proposed alliance in 1996."
"Far from having adopted a dilatory attitude, as the rapporteur appeared to suggest in his report, the Commission has been very vigilant about the developments in a market which, by becoming global, could, in turn, create fresh constraints on the full benefits of liberalization."
"Recognition of that has, for instance, prompted the Commission to take initiatives on air-traffic management - which was mentioned by some honourable Members -, on groundhandling services - mentioned by other honourable Members - and on airport challenges - again referred to by some contributors to the debate."
"Our proposal for the revision of the current airport slots regulation will become public within the next few months."
"Mr Seal is right to point out that our communication did not devote much space to the social aspects of liberalization."
"Although it would also be true to say that the Commission has in other respects been particularly attentive to the social impact of liberalization measures."
"The House is aware - and there were references to this - that we commissioned a study to address this issue. And since we received the results of that study within the last week, I can firmly express the hope that the final report will be available to this Parliament and to the general public in April."
"It is already clear, of course, that civil aviation has been the only transport mode in which employment increased between 1990 and 1995, and although the total growth was modest - about 0.4 % per annum over the period - it is worth noting that was achieved despite general economic recession and despite extensive airline restructuring, which has, in some cases, caused what turns out to be a temporary reduction in staff."
"The increased effectiveness and competitiveness of airlines has the effect, of course, of again stimulating demand for employment - and that is good news for everybody."
"As the House might anticipate, I totally agree with Mr Seal's view that liberalization should not, indeed must not, be achieved at the expense of safety, and we will therefore continue to be active and vigilant on safety issues, not only at Community level but globally."
"To give practical evidence of that: we have in recent months proposed a directive to establish safety assessment of thirdcountry aircraft operating in the European Union, and we have published our proposal for the establishment of a European civil aviation safety agency."
"In addition, outside the Community the Commission makes sustained efforts to secure and to maintain the effective implementation of ICAO standards."
"Meanwhile we are also addressing environmental aviation issues, which were referred to by some of the contributors to the debate, through the communication on carbon dioxide emissions and transport which we shall be publishing in the spring and, in addition, more specifically in our study on the implication of the impositions of a kerosene tax for civil aviation and the environment."
"The House may know that we have for the first time joint environment and transport councils convened under the United Kingdom Presidency - one informal, one formal - and we look forward to very positive results for transport and environment from those initiatives."
"As far as the protection of consumers is concerned, the Commission has recently presented a proposal concerning denied-boarding compensation, whilst the current code of conduct on computerized reservation systems, as well as the amendments proposed to it, already provides for the operator of a flight to be clearly identified and for the passenger to be properly informed."
"We have had some passenger complaints on this issue and I hope that honourable Members, as frequent flyers themselves, and as users of liberalized air services, will take pains to ensure that if they experience difficulties in this respect, they communicate those difficulties both to the airlines concerned and send a copy to me."
"I would be pleased to have such information from the front line."
"I will certainly act upon it."
"These actions, in so far as consumers are concerned, should reinforce the requirements of information and transparency that Mr Seal's report is rightly seeking."
"The list of different actions, which I have given this evening, is not exhaustive but it shows clearly that the Commission does not consider that its work was completed when we presented our communication in October 1996 or when the single market in civil aviation was formally and legally completed on the 1 April last year."
"On the contrary, we acknowledged that further work was necessary and since then we have been actively pursuing further necessary advances."
"Against that background, Mr Seal's report is of great help in emphasizing priorities and in highlighting the significance of the social dimension."
"He will, I hope, be pleased to know therefore that in order to give full attention to the social impact, and also to take account of new developments and the changing environment in which airlines operate after the full completion of the aviation single market, we will be publishing the report that I referred to earlier which should be available for debate in this Parliament in the near future."
"I hope that I can say with complete confidence that the report will provide a full response to those aspects of Mr Seal's report which relate to the matters that were not dealt with by our previous communication."
"I look forward to considering that and indeed other matters with this House but hopefully not at such great length in future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Cabin crews in civil aviation"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Grosch (A4-0018/98), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive on safety requirements and attestation of professional competence for cabin crews in civil aviation (COM(97)0382 - C4-0460/97-97/0212(SYN))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the safety training of cabin crews in civil aviation is almost a component of the subject which we have just discussed, or a consequence of it."
"The Commission could in this respect have taken the terms of the JAA changed or unchanged and transferred them into Community law - quite simply in accordance with Regulation No 3922/91."
"It has, however, chosen another route, namely the form of a directive."
"It is of course clear that we as Parliamentarians explicitly welcome this decision, and the fact that we as a parliament are involved in the lawmaking process."
"But in my view that is not the most important reason point."
"The Commission's proposal - and this is the most important element - puts the work of the cabin crews in the correct light, that is, it covers their safety functions."
"It is very important therefore to provide more transparency in terms of the fact that the crews must undergo basic training, a general further training and additional training related to various types of aeroplane."
"That is, in our view, an important part of this work."
"There is in fact a risk, which has just been discussed, that the airlines in the thick of the competition battle will regard these very training costs as variable costs and correspondingly perhaps try to economize in this area, which in my opinion would be unfortunate."
"Therefore, we also see the programmes proposed in the Annex as minimum requirements."
"In our opinion, both the basic training and the type-training indicated should form part of basic training, in which really nothing may be left out. This would mean that the cabin crew enjoy the social protection which exists in every similar profession, and that entry to the profession or employment in this job is no longer possible without training."
"If we compare the programmes of one airline with another then we soon discover that this directive is necessary. Although most airlines take training very seriously, the further training, particularly the typetraining is somehow neglected."
"The Commission's proposal also respects subsidiarity."
"It therefore takes into account the desire of Member States to continue to define their training themselves, although there should be an obligation to keep the Commission informed."
"In short, the proposal is an ideal response to technical and administrative questions, to social challenges in the free market and to safety claims associated with the profession of cabin crew."
"Although it is not as important, we must not forget in this document that with some form of recognition - here known as certification - mobility in this professional sphere can be increased."
"The amendments submitted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism in this respect are therefore to be regarded as no more than fine tuning."
"They regulate amongst other things transfer conditions, they regulate or fix the obligation of the Member States to supply information and they regulate medical monitoring somewhat more clearly."
"In the Commission's proposals only regular checks are suggested: we however propose a periodic cycle of inspections."
"The amendments tabled later by Mr Simpson are in my view also worthy of support."
"Although the Commission's text, my amendments, and the amendments proposed in committee maintained the distinction between cabin crew with and without safety functions, these amendments from Mr Simpson are designed to remove this distinction, so that all cabin crew must meet the same training requirements."
"In my opinion, this has the important advantage of ensuring that there will no longer be cabin crew with varying qualifications and that in serious situations any member of the cabin crew will be able to fulfil his task completely."
"Finally I would like to remind my colleagues - and perhaps that could have been said from the start, for thus far the whole thing sounds rather unanimous - that this directive is of course not welcomed by the JAA and the airlines."
"For me this is not yet particularly worrying."
"I am far more concerned about the scepticism - to put it mildly - of the Council on this subject."
"I hope that even those accidents which have been avoided, to say nothing about the tragic reality of the actual aircraft accidents, will convince the Council, so that this document does not end up in a drawer somewhere but is instead dealt with effectively and also fulfils its objective."
"Mr President, first of all, just to clarify: we are tonight debating safety standards for cabin crew and not air traffic controllers."
"At least I hope so."
"I know it is very late but I believe that is the directive we are discussing, otherwise I am in the wrong room."
"I think we have a problem with interpretation, with all due respect to Mr Grosch."
"I wish to thank him for his efforts in endeavouring to steer this report through Parliament and doing such a comprehensive job, and also to congratulate the Commission on having the foresight to bring this forward, particularly in the light of what we have just been saying about liberalization and the very important comments the Commissioner made about the need to underpin liberalization with a very strong social framework."
"This is clear evidence that is actually happening, and this is a measure which commands the full support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"One point we have to stress is that we need to get over to the Council and, indeed, the wider community why this measure is so important."
"One thing we have to make very clear is that, contrary to accepted beliefs, if you are involved in an air crash the likelihood is that you will not actually die."
"Indeed, many aircraft accidents are survivable."
"Around 75 % of aircraft are involved in accidents during approach, landing or take-off."
"Research indicates that around 90 % of all aircraft accidents could be survivable."
"It is estimated that of the 1 500 people on average who die each year, some 300 a year, on average, could survive if evacuation measures within aircraft were improved."
"I am confident that if we had better, faster and more effective evacuation, we could save lives - as many as 300 a year."
"How do we do that?"
"There are a number of methods by which we can improve evacuation measures."
"Firstly by the behaviour and crowd-control skills of cabin crew during emergency evacuations, and, secondly, by passengers' knowledge of safety procedures and their motivation to get acquainted with them."
"We all know from our experience in flying that no-one takes any notice whatsoever of cabin crew when they are giving us the safety demonstrations and yet all the evidence suggests that information they are conveying to us could make the difference between life or death."
"There are a number of reasons why evacuation is a key issue, and training is clearly a means by which we can enable and motivate the cabin crew to provide effective information to the passengers, before, during and after an incident."
"That is why we believe this measure is so important."
"The large majority of air crashes are survivable technically, and effective evacuation is so important."
"Current regulations, for example, specify that an aircraft must be evacuated within 90 seconds with just half the exits open."
"In 1994 research was carried out by both the CAA and the FAA which clearly indicated that the difference between getting out of the aircraft or not depended on assertive, highly-trained and highly-effective cabin crew."
"Tonight we should reflect on that."
"It underpins the work of Mr Grosch and the proposal from the Commission."
"The results show clearly that trained cabin crew make the difference."
"That is the reason why we are very pleased to support this proposal for a directive on the training of cabin crew."
"We have a number of concerns which we have identified via our amendments."
"We think that in an incident you cannot differentiate between some cabin crew who may have safety training and others who do not."
"All the crew should have the skills necessary to ensure that the plane, for example, is evacuated as quickly and effectively as possible."
"That is why we have tabled Amendments Nos 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17, to ensure this measure applies to all the cabin crew."
"If you speak to the cabin crew themselves, they do not want to create a situation where, possibly, some airline operators could differentiate between cabin crew and create a two-tier system."
"In Amendment No 13 we propose annual medical checks for cabin crew."
"Again we think this is perfectly reasonable, when your life is effectively in not just the pilot's hands but also in the hands of the cabin crews."
"An annual medical check is the best way forward."
"Leaving it just to the wording 'regular' is not sufficient."
"Finally, Amendment No 18 talks about annual training for cabin crews, including things like fire-fighting and the use of life rafts."
"Again, it is extraordinary that a basic requirement like using fire-fighting equipment or life rafts is not checked annually."
"That is why we are tabling this amendment, to ensure that training is given on an annual basis."
"In conclusion, as travel demand increases, the number of aircraft increase, the number of risks increase, it is vital that safety standards throughout the Community are harmonized."
"We believe this directive will ensure that and could make the difference between life and death itself."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mr Grosch, on behalf of the PPE group, for a thorough piece of work."
"This is a very important report."
"Setting safety requirements is one of the most important tasks for all of us who are concerned with questions of transport at European level."
"With the deregulation and liberalization of air transport, it is essential that safety should not suffer."
"We know today that safety rules vary greatly from one EU country to another."
"The JAA, the Joint Aviation Authority, has concentrated on this and approved common requirements both for basic training and for further training."
"This is all of the utmost importance, and the more players operating in an increasingly liberalized air transport market in future, the more important it will become."
"I am quite convinced that there really will be more players operating in this market."
"In this context, one of our biggest and most important tasks is to help ensure that safety requirements are increased and not reduced."
"That is a precondition for liberalization to have a real and lasting impact."
"In this context, I do not want to make a big thing of the issue of certification at European level."
"But it is worth giving encouragement to cabin crews, who are a group of employees who work across borders to a very large extent, so that they also have the possibility of changing jobs to another airline in the EU."
"This could happen in various ways, such as through a licence of this kind. But I think it seems extraordinarily important to encourage this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the completion of the internal market for civil aviation has increased the need for international agreements on safety standards for European Union countries."
"Increased competition sadly only increases the temptation to cut down on safety."
"The proposal on safety requirements for cabin crews has been prepared and accepted within the Joint Aviation Authority to which eighteen European countries belong."
"The Commission believes it should add to the JAA proposal a competence certificate for cabin crews."
"Recognition of training in one Member State by aviation authorities in other Union Member States was meant to improve the mobility of cockpit crews."
"This concession to the unions ignores the reality that all airlines have different safety procedures which even differ between aircrafts within each airline."
"That is why, to my mind, such a certificate will not promote staff mobility, whilst the Member States are burdened with an extra administrative commitment."
"Moreover, the addition of safety certificates has made the Council proposal controversial."
"It looks unlikely that this will be discussed within the near future."
"For these reasons it would have been better if the Commission had limited itself to the JAA proposal."
"We have a similar objection to the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"They claim that every crew member is responsible for safety duties, and should therefore receive training."
"I believe that it is possible to maintain a proper level of safety on aeroplanes without seeing all members of the crew as safety personnel."
"I will therefore not be able to support the PSE amendments."
"I support Mr Grosch's amendments which clarify the proposal where the Commission text is too vague."
"Mr President, firstly we all know national provisions on safety training for cabin crew vary widely across the European Union."
"With the liberalization of the whole air transport sector, it is imperative that we have common standards on training and licensing of cabin crews throughout the Union."
"As you have heard earlier, in Ireland we have the situation where Ryanair baggage handlers are on strike simply because they want to be represented by a trade union."
"They are low paid with poor working conditions and their legitimate demand is that they be represented professionally with regard to pay and health and safety conditions."
"Serious questions have to be asked about the operation procedures and indeed the training provided by low cost airlines such as Ryanair, Translift and others."
"I am also very concerned about reports on the hours that these cabin crew work and the consequent fatigue they suffer with no breaks allowed between shifts and 25 minute turnaround time during which they are required to carry out cleaning duties."
"Cutthroat competition in the air seems to be leading to a lowering of safety standards and we have seen a lot of accidents recently which I know will be investigated and we will see what turns up."
"The latest media reports that airlines are reducing fuel costs by recycling unfiltered air into passenger cabins are equally alarming for all of us who travel frequently and, more particularly, for the cabin staff and pilots."
"Cabin crew are the only safety professionals with dual responsibilities."
"While safety is their primary responsibility, they are mainly engaged in other tasks."
"Safety refresher courses must take place on an annual basis."
"Finally I would ask this particular question: is it because the vast majority of cabin crew are women that licensing was not introduced a long time ago?"
"Mr President, this proposal is obviously linked to the measures to support the process of liberalization in the air transport sector with the aim of ensuring high safety standards."
"I congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work, and the Commission for its excellent proposal."
"My concern with the directive proposed is, will it actually improve safety in air transport?"
"Our aim should surely be to set the best safety practices across Europe."
"Currently, the joint aviation authorities seek to achieve cabin crew safety by placing responsibility for safety throughout an airline clearly on the operator."
"Currently that operator must ensure comprehensive safety throughout the company and that cabin crew are trained to fit in with that company's specific system."
"The directive waters down this responsibility and, therefore, may just possibly undermine cabin crew safety."
"The Commissioner, this evening, referred to a number of proposals, including that to set up the European Civil Aviation Safety Agency and efforts to improve the implementation of ICAO standards throughout the European Union."
"I would make a plea to the Commission this evening to reach an early agreement with the Council on the setting-up of this European Civil Aviation Safety Agency to ensure that safety both in Europe and worldwide is secured."
"The figures show - and were discussed in a conference in Maastricht today - that over the last ten years 70 % of all accidents have involved carriers accounting for only 16 % of total air traffic."
"Those airlines from developing countries appear to be mostly at risk."
"Without this European action which is so urgently required, experts predict that quite possibly there could be one air accident a week."
"So please, Commissioner, and the British Presidency of the Transport Council, act now."
"We must set up this European air transport safety organization with proper safety checks at all European airports to ensure the safety of those European passengers using those carriers and those European residents near Community airports receiving them."
"I am delighted to support this report."
"But I hope that the Commissioner can satisfy me that urgent action will be taken by the Council of Ministers and through his good offices."
"First of all I would like to thank Mr Grosch and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the work that they have put in to considering this particular proposal, and for the generally supportive attitude that they have taken."
"In a growing and changing environment such as civil aviation, it is obviously essential that the highest possible safety standards are maintained."
"It is equally obvious that the people responsible for fulfilling those safety standards must be well-trained and wellmotivated."
"The purpose of the proposal before the House is to achieve those outcomes."
"I know that honourable Members share that objective, as they have demonstrated again in the course of this debate."
"I should like to make two other points by way of introduction."
"First, this draft directive sets down minimum, not maximum standards."
"Our constant desire is that Member States will seek to exceed these minima, even though they are of a satisfactory level for the general purposes of maintaining the safety of aircraft and passengers."
"Secondly, just as a point of reassurance, but certainly not in any spirit of complacency, our region of the world sees 30 % of the world's air traffic movements, but only 10 % of air traffic accidents take place in this region."
"Everybody responsible works to try to ensure that the level of accidents is even lower than that."
"We strive for nil, naturally."
"But it is important to put the matter into perspective so that the general idea is not spread that somehow there is a deterioration in standards, inadvertent or deliberate."
"I would say to Miss McIntosh, for instance, that there is absolutely no conceivable way in which this draft proposal, inadvertently or deliberately, could possibly lead to the dilution of standards in air safety."
"I will deal with that point at greater length later on."
"I should also say to Mrs Malone, though unfortunately she has left the Chamber, probably on pressing business, that if she has evidence of an increase in accidents, as she claimed, I want to see it most urgently."
"Secondly, if there is evidence that any aircraft operating in European Union airspace has been recycling unfiltered air into the cabin, I want evidence of that too because we most certainly will make an active response."
"In response to the amendments proposed by Mr Grosch, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 add clarity to the text."
"The Commission can therefore accept them."
"I am also glad to say that the Commission shares the desire of the rapporteur to uphold the established rights of experienced cabin crew."
"We can therefore accept Amendment No 8."
"I understand the motivation behind Amendment No 1, but it appears to me to be somewhat superfluous since the content of the training programmes is laid down in the Annexes to the directive and will be universally applicable."
"To centralize each and every programme at Community-level seems to me to be unnecessary."
"That problem of otiose bureaucracy also applies to Amendment No 6."
"As far as Amendment No 7 is concerned, I do not see what added value it gives."
"In practice, cabin crew automatically receive conversion training when changing from one aircraft type to another and the obligations for and the regulation of recurrent training are laid down in Article 5 and in the annexes to this directive."
"While I fully appreciate the rationale behind Amendment No 2 as well, it would, in practice, extend the provision of the directive to staff such as beauticians, secretaries and medical companions who are on-board an aircraft for purely commercial reasons and have neither the training nor, in general, the competence to provide useful assistance in the event of an emergency in the air."
"In many respects they are effectively passengers themselves."
"I do not believe it was the intention of the rapporteur that this should be the case - that people should be allocated responsibilities for which they have not been professionally trained."
"This point applies equally to the series of amendments put by Mr Simpson: Amendments Nos 9-12 and 14-17, which have the same objective."
"I understand it to be laudable, but I cannot see how it can be practicable."
"So I cannot accept any of those amendments."
"The Commission cannot support Amendment No 3 either, nor the new Amendment No 13, which specify the regularity of medical checks."
"When legislating, we have to bear in mind the costs of our legislation and also have to recognize who will meet the bills."
"If the result of implementing the provision on medical checks appeared to be very costly, there would be resistance and that would undermine the very basis of the proposal."
"Decisions on precise frequency of checks are therefore best left to national authorities who, I am absolutely certain, will not let great gaps appear between medical checks of air crew of any description."
"There remains just one amendment, Amendment No 18, which, again, I regret to say I cannot accept."
"This amendment seeks to increase the required frequency of recurrent training and to so well beyond the requirements of JAR-OPS from which our proposal originates."
"I would say to Miss McIntosh, when she considers that there is a possibility of reducing the level of requirements below that of the JAA, I would refer her to page 2 of the proposal."
"The common safety training standards, as laid down in JAROPS compare favourably with international recommended standards and the better training practices of industry."
"They are adequate to ensure a high level of safety."
"This proposal is entirely in conformity with that."
"Making a further change would add an unnecessary burden on operators without bringing any greater safety guarantees."
"In conclusion, I would like again to thank Parliament for its work."
"The adoption of this Commission proposal, with the amendments that I have indicated will, I am sure, contribute directly to maintaining motivation amongst staff and sustaining high levels of safety standards in civil aviation."
"I know that honourable Members, together with the Commission, strongly support both objectives."
"Mr President, if I can try be helpful to the Commissioner I accept his point about other auxiliary cabin staff, beauticians etc. But his own proposal, his own directive Article 2(b), with its definition of a cabin crew, already addresses this point."
"It actually specifies that it does not apply to crew members solely assigned to non-safety duties."
"So the answer lies in your own text, Commissioner, I hope perhaps we can review this in that context."
"Secondly, on the point about annual health checks, I understand that all staff of the European institutions are required to have annual health checks."
"Surely if it is good enough for us and our institutions, it should be good enough for cabin crew members."
"Mr President, if all airlines were as willing as the European institutions to meet the costs of ensuring that their employees had annual medical check-ups in common with many other employers in the public and private sectors, I could share the honourable Member's confidence."
"But that is not the case."
"As I have said, if there were resistance based on the idea of unnecessary cost then the consequence would be that we would get even less adequate standards than those set down in this draft."
"I take the point that the honourable Member made about other staff referred to in this draft."
"I think that is a very good debating point."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Transport of dangerous goods by road -Distinguishing signs for motor vehicles - transportablepressure equipment"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism:"
"by Mr Le Rachinel (A4-0014/98), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive relating to motor vehicles and their trailers with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road and amending Directive 70/156/EEC in respect of the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (COM(96)0555 - C4-0665/96-96/0267(COD)); -by Mr Le Rachinel (A4-0024/98), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the recognition in intra-Community traffic of the distinguishing sign of the Member State in which motor vehicles and their trailers are registered, (COM(97)0366 - C4-0419/97-97/0199(SYN)); -by Mr Camisón Asensio (A4-0039/98), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive on transportable pressure equipment (COM(96)0674 - C4-0068/97-97/0011(SYN))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am attacking my first report."
"The proposal for a directive and the report which I submitted have as their objective the establishment of technical requirements applicable to motor vehicles and to trailers, guaranteeing transport by road."
"Certain requirements were already put in place by the 1994 directive regarding the construction of vehicles which transport hazardous goods by road."
"However, the recognition and acceptance by all Member States of the characteristics of construction of this type of vehicle is not guaranteed."
"This new directive sets down specific clauses for the construction of vehicles."
"It also provides the technical specifications for electrical equipment, braking systems, fire risks and speed limits."
"This harmonization has the advantage of preventing a Member State from prohibiting the sale, registration or entry into service of motor vehicles which have already been approved in other Member States."
"Only one amendment to this proposal has been tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"It relates to fixing a date for the entry into force of the legislative, regulatory and administrative clauses necessary to conform to this directive."
"This deadline has been set for twelve months after the publication of the directive."
"No other amendment has been tabled and I think that this report does not represent any particular problem and, Mr President I think we have a broad consensus on this subject."
"Mr President, it is very clear that this proposal for a directive has been in the process of formulation, basically, to plug the two most blatant loopholes in the legislation referring to the manufacture, transport, commercialization, use and maintenance of all transportable pressure equipment which will fulfil the requirements of the ADR and RID agreements."
"Such agreements, as you know ladies and gentlemen, are intended to strengthen safety in the transport of such equipment and ensure free circulation of the same in the common Community market."
"At the same time an orderly transition is needed from current transportable pressure equipment to that of the future and this can be done through periodic inspections and conformity assessments following the modular approach, although the process requires inspection bodies to comply with adequate quality criteria, such as those based on the CEN standard in the EN 45000 series, since basing such criteria solely on the content of the directives concerned may not be sufficient, as both these directives deal almost exclusively with transport, with the result that there is a shortage of specific provisions on certain other matters."
"Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems clear from recent experience that mutual recognition of inspections, which is essential for making progress towards completion of the internal market, can not be fully achieved, through the application of annexes A and B of the ADR directive, which only seems to ensure freedom of transport, and which, because it includes no provision for distinguishing marks, has little impact on the use of such equipment in the country of destination."
"Hence the need for the present directive."
"Consequently, one of the major advantages of this proposal is that products can secure a higher market share, with the inherent advantage of securing economies of scale and lower administrative costs for the relevant approvals."
"For this purpose, the equipment concerned must be easily identifiable and the best way of doing this is clearly to give them a distinctive mark different from those currently in force for stable pressure equipment or gas bottles."
"However, the main dilemma posed by this proposal concerns the question of experience as opposed to independence."
"I am referring, of course, to the inspection bodies."
"It is well known that for many years, the European industry has been able to carry out proper inspections on this equipment, including ADR class 2, by means of type B or even type C bodies belonging to the users' sector."
"This has been possible because they have been able to accumulate an advanced level of knowledge through daily contact with the problems concerned."
"They have therefore achieved a lot in the last few years."
"On the other hand, it may be that the experience because of their centralized nature, of type A bodies is confined to new products on the market, with the result that their experience and skills are more general."
"For these reasons, the Committee on Transport and Tourism unanimously approved this report and its corresponding motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, I support the Rachinel report and I must say that one of the hallmarks of this Commission has been its overriding concern for safety, especially on our roads."
"This directive is designed to enhance existing legislation in the motor vehicle sector by ensuring that the construction characteristics of vehicles carrying dangerous goods are harmonized throughout the whole Community."
"It will be welcomed, in my opinion, by the industry that one set of rules will apply across the EU for the design and construction of vehicles carrying dangerous goods."
"This is a necessary step to develop and enhance safety on our roads."
"We need technical provisions to ensure that dangerous goods are safeguarded during the time they are in transport."
"This means possibly adopting standards of electrical equipment, braking systems, fire risk prevention provisions, etcetera, just to name a few."
"All will help to create what I regard as a safer environment on our roads."
"Accidents have happened and accidents, of course, will continue to happen."
"Let us not allow dangerous goods, which would pollute and damage health, to be carried in vehicles which are not up to what the Commission regards, and what we regard, as the highest possible standards."
"Let us minimize the risk of horrific accidents on the roads where hazardous materials are involved."
"Let us make this applicable to the whole of the EU."
"Finally, just one last appeal regarding distinguishing signs."
"I hope that the Commission will give some account to the symbols that might highlight smaller nations like Wales."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since all of us here are experts I shall, in view of the late hour make just two basic comments on the Le Rachinel report on the type-approval of vehicles and on the report of my colleague, Camisón Asensio, on transportable pressure equipment."
"Firstly, it is clearly insanely difficult really to make a reality of the Single Market."
"It is technical and is getting more and more technical, but we shall not be able to get out of the work."
"Perhaps we shall one day manage to deal conclusively in committee with the kind of report which does not have particularly great political importance, if the Commission presents us with well-prepared reports, so that we no longer have any need to argue about slots at this time of night."
"Secondly, it is nevertheless important for our colleagues in the committee to study these reports carefully themselves."
"Mr Le Rachinel was, as it were, in the fortunate position after careful checking to be able to say: I need only one amendment."
"And everybody agreed with him."
"Colleague Camisón had more difficulties."
"He had to deal with 28 amendments because on the important question of inspection, he had become involved in discussions with those in the industry who were directly affected and came to a different point of view."
"I am very grateful that he worked out this complicated point so well."
"But it is important that we bear in mind that both reports are not only reports for the Single Market, for more business and for more trade."
"Rather both reports, as the previous speaker has also said, are quite important for people's safety on the roads and thus for the protection of the natural environment, since accidents which occur can not only kill and injure people, but accidents with dangerous goods can cause incalculable damage to nature, in the water and in the soil."
"Therefore, I thank you sincerely for these good reports."
"We shall take the trouble to study these reports carefully."
"I thank the two rapporteurs and we will await the opinion of the Commission."
"I hope that the Commission does not immediately discard 20 of Mr Camisón's 28 amendments, but we shall wait and see."
"Mr President, the merits of the regulation concerning the distinguishing signs for motor vehicles is that they put an end to the practice of drivers being fined because one Member State does not recognize the distinguishing sign of another."
"The recognition of the registration plate comprising national registration and the European flag will obviously become increasingly important as more Member States start introducing this, and, perhaps, a Community registration number."
"The Dutch government, for instance, plans to include the European flag and the letters NL on the number plate."
"It might be possible, of course, that in a wave of Euroscepticism, the flag will be a disaster in the Netherlands."
"The European Parliament's popularity, and by implication that of the European Union, is not exactly furthered by the kind of scenes which took place here yesterday and today during votes, when European Members of Parliament declared they were not being paid to vote."
"I wonder then what they are paid for."
"It bothers me very much that our European flag is allowed to grace vehicles which should not really drive on the European roads; cars without catalytic converters, for example."
"I would like to see Member States, mindful of the subsidiarity principle, be given the right to withhold the flag from the most polluting cars and engines: watch out, environmental pirate!"
"Unfortunately, parliaments do not seem to understand my graphic amendments, which is why I was not able to submit them."
"Mr President, I will restrict myself this evening to Mr Le Rachinel's report on vehicle registration signs and of course I congratulate him on his efforts in producing the report."
"There is clearly a need across Europe to clarify the situation, which is incredibly complicated for the average motorist trying to travel around the Continent, and indeed UK and Ireland as well."
"The signs referred to by Nel van Dijk which the Dutch may or may not adopt in the year 2000 are currently compulsory in Ireland and Portugal, they are optional in France and Germany, where they may make them compulsory, whilst all the other countries have the Vienna Convention white ellipse except the UK, Spain and Portugal which do not have anything."
"There is a need to make life simpler for the motorist."
"The Commission's proposal does just that and I commend it."
"However, as the Commission will be aware, motorists throughout Europe are much more European than perhaps we think."
"They are of course rebelling against the Vienna and the Geneva Convention, and indeed his own proposal, by adopting their own symbol of European unity."
"Therefore I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner and Members to our Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6 and 7 which recognise the reality that many motorists do not like the Vienna Convention symbol, the rather boring black letters on a white background, but prefer the European symbol of the white and yellow letters with the gold stars on a blue background in accordance with their particular national registration."
"I hope that the Commissioner will agree with our argument that we should give the motorists a choice."
"Why is it that motorists in Greece or the UK - it could be my car, Commissioner -have to remove their European symbol and replace it with a white sticker with black letters when they travel to France?"
"That to me seems a backward step."
"Our amendment is trying to be helpful by giving motorists that choice, that additional right to display a European symbol if they so desire rather than the white ellipse."
"I commend it to you, Commissioner, and I commend it to the House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to talk about the second Le Rachinel report."
"The present proposal for a regulation remedies the lack of similarity between the separate national legislations."
"The Community model for the distinguishing sign of the Member State licensing of vehicles and trailers in internal Community traffic, let us call it the European nationality plate, is long overdue."
"Such a measure directly helps to include and raise the awareness of the citizens of the Union in the creation of an area without internal borders and to form and establish a feeling of European identity, while contributing indirectly to n increase in road traffic safety."
"In particular, the demand that the proposed Community sign must be located both at the front and at the back on the left beside the registration plate will be an advantage for the police and other administrative and judicial bodies."
"Although on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party I completely support Mr Le Rachinel's report and thank him for his work, it seems to me personally that the Commission's proposal for a regulation is not completely logical."
"Let us just consider: in a few weeks the third phase of European economic and monetary union begins, which will lead to a domestic market, the formal external appearance of which will be the single currency."
"What a magnificent achievement, proving our great farsightedness!"
"With the distinguishing sign for vehicles and trailers the Europeans are failing to achieve logical standardization in the form of a common, standard design principle. Thus, with reference to the principle of subsidiarity, the EU Member States are obliged in fact to recognize the proposed Community model, but the validity of existing nationality plates remains completely unrestricted and continues to exist, independent of the Community model."
"There is not even a reference to the fact that in the Member States the Community model should preferably be used."
"In view of this fact, I could even understand if citizens from third countries were doubtful of the ability and/or seriousness of the efforts of EU to build a political union."
"For the vehicle owners of the Member States who have already accepted, on a compulsory or voluntary basis, the use of the Community model - it is of course not a new invention -, the present proposal for a regulation takes up a long-standing desire for legal certainty and is recognition - let us call it personal - of the costs they often willingly incurred when buying this combined vehicle registration plate."
"For me, too, it is desirable that third countries, above all the countries of the European Economic Area but also the associated countries of central and eastern Europe give legally binding recognition to the Community model."
"I recommend that we accept this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like briefly to express an opinion on Mr Le Rachinel's report on the transport of dangerous goods by road."
"One of the Union's aims is the completion of the single market."
"We should do everything we can to guarantee its successful operation by implementing suitable measures."
"In this sense the free passage of vehicles transporting dangerous goods should be possible."
"Above all, I believe it is very appropriate to harmonize design features and technical specifications, for example on brake fittings, speed limitations or electrical equipment, to guarantee free passage within the Community."
"The creation of a European type-approval system will help ensure that in future no Member State will be able, on grounds which relate to design features, to prohibit a vehicle manufacturer from offering it for sale, or to refuse its approval or use."
"The Member States should thus be obliged to produce the necessary legal and administrative regulations within 12 months of the publication of this directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour we are once again discussing transport policy questions."
"Let me make just two short remarks."
"Firstly, I would like to look at the issue of transportable pressure equipment which unfortunately has figured too briefly in this joint debate."
"This is a very important matter, not only from a technical viewpoint - although to me as an engineer it appears thoroughly interesting, - but it also as regards the question of safety of everything which travels on our roads."
"It concerns the question of regular monitoring and the capability to carry out this monitoring and I think that here it is the rapporteur, whom I would like to thank sincerely, who has succeeded in presenting a balanced report."
"I can only ask the Commission to listen carefully to Parliament."
"Secondly, I would like to consider the distinguishing sign of the Member State of registration, that is, the national registration plate."
"I consider that, too, to be an important proposal and Mr Koch referred to the problems which we still face."
"Here at last we have a regulation with which we can bring Europe to life. As well as the standard driving licence, which has already been decided on, it is a further symbol to make Europe come to life."
"It is a citizen-friendly decision which makes administration simpler."
"I would just like to ask you, Commissioner, to take this up perhaps in negotiations with Switzerland too, because it is not sensible or logical to introduce it throughout Europe, and have it recognized in the European Economic Area, and in the associated states, while right in the middle of Europe we have an Island of the Blissful, where we still have to have our stickers."
"I ask that you take this up in the negotiations."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Le Rachinel for his two reports, firstly on the proposal relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and trailers intended for the transport of dangerous goods by road and, secondly, on the distinguishing sign for vehicles."
"On the first report, I am pleased to say that the Commission accepts Mr Le Rachinel's single amendment, since the additional wording he suggests on Article 6 provides the correct legal term for the date of implementation and does not in any way contradict or change the intention of the Commission proposal."
"This legislation, as the House will know, is an important step towards harmonization of the laws of Member States on typeapproval procedures relating to vehicles carrying dangerous goods."
"I am therefore grateful for the constructive approach taken by the rapporteur and his colleagues."
"Colleagues, indeed, like Mr Morris who, in an erudite and convincing speech, would not only have demolished any doubts at all about the transport of dangerous goods but probably have persuaded everyone that Wales should have its very own distinctive number plate."
"That would, of course, be permissible, as we see evidenced by the fact that in the Republic of Ireland the name of the region is given on the numberplate in Erse and in Germany the Land badge is also shown conventionally on the numberplates."
"So I am looking forward to seeing a draig goch , the red dragon, on Mr Morris' numberplate."
"I am sure that would be a very popular step."
"Not that I would dream of intervening in subsidiarity to advocate it publicly."
"Mr Le Rachinel's second report concerns numberplates."
"Because of press misreporting, which has on occasion misinformed public opinion on the issue of vehicle numberplates and distinguishing signs, I think it wise to begin my short response to this very constructive report by saying what the proposal does not mean."
"Firstly, it does not have any suggestion that Member States must provide numberplates which incorporate the symbol of the European Union."
"Secondly, it does not have any suggestion that all vehicles must show the symbol of the country of registration."
"I specify this because Mr Jarzembowski will I know be interested to be informed that a couple of years ago the Daily Mail - not a newspaper that I customarily buy - incredibly printed a front-page story about me going to impose Euro-numberplates on all unsuspecting citizens of the Union."
"The story was so inaccurate, misleading and mischievous, that I sued the Daily Mail and, I am happy to say, successfully."
"I hope that they will record, with precision, what this proposal does and does not do."
"The aim of the proposal is simply to ensure that where the rear numberplate on a vehicle shows the distinguishing sign of the Member State of registration, on the background of the symbol of the Community, the distinguishing sign is recognized by the other Member States as a valid identification of the country of registration, without further need for the vehicle to show any other sign."
"That includes the elliptic sticker, the rugby-ball-shaped sticker specified by the Vienna Convention."
"It may be, of course, as far as Mr Morris is concerned, that shape of sticker would do for Wales, but I understand that too."
"I know that Members of this House understand that and I would like, therefore, to respond to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"First, we welcome Amendment No 2 and the first part of Amendment No 3, which extends the coverage of the regulation to trailers."
"We can also accept the second part of Amendment No 3, which refers to the position of the distinguishing sign on the left-hand side of the numberplate."
"In addition, we can accept in principle the last part of Amendment No 3 that refers to other official signs."
"But we believe that the wording and the purpose of the recognition, which is to identify the state of registration of the vehicle, could be more specific."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 1, which is intended to introduce a requirement to affix the distinguishing sign of registration on the left-hand side of the plate."
"However, the amendment actually changes the legal term distinguishing registration signs, which simply means the official abbreviation used to denote the Member State."
"The term itself and the definition are consistent with the Vienna Convention, which is as it should be."
"As in the case of the Convention, the size, shape and location of the distinguishing registration sign are specified in the Annex, although that provision is now also covered by the second part of Amendment No 3, which, as I said to the House, we have accepted."
"Amendments Nos 4 to 7 have been tabled by Mr Simpson with the purpose of sanctioning or regularizing the practice of using stickers in the form of the European symbol containing the abbreviation of the country of origin."
"I have to say that Mr Watts did a job of which any salesman would be immensely proud in the course of the debate tonight."
"As a consequence, I have some sympathy for the idea."
"However, I have to tell the House that these amendments do not meet the need to lay down the technical specifications with sufficient detail to achieve mutual recognition."
"Well I can always mutually recognize Mr Jarzembowski even if I cannot hear precisely what he is saying!"
"Our proposal makes mutual recognition possible precisely because the sign is issued under the control of the national authorities as part of an official numberplate, and that would clearly not be the case for the separate sticker."
"The eighth and final amendment by Mr Cornelissen is unnecessary since the regulation, once adopted, will be automatically applicable in the European Economic Area."
"Incidentally, I think history is being made."
"It is ten past eleven on a night in Strasbourg."
"We are having a transport debate and Mr Cornelissen is not actually here."
"This must be the first time in history and I am sure there is a very good reason for it."
"I now turn to the third report and I would like to thank Mr Camisón for the time and effort that he spent on this complex technical proposal related to safety in the movement of transportable pressure equipment."
"As the House will know, by adopting Directives 94/55 and 96/49, the Council has already ensured a high level of safety in the movement of transportable equipment by defining common rules on design, materials, filling and periodic testing of such equipment. However, one further demand needs to be met."
"The current situation is that transportable pressure equipment, for instance gas cylinders, moved from one Member State to another and then used cannot be refilled in the receiving Member State and then transported back to the first Member State without being retested, inspected and approved in the receiving country."
"This threatens the very existence of the single market and so obviously has to be changed."
"In the absence of mutual recognition of the conformity procedures and of markings of the inspection bodies in different Member States, these conditions will continue."
"The proposal before the House therefore seeks to rectify that."
"A further effect of this proposal is to ensure free circulation of transportable pressure equipment in the internal market, a facility which is not possible now because Directive 97/23 on pressure equipment excludes transportable pressure equipment from the scope."
"Since Amendments Nos 4, 6, 7, 11, 12 and 19 are consistent with the aims of the proposal, the Commission is able to accept them and, as a consequence of accepting Amendments Nos 6 and 19, the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 10 and 20 in so far as they relate to the date."
"When I conclude my time in the Commission, I can always get a job as the person who announces the lottery results on BBC television on Saturday nights."
"I have been training for that for some time."
"Señor Camisón's report provides me with the unique rehearsal in this number reading skill."
"Amendment No 9 deletes Type C inspection bodies and there are related editorial changes in Amendments Nos 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28."
"They can all be accepted by the Commission if the definition of Type B inspection bodies is modified."
"We will therefore frame our revised proposal accordingly."
"And people say that DG VII functionaries do not earn their money!"
"The other amendments, however, are not acceptable."
"Amendment No 1 is rejected since that 'whereas' clause is limited to the main objective of the proposal: transport safety."
"Amendments Nos 2 and 3 are primarily editorial changes but they are rejected because the original text is more accurate."
"Amendment No 14 is rejected because the limitation solely to existing Type B inspection bodies is too restrictive and would prevent new Type B inspection bodies from entering the market."
"Amendment Nos 16 and 20 are rejected since the Commission considers that frequency of controls upon relevant bodies and the details rightly fall under the competence of the Member States."
"Amendment No 22 is also rejected because it would not allow the same undertaking to be engaged in maintenance and periodic inspection and is therefore, in the view of the Commission, too restrictive."
"As I said at the outset, this is a technical proposal which is nevertheless a further contribution to safety in transport and I am grateful for the fact that it has the support of the rapporteur, Señor Camisón, and indeed of the House."
"Naturally I am pleased to note that the large number of amendments manifests the attention to detail that the proposal has received from the Transport Committee rather than any real differences of substance between European Parliament and the Commission on the issue."
"Dealing with three different proposals in one debate is obviously not easy and this is even more true when the proposals and the discussion are particularly technical."
"I know, however, that the House is well able to cope with such situations, apparently better than the Commission, and I look forward to progress on all three measures now before the Parliament."
"I must say that history is being broken for the second time in the course of this debate."
"Not only is Mr Cornelissen not here but I have managed, having been given 15 minutes of the Parliament's precious time, to finish in 13 minutes and 58 seconds."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I did not intend to spoil your future as announcer of the lottery numbers on the BBC, but you also, of course, have a past as a parliamentarian, and I had asked a question which certainly did not come up in your speech, that is, the question of how this nationality plate will be treated in Switzerland."
"I think it is in fact an important point if we introduce it in the European Economic Area but not in Switzerland."
"Is the Commission considering the possibility of finding a standard regulation in Europe which includes the Swiss authorities?"
"I am grateful to the honourable Member."
"I must say that some of my friends say that I am quite gifted in some respects, but I am not yet gifted enough to be able to read what is not written."
"Consequently, since the Swiss references are not part of this report, I am sure that the honourable Member, who is very understanding, will comprehend why I have not made the response."
"In addition, whilst I take full account of the difficulties that can be caused because Switzerland takes a different view, I am not anxious to enter any new material in the negotiations on land transport with Switzerland which we have just concluded very satisfactorily for the Union."
"I will discuss it very readily with him under other circumstances."
"It astonishes me, Commissioner, that you do not have a simple answer for a simple question, for normally you have an answer for everything, prepared or otherwise."
"I assume that you will follow up the question asked by Mr Ferber."
"In my opinion, as a stimulus we could say that we would perhaps be prepared, in exchange for recognizing this distinguishing plate, to fix the transit fee through Switzerland at 236 Swiss Francs."
"But maybe it would be better to discuss this over a whiskey!"
"First of all, I am aware that Switzerland is party to the Geneva and Vienna Conventions, so there is some reassurance there."
"I am also, as a special concession to Mr Jarzembowski, prepared to call the Swiss Transport Minister and recommend that in order that Mr Jarzembowski can wear any plates that he likes, he do so for the small consideration of paying double the Swiss vignette in order to pass through the country."
"Maybe it is a privilege he would not want to take advantage of."
"I certainly will see Mr Ferber on the specific issue that he raised."
"Mr President, I would not like to conclude this debate without offering my hearty congratulations to the Commissioner for his marvellous ability to trivialize this topic."
"Indeed, I have to put on record here that his frivolity contrasts greatly with the seriousness and concern which many sectors of European industry display, and it should go on record that this marked contrast has caught my attention."
"If the honourable Member cannot tell the difference between passing amusement at some of the text that I am obliged to read out to this House, and trivializing a proposal, then his wisdom is considerably less than his years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"Madam President, I would just like to say I was present although I am not included in the list at the back."
"Madam President, this also applies to me."
"I am not on the list either."
"But there is I something else I would like to say, Madam President. Yesterday the debate on the various oral questions was chaotic."
"We had a number of debates: Nigeria, Burma, the United Nations."
"These debates, and the speakers, were taken randomly."
"This throws Parliament into chaos, and is not very courteous towards the Commission representatives or the Presidency, who have difficulty making sense of anything from the different remarks which are made at cross-purposes."
"Madam President, I would therefore ask you whether in future, when as a group we submit to you the list of speakers per subject, you could keep to it."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I have taken note of your criticism."
"We shall discuss it amongst the few people who are leading the session here, and then it will certainly be possible next time to proceed in a more orderly fashion."
"Madam President, the Minutes of Wednesday Part I, page 1, sub-paragraph, ' the following spoke on the new rules' ."
"That is in the official record."
"I have been arguing that it was a new rule but have been assured by the Chair that it is not a new rule."
"It is something other than a new rule."
"I note the last sentence of the next paragraph which states 'The President replied that the new rules were being applied for the first time' ."
"If there is a procedure for new rules, this House has to agree to them."
"One gets a little tired of raising points of order on something so clear but it nevertheless is in the Minutes and it is incorrect."
"Mrs Ewing, in logical terms you are, of course, right."
"If it were a matter of changing the agenda that would have to be decided by the plenary."
"But it is not."
"It is a new rule, but it is not a change to the agenda."
"That was incorrectly noted in the Minutes."
"We must check it."
"You are right in your criticism; the item must be corrected."
"Madam President, I raise the report of the speech of Mr Titley in the report of proceedings of yesterday on the debate on Iraq."
"I ask the President to give a ruling as to whether this requires a personal statement from me and from the Member concerned, Mr Titley."
"He said in his speech 'I have never heard a speech of such distorted self-indulgent drivel than that which Mr Kerr give a short while ago.' Clearly many Members would agree with that and that is decent political debate."
"However, he goes on to say 'I now know that care in the community in the United Kingdom does not work' which is clearly an indication about my mental health."
"You may think that is true as well, but I suspect, under the Rules of this House, you are not allowed to cast aspersions on Members' mental health. I would ask you to make a judgement on whether I can make my three minutes' personal response."
"Can I also indicate that, as shown on page 25 of the Rainbow, I asked Mr Henderson, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whether it was true that the Financial Times had reported that Britain is preparing to use nuclear weapons against Iraq."
"He said in his reply to me that Mr Cook, Foreign Secretary, had denied this in the House of Commons."
"I have the transcript of Mr Cook's speech in which there is no denial."
"The Foreign Office officials are still briefing that Britain is preparing to use nuclear weapons on Iraq."
"Mr Kerr, I followed that myself yesterday."
"I was not in the Chair but remained in my place and heard what you asked."
"I also heard the answers given by the representative of the British Presidency."
"It is true that he did not answer this question precisely, but I wonder why you did not yesterday make your point, whilst the Presidency of the Council was still present."
"I take note of your comment, but in such cases it is wiser to rise to speak up immediately."
"Madam President, if Mr Kerr were to read Hansard of 10 February, he would see that it states: ' Will my Right Honourable friend, the Foreign Secretary, rule out the possibility of a nuclear attack on Iraq?"
"Mr Cook: Yes, I can rule that out straight away.'"
"Madam President, I wish to remind you that, two days ago, on 17 February, the German writer Ernst Jünger died at the age of 102."
"He was one of the main exponents of the conservative revolution in Germany and certainly, as pointed out by the international press today, an important author of European political thinking and twentieth century literature."
"He died at the age of 102 and is, therefore, an excellent witness of the twentieth century, a century full of contradictions;"
"Jünger, a free spirit, remained loyal to the principles of freedom and intellectual consistency, refusing any subjection to the totalitarian regimes of his time."
"And so, Madam President, it is the duty of the European Parliament to pay homage to the memory of this man."
"Mrs Angelilli we all regret the death of Ernst Jünger and know that he was a great thinker and writer, but what you have just said is not really a comment for the Minutes."
"We are still approving the Minutes."
"Madam President, I apologize for returning from the heights of Ernst Jünger to the quite ordinary parliamentary level of yesterday's Minutes."
"On page 8 under the heading ""subcritical nuclear tests' is a note saying that there is an objection by Mr Rübig. As a result, the heading ""safety in the Leopold District of Brussels' is to be dealt with instead."
"I want to make a correction here."
"It is not ""safety in the Leopold District of Brussels' but ""crime in Brussels' ."
"There is, I believe, a major difference between the two, since we are not fighting here for our own benefit, but in principle for safety in Brussels."
"Furthermore, it states here that the President informs us that he has declared the objection to be inadmissible in accordance with Article 47, paragraph 2 and that he intended to send Mr Rübig a letter with an explanation."
"Mr Rübig has received this letter."
"I have seen a copy of it."
"In the letter there is no more explanation than here in the Minutes."
"It would, I believe, be very appropriate, if he could pass on the information he has on to the Bureau."
"We would be very grateful if the President could tell us with which offices in Brussels he has had contact, what the concrete results of these conversations were and if he will also inform the House about them."
"In any case almost 50 Members have signed the resolution. They are really concerned about what is happening in Brussels and would therefore like to know what is going on."
"I believe the House has a right to be told."
"Would it not at least be possible for us to learn this week when we can expect to get this information?"
"(Applause)"
"Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, as far as I know, the President has said that he will take up these contacts."
"He has not done so yet and probably the details about whom he will contact are not yet fixed. I am quite sure that he will report on the matter."
"I will, nevertheless, pass this on to the Bureau."
"As regards your first comment, the Minutes can contain only what was said."
"If the wrong description or wrong terminology is used then that is unfortunate."
"However, thanks to your comment the item has now been corrected indirectly."
"Madam President, I just wish to refer to the last item on page 4 - the statement by Mrs Green, leader of the socialists - in the English version of the Minutes."
"I do not want to get into any type of war, be it nuclear or otherwise, with Mrs Green."
"I want to correct a statement she made yesterday concerning the Pery working party and the new rule which was introduced this week."
"Neither Mrs Nicole Pery, who has left this Parliament, nor the working party, made any suggestions concerning the application of this rule."
"What Mrs Nicole Pery reported to the Bureau was quite simply that she had various documents from different groups and individuals and many varied suggestions on this particular matter."
"She did not come down on one side or the other or make any such suggestion."
"So we go back now to the Conference of Presidents, because that is where the pressure for this particular rule came from."
"While I am clearing the decks on this particular matter, it is only right and proper that the House should know that when this first request came to the College of Quaestors, the College, in its varying political make-up, unanimously agreed that it was impossible to implement."
"It then went back to the Bureau, and the Bureau made the decision on the basis of what, I assume, the Conference of Presidents had requested."
"So, in order to clarify all this, let us not take a third outside organization into this, namely the Nicole Pery ad hoc committee, because I was a member of that working party and on this particular matter it did not do anything of that nature."
"I would suggest that we need reform, and we all agree on that."
"The dignity of this House is a priority above all other things and the dignity of this House was brought to its knees this particular week and it is time we reviewed it."
"As far as the agenda is concerned, Mr Killilea, we shall keep to it. Anybody can point matters out and if there are any problems, they will be corrected."
"What you have just discussed relates to events which go back as far as last July."
"Then this report was submitted."
"I remember very well that we discussed it in a session in Luxembourg."
"I cannot check it quickly this morning. I will, however, have it checked and then we shall return to it."
"Madam President, on the same subject: item 5 of the Minutes, which is on page 9 in the English version, and your reply to Mrs Ewing."
"Members have a variety of names for this attendance-checking procedure - some of them rather rude - but you mentioned a new rule and change of rules."
"Vice-President Nicole Fontaine actually refers to them as 'implementing measures' ."
"Which are they?"
"I do not have that is not in front of me at the moment, but we are, of course, all aware of the incidents in question and we know what we are talking about."
"I believe it has been said several times that there have been renewed discussions in the Bureau about the way in which attendance can be confirmed in future."
"Please let us wait for that and discuss it when the Bureau hands down other rules which are more easily applicable to the House or to the groups."
"I find it simply futile that we have now referred to this matter for the hundredth time in one way or another."
"This robs us of time for other more important discussions."
"It is now agreed that the Bureau has decided to deal with it again, to correct any possible mistakes and to ensure that it will be simpler in future to confirm attendance."
"Perhaps we can wait until we receive new proposals."
"Madam President, concerning Mr Kerr's remarks, I would like to draw to your attention an open letter sent to all Socialist Members."
"I will quote a small part of it: ' We would ask all Socialists to support this, particularly British Labour Members, who will be glad to know that we shall be circulating the names of those Members who voted for this amendment and therefore against the war throughout the Labour movement in Britain' ."
"I am not sure whether that is a carrot or a stick, but I have to inform the two individuals involved that I know my conscience and my duty on Iraq and how I will vote."
"I do not need instruction from a pair of political opportunists."
"Madam President, I share Mr Smith's viewpoint on these matters but I would like to return briefly to the Rules, the implementing measures, the procedures or the diktat from the Bureau."
"Yesterday the House agreed to allow Mrs Fontaine as President in the Chair then to conduct the sitting in a rather abnormal manner."
"All I seek are assurances that we will return to the instructions from the Bureau and that, when a roll-call is called, you will accept my wish to speak and note my presence at that time if I so desire."
"I hope and trust that you and future Presidents today will implement that particular measure without heeding the ill-advice that comes from your advisers."
"Mr Falconer, you have heard what I have said on this matter."
"I think that will suffice!"
"Madam President, I would simply like to remind Mr Falconer that this matter is perfectly clear, although I am sure he knows this from the Minutes."
"I had stated that yesterday's conduct was exceptional, due to the exceptional situation in which we found ourselves, since the voting time was divided in two to allow for the speech by the President of Portugal."
"Moreover, the first thing I did this morning was to ensure that the Minutes referred to this exceptional procedure."
"Mr Falconer could see, as I could, that they did."
"I therefore believe that this matter is completely clear."
"Madam President, I hope we are now moving away from the matter discussed at the last two sittings which brought Parliament into disrepute."
"Along the same lines as Mr Cot, may I have an assurance from you that when the changes to the Rules are drawn up, they will be put to the House so that the House can endorse or reject them?"
"That is all we are asking for."
"Madam President, I have just seen that my name does not appear in the list of Members present."
"I cannot rule out that I might have forgotten to sign in."
"In view of the many roll-call votes, I believe that can be entered later."
"Madam President, I notice that my name is missing on page 26 of the English version of the roll-call vote on Lange."
"It was a report I was particularly interested in and I voted on it."
"I said on Tuesday how important it was, with the new roll-call system and the new proposals coming out from the Conference of Presidents, that Members should understand all the regulations and that we should circulate these regulations to Members."
"It must also be made quite clear that Members themselves must hold a certain amount of responsibility for making sure they check that their names are recorded."
"Mistakes can be made."
"That will be corrected, Mr Sturdy."
"Madam President, I had made a suggestion in keeping with the Minutes."
"I had asked that a list be drawn up of Members who do not fulfil the criteria for the payment of allowances."
"I have not had any response concerning this matter nor have I seen any such list."
"However, I think that the most important thing should be to inform Members what to expect!"
"Mrs Guinebertière, miracles take a little longer!"
"I have this morning said several times that the Bureau will discuss this question again."
"Please be patient until we get an answer since this is all part of the matter which did not really have to be discussed in such depth in the context of the Minutes."
"However, we have done so."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Animal feed"
"The next item is the report (A4-0020\98) by Mrs Poisson on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposals for European Parliament and Council Directives amending:"
"I.Council Directive 93/74/EEC on feedingstuffs intended for particular purposes and amending Directives 74/63/EEC, 79/373/EEC and 82/471/EEC (COM(97)0408 - C4-0409/97-97/0208 (COD))II.Council Directive 95/69/EC laying down the conditions and arrangements for approving and registering certain establishments and intermediaries operating in the animal feed sector (COM(97)0409 - C4-0408/97-97/0213(COD))"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposals for directives submitted by the Commission are aimed at amending Directive 93/74/EEC on feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes through the integration of a new mechanism which would allow its field of application to extend to a new generation of products called nutritional supplements for animals. They are also aimed at amending Directive 95/69/EEC on the approval and registration of certain establishments and intermediaries operating in the animal feed sector."
"One important factor must still be underlined."
"In fact, having made commitments to the Committee of Inquiry into BSE in feedingstuffs and foodstuffs intended for human consumption, the Commission is proposing for the first time to apply the codecision procedure, in accordance with Article 100a of the Treaty."
"The Commission hopes to regulate the use of a new generation of products which have appeared on the market in all the Member States, with a view to defining a strict framework covering the nature of these products and their use."
"These new products, known as nutritional supplements, cannot be likened to complementary feedingstuffs or additive premixes."
"They must not contain medicinal substances, must be used under clearly defined conditions and for a short period only."
"Nutritional supplements are intended to adjust an animal's nutritional intake in response to a temporary increase in its nutritional requirements brought about by critical breeding or living conditions, such as during calving, weaning or at point of lay."
"Animal nutrition plays an important role in the human food chain."
"It is therefore necessary to ensure that the Directive's scope is clearly apparent from the definition of the term ""nutritional supplement' , so as to avoid a legal vacuum in the products used in the animal feed sector between straight or compound feedingstuffs and nutritional supplements."
"As regards Directive 95/69/EC, the Commission lays down certain obligations applying to operators in the animal feed sector, with a view to providing sounder guarantees of the quality of products destined for this sector."
"Nutritional supplements should be subject to the same rules as additive premixes, given that both categories of products generally contain the same proportion of additives."
"However, the Commission's position as regards the obligation to register gives rise to some reservations."
"In fact, the registration system proposed by the Commission for users of nutritional supplements would in practice create a register of breeders parallel to that provided for in Article 9 of Directive 96/23/EC, which has the aim of ensuring the correct use of substances in stock farming."
"It would create an additional administrative procedure which would be a burden for both operators and inspection departments without bringing any real practical benefits."
"This is why, in the desire to maintain clarity and simplification, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 11 and 12 from Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf relating to the list of components and their proportions, since obligations are already defined in this area."
"In conclusion, I support the new provisions put forward by the Commission which will provide consumers with an extra guarantee of the quality of products."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Poisson, for her very clear report on the proposal to amend the Council directive on feedstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes."
"Over the last two years we have all become very much more aware of the need to ensure that anything entering the human food chain via animal feed is carefully controlled and presents no dangers, either to human or animal health."
"I have more than once drawn the attention of this House to the dangers of indiscriminate additions of substances such as antibiotics or other medicaments to animal feed, not to deal with a particular, temporary health problem of an individual animal, but as general prophylactics."
"I therefore welcome the precautionary note clearly set out in the Commission proposal to regulate the use of new products with high concentrations of vitamins, trace elements, fatty acids, etc. as food supplements to normal animal feed."
"Of course there are times in an animal's life cycle when such dietary additions can be very valuable, such as when a cow is in calf."
"The rapporteur's proposal that there should be very clear definitions as to when such products should be allowed for use, should be supported."
"The Commission's proposal requires stock farmers to register if they use such products."
"This was regarded in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as being excessively bureaucratic."
"But it is important to set clear guidelines to stock farmers to ensure that they understand the parameters within which such products should be used."
"Prime among them is the stipulation that they should only be used for a limited period and for a very specific purpose, to ensure that no possible residues from such products could remain within meat or other products which eventually are sold for human consumption."
"Furthermore, the precise composition and quantities of such products should be clearly stated on the label."
"Never again should farmers be able to say with truth that they are unaware of exactly what they are feeding to their animals."
"Madam President, animals, like humans, are entitled to good and healthy food."
"Our legislation should serve this aim."
"Furthering this aim, and certainly not standing in the way of it, is what we should focus on with this directive."
"The directive deals with nutritional supplements which serve a particular nutritional purpose; it concerns dietary feed which should not contain any medicinal substances."
"The national legislation which will have to be based on this directive must be clear."
"It should be possible to hold the companies manufacturing and launching these products onto the market responsible for this part of the food chain."
"In the meantime it appears that several directives, and consequently also national legislations in this area, are in force, and it is difficult to see any overall coherence among them."
"For example, a registration requirement exists for manufacturers of ordinary compound feedingstuffs, or for so-called premixes, but there is no system of approval for these firms."
"It therefore makes no sense and it is wrong to lay down an approval system for the manufacturers of nutritional supplements, which contain no pharmalogically active substances."
"This is unnecessarily bureaucratic, especially if these nutritional supplements are only used in-house at the stock farm."
"The rapporteur's proposal to delete the suggested approval procedure for manufacturers of nutritional supplements has our support."
"Yet in the report by Mrs Poisson - whom I would like to congratulate on her clear presentation of this complex matter - there is one bit of unnecessary centralist meddling in the use of nutritional supplements."
"In Amendment 3 it is noted quite rightly that it is vital that the notion ""temporary use of nutritional supplements' is not to be taken as a reference to a random limited period, but that the length of use should be determined case by case."
"A duration stipulation of this kind will have to be supported by a bibliographic case, underpinned by scientific facts which justify the nutritional objective and the period of administration."
"Using this as a starting point, the condition in Amendment 6, which covers the legal text, stating that nutritional supplements intended for pets should not be administered for more than eight days, is completely wrong and contrary to good animal husbandry practice at many stock farms within the European Union."
"It should be possible for this maximum period to differ according to the type of farm and type of animal."
"Thus, the eight day condition must be deleted."
"I am convinced that the regulation of sensible animal feed in all its aspects should never be a subject of controversy between farmers, consumers and organizations promoting animal welfare."
"I therefore think that the Commission might be able to embark on a codification of all legislation on the matter."
"Many would see the importance of this."
"It could come about in a codecision procedure with the European Parliament, as is the case with this directive."
"Madam President, I have been able to note this week that not only does Mrs Poisson write a very good report, she can also write a good newsletter."
"I am familiar with both."
"Firstly, my group is looking forward to the fact that the proposal will collapse over the co-decision procedure."
"We think it is extremely important that after the BSE crisis, this Parliament will have to deal in all kinds of areas with the food that people, consumers, consume daily within the European Union."
"Like the rapporteur, we believe that the use of drugs, nutritional supplements, and so on, should under no circumstances become a habit in animal feeding."
"Since the BSE crisis we have learnt how careful we should be with animal feed."
"That is why we support the proposals of the Commission in principle, as well as the rapporteur's amendments."
"Yet, like the Christian Democrat Group, we have the gravest objection to the eight day period."
"We find it difficult to insist for all eternity that a certain product can only be used for eight days."
"When used under expert supervision, it might benefit the health of the animal if it is given for nine or ten days."
"This should be possible, so in our opinion the eight day restriction should be removed."
"I would like to make another remark on something quite different which does not relate to the proposal as such."
"In Europe we are improving our standards."
"We are making food healthier, we are making meat and animal products healthier."
"But what happens to imports?"
"What is the use of introducing strict conditions in Europe, whilst we import, under WTO rules, increasing amounts of products over which we have no control. I would like to advise the Commission, when the occasion arises as part of WTO, or in any forum with America, to state that we as Europeans have every right to know what our food contains, and that we can demand this from the imports which end up on our table from other continents in the world."
"This is a view which cannot be found in the Commission proposal, and which is not discussed in the report, but which our group believes does require attention."
"Mr President, this is a question of food additives which are not medicaments."
"These are not the main problem with regard to people's health in the European Union."
"The biggest problems are the use of hormones and antibiotics, the use of substances that are prohibited."
"We cannot, however, fully rely on the chemical industry in this matter when, under the guise of added ingredients, they produce substances harmful to humans."
"Whenever there are regulations people always try to get round them."
"A good example of that is the use of asthma medicines at the Olympics: sportsmen and women appear to be severely asthmatic."
"In exactly the same way it may be that some animals need added ingredients in accordance with the regulations."
"I think we must therefore monitor the use of additives; Mrs Poisson's recommendations are far too wishy-washy."
"The Commission is being more responsible in wishing to establish how these substances are being used."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the warm welcome which the Commission's proposals."
"Like any other product destined for animal consumption, nutritional supplements must be subject to strict regulation, with regard to the needs of the breeding sector."
"Therefore, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in particular its rapporteur, Mrs Poisson, who has been rightly praised by various speakers for her constructive motion for a resolution as well as for the amendments she has proposed."
"For the most part, the Commission agrees with the amendments proposed concerning the draft amendment of Directive 93/74: Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, aimed at strengthening and clarifying the proposed measures can be included in their entirety; in the same way, Amendments Nos 1 and 6 can be approved, on the condition that a slight change is made to ensure that there is greater coherence between the provisions of the regulation concerned and some of the amendments which have been taken over."
"In addition, the Commission can approve Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 10, aimed at simplifying the amendment of Directive 95/69 as regards the approval and registration of certain establishments and intermediaries operating in the animal feed sector."
"The Commission cannot include Amendments Nos 11 and 12 which require a qualitative and quantitative declaration of the ingredients used in both dietetic feedingstuffs and the nutritional supplements given to animals."
"As regards Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's speech, the Commission points out that it has already begun a study on the possibility of monitoring this declaration using analytic methods and, as promised, will inform Parliament of the results of this study as soon as they are available, as well as of its intentions in this area."
"Finally, as regards Mr Mulder's reference to the World Trade Organization, the Commission is opposed to those who would like more flexible regulations, and support the adoption of strict rules. We feel that this criterion should remain in place."
"Madam President, can you ask the Commissioner if my statements, made in reference to the Commission's statements, are correct?"
"Then we need rather more clarification of the question."
"The matter of the study is a completely different one."
"This relates to the open declaration in the vase of feedingstuffs and we have agreed to wait for this study."
"I want to know whether my statements are correct: then these amendments must be accepted."
"This conclusion here is based on false statements by the Commission."
"Madam President, I would like to point out that we believe the information presented by the Commission to be correct, but that we will complete our study in order to allow us to clarify any doubts that might exist."
"In any case, the Commission's position is clear, and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is now aware of it."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that obviously cannot be clarified in the way you mean."
"The discussion is closed."
"The vote takes place today at 12.00 noon."
"Impact of biotechnology on agriculture"
"The next item is the Report (A4-0037\98) by Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the impact of biotechnology on agriculture."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all, as the rapporteur in the Initiative Report on the impact of biotechnology on agriculture, to thank very sincerely all those who have helped me so magnificently in the work."
"Every new technology conceals risks within itself but also promises advantages."
"I am of the opinion that broad statements which only condemn or only glorify, are inappropriate."
"Modern biotechnology, as a key technology of the 21st century will make a central contribution to feeding the global population."
"Of great importance in this will be the need to treat the natural fundamentals of life in a manner which is caring and long lasting."
"The use of bioand genetic technology brings advantages for agriculture."
"A world population which is growing out of all proportion against a background of static-remaining areas for cultivation obliges us, across all party boundaries, not to shut ourselves off from the use of new technologies."
"In all the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development this was the prevalent opinion."
"Scientists are of the opinion that the use of biotechnology can make a contribution of 20-30 % of the supply of food."
"Of course it always has to be borne in mind, that with any use of genetic-technologically modified organisms the principle must always apply that health and the environment must not be damaged in any way."
"It makes no sense and is irresponsible to use this topic simply to stir up the fears of consumers."
"Factually accurate information and enlightenment in the field of biotechnology and its applications should always be highly valued."
"In my view, economic considerations, however important they may be, must never take priority over people's health."
"But the scepticism which prevails in Europe will not change the fact that this innovative technology is being used throughout the world."
"To renounce biotechnology and gene technology would mean leaving this important sphere to our competitors on the world market."
"European agriculture needs this technology as an essential means of improving its technical proficiency and the effects on the environment."
"We must catch up as quickly as possible on the lead gained by countries outside Europe from the introduction of biotechnology so that the agricultural commodities market is not lost to world wide competition."
"I therefore call in my report - and here I turn to the Commission - for the very rapid setting up of a legal framework, so that the consumer can decide what to buy on the basis of enlightenment and appropriate product labelling."
"The comprehensive and risk-free realisation of the potential of bio-technology needs the best possible framework of control."
"This must take into account the fact that we in Europe are making possible the innovative development of bio-technology which is at the same time aware of its responsibilities."
"I also support an intensive, constructive and factual dialogue with the people about this new technology."
"Bio-technology and its application together will fundamentally determine the development of agriculture."
"Finally I would like to point out that in many spheres, but particularly in our capacity as politicians, we are not only responsible for what we do but also for what we do not do."
"I would like once more to appeal to the Commissioner at the end of this discussion to tell us quite clearly how the Commission plans to proceed in this matter against the background of this Initiative Report."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Keppelhoff for her work which, while being brief, is very serious and balanced and does not omit any of the fundamental points of the impact of biotechnology on the agricultural sector."
"Her report is inspired by a positive view of the biotechnology and their potential for the agricultural sector."
"I take note of it and agree with what it has to say."
"A positive view is not an idyllic and illuminist view that ignores the problems."
"On the contrary, I believe the report we are preparing to approve illustrates all these problems extremely clearly, including those of an ethical and moral nature that need to be faced by trying to provide a way of offering the consumer every guarantee and, at the same time, a favourable framework for the development of this sector, which has great potential for agriculture."
"There are three aspects of interest to agriculture."
"The first is environmental."
"Using genetic techniques, we can reduce the use of plant protection products and chemical synthesis products and obtain considerable advantages in respect of greater ecocompatibility of the crops from the point of view both of pollution of the strata and of product safety."
"The second aspect of interest is that of development of food products worldwide to face the problems of food safety resulting from the population increase."
"As rightly observed by Mrs Keppelhoff, so far we have dealt with the increase in the arable and irrigated areas and the increase in production with the use of fertilizers and manure."
"Today, the responsible use of biotechnology can enable the use of these to be stopped."
"The third aspect is the development of biomass, as sources of renewable energy."
"We know that the Commission is active in the sense, that work programmes and proposals exist that are aimed at this sector."
"However, all these opportunities are not being developed in a consistent and painless manner, it cannot be a question of working shut up in a laboratory and then leaving it convinced that a miraculous solution had been found for everything."
"Dialogue with the consumers is decisive and their attitude is of the utmost importance."
"However, I have to admit that there has often been a great deal of joking, with thoughtlessness or improvisation, or because, as Mr Happart has suggested, the interest in consumer health has been sacrificed to financial and economic interests, and sometimes those opposed to biotechnology have aroused consumer concern in bad faith."
"Europe cannot withdraw into a useless dispute between those in favour of and those against biotechnology."
"The conditions are there for doing more than that!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report."
"I would also like to compliment her on the very clear way in which this complicated and very emotive subject was discussed, not only in general terms but specifically in relation to environmentally-friendly and sustainable production, world food supplies, economic aspects and the future prospects for genetic engineering."
"During earlier debates in this House I said the purpose of modern plant breeding is to improve quality and increase the resistance to disease while also increasing the yields of cultivated plants."
"Genetic engineering makes it possible to achieve these aims more efficiently and in a much shorter time than by conventional propagation."
"I agree with the views set out in the EU White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment that biotechnology is one of the technologies which will determine the future of European competitiveness."
"Unfortunately, surveys show that at this stage more than half of European citizens are opposed to the release and marketing of genetically modified foods."
"I believe the vast majority holds this view because of the influence of scare stories and theories which are completely without scientific foundation."
"The full benefits of biotechnology will not be manifest unless public trust and approval are first secured."
"The only way this can be achieved is through continuous research to ensure absolute safety and maximum transparency in that research, including explanations to consumers of the technical details should they wish to avail themselves of them."
"The compositional quality and indeed the bacteriological quality of foods are more accurately measured today than ever before."
"Consumers can feel at ease that this technology, which is highly monitored and tightly regulated, will ensure that Europeans continue to be the best fed people in today's world."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to thank our colleague for her excellent report which reasserts the fact that biotechnology should come under a specific and individual programme within the Commission's 5th Framework Programme."
"It is important to point out that the European Union has already made significant efforts in research and the application of biotechnology in agriculture and the agro-food industry."
"These efforts must therefore be maintained."
"This report also underlines the economic importance of the introduction of biotechnological products in the field of agriculture, while pointing out that it is necessary to inform and educate the public effectively."
"Modern agriculture will have to face up to the major challenge of providing for a world population which, according to forecasts, will double over the next 30 years, and this at a time when we are experiencing a global reduction in the amount of land available for cultivation."
"Over the past 30 years, the productivity of agriculture has improved due, amongst other things, to a significant increase in the use of additional products such as protective agents and pesticides."
"In the years to come, modern agriculture will have an additional challenge to face: respect for man and for the environment."
"In order to maintain the competitiveness not only of agriculture but also of its related industries, it is important to supply it with the means necessary to participate in the game of world competition, particularly within the controlled framework of reducing Community aid to agriculture, as laid out in Agenda 2000."
"Biotechnology can provide solutions, but we obviously cannot accept them at any price."
"Consequently, we must adapt the regulation system, which will have to accept a double challenge: it will need to be flexible enough not to hold up any initiatives in this field, and it will need to be rigid enough to respect both the primary principle, that is, consumers' sanitary health and the principle of ethics."
"In conclusion, if we allow this technological revolution to take place outside the boundaries of the Union, we will be left with many concerns for the future, not only for the economy, but also for European agriculture."
"Therefore, the major challenges now are to encourage the use of biotechnology in creating an agricultural industry which is productive and durable and which respects man and the environment, to help companies involved in this field to become established within the Community and to continue efforts made in the areas of research and innovation."
"In order to overcome these challenges, Europe must also ensure that its consumers are better informed and better educated and that they are reassured with accurate, scientificallyproven arguments."
"Madam President, my group does not share the optimism with regard to the impact and benefits of gene technology."
"We have major concerns with regard to the health of consumers and we have major concerns about the impact on the environment."
"We hold the view that unlike the sphere of medicines, where possibly the side-effects of a product can be tolerated the sphere of food cannot tolerate any side effects."
"As long as this is not guaranteed we must treat this technology with very great caution."
"We do not share, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, the hopes you expressed with regard to feeding the world."
"We must teach people how to run agriculture so that they have enough to eat."
"The satisfying of people's hunger will, in my view, not come from the key industries of gene technology."
"In the matter of factually accurate information, this is exactly what we require and our amendments are aimed at obtaining this factual information from science, but also from the Commission."
"For example, science has always told us that genetechnologically modified organisms would not transmit further, not skip generations."
"However, we do have the case of the herbicide resistance of rape, where the generation skip to a weed took place, and I find that this contradicts the certainty which is being dangled in front of us."
"We therefore demand first and foremost that science must create certainty in this matter o that we can move into this risk technology."
"There does remain a ray of hope: the Commission will accept Parliament's proposal and exclude the biosphere of gene technology."
"We shall have a statutory regulation whereby bioproducts may not come into contact with gene technology. That urgently requires precise labelling of the use of gene technological processes in food."
"I look forward to the conflict between these two areas and the competition in the positive sense."
"Then we shall see which foods will be accepted by the people and I think that in the long term the bioline will be the line which secures the feeding of the world."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert's excellent report on the application of biotechnology to agriculture seems to me, nevertheless, somewhat moderate given that it is a topic which is often the subject of heated debates."
"However, we must recognize that it forms a good basis for discussion because Madame rapporteur has objectively presented us with the opportunities and challenges of biotechnology applied to agriculture."
"Faced with expectations and with concern on the part of the public, we, the lawmakers, and the consumers outline what exactly is expected from these new technologies."
"There is no doubt that the enormous potential that exists for developing biotechnology could lead us towards a new green revolution."
"It is we who must decide what it will be like."
"The image of the world farm providing for an overpopulated planet is more like a nightmare than paradise."
"Although excessive concentration and specialization lead to an increase in productivity, which are important in the short-term, they also lead to more fragile surroundings and more vulnerable populations."
"Can we imagine the dramatic effects we would see if a single seed which had become the only standard in the world became diseased?"
"These choices are at odds with our convictions and with our European way of conceiving durable development."
"The green revolution must be mastered rather than endured."
"This means guiding agricultural policies so that they are based on the advantages their surroundings offer."
"It also means that at an international level we must establish a coherent, legislative framework in order to avoid concentrating cultures and technologies in the hands of a few privileged people."
"Rather than trying to provide for the world population from giant, highly specialized centres of production, we must ensure that these new technologies are made as widely available as possible."
"The rules to be established at an international level must be based the highest levels of safety for man and for the environment, and aim to avoid the setting up of any sort of free zone fearing neither God nor man and permitting everything, particularly in terms of genetics, to the benefit of certain sorcerer's apprentices greedy for profit."
"Money is money after all!"
"My own belief is that biotechnology must not take over from nature, but should allow us to profit from its diversity on a longterm basis."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must take up a strong political stance and take action so that the WTO takes these demands into consideration."
"For the good of public health and consumers it is the duty of the European Union to acknowledge that European agriculture is an exception. If we fail to do this, we will eventually have to find the political courage to reject unjust compromises in the future."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report in a very difficult field."
"Certainly developments in the field of biotechnology bring a tremendous challenge to the agricultural industry and beyond."
"The question is whether we move with the new developments and new technologies or stand aside and allow others to set the pace."
"I personally have to admit that I have terrible concerns about a lot of the new technologies and things that are happening now."
"I would also like to ensure that we in Europe do not lose out if we say no."
"That is the bottom line as far as we are concerned."
"We must proceed with extreme caution."
"There is a very clear concern in the mind of the consumer and, taking into consideration past events, I think one has to sympathize with that concern."
"Consumers are sceptical and will require convincing that the legal framework that is put in place to control and act as the safeguard will ensure the most stringent monitoring of the new arrangements."
"Whatever is put in place cannot be seen to be weak and lacking the ability to control the harmful aspects that might develop."
"To this end we must make doubly sure that all genetically engineered food should be clearly labelled, in a transparent way, so that consumers can see what they are purchasing."
"In this way there can be no ambiguity or reason for any concern in the mind of the consumer."
"I have no problem in principle with the continued research and development in this field."
"But, as I have said, we must have maximum transparency, control and full knowledge of the ultimate objectives."
"As long as we are assisting society and the consumer, and not using and abusing technology to increase the profit margins of the major multinationals at the expense of consumer confidence, then I am prepared to give tentative support to current developments."
"We must give a clear warning that any abuse of these new developing technologies by those involved will be dealt with in the most severe manner."
"Although I have my reservations, I hope I am also realistic and it is that realism that forces me to give my qualified support at this time."
"I feel I speak for many when I say that it cannot be taken for granted."
"Madam President, the proposals before the House reflect the lessons that have been learned across Europe from the BSE crisis."
"That crisis taught the value of caution where foodstuffs are concerned, especially as regards animals and meat eaten by human beings."
"Everyone involved in this crisis has suffered: producers, consumers and the ancillary industries."
"The proposals that we are talking about now are a necessary step, but this step has to be taken - as my colleague from Northern Ireland has said - with great caution."
"There is a clear need to lay down a strict, enforceable framework of rules governing the nature of the products we are discussing."
"Animal nutrition plays a crucial role in the human food chain, so this is a vital report."
"Confidence is of the essence."
"Without confidence in the standards of foodstuffs, the entire basis of our agricultural industry is put in jeopardy."
"I would underscore again that extreme caution is needed in biotechnology."
"It is high-risk and there are unknown risks which lie ahead."
"Great care is essential."
"I might add, in concluding, that the recent outbreak of BSE in the United Kingdom affected Northern Ireland."
"Northern Ireland has been unfairly penalized by having all beef exports banned by this Union."
"This was despite the very low incidence of BSE in the province and our excellent traceability system, which is better than anywhere else in the whole European Union."
"The Commission has proposed a lifting of this ban in Northern Ireland."
"We welcome that, but the standing veterinary committee seems to be engaged in delaying tactics."
"I call on those Member States which, for political reasons, are continuing to block the lifting of the ban, to start looking at the objective, scientific evidence."
"The beef ban for Northern Ireland is unjust and should be lifted immediately."
"Any further delay would rightly be regarded as political."
"As our beef industry is worth over £50 million per year, agriculture is our biggest industry."
"The Commission has decided that the time for action is now, and I endorse this view."
"Madam President, for the balanced and, above all, convincing report I would like to thank the rapporteur Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert."
"I am sure that in future there will be much discussion of this subject."
"The discussion on biotechnology is indeed usually a very controversial one and like many other Members I, too, see advantages and positive effects in this field."
"Possibly the result will be an increase in jobs, but in spite of all this we should not be so blue-eyed as to see only the advantages."
"There are certain risks."
"I can only support the rapporteur explicitly when under point No 2 she demands an optimal control framework which includes the impact on the environment, on every single animal, on the health and well-being of people and all the ethical aspects."
"Do we really know everything about the interaction of gene technologically modified organisms in the overall ecological system?"
"How do we deal with waste and residual matter?"
"Where does the residual risk end or where does the risk begin even?"
"What is the long-term impact on the metabolic and other natural processes in the living organism?"
"Anyone who has read the article about the Monsanto report ""Green Gene Technology' , Volume 39 of 9.2.98, No.6, learns there are only positive results and effects."
"There do not appear to be any risks, or at least they are not mentioned."
"There are obvious advantages, but precisely because of that the responsibility-awareness of all those involved must be alerted to the not least very profitable possibilities."
"Therefore it can only support explicitly the announcement by the Commission in its proposed Amendment to Directive 90\220\EEC that it will undertake a broad evaluation of the direct and indirect risks to human health and the environment."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is in the interests of the farmers and the consumers of the European Union to study critically the use of gene technology and to consider both the advantages and the risks."
"The use of gene technology cannot be excluded out of hand, but we need clear rules and a clear administration."
"It is a concern of all farmers that the confidence of the consumers is fostered and that can only be ensured, through the greatest possible transparency and unambiguous marking of food and animal feedstuffs which are produced by means of gene technological methods."
"It would be wrong to negate these new developments, since in many parts of the world they are already being used professionally."
"In my view it is nevertheless necessary to orientate the statutory framework conditions to the greatest possible extent to the needs of the consumers and the farmers."
"An optimal framework of control must be created in order to make possible a biotechnological sphere which is aware of its responsibilities. In other words, we need a statutory framework which is efficient, quick and transparent and at the same time meets the requirements of the most comprehensive clarification possible of all safety questions."
"For me the essential element in this context is the situation and management of imports from third countries."
"I therefore demand that this is dealt with immediately."
"A step by step procedure in the release of gene technology modified organisms is a necessary condition and we must not allow a general go-ahead to small and large-scale open experiments."
"Each case must be tested separately, in the same way that our decisions here must be made."
"At any rate there must be the greatest possible degree of safety and all questions about any procedural step must be clarified before a further stage in the development can take place."
"I am against the general shortening of the testing periods."
"I would like once more to emphasise how extremely important it is to ensure that when gene technologically modified organisms are used, neither the health of the people nor the environment is impaired."
"Madam President, I wish to thank Mrs Keppelhoff for her work in bringing forward a report which represents a reasonable balance between the importance and potential of biotechnology in the development of agriculture and food production, on the one hand, and on the other the understandable concern of citizens about possible ethical implications, which is shared by all who wish to see technology developed for the benefit of mankind."
"For farmers, who are the custodians of our land resource and responsible to society for guaranteeing food security and quality, it is of the utmost importance that the benefits of science and research are available and applied to this sector."
"It is to the credit of those who manage our land resources that they have been at the forefront in the application of modern technology."
"Hence the remarkable progress in agricultural production, in food quality and safety."
"I am a supporter of the concept of sustainability and the development of renewable resources but I also live in the real world."
"I am realistic enough to know that those who would keep agriculture in the dark ages have little to offer in the way of solutions to the threat of world hunger, a reality which future generations of farmers will be called on to address. It must be borne in mind that the world's productive land resource remains constant and much of it will not respond to established agricultural practices."
"It is only through ongoing research, the application of new science, including safe and tested biotechnology, that the full potential of land resources can be harnessed for society."
"We need, however, as other speakers have said, a balanced and sensible approach."
"I fully share the view of those who have expressed concern with regard to the application of genetic engineering to humans which I strongly oppose."
"It must also be acknowledged that biotechnology has made a significant contribution to the development of modern medicine."
"Biotechnology is not a recent discovery, it has been applied, as the rapporteur has said, in varying degrees since 1970."
"There is now a greater understanding of its potential and benefits for mankind."
"It is one of the key technologies of the twenty-first century and there is an obligation on us to use this in a careful and planned way."
"As should be the case with the application of all new research, transparency and consumer information are important."
"To this extent I fully support the case made by other speakers in this debate that labelling of all genetically modified food is important so that the consumer can make a choice."
"Finally, I say to those who hold positions of influence in society and who, for their own good reasons, oppose the development of biotechnology, that they should be careful not to overstate or exaggerate their position."
"The future of world agriculture, the profession of farming, the health of our citizens and employment in the food sector are dependent on the development of a sustainable agriculture based on the benefits of ongoing research and the application of carefully tested new technology."
"Madam President, some interesting things can be learned from the latest Eurobarometer on Biotechnology ."
"It appears, for instance, that the European citizen feels less optimistic about biotechnology, whilst his knowledge of modern biotechnology has in fact increased."
"The interviewees on the whole have little faith in their governments, as these restrict themselves to a risk analysis of new products for the safety of humans and animals."
"The general opinion is that governments should pay much more attention to the ethical aspects of biotechnology."
"I do not wish to play down the positive aspects of gene technology, but I do wish to remind the national governments and the European Commission of their responsibility."
"Government must curb man's laxity."
"Legislators have the responsibility to indicate clearly which limits should be observed."
"An essential part of this is a thorough deliberation of the values and standards against which new techniques are tested."
"The Bible teaches us that in nature we are dealing with God's creation."
"The Biblical concept of custodianship is therefore a central factor for me."
"It means we should build and maintain."
"Only if we use creation as God intended, is it able to serve man."
"Plants and animals must not be degraded to production factor, which can be manipulated to our heart's content."
"If no thorough deliberation of the limits of biotechnology is initiated, I fear we will be relinquishing control to research and our trade partners."
"I therefore cannot support the plea in the Keppelhoff report for the harmonization of European testing legislation with those of Japan and the United States."
"It is to be expected, of course, that technological companies will locate in countries with the most flexible preconditions."
"The fact that 27 out of 43 registered products are in the name of the United States says something about the ease with which they handle such techniques."
"But that should be no reason for Europe to opt for a less careful testing procedure."
"Madam President, gene technological manipulation has nothing whatsoever to do with conquering world hunger."
"We can only combat global hunger by offering those countries in which it prevails fair social development possibilities."
"Sociologically it has long since been proved that there is a close connection between the population explosion and social emergency."
"To use population growth as an argument in favour of the need for gene technologically manipulated foods is a pure and simple deception."
"The same applies to the assertion that gene technological manipulation enables us to reduce the use of fertilizers."
"I regard as particularly questionable Point 16 of the report which declares cross-frontier open experiments to be appropriate."
"The promotion of communication for gene technological manipulation must also involve promoting the communication of information about the dangers of gene manipulation."
"Madam President, I also wish to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her own-initiative report on the impact of biotechnology on agriculture, which sets out in a very balanced way the opportunities and risks presented by the rapidly expanding development of biotechnological processes."
"There are huge vested interests involved."
"A number of large multinational companies are investing heavily in biotechnology, developing products which could be of great value to the human race, particularly in helping raise agricultural output and thereby tackling food shortages in parts of the world where they exist."
"All too often, however, the aim is to establish a monopoly position over important market sectors to maximize profits, and the poorest farmers in the world are either further impoverished or put out of business completely."
"Of course, companies need to make profits to survive, and many jobs are provided by the biotechnological industries."
"However, as previous speakers have pointed out, these profits should be made within a basic ethical and regulatory framework to ensure that new biotechnological products are beneficial, rather than harmful, to the health of human beings and other living creatures, and also to the wider environment."
"Governments and the Commission of the European Union have a role to play in encouraging beneficial application of biotechnological products by supporting research, basic research, which is independent of commercial concerns and has at its prime purpose the discovery of biotechnological applications which really will benefit the world rather than company profits."
"It worries me greatly that agricultural and horticultural research organizations and university departments which used to be publicly funded are now increasingly reliant on multinational companies for their finance and are thereby prevented from pursuing basic biotechnological research, independent of the need to make a rapid financial return."
"Commercial concerns should not be allowed to dominate this vital area totally."
"Madam President, today, world food problems are more complex than they were twenty or thirty years ago, in terms of volume of production in some parts of the world, such as like Africa and Asia, or of quality, as in the case of the European Union."
"Biotechnology has been able to offer solutions to these various situations, creating varieties with higher yields and others that are disease-resistant, and by reducing the use of chemical products which are usually harmful to the environment."
"As our rapporteur suggests, the time has come to end the demagogic vilification of biotechnology and genetic engineering, because these techniques can in fact provide consumers with supplies of adequate quantity and quality and protect environmental quality."
"Moreover, if the European Union does not use these technical and scientific resources, it will find it quite impossible to respond to increasing world demand for food, for which it must contend with the major exporting powers."
"For European agriculture not to use these techniques which are employed by its main competitors would be like taking part in a bicycle race against competitors driving cars."
"We cannot, therefore, be afraid of using biotechnology and genetic engineering, although we must be realistic, disciplined and cautious."
"Consequently, the European Union should draw up a clear and operational legal framework that covers such important issues as the environmental impact of these new products, their effects on human health and on the well-being of animals and, of course, the compliance with previously-defined ethical standards."
"Finally, I would like to say how important it is that the next round of GATT should include clear rules in this regard, without which unacceptable distortions of trade could well be created."
"I would like to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her excellent work."
"This is a very sensible and balanced report which will be extremely useful to the European Union."
"Madam President, with the problem and the report by Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, we are getting into the myths of Prometheus or Demeter, and it is true that biotechnologies will go through both good times and bad."
"Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert rightly informs us that through this technology we can obtain a whole range of modified plants (potatoes, soya, rice, cotton, rice, tobacco, etc.), that 32 million hectares have already been cultivated, that 6, 000 experiments have already been conducted and that there have been positive results."
"We can fight against viral diseases in sugar beet, the European corn borer, fungus on potatoes which can lower harvests by 20 % and we are even building plant factories."
"So we have brought about the third industrial revolution whereby the mylolepine in potatoes has increased adhesive capacity, gene technology allows an increase in the content of oleic acid in oilseed rape, we can manufacture detergents, lacquers and cooling liquids and we even have larger fish and transgenic poplars which produce more wood."
"Finally, the dream of having heaven on earth is to become a reality."
"However, there are still risks involved."
"Firstly, there is trickery involved in the terminology."
"The word ""bio' is a favourable word and the word ""techno' reminds us of a sort of natural music which would be modified."
"As soon as the words ""techno' or ""bio' are used, young people are likely to be supportive."
"In addition, there is a contradiction: a contradiction between fallow land and the genetically modified organisms."
"We cannot use the fallow land because of world overproduction and then produce GMOs in order to fight hunger, since, if there is a hunger problem, we might as well recultivate the fallow land!"
"There is also a contradiction between the GMOs and the MGQs, because we cannot increase the yield of oilseed rape and then have maximum guaranteed quantities under the GATT for rape if we do not have enough."
"There is obviously a very real risk from the multinational monopolies seized by Novartis, Cargyll or Monsanto, since these multinationals in the Arizona desert have stockpiled more than six million plants for which they possess the patent."
"Resistance to antibiotics has been discussed."
"My colleagues have not seen any mechanical factors, or dare I say quantum factors, which are much more dangerous and which involve the molecular composition of plants."
"All plants and all life are made up of four sugar sticks: ATCN."
"This is the elementary alphabet and this alphabet vibrates in quantum mechanics."
"Changing one of the elements of this molecular composition is the same as changing the atomic vibration of the plant, and we do not know what the consequences of this would be."
"There is therefore a risk involved in the great universal harmony and the great universal division; there is the risk of a false, yet to be found, molecular note."
"In other words, the ""mad-cow' lesson seems to have been forgotten."
"I believe that Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert is right: we must not work against progress."
"However, time is not yet running out!"
"There could be at least a moratorium before there is widespread dissemination!"
"Labelling is still an illusion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must find a balance, an ancient balance which comes from Greek mythology, between the need for progress and the need to respect natural harmonies, because life is beautiful and we should not play with it!"
"Madam President, the principles of a computer are actually quite simple."
"Basically it is a question of adding zeros and ones."
"The mechanical adding machines of the 1800s were actually far more complicated, but because computers can add up so quickly, they can carry out infinitely more tasks that the adding machines of the 1800s could do."
"As we all know, computers have opened up entirely new areas for mankind and science."
"Biotechnology is old in the sense that for many hundreds of years we have deliberately changed the genetic make up of animals and plants."
"However, this relates to the old methods in the same way that computers relate to the old adding machines."
"Biotechnology is opening up entirely new possibilities, partly through its speed in creating new species, and partly through making combinations possible which nature herself cannot create."
"At the university I come from, for example, people are working on using genes from fish which are implanted into trees to get the trees to grow faster."
"With these words I would like, apart from thanking the rapporteur for an excellent piece of work, to underline the importance of always putting the principle of caution first."
"Modern biotechnology makes it possible to manipulate nature in ways people could not do in the past."
"In these new areas we must move with great caution."
"Nature can hit back!"
"Madam President, we have received reports about which we can be pleased and Mrs KeppelhoffWiechert has written a report which has a great future, which deals with a very responsible subject and is very ambitious."
"I believe that food technology and in particular biotechnology have enormous influence on the people who sell food, on innkeepers and consumers."
"Mrs Schierhuber has already referred to the fact that we need a good legal framework which makes it possible to produce these products without risk."
"Labelling is a very important topic and I believe there is also a consensus here that marking must take place."
"In principle we must say that there is no such thing as gene-free food."
"In every food we consume there are genes and when today we eat various foods - vegetable, fruit, milk or meat - then these genes come together in our stomach and are digested there."
"We also know that from foods which are made on a purely biological basis many illnesses can occur."
"Dr Flande has shown in his latest book that food allergies can trigger off problems such as migraine, neuro-dermatitis, fungal infections, colds, asthma, chronic tiredness, obesity, itching, swelling, palpitation - all due to perfectly naturally produced foods."
"We must see to it that we find foods with which we have a chance of remaining healthy."
"That is an important task in which agriculture, the food distributors and ultimately the consumers must cooperate in order to be able to remain healthy in their old age."
"Madam President, genetically modified food is on the agenda once again."
"This is about food which is processed not by old-fashioned methods but by changing the inherited basic characteristics of vegetables, for instance."
"The results can be apples which do not turn red and types of corn which do not need so many insecticides."
"Seen in environmental terms, it is essential that there should be research into biotechnology, because this may also allow us to reduce our use of insecticides."
"But there is also some reason to believe that this technology will not solve all our problems."
"There is also some reason to stop and think about whether this technology might at some point not go beyond the limits of what is ethical and correct."
"Are we fully in control of the consequences of what happens if we alter foods so drastically?"
"Labelling of foods containing genetically modified products is therefore essential."
"It is important that consumers themselves should be able to decide whether they want to eat these products."
"Consumers have the right to know what production methods are used, not just for square bananas and blue tomatoes, but also for natural products and the ingredients which go into them."
"I therefore welcome this initiative."
"The report recognizes that genetic engineering is a tool which can have both positive and negative effects, so we need proper legislation in this field to protect consumers against the adverse effects of this new technology."
"Finally, I would like to emphasize once more that it is essential to mark these new products so that consumers themselves can decide what they want to eat."
"Here in the European Parliament, we have passed a proposal that ecological products must not contain any genetically modified organisms."
"This would guarantee consumers products which are produced in a healthy, environmentally friendly manner."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the initiative taken by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to present this excellent report on biotechnology to the European Parliament, and I would particularly like to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert who has laid out so clearly the challenges that this new technology presents to the world of agriculture."
"Despite everything said by its critics, biotechnology is now a reality which we cannot avoid. To surrender to it would mean that Europe would experience an accelerated loss of competitiveness, to the advantage of the great economic powers who have understood very well over the last decade the benefits they can obtain through exploiting the enormous possibilities offered by this new science."
"As the report rightly points out, European agriculture must show itself to be less conservative and must take advantage of this new technology, since its many different applications would allow Europe to face up to the constant impoverishment of its natural resources and the continuous rise in its population's needs."
"Since the beginning of this decade, the Commission has shown that it is clearly in favour of biotechnology through the creation of a regulation framework for genetic engineering."
"The adoption of Directives 90/219 and 90/220 on genetically modified organisms reflects our Institution's constant desire to welcome innovation, while at the same time endeavouring to control it in order to better protect the environment and the population."
"I have noted with much interest that the Commission's attitude towards biotechnology is shared by those responsible for the report, who advocate a style of agricultural production which is open to this new technology, as long as it respects the environment."
"I also share the opinion that considerable efforts should be made to provide consumers with information about genetically modified foodstuffs."
"The reservations still currently felt by many consumers towards genetically modified foodstuffs and agricultural products will only change through objective dialogue and accurate information."
"In my view, the only way to change fixed, negative attitudes regarding genetic engineering is through total transparency on the labelling of transgenic products which then allows the consumer to choose freely."
"In relation to the question raised by Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, I would like to say that I have read very carefully the recommendations put to the Commission and I can already tell her that some of these are about to implemented."
"The Commission will soon submit new proposals for a more adequate regulation on genetic engineering and an improvement in the procedure set out in Directive 90/220 for the authorization of established genetic organisms."
"In addition, with the aim of perfecting the existing regulation, the Commission, probably during this first semester, will submit a proposal concerning the raw materials destined for the animal feed sector that have been genetically modified."
"I can assure you that the Commission will study with extreme care all the recommendations set out in this report, as well as those presented orally here this morning, with specific questions, and it will endeavour to take them into account in its future proposals."
"Madam President, I have no questions but I would like to sum up by saying thank you."
"Time has moved on."
"Most speakers have expressed themselves very positively indeed."
"I hope that this is reflected at 12.00 in the vote."
"I just wanted once more to reply to those who keep saying that it does not help the people in the developing countries."
"Only yesterday afternoon we had a broad discussion here in the chamber in which the scientist Dr Klaus Amann refuted that very argument."
"So, for example, in cooperation with research bodies in Europe and with organizations in the Philippines types of rice are being developed which promise the people there a better future."
"To that extent I must again, being logical, reject it."
"I must also say that for me ecological agriculture and gene technological do not represent a contradiction."
"Thank you very much for all your work!"
"Thank you, Madam Rapporteur."
"The discussion is now closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00 noon."
"Confidence in electronic means of payment"
"The next item is the Report (A4-0028\98) by Mrs Thors on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Monetary Institute and the Economic and Social Committee: ""Boosting customers' confidence in electronic means of payment in the single market' (COM(97)0353-C4-0486\97)."
"Madam President, I am pleased to see that you, Madam President, are a true friend of Finnish jewellery."
"This report is part of a long series of initiatives which the Commission has already taken and will continue to take in order that we shall eventually have a set of rules to apply to the numerous new means and methods of payment which are being rapidly introduced."
"During the suppliers' strike in Brussels we had practical experience of what living in a society free of notes and coins is really like."
"The euro is just around the corner and we have these new means of payment whose limitations not even we are aware of."
"Central banks will no longer regulate the money supply."
"I think it is time for us to prepare ourselves, because the new situation will be very different."
"We need to be prepared with a set of rules, but we should not legislate unnecessarily."
"The communication which we are now discussing and the recommendation which it contains are not particularly dramatic."
"It is a minor modernization of a ten-year-old recommendation which actually has minimum requirements for terms of agreements and legislation in the Member States."
"It will be more exciting this spring, I expect, and we hope that we shall soon have a proposal from the Commission concerning when, where, how and whether we should supervise those who have the right to provide means of payment."
"Although I am a very experienced user of the new means of payment, and although I often make my payments by Internet, it is still unclear to me whether this recommendation is about that."
"We have also noticed that the Economic and Social Committee was very critical of the definitions in the recommendations."
"If recommendations which are supposed to increase consumer confidence are unclear, that is worrying."
"We have no need for unintelligible language in this matter."
"On the other hand, I would like to express my appreciation of the fact that in the recommendation the Commission says that the terms of agreements should be in a clearer language."
"Unfortunately, the recommendation has still not realized that several of the Member States are bilingual, because it refers to the official languages of the Member States."
"Something which I also consider to be important, and which we stress in the report, is that all customers should have access to the terms applicable to the means of payment they are going to use."
"It is far too common to just have framework conditions; the small print is somewhere else, and the consumer is not really shown what the agreement will entail."
"I hope that the Commission will be strict and will monitor how the recommendation works."
"In addition, we know that flaws in this area include the fact that sometimes there is a lack of effective procedures to compensate consumers, that there is a lack of clarity about liability for theft, that the rules on the burden of proof are unclear, i.e. who must prove what, and that the position of customers in bankruptcies can be vague."
"We should also be aware that when new means of payment are introduced, a long time may elapse before consumers become aware of the new problems which can arise."
"Instead of somebody stealing your card, it could happen that someone breaks your code or spies on you when you use it."
"It takes longer before you discover this loss."
"I think this problem requires new consideration by all of us."
"I must also say that a few weeks ago we had an unfortunate example of what happens when there is a lack of clarity about means of payment."
"Here I refer to the payment card VISA Electron."
"It appears that the issuers of this card did not follow the principles in the recommendation, and in particular Article 8.1 b."
"And so to the future timetable. During 1998 the Commission shall monitor what happens."
"I hope that this will be done in a more active way than with the previous recommendation, when a very mechanical study was carried out."
"I hope the Commission will invite consumers and issuers of cards to a round table conference, so that people can go through problems and see how things work in reality, and that the Commission will also be prepared to always have a line always open for feedback from the consumers."
"In that way we shall get a speedier and proper understanding of how the recommendation is working."
"Madam President, I would like to add my voice to that of Mr Martin on behalf of the Socialist Group, in praising the rapporteur for a very thorough and, on the whole, uncontroversial job on a very important subject."
"As has already been pointed out both by the rapporteur herself and by Mr Martin, this is a consumer protection issue, an area in which we should all be concerned to protect the interests of our constituents and citizens."
"There is only one amendment to Mrs Thors' report in the name of my group."
"It was an amendment which I put down in committee."
"Because Mrs Thors, as rapporteur, was unhappy with it - she considered that it did not have much relevance in that particular context - I withdrew it before it was put to the vote, largely because I sit at the front of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and I could not see what was going on behind me."
"I understand that my amendment would have been passed had I put it to the vote."
"I would like to ask, in this instance, that all other groups in the House support that amendment, which is designed to ensure that where a partner to a financial transaction goes bankrupt, the consumer does not suffer any loss as a result."
"I understand, from the rapporteur, that she may well be prepared to leave the decision to the wisdom of the House."
"She is nodding, so I take that to be the case."
"I hope that all the other groups, today, will be able to support the PPE amendment."
"That is all I need to say at this stage on behalf of the PPE."
"We shall support this proposal wholeheartedly."
"Once again, many congratulations to the rapporteur."
"We shall now interrupt the discussion so that the vote can start punctually."
"The discussion on this item of the Agenda will continue this evening at 6.00 p.m."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am pleased to welcome a delegation of seven Members of the Swiss Parliament, headed by Mr Peter Biere, seated in the official gallery."
"The delegation has come to Strasbourg to meet the members of the delegation from the European Parliament on the occasion of the 17th European Parliament-Swiss Parliament interparliamentary meeting."
"Several meetings have taken place, yesterday and today, and topics such as the enlargement of the European Union, the forecasts for European Monetary Union, the bilateral negotiations between the European Union and Switzerland, the prospects of a common foreign and security policy and future relations were discussed amongst others."
"I hope that the discussions have been productive for the delegation and that they have had a pleasant stay in Strasbourg."
"Mr Kerr wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"At the outset of the sitting this morning Mr Alex Smith raised the question of a letter which Mr Coates and I had sent out concerning the vote on the debate today."
"The letter was intended to draw attention to Amendment No 12 tabled by the Green Group, asking him to vote against the war."
"But Mr Smith was offended by the letter, so I withdraw the letter today and apologize to Mr Smith."
"Votes"
"Mr President, according to the correspondence, implementation measures and rules we have received from the Bureau, could you please note my presence in the Chamber."
"Mr President, pursuant to the rules brought in by the Bureau, I wish to put on record that I am present but did not partake in the vote."
"Mr President, could I again have my presence noted in the Chamber?"
"Very well, Mr Falconer."
"(Through successive votes, Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions)"
"Mr President, as regards Amendments Nos 11 and 12, the Commission would like to make the following statement: in terms of the composition of feedingstuffs, the Commission wants to point out that current legislation lays down that all ingredients used must be declared in order of importance, but without any indication of their respective quantities."
"In this respect, the Commission is carrying out a survey in order to see if it is technically possible to include not only the ingredients in their order of importance, but also an indication of their respective quantities."
"Mr President, after this declaration by the Commission we must ask the rapporteur if she still has reservations about the matter."
"For now, both our amendments make sense because they demand that the percentage share must be indicated."
"Hitherto this was disputed by the Commission."
"After this statement it is clear that our amendments are appropriate."
"Mrs Poisson, could you let us know if you accept the amendments?"
"Mr President, I wanted to reply to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"I am not sure that the amendments he is proposing in any way provide more clarification."
"Therefore, I am still sceptical about them."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Poisson."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, in Article 11 the following technical amendment is necessary: a new, correct figure was inserted, but the old figure of ECU 3.3 billion was left in by mistake."
"For the sake of correctness it must now be deleted, since it is the figure of 2.5 billion."
"I also request the insertion, after ""by the year end 1996' of ""in the context of the EFRD' , so that this sentence now reads ""Criticizes emphatically the state of affairs whereby by the year end 1996 in the context of the EFRD, funds still need to be carried through from the period before 1994 amounting to ECU 2.5 billion' , etc. This is not a substantial alteration but a purely technical one."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, can my presence in the Chamber be noted."
"I would simply like to point out that when a Member has shown that he does not want to take part in a vote, but has established that he is in the hemicycle, the Bureau will obviously take this into account for the following roll-call votes."
"Mr President, that was a very important statement."
"According to the interpreter you said that my presence would be recorded at all future roll-call votes."
"That is not correct."
"I participated in the Iraq roll-call votes and in the human rights roll-call votes."
"Hopefully you will note my presence in the Chamber only when I indicate that I wish it to be noted."
"On occasion I may wish to exercise my right to record my vote."
"Very well, Mr Falconer."
"Most of the Members prefer not to have to rise each time."
"It is logical that if they do this is taken into account during the rest of the voting."
"But if you would prefer to rise, then we will take note of this each time it happens and only then."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Those of us concerned with environmental matters know that landfills are an unacceptable method of eliminating waste, especially if we are looking for viable solutions."
"For this reason, this Parliament rejected the common position in 1996."
"The new proposal sets out both clearer and stricter criteria which integrate some new elements into the process of eliminating waste: reduction, pre-treatment, control of methane gas emissions, recycling and recovery, etc."
"This new regulation will provide for the closure of illegal landfills and the improvement of existing ones without necessarily having to resort to incineration."
"It will oblige the Member States to draw up a national strategy aimed at reducing biodegradable waste by 50 % by the year 2005 and to ensure that only pre-treated waste, with the exception of inert material, is deposited in landfills."
"There is no doubt that costs will be incurred in fulfilling these requirements and that a tax will have to be imposed on waste destined for landfills."
"It would have been logical for the Commission, when presenting this Directive, to have included a financial estimate of the costs involved in implementing it."
"However, it is a step in the right direction and will receive my vote."
"We must take note of the long delay before the Commission's re-introduction of its proposal to establish Community laws governing the hygienic burial of waste, granted the importance of the problem for the protection of the environment, the conservation of and respect for the ecosystem, and for the protection of our citizens' health and quality of life."
"However, the Commission's new proposal, after the important changes it underwent thanks to the European Parliament's decisive intervention and to the addition of new elements, is clearly along more positive lines than the initial draft."
"For one thing, there is a smaller number of exceptions in its field of application, and less scope for the deviations that made it substantially ineffectual - if not burdensome - for exactly those regions which are supposedly facing particularly acute problems."
"It is positive that the proposal finally includes the fact that along with the establishment of high standards for hygienic burial, there should clearly be an impetus towards preventing the production of waste, towards alternative waste management methods such as recycling and other ways of recovering materials, and against combustion and other ways of recovering energy which burden the environment."
"This a very important improvement because it establishes the clear priority of recycling and composting as opposed to combustion, pyrolysis or gasification."
"We must, however, draw the Commission's attention to the need to adopt all the measures required to ensure that extensions of the transitional period will be granted for adaptation and modernization of existing landfills so that those extensions will have a constructive effect, and to ensure that there are no delays with adverse results for the environments' viability and people's health, so that all the prerequisites are secured for the best possible organization and support of the programme."
"To achieve such a target, as much account as possible must be taken of local environmental needs, geological and hydrological conditions, and the solutions adopted must be individualized and adapted as much as possible towards achieving the best overall results in each particular area."
"The problem of waste is a result of the lifestyle and throw-away mentality which a majority of the inhabitants of the industrial world have today."
"That is why the issue of waste has become more and more alarming."
"I therefore have great sympathy for the proposals which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has put forward, demanding tough measures, partly to reduce the waste mountain through more recycling, and partly to ensure that what is dumped has a minimal environmental impact."
"However, I am not sure that the question should be decided at the EU level."
"Since the question does not concern environmentally dangerous waste, but just waste, it should still be a question for the national Member States to decide."
"At the same time I am aware, however, that the rules which already exist at EU level are not being complied with to the desired extent which is very regrettable."
"It would therefore be best to have minimum rules in the area of waste, so that individual countries can introduce tougher rules if they so wish."
"I think, of course, that the EU should do all in its power to encourage the Member States to get to grips with this issue."
"The proposal from the Committee on the Environment should without doubt form the basis for implementation at Member State level."
"Through measures which encourage recycling and the minimum creation of waste, the waste mountain can be reduced, which is necessary."
"Naturally, I think the question of environmentally dangerous waste should remain subject to international rules in future."
"We have decided to support the Jackson report, as we believe its basic views are well-considered and sensible."
"But we would like to point out that it contains a serious weakness: in its proposed amendments to the Council Directive (COM(97)105), it does make any provision for Member States to be able to put a brake on the transport of waste across national borders."
"It will still be lawful to treat waste as a commodity which enjoys free movement within the single European market."
"In effect, this prevents parliaments in Member States from passing stricter national rules for handling waste."
"Those who produce the waste will still be able to choose the 'cheapest' solution if their national parliament decides to go further than the EU's minimum rules and send their waste products to an EU Member State which only applies EU rules."
"So, although in formal terms it is a minimum directive, the Directive should in fact be regarded as a maximum directive."
"This report offers constructive proposals for the regulation of the landfill of waste."
"Landfill can be a useful means for the disposal of waste but it must be properly regulated in order to avoid water, soil and air pollution."
"In Northern Ireland we have had recent experience of the problem."
"It was planned to locate a landfill waste disposal sit next to a lough of scientific interest even though it was believed that substance listed under current EU legislation would be discharged into the lough."
"Fortunately the matter went to a public inquiry which ruled against the application."
"However, it did highlight the problem of unsatisfactory regulation."
"Part of the problem appeared to lie in poor implementation of legislation at national level."
"I trust that national governments will do more in future to implement EU legislation in this regard."
"Indeed, I would argue that national governments should be taking the initiative."
"In regard to the disposal of tyres through landfill, there should be an exemption made for large tyres such as tractor tyres."
"These can actually be of some use in landfill and are difficult to dispose of by other environmentally friendly means."
"I must congratulate Mrs Jackson on her report on the European Commission's proposal on the landfill of waste which has just been considered during first reading."
"I would like to remind you that this current proposal for a Directive is actually the European Commission's second attempt."
"In fact, the common position adopted by the Council had been considered much too lax, particularly due to the numerous derogations it provided for, our Chamber rejected the proposal during the second reading, at the part-session in May 1996."
"I am glad that this new proposal incorporates much more precise and rigorous criteria as regards the derogations to the Directive's field of application as well as some new elements, such as the pre-treatment of waste before sending it to landfills, a ban on the joint-disposal of dangerous and non-dangerous waste, etc..."
"These new elements will undoubtably contribute to the application of higher standards in the elimination of waste throughout the European Union."
"The work carried out by the rapporteur in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is nevertheless important."
"Some of the amendments provide necessary clarification, particularly as regards responsibility during and after the exploitation of sites."
"I therefore support this report and sincerely hope that the European Commission will be able to respond favourably to the amendments that Parliament has just adopted."
"Grosch report (A4-0018/98)"
"With the proposal for a directive we are considering, the Commission is trying to establish uniform specifications in respect of safety requirements and the professional competence of cabin crews in civil aviation."
"That issue, however, is only one aspect of the more general problem of air safety. Others include the competence of the flight cabin crew, the technical specifications and maintenance requirements for aircraft, the safety policy and priorities of the air carrier, the rescue equipment available, the work rules and labour policy applied (which neither the proposal nor the report mentions at all), etcetera."
"From that standpoint the EU, with its policy of liberalization and the prevalence of full competition in air transport, combined with the world-wide opening of the markets after the GATT agreement, is in practice undermining the safety of flights, while the headlong race to maximize profits and cut operating expenses in every possible way has a high cost in human lives, as is proved by the worrying increase in the frequency of air accidents."
"A basic prerequisite for safety is to employ permanent flight crews."
"The special nature of their duties must preclude the use of seasonal or part-time crews, which inevitably cannot offer the requisite guarantee of adequate training and experience."
"That, too, is something we are worried about, since we are witnessing procedures in which collective agreements are being broken and flexible labour relations are being imposed, as shown by the recent amendment passed by the Greek Government concerning Public Corporations and Organizations, and the plans to make Olympic Airways 'healthier' ."
"We agree with the establishment of a minimum training level, and consider it necessary that aircrews should undergo periodic training whenever they are to transfer to a different type of aircraft (this training being regarded as working time), to be concluded by appropriate testing for the renewal or award of a new certificate."
"However, the responsibility for the programme and the assessment and awarding of the training certificate must lie with the Civil Aviation Authority in each state."
"We oppose the concession of training in a field of particular public interest to private or other 'approved' bodies, which are difficult to monitor in practice and can easily be drawn into competition."
"Subject to that precondition, the principle of reciprocal 'attestation of professional training' recognition which would guarantee that appropriate training had been given and the necessary requirements had been satisfied, would be a positive factor."
"Owing to the strict health requirements which cabin crews must satisfy, they must undergo special annual medical examinations explicitly defined at EU level, confirmed by the issuing of a medical certificate guaranteeing that they are capable of doing their work."
"In the event of a health problem (defined homogeneously throughout the EU) the crew member must be re-assigned as ground crew."
"No provision has been made for monitoring the implementation of the directive."
"We consider that monitoring should be carried out by a single independent authority to check requirements related to the cabin crews of all air carriers operating in the EU, without exception."
"Infringements should result in sanctions amounting if necessary to the suspension or revocation of the operating licence."
"The same requirements should apply to air carriers of third countries to the extent that they operate flights within the EU."
"Le Rachinel report (A4-0014/98)"
"We have abstained from voting because we are opponents of centrally imposed EU labels and see this as a step in that direction."
"We think the explanatory statement, which refers to a 1998 European Parliament resolution which demanded that the European flag should be on vehicle number plates 'in order to increase the citizens' awareness of Europe' , partly confirms this, and is absurd."
"I am glad that, for once, the European institutions are taking up an idea which comes from the smallest country in the European Community."
"In fact, in 1985, Grand Duke Jean suggested to his Minister for Transport at the time that he design a European registration plate for cars registered in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg."
"In response to this suggestion, two proposals were submitted to the government: one which corresponds to the Commission's proposal and the other which, in the interest of European unity, does not incorporate any distinctive national sign."
"The latter was approved by the Luxembourg government and, after a change in the highway code, introduced as the official plate for Luxembourg cars."
"Since some European countries do not want to abandon a national sign on their registration plates, there should be no problem if the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg accepts the Commission's proposal or if Luxembourg cars also have a registration plate with an L in the middle of 12 stars on a blue background."
"It will then be up to the Commission to find a way to ensure that this European initiative is recognized in the other countries, which still want to keep a distinctive, white, oval sign for the different countries."
"I also believe that, now that European membership is clearly indicated externally, we should get rid of other registration plates such as the green or blue plates that we see from time to time, and why not have registration plates that show we are officials of the European institutions?"
"Poisson report (A4-0020/98)"
"On behalf of the Danish Social Democrats, I have tabled an amendment to the report on foods for special nutritional purposes."
"This amendment, which the committee has adopted, says that these kinds of foods which are given temporarily to meet specific animal requirements must not under any circumstances contain antibiotic growth agents."
"This amendment is an important step towards guaranteeing consumers healthier foods."
"In matters like this, the EU should be out in front in world terms, so that consumers can feel secure about the foods they eat."
"The reports received on the possible implications for health are far too serious to ignore."
"There is a risk that people will become resistant to important drugs if they eat products treated with growth promoting agents."
"It is also a recognizedd fact that if farmers ensure good stall hygiene, using growth agents is totally unnecessary."
"This is an important step in the right direction towards imposing a ban on using antibiotic growth agents in connection with foods for special nutritional purposes."
"Producers should not be able to use such substances as part of temporary additives to animal feed."
"The WTO recommends that all growth promotors should be banned."
"I therefore call on the Commission to support this amendment, and at the same time I demand that the Commission conduct a risk analysis into all antibiotic growth promotors."
"Saying no to the use of antibiotic growth promoters in this context will hopefully open the way for us to obtain a general ban in the EU on using these toxic substances in the long run."
"Berend report (A4-0016/98)"
"Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report although the parts containing the evaluation of the grants appear to be too slight."
"Nevertheless I consider the report to be justified and voted positively."
"The report emphasizes that under-implementation of the Structural Funds is mainly due to incomplete planning and the administrative fragmentation to which they are subject."
"We support the rapporteur in welcoming the concentration, simplification and reduction in the number of forms of intervention proposed by the Commission in Agenda 2000."
"However, this simplification should not lead to a reduction in regional aid to Sweden (also in view of the fact that Sweden is one of the largest net contributors to the EU's budget), particularly to the Objective 6 area."
"On the other hand, we cannot support the content of paragraphs 32 and 38, which involve trying to avoid any repayment to the Member States."
"A reform of structural funds is currently under debate within the framework of a timetable which provides for a new plan from the year 2000."
"It is natural and normal, given the experiences of the 89-94 and 94-99 plans, to reconsider the criteria and conditions of application of these structural funds and I agree with the demands for more transparency, coherence, decentralization and precision."
"I am concerned about the risk of a reform which would in fact be designed to face up to the consequences of the Union's enlargement and the budgetary austerity of the Member States, in helping the new Member States from Eastern Europe, without sufficiently increasing the European budgets."
"Since I represent a region which has benefited from having Objective 1 status since 1994 and Objective 2 status since 1989, I know the importance of such aid. There would be dramatic consequences if this aid were to brutally disappear."
"We certainly need new criteria but only on the condition that they are aimed at improving the new system and not turning it upside down."
"In all cases, if there are modifications for certain areas, then provisional measures will be called for in order to avoid ""cut-off' and threshold effects."
"My final concern is to ensure that the construction of Europe continues to be based on solidarity and harmony."
"The dominant liberal ideology must not destroy our devices on behalf of principles and an ancient law which only represent ""the law of the strongest' and its consequences."
"I welcome the production of the report by Mr Berend."
"Obviously the teething problems that resulted in only 75 % of funds being spent in 1994 have been resolved to the extent that this figure has risen to 95 % in 1996."
"Part of the problem is due to the unnecessary red tape that exists and I welcome the fact that the reform of future structural fund regulations lays great emphasis on reducing this further."
"I also support Mr Berend's view that devolution to the regions will provide further improvement."
"From an Irish point of view, we have always been efficient in spending structural funds."
"The generosity of our EU partners in this regard has played a significant part in the performance of what is now termed the 'Celtic Tiger' economy."
"Although we cannot and should not expect the same level of structural fund aid in the future, it is nonetheless important that there is a reasonable transition period."
"A too abrupt turning off of the 'EU tap' could jeopardize the very successful performance of the Irish economy."
"This report is important because we are on the eve of a new period of structural programming, the period 2000-2006."
"We must make use of it to learn lessons from mistakes made in the past."
"I would like to thank Mr Berend for his meticulous work which provides us with a clear and precise analysis of the problems experienced during the period 1994-1999, as well as a description of the improvements noted."
"These problems are due to many, varied reasons according to the administrative organization of each Member State."
"As regards my country and my region, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, one of the main recipients of Community aid, it must be pointed out that the delays are for the most part caused by France and by the Commission: delays in the presentation of SPDs by the Member State, delays in the co-financing for which the Member State is responsible, delays in the forwarding of appropriations to final recipients, etc."
"However, the Commission is no longer free from all reproach in this process!"
"It is responsible for the numerous regulations and the lack of transparency in the funds as well as for the complexity of the procedures and the difficulty countries experience in responding to the criteria laid down."
"We should learn from these errors and draw up a new regulation which gives priority to the partnership between the Commission and Member State as well as to decentralization, particularly within the Member State, with the participation of all the social, economic and environmental partners in order to make all the players aware of their responsibilities."
"We should take advantage of this occasion to draw up a new regulation with clearly defined rules on cofinancing for which the Member States will be responsible."
"This is what the Berend report is inviting us to do."
"Let us hope that the Council and the Commission are listening!"
"We all appreciate that negotiations are under way at an advanced state with regard to the share-out of the next EU Structural Fund round 2000-2006."
"Some general yardsticks have been put in place by means of the 'Agenda 2000' document launched by the European Commission last year, but extensive fine-tuning remains to be carried out with regards to specific allocations of Structural Funds to each Member State."
"I fully welcome the statement of Regional Affairs Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies when she stated that countries which presently are in receipt of EU Structural Funds will continue to be in receipt of such monies under the next EU Structural Fund round."
"From an Irish perspective, the border county region and the province of Connaught merit to be designated Objective 1 status for the period 2000-2006."
"This will entitle these regions to the maximum amount of European Regional, Social, Agricultural and Fisheries funds."
"The province of Connaught and the border county region are not as wealthy as the east coast of Ireland and should not be put in the same bracket when it comes to the disbursing of EU Structural Funds monies."
"I furthermore would like to welcome comments of Jacques Santer, when he stated that he supports the continuation of the Leader II Rural Development scheme and the INTERREG II cross-border scheme during the period 2000/2006."
"The Leader II scheme is a highly successful programme, worth £100 million to Ireland, at this juncture, in terms of the jobs that it assists in creating in rural Ireland."
"The Interred II Cross-Border programme is similarly an important initiative in terms of the jobs that it creates in border regions."
"The European Commission will shortly table its proposals for the future operation of the structural funds."
"It seems likely that the Commission will propose a reduction of the amount of funding available to some parts of the Union because of the progress made in recent years in generating economic growth and development, notably in Ireland."
"I believe that the Commission must ensure that its proposals for transitional arrangements for countries such as Ireland do not undermine the progress made over the last few years."
"The phasing-out of maximum grant aid should occur over the longest possible period of time with a view to minimising the impact of this reduction on the Irish economy."
"Secondly, despite the fact that the Irish economy as a whole has exceeded the threshold level for Objective I status, many parts of the country are still well below the threshold level and should still qualify for maximum aid rates."
"The different situations which exist in the different parts of the country should be taken on board by the European Commission in formulating its proposals."
"Regions of the country which have still not reached the threshold level in terms of their economic growth should not be penalised because of the strong growth level recorded in other parts of the country."
"The Commission must recognize the importance of appropriate transitional arrangements and the need to differentiate between regions with strong growth levels and those with weak growth levels within individual countries, prior to formulating their proposals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Berend Report on the Structural Funds comes just at the right time."
"Particularly now when we are discussing the continuation and future form of the structural fund the report offers a good basis upon which we can build the future constructively."
"European structural policy must support effectively and efficiently the efforts of the Member States, the Regions and others involved in order to contribute to the reduction of the backlog in the development of the economically weakest areas."
"It is, however, no more than a supplement to local initiatives in the process of necessary innovative structural change."
"This supplementary factor becomes clear in the relevant co-financing of the Member States."
"We know that it is precisely the raising of local resources which inhibits applications for EU resources."
"Nevertheless we must continue to adhere to this criterion in the future."
"For only someone who pays his share of something ascribes any value to the project, and things which we get for nothing are also known to be worth nothing."
"When considering the table of applications for funds we find that in 1996 100 % of the funds for Objective 5b were applied for."
"Objective 5b is one of the objectives which concentrates in particular on rural areas."
"The rural area thus, as I see it, has its special place of value in the Member States, in the regions."
"Therefore we must draw up a specific and comprehensive initiative for the future of the rural areas, in order to promote their positive development."
"That means creating infrastructure and jobs."
"I come from the rural area."
"We educate our children as best we can, send them to schools and universities."
"But we do not only educate them, but we send them away because, with their good education, they cannot find jobs in rural areas."
"Let us leave more decision making authority in the use of funds in the regions and let us give the regional committees more say."
"The people on the spot know where the shoe pinches and how it can be made to fit."
"The report gives a clear picture of how the Structural Funds have been managed."
"It also describes the initial difficulties the Member States had which resulted in an under-implementation of appropriations."
"The proposal to start the next programme planning period in a different way is therefore welcomed."
"What I think is missing, apart from a quantitative analysis of the economic means, is a qualitative analysis of how the money has been used."
"Such an analysis should also investigate any dynamic effects and side-effects in various areas, both negative and positive."
"I have voted in favour of the Berend report because it is a comprehensive analysis of the causes of under-implementation of resources."
"Structural fund actions are the key budgetary tool which Europe has to tackle unemployment, support job creation and underpin the Treaty objective of economic and social cohesion."
"The Socialist Group amendment to paragraph 32 was tabled in order not to give carte blanche to the Commission to penalize or sanction Member States for the non-utilization of resources."
"Our prime objective must be to improve the flow of resources to the final beneficiaries and to support those regions in most need."
"The arbitrary removal of resources without a defined set of criteria potentially undermines our actions in achieving economic and social cohesion and tackling unemployment."
"Reinforcing the Commission's power of sanctions to arbitrarily reallocate resources is not in the spirit of decentralization and subsidiarity."
"Any financial penalties or sanctions with an impact on programmes in regions and local areas therefore needs careful consideration by all partners."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur and the PPE Group chose finally to support the PSE Amendment No 8 in plenary vote."
"This is a well-written report which addresses the urgent need for improvement in the implementation of Structural Fund appropriations."
"Those of us who represent regions where there is a strong Structural Fund dimension to economic and social development have been calling for improvements in the implementation of the entire programme for a long time."
"If funding is to bring real benefit then it must be implemented efficiently and transparently."
"I support the case for decision-making being taken as far as possible in the regions."
"The closer decisions are taken to the people, the more efficient and transparent the programme will be."
"I make the same point in regard to structural funding as I do on most social issues which is that the expertise at national and local level should be used as much as possible."
"My primary concern in regard to the funds is under-utilization."
"By failing to utilize all the available resources, we are failing our regions."
"However, we should note that the Commission has endeavoured to ameliorate this problem with some success."
"The presentation of this report on the implementation of the Structural Funds presents our group with the opportunity to make a brief point on the very future of the Structural Funds."
"In fact, within the framework of Agenda 2000, it is the European Union's duty to welcome in some of the CEECs and Cyprus, which, as I recall, will all be eligible for Objective 1 status, while respecting the inescapable financial framework of the 0.46 % of GDP laid down for Member States of the European Union."
"The proposals drawn up by the Commission in its Agenda 2000 communication are deceptive since they underestimate the economic consequences of enlargement."
"The future of structural policy would therefore seem to be uncertain and will have to undergo significant reform."
"In order to provide the Structural Funds with the efficiency they are lacking, it is essential to simplify the administrative procedures, to stop spreading funds too thinly and concentrate efforts on the only integrated, Community policies, that is, the CAP and the CFP."
"Moreover, there is a fear that the rural regions, although they are affected differently by the effects of the CAP and the CFP, will be the main victims of this bitter pill."
"According to the Commission, the new Objective 2 should only benefit 18 % of the Community population."
"Nowadays, it is the rural regions in the European Union that benefit from having Objective 5a status."
"In future, the percentage of rural regions benefiting from aid will be minimal."
"It is essential to remind ourselves that structural aid to help the rural world was developed in 1992/1993 in order to compensate for the reform of the CAP and to respond to the devastating effects of internationalization and the GATT."
"This is why we are once more calling for the creation of specific secondary objectives within the future Objective 2: one for rural areas and the other for maritime and shore areas."
"The stakes are even higher than those concerningagriculture: we must maintain a model of European economic development which encourages the balanced development of our territory so as to preserve our natural and cultural heritage which is both rich and fragile."
"In his report, Mr Berend presents a detailed analysis of the implementation of Structural Fund appropriations; however, many of his conclusions, as well as certain underlying postulates, cannot receive our support."
"For example, the rapporteur tries to highlight the reasons why some appropriations are not always fully used."
"In reality, there are two obstacles to using all the Structural Fund appropriations."
"The first is due to the administrative constraints imposed by the Commission."
"In fact, the administrative process generally takes between one and two years to allocate the funds."
"Many of those responsible for projects are therefore discouraged by this procedure since it leads to both additional internal, administrative costs as well as financial costs in releasing appropriations."
"The second obstacle, in his opinion, is much more political."
"In fact, to make better use of the funds, the European Commission demands that they be co-financed by Member States and/or local or regional authorities."
"In addition, these Member States are obliged, given the convergence criteria they must fulfill to be part of economic and monetary union (single currency), to bring their budgetary deficit under control."
"Consequently, they prefer not to commit to programmes so that they are not obliged to get involved in co-financing."
"Finally, we must remember that the portion of the European budget which is not spent is returned to the Member States in accordance with their contribution to the budget, thereby leading to some ""pocket receipts' which themselves allow the Member States to somewhat control their budgetary deficit."
"In conclusion, if the Structural Funds are not being distributed to an acceptable level, we should maybe look further than the end of our noses and analyze the real consequences the single currency will have for the decisions made by the Ministers for Finance from the different Member States."
"Joint motion for a resolution on the Kyoto Summit"
"Just a few months after the Kyoto Conference, the first signs of that agreement's inadequacy to deal with the serious environmental problems faced by our planet and mankind are beginning to emerge."
"The desperate cries about the rapidly approaching destructive consequences towards which the economic policies pursued today are leading us with mathematical certainty, echo in the ears of those who will not listen."
"The multinational companies and, more generally, multinational capital do not permit any changes that could cut profits and control the markets."
"Thus, any half-measures decided upon are essentially based on the opportunities created for those enterprises to increase their profits and consolidate their dominance."
"The same factors characterize the effort to commercialize pollution rights, which will further delay measures for the reduction of environmental pollution in the more developed industrial countries and will directly influence the development capabilities of the less developed countries."
"As we approach the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climatic Change, we must not forget that the European Union, with 6 % of the world's population, produces over 14 % of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions."
"The reduction of those emissions by 15 % in the European Union should be regarded as a minimum contribution, which alongside the application of appropriate policies and technology, could result in lower costs."
"Support for programmes promoting the use of renewable energy sources must become a prime objective of the Union and its Member States, as well as appropriate planning of the reduction of emissions in each sector, for example transport, industry, energy, etc."
"The European Union must not take advantage of the options provided by the Kyoto protocol to distance itself from the targets it set itself and must not have anything to do with agreements on the trading of pollution rights."
"The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is now a matter of urgency."
"The more highly industrially developed countries, which are mainly responsible for the phenomenon, must assume the responsibilities that fall to them and not use it to perpetuate their dominant economic position."
"In the context of a different policy for the benefit of mankind, it is now necessary to assist the development of third countries and transfer resources and technology that will enable them to combine their development with their contribution towards reducing pollution."
"Such action must constitute an important factor in the orientation of preparations for the Fourth Conference in Buenos Aires."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the resolution putting pressure on the EU Commission and Council to get them to go furthest and provide a good example at the climate negotiations."
"The EU's original proposals contained a 15 % reduction of greenhouse gases by the year 2010 for three selected greenhouse gases."
"At Kyoto, it was decided to reduce six different gases in our part of the world by 8 % between 2008 and 2012."
"The Danish Social Democrats think this is a good idea, but there are two things which should be emphasised."
"First, it is essential that the EU put pressure on the USA, other OECD countries and Russia to avoid delays in ratifying the Kyoto protocol."
"Second, it is essential that the EU should go furthest: we have the resources to do so, and we have the opportunities."
"There are many areas the EU could get involved in - transport, energy supplies and the like in the EU, but also via the EU's programme of assistance to Eastern Europe, with a view to more energy efficiency and developing cleaner technology."
"Joint motion for a resolution on Iraq"
"Mr President, I cannot in all conscience vote for the resolution we supported here today, primarily because of paragraphs 4 and 5 which I find to be totally offensive and repugnant in the way in which they seek to disguise their intention."
"These weasel words are designed to cover up the legitimization of military force and only compound the shame of launching an attack which, far from achieving any military objective, will result in the death of other human beings already suffering under the yoke of Saddam Hussein and economic sanctions."
"Of course I would insist that Iraq respects the UN resolutions but why are we so selective?"
"What of other nations such as Israel and the United States of America which defy UN resolutions at will?"
"Why do we feel entitled to adopt a moral tone?"
"The possession and threatened use of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction is morally indefensible no matter who is the possessor or who poses the threat."
"After 2000 years of Christianity we still revert to bomb, to maim and to kill."
"Suffer the little children indeed!"
"We cannot support a military intervention against Iraq."
"However, the UN Charter does provide the possibility of using military means as a last resort when peace is threatened."
"However, such a decision must be taken by the UN Security Council."
"Therefore we have voted for Amendment No. 1."
"Like my colleagues, I, too, sincerely hope that a diplomatic solution can be found to resolve the crisis in Iraq."
"I fear, however, that Saddam Hussein's recent attitude has not been moving in this direction."
"The UN experts must be able to carry out their work in accordance with Resolution 687 of the Security Council."
"As long as Saddam Hussein does not accept this, no compromise can be made."
"He must firstly abandon his projects to develop chemical and biological weapons."
"This is a service which must be carried out for the Iraqi people who have been living under economic conditions which are worse than critical, since most of the country's budget is devoted to weapons."
"Only Saddam Hussein can be blamed for the deplorable living conditions they experience and we must not consider them to be a direct repercussion of the international embargo."
"If Saddam Hussein continues with this attitude, there will only be disagreeable solutions involving constraints which will obviously not be totally satisfying."
"I therefore embrace the total support given to the Secretary General of the United Nations for the mission he has undertaken in Iraq."
"However, if military action was attempted, only Saddam Hussein would be morally responsible."
"We are glad that the Secretary General of the United Nations is making a visit to Baghdad tomorrow, a visit which we sincerely hope will be a success for multilateral diplomacy."
"However, irrespective of the outcome of these negotiations, we would not accept any actions against Iraq that are not authorized by the Security Council of the United Nations."
"Any other solution would be harmful both to the principle of international law and, more importantly, the credibility of the arguments that the Western powers employ against Iraq."
"We are still very uncertain about the effectiveness of a military option which should not be envisaged unless all diplomatic instruments have failed."
"We are convinced that unilateral action, and potentially a military response, is neither effective nor justified."
"Unfortunately, in this matter, we can only regret the fact that we lack a real common foreign and security policy."
"Europe is running the risk of continuing to be an economic giant who is only a political dwarf."
"During the first Gulf Crisis, after the invasion of Kuwait, I supported military intervention against Iraq."
"We had a mandate from the UN and enormous international support, including Arab support."
"Europe was active and present."
"We won ""that war' , but we saw its consequences and limits."
"There were many victims in both camps and Saddam Hussein remained in power."
"This is why, today, if we wish to ensure that the UN resolutions are respected, we need to do all in our power to avoid a military adventure which would set the region ablaze."
"We therefore demand a clear mandate from the UN."
"It is still necessary to explore as well all the diplomatic routes and, above all, to avoid a confrontation between the West and the Arab world."
"Until then, we must not follow Mr Clinton's strategy whose domestic origin is much too obvious."
"Europe must assert itself and Tony Blair must move away from his visceral Atlanticism and remember that he holds the Presidency of the Union."
"France must continue to play its own role, which it does very seriously."
"If, in order to achieve peace, we need to know how to make war, then this must only ever come as an extreme and last resort."
"This resolution on the situation in Iraq can only lead us to regret the fact that the European Union lacks a common security and defence policy."
"Every time there is a serious situation, Europe seems to be absent."
"We deplore this fact."
"Thus, as a French socialist, I cannot favour the diplomatic route nor give my entire support to the mission undertaken by the UN's Secretary General."
"We are placing all our hopes in his trip."
"For us, the military option can only come as a last resort, after the failure of all other diplomatic efforts."
"It must only be contemplated on the basis of a formal and written mandate from the United Nations."
"Besides, if military action were chosen, what good would it serve?"
"I doubt that Saddam Hussein would be the victim."
"Seven years ago, the Americans were responsible for a horrible massacre of the Iraqi people on behalf of their President, Mr Bush. It was a slaughter that was presented to public opinion by a unanimous media - and this is a prime example of Anglo-Saxon humour - as a clean, surgical war."
"Today, American arrogance is intact and the Iraqi people, who have already lived through seven years of misery, deprived of medicine, electricity and food, watching their children die from hunger and disease, are about to experience this new tragedy."
"There is absolutely no proof that Iraq represents a military threat, either to its neighbours or the world."
"However, it is essential for Mr William Clinton to make us forget his pitiful macho behaviour when playing the fascist and, a few months before the next presidential elections, to satisfy the demands of the Israeli extreme right and the aggressive Mr Netanyahu."
"It is our duty as Europeans to stop Israel and the United States of America in their murdering madness."
"It is time to provide us with the means to do this."
"The motion for a resolution on the situation in Iraq determines the framework for a positive compromise on the attitude which Europeans should defend within international bodies, in particular the idea that military intervention should not be used to ensure that international law is respected unless all diplomatic options have been explored and exploited."
"However, we should have highlighted better the essential requirement that the only body authorized to decide what action should be taken to settle this conflict is the Security Council of the UN."
"This is why I would have like the amendment aimed at replacing the phrase ""formal deliberation' by the Security Council with formal ""decision' , since it is out of the question that the USA can intervene or decide to act while the Security Council is content to exchange views or to indicate its reservations."
"The European Union show that it is determined to ensure that the UN is recognized as the decision-making body, and refuse the de facto leadership of a single country, in this case the United States of America."
"In this crisis, the European Union should have acted more coherently and we regret that certain heads of state rushed to the side of the American President to support his plan for military intervention."
"Unfortunately, we can clearly see here the terrible and harmful consequences of the lack of institutional progress as regards the CFSP: Europe is powerless on the international stage!"
"Apart from the disastrous human effects military intervention in Iraq would have, we have the right to question the effectiveness of such a decision if the desired aims are actually those stated: the respect of international rules and the refusal to allow Iraq to arm itself with chemical and nuclear weapons."
"It is frightening to think that after such intervention, the Iraqi regime might still be anti-democratic, inspections more difficult and the country might continue to arm itself on its own territory or elsewhere."
"The only people to be punished will be those who had no choice: the country's inhabitants."
"The diplomatic options should therefore be explored with conviction until they are exhausted."
"Finally, the policy of double standards should not be applied within the framework of international law and of the respect for agreements signed."
"Our Parliament and Europe must endeavour to ensure that the peace process in the Middle East continues as expected and, along with the UN, take useful steps in respect of the commitments made."
"We must not be taken in by the allegation that there is an urgent need for a massive counter-attack in Iraq."
"The USA suddenly became more alarmist only after the UN's decision to establish the ""oil for food' process, which would have affected the price of petrol, and when considerations regarding internal policy seemed to push President Clinton towards a spectacular external initiative."
"Europe must, whatever the circumstances, maintain its autonomous assessments and its independence."
"Peace in Iraq, in the Middle East, is the result of sustained, balanced action based solely on the application of law."
"The route chosen by the United States is not the right route."
"Military intervention is not acceptable."
"On behalf of my colleague, Mrs Ewing, and myself, I wish to state that the Scottish National Party condemns the actions of Saddam Hussein in flouting the will of the international community and seeking continually to evade the completion of UN arms inspections."
"Iraq must abide by the terms set up by the UN, and the SNP accepts that the UN has the right to use force in order to secure acceptance as a last resort if all other means fail."
"However, the SNP questions the clarity of the present war aims as enunciated by both the US and British Governments."
"The SNP fully supports UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his mission to Baghdad."
"In addition, the SNP commends proper consideration of the proposals to establish 'no drive' zones to augment the existing 'no fly' zones, and to set up in these areas a provisional administration as the first step to bringing about pluralist and democratic government for the whole of Iraq."
"These proposals would also alleviate the plight of the Kurds and the Marsh Arabs, who have been persecuted over decades by the Ba'athist regime."
"The SNP believes that such proposals would weaken the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, rather than run the risk of strengthening it, and would avoid the civilian casualties which could result, for example, from air strikes against military targets near civilian centres."
"Joint motion for a resolution on the 54th United Nations Assembly"
"It is very disappointing that although the EU will be taking effective action on Nigeria, Burma and the rights of women and children, there will not be a similar initiative on human rights abuses in China."
"It is appalling that there is no consensus within the Council on this issue."
"The obvious reason for this state of affairs is that too many Member States consider that commercial and trading interests should take precedence over human rights concerns."
"How can we speak with moral authority on the issue of human rights elsewhere in the world if we choose to ignore the situation in China?"
"Those Member States which are prostituting themselves for thirty pieces of silver should be ashamed."
"Their lack of action on this issue makes a nonsense of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"We have voted for the resolution in all its parts."
"However, we would like to make some comments."
"Paragraph 1 names a whole list of countries in which breaches of human rights take place, and which the report particularly wants to point out."
"We agree completely that all of these countries should be criticized for these breaches, but at the same time we think that a number of other countries could have been included in this list."
"Cuba, for example, is mentioned in the statement."
"We agree that breaches of human rights happen in Cuba, but in Latin America there are also a number of other countries where these breaches are considerably worse than in Cuba."
"Mexico, Brazil and Peru are examples of states in which defenceless union and farming activists and other civilians have been murdered by various paramilitary groups."
"For this and other reasons, the choice of states on the list is somewhat misleading."
"In paragraph 2 special priority is given to Algeria."
"We agree that this is necessary in view of the serious situation in the country, but some other states could also be mentioned here, such as Colombia, where the state-sponsored terrorism against large parts of the country's population is getting worse."
"Finally, we agree with the statement's severe criticism of the situation in China."
"We think it would be correct to say that no progress has been made in China as far as human rights are concerned."
"Seal report (A4-0015/98)"
"I wish to place on record my support for Amendment No 3 in the name of the GUE/NGL Group."
"This amendment expresses support for the right of Ryanair workers to join a trade union and have that trade union represent them in negotiations with their employers."
"As a strong supporter of the Social Chapter I am disappointed that the body of EU legislation that emanates from it does not enshrine this right and this is something we should remedy as a matter of urgency."
"The downward slope of unrestrained competition and deregulation seems to have no end."
"Even before completion of the third liberalization package, the Commission, within the scope of its 'justification' , is announcing a further hardening of its attitude, provocatively ignoring any social parameters and concepts of public interest and service, and emerging in essence as the official agent of the powerful multinational interests of the air."
"Thousands of redundancies, the overturning of collective agreements in the name of competitiveness, the invocation of the Damoclean sword of company closures, the abolition of routes or concession of flights to private capital, accelerated privatizations, the appearance of companies with doubtful guarantees which call into question the quality of their services, flight safety and labour relations, all these are what makes up the landscape of a liberalized air transport market, even before the attempt concerned has been completed."
"For the Commission, of course, all this does not represent an 'explosive' change."
"It is simply aware of the 'possible consequences' for employment and is 'preparing a study' ."
"As for the celebrated argument that competition leads to price reductions, it acknowledges that this has not happened and denies that wherever the newly arrived competitors have led to a minimal proportional differentiation, this is because costs are being cut as never before, with adverse consequences for the safety of working people who are employed under third-world conditions, and for the quality of the services offered."
"In its statement it ignores the consequences, for airports and those working there, of the directive on the liberalization of handling and of the regulation on the liberalization of cabotage."
"It calls for more rapid privatization and for restructuring in the branch, it demands 'strict' application of the rules of competition, it announces the further restriction of state aid, it directly calls into question the principle of an overall service, speaking about 'excessive use of the obligations to provide a public service' and about the need to examine 'the extent to which those obligations are a hidden means to restrict access to the market' ."
"Needless to say, it does not bother to explain how the demands of management based on the private investment principle are to be reconciled with the increased and specific obligations of national air carriers to provide means of communication, connection and development for remote areas."
"Nor is it worried by its finding that such lines are usually unprofitable and consequently of no interest to anyone acting on the basis of market forces alone."
"The rapporteur fully accepts the EU's entire policy and rationale."
"Indeed, he urges the Commission and the Council to accelerate 'decisively' the furtherance of matters still outstanding, calls for stricter application of the guidelines on state aid and for the rejection of any 'special treatment' for national carriers, asks that the turnovers of 'strong' companies in Europe should be improved - obviously, to the cost of the weaker companies, which risk bankruptcy because of the public interest obligations they have -, and accepts the liberalization of cabotage while admitting that most internal routes are unprofitable operations."
"We cannot accept the contradiction between the complete acceptance of unrestrained competition and simple 'concern' lest that might entail some risk to safety and employment, favouring social dumping."
"We refuse to be content with 'noting' or 'expressing concern' about the retrograde steps which some wish to impose."
"We consider that the interests of the people, the workers, the users of air transport are more important than the interests that are trying to maximize the market share of the powerful groups of air transport companies."
"We will therefore vote against the report."
"The liberalization of air transport has certainly had some good effects on the market."
"However, at the same time, in spite of the fact that it is 'controlled' , it has led to several negative effects, which I think are far too lightly dealt with in this report."
"The rapporteur states clearly that liberalization has led to an increase in size of the whole air transport market and that the forecasts for the coming decade are an annual growth rate of 6-7 per cent (observations J and L respectively)."
"Personally I see this as disturbing, partly because it means an additional burden on the environment because aircraft are not a particularly environmentally friendly means of transport, and partly because the airspace over Europe is already congested. This could lead to a decline in air safety if traffic increases."
"Social issues are not often referred to here or in the Commission's document, which is regrettable."
"It is clear that in certain cases liberalization has led to reduced influence for union bodies and therefore for employees."
"Keppelhoff-Wiechert report (A4-0037/98)"
"We are now aware of the consequences of using genetic engineering in agriculture."
"Using genetically modified plants in open natural systems can have damaging effects which we have no way of assessing today."
"In this report, the rapporteur demands that this practice be supported."
"We cannot support it."
"It has been shown time and time again that using plants which have been made resistant to diseases or toxic to pests has had directly the opposite consequences."
"Using corn which was toxic to insect larvae, for instance, led in fact to those pests becoming resistant to the plants."
"In this case, the advantage of spraying that the pests are only affected for a short period and so cannot become resistant."
"Without wishing to defend this method of pest control in any way, we wish to point out that it has also emerged that using genetic weapons has made the problem of pests harder to deal with."
"This report wishes to encourage research into genetic engineering in agriculture, and says this should be done to encourage people to use it."
"This is by no means unproblematic."
"Apart from the environmental implications and risks which genetic engineering involves, we cannot be sure that genetically modified organisms will not have an adverse effect on human health, even if no such health problems can be shown in connection with such organisms today."
"We know that using genetic engineering can threaten biodiversity and that using it will lead to a monopoly of the crop market."
"We cannot allow the profit motive in agriculture to take precedence over human health and the environment."
"Instead of putting resources into researching methods as uncertain as genetic engineering, we should focus on an area which is largely unresearched: that is, we should put more resources into finding out how Nature's own mechanisms combat pests and plants."
"Agriculture in the next millennium must face up to a two-fold challenge: feeding a world population which will double over the next 30 years while respecting man and the environment."
"In order to maintain its competitiveness, European agriculture, as well as related industries, must be able to benefit from technologies adapted to global competition."
"In the Commission's proposals in Agenda 2000, we clearly see a desire to advance the globalization of European agriculture by lowering administered prices and decreasing the level of aid."
"We need to have a coherent position."
"It is, in fact, the same people who want both to decrease aid to agriculture and delay the development of technological agriculture."
"Personally, I do not believe that the globalization of European agriculture is the right solution."
"However, in this context, where the Commission, along with a certain number of Members of this Parliament, hopes for further advances, I do not see how we could miss out on the development of biotechnology."
"To allow this revolution to pass us by outside European frontiers, while at the same time abolishing Community preferences, would lead to the total destruction of our agriculture."
"As regards legislation, the European Union and the Member States must guarantee both a certain flexibility to allow the development of private and public initiatives and health safety for consumers."
"The principle of precaution must be the main element behind legislation and evaluations must be carried out on a strict, scientific basis."
"I voted against the Keppelhoff-Wiechert report."
"I fear that it is too sanguine about the possibility of controlling biotechnology and about the part biotechnology could play in feeding the world."
"Biotechnology is being promoted by huge, inadequately controlled economic interests."
"The likelihood, at present, is that an expansion of biotechnology will serve those interests, not the environment and not humanity."
"Mr President, we see in the Chamber today that at one point it was a very important matter for the individual concerned to explain to the rest of the House why he was voting in a particular way."
"That right has been removed."
"If you look round you will see that there are only two or three Members present, four including yourself. Is it not a disgrace that the right of Members has been taken away in this manner?"
"The only people who are suffering are the interpreters who stay here loyally to hear one explanation of vote."
"It is a disgrace how the President and the Bureau are handling these matters."
"It is time that you, who was elected to look after Members' rights, start to exercise your authority in the Bureau and give the Members back their rights."
"Otherwise this Chamber will fall into further discredit."
"Very well, Mr Falconer, I will pass on your opinion to the Bureau."
"In addition, they will be noted in the verbatim report of proceedings."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B4-0189/98 by Mr Dell'Alba and others, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the situation in Afghanistan; -B4-0191/98 by Mrs Roth and others, on behalf of the V Group, on Afghanistan; -B4-0211/98 by Mrs Lulling and Mrs Oomen-Ruitjen, on behalf of the PPE Group, on Afghanistan; -B4-0220/98 by Mrs André-Léonard and others, on Afghanistan; -B4-0228/98 by Mr Pasty and others, on behalf of the UPE Group, on Afghanistan; - B4-0233/98 by Mr Sornosa Martínez and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Afghanistan; -B4-0253/98 by Mrs Hoff, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Afghanistan."
"Madam President, Mr Vice President of the Commission, I am very pleased that, every so often, our group is the first to be able to talk about the situation in Afghanistan."
"We have before us the rare tragic pictures of the earthquake that has affected thousands of people and the difficulties encountered by the humanitarian organizations, such as ECHO which is currently in the region to provide aid for the population; we also have before us the dramatic and rare pictures of events under the medieval Taliban regime, equally illustrating the situation of women in particular."
"This debate is also a tribute paid by Parliament to the cause of Afghan women, a cause which the Commission has so admirably sought to resume by launching the campaign, ""a flower for the women of Kabul' ."
"This campaign is probably the most significant gesture that could be made to show that we are not ignoring or accepting as inevitable as inevitable the many evils afflicting this society: racial segregation and, according to some, a sexual apartheid that offend the conscience of both the western and the Islamic world."
"The best way forward is a vote for a resolution that not only firmly condemns the Taliban regime and all its supporters, including trustworthy western powers, but also asks forcefully for support for the Commission and that all possible measures to be taken to overthrow the Taliban regime, contrary to what some organizations are doing, such as the UNDCP, which is trying to reach an agreement with the regime."
"Madam President, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan is using religious arguments to suppress the rights of women; worse still, they try to make it impossible for women to take part in public society."
"Education and health care have become taboo for women, and they are not allowed to show themselves in the street unless they are accompanied by their brother, their husband or their father, let alone voice an opinion in public."
"This is a flagrant violation of human rights, and therefore also of the rights of women, which has become a daily occurrence in the region of Afghanistan where the Taliban rule."
"There is no other country in the world where this type of human rights violation is as acute as in Afghanistan."
"But the Taliban are in fact a bunch of common scoundrels, power-mad men who want complete control of the entire society, and they keep their regime going through international trade in heroin."
"This has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with religion."
"We should realize that women in Afghanistan enjoyed much more freedom in the recent past, and that women from all strata of society are affected."
"How would the international community react if somewhere in this world women were muzzling men the way the Taliban muzzle women in Afghanistan?"
"It is unthinkable that this would meet simply with mild toleration"
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention once more to Article 11, because the Taliban regime is partly kept in the saddle by a number of nations which recognize the country."
"With these countries we, the European Union, maintain political and economic relations without too much difficulty."
"A stop should be put to this."
"Humanitarian aid should continue, in particular now that the effects of the earthquake have become so obvious, but the regime must be isolated."
"Madam President, women - as I am sure you will agree - have been used to all types of discrimination for centuries."
"The imagination that certain men, certain ideologies and certain regimes have developed over thousands of years in order to bully women, individually or collectively, deserves a place in the Book of Records."
"But the way in which they are treated by the odious Taliban regime in Afghanistan, a country which has been ravaged for many years since it was occupied by the Soviet Union, far surpasses the limits of our imagination now at the end of the 20th century."
"Unfortunately, we have few illusions as to the direct consequences of the initiative we launched as the Committee on Women's Rights, in conjunction with the Commission, under the auspices of International Women's Day."
"We want to make use of this day, 8 March, to make public opinion aware of the distress of Afghan women, who are deprived of the most fundamental human rights by the Taliban regime."
"In depriving the Afghan women of their freedom of movement, freedom of expression, access to education and basic health care, the Talibans are turning them into the most deprived, pitiful and unfortunate human beings on the face of the earth. God knows, in this world there are already thousands of other women suffering discrimination, but none to this extent."
"We cannot remain silent in the face of such misery."
"We must denounce this hateful regime and try to find a way of getting humanitarian aid to them, particularly to the Afghan women, without it being regarded as a recognition of the Taliban regime"
"We want them to know that they are not alone in their exceedingly difficult and dangerous opposition."
"Having lived through the monstrosities of the Nazi occupation during the Second World War, I know how much value those who are resisting such a regime place on moral support."
"Let the Afghan women know that we are suffering, that we are struggling with them and that together we will manage to free them from a regime whose leaders are not worthy of being called human beings."
"Madam President, can you imagine a woman not being able to work because it is against the law to earn a living?"
"Imagine you had to tell your daughter that she could no longer go to school."
"Imagine you had to live in a house where the curtains and windows had to remain closed."
"Imagine you had no longer any right to health care."
"Imagine the only use women had was to bear children."
"I would like to address the Afghan women, who are the target of an apartheid regime which is without precedent, and who are today deprived of fundamental human rights."
"While the international community prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, when discussing these women we need to take another look at ourselves and all around us."
"If we want more than just the usual cooperation, then we must manage to highlight the inescapable problem of these women."
"The questions this discrimination raises are at the heart of the debate on the vision of law and the rule of law."
"I would like to express my solidarity with the Afghan women who, despite the oppression they suffer and the unspeakable threats of the Talibans, continually demonstrate against the violation of their fundamental rights and for their right simply to exist."
"Mr President, we have already heard a great deal."
"We know about the situation of women unfortunate enough to have been born in Afghanistan and now living there."
"This debate is taking place a short time before the festival for women."
"In the Committee on Womens' Rights we had decided to adopt an initiative on behalf of the women of Afghanistan. I also think, however, that this movement taking place here is very appropriate."
"Womens' day is approaching; we all know that each year we celebrate women with various events, some meaningful and others not and we say various things which are very often never followed up."
"Of course, anything that awakens public opinion is important and anything that can make us aware of the huge problems that exist is important."
"In that corner of the world, appalling things are going on right now, which we talk about when the occasion arises and then forget until the next time they reappear, while the fate of women in Afghanistan is perhaps the worst fate of oppressed women anywhere in the world."
"The Commission's initiative is very praiseworthy, and the slogan a flower for the women of Kabul is also a very kind and somewhat romantic one."
"Let us ask, however, what our own responsibilities are - I mean in the broadest sense - in the matter."
"Because we often speak about illiberal regimes, we often speak about the fate of people living under such regimes, but seldom do we think that many of those regimes would never have seen the light of day, that much of the misery of people living in those countries would not exist, if the countries of the so-called free and civilized world did not have a share of responsibility for those misfortunes."
"It is an open secret, it has appeared throughout the press, and no theory has been put forward to question the hypothesis that the United States played a very 'good' and specific part in putting the Talibans into power."
"Feminists in the United States have recently tried to block investments in Afghanistan."
"Perhaps the feminists will find a solution, because although we often speak about human rights, we frequently do all we can in the free world to prevent human rights from flourishing."
"Madam President, Afghanistan has become a strategic challenge on the international stage, thanks in particular to its proximity to oil resources in Central Asia."
"This is what explains the tolerance, not to say the complicity, of the United States which, with the support of Pakistan, has allowed the Talibans to take power there."
"In the name of a totally mistaken, obscurantist interpretation of Islam, the Talibans inflict every kind of discrimination on the Afghan women and deny them the right to live normally."
"They do not have the right to participate in civil life, they have no access to education, or to medical care."
"They have no freedom of movement or expression."
"To go out, they are obliged to wear a veil which is like prison bars; their clothes are only shackles."
"It demonstrates an unprecedented hatred."
"This situation is intolerable."
"We must increase our efforts in order to lift the veil of silence."
"I am therefore glad that the International Women's Day on 8 March is being devoted to Afghan women, as a symbol of our solidarity and to raise the awareness of international opinion."
"This Day should not be a last-ditch struggle but the starting point for a campaign to express our support for the Afghan women who struggle for their freedom and their dignity, by applying in their own way the belief of the Algerian poet Jean Senac, that a hunted life invents another life."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please imagine for a brief moment - above all the gentlemen - that you may no longer show your face in public, that boys may no longer take part in lessons at school, that public buses may no longer be used, that you may walk down the street only with your nearest female relatives and that you no longer have any claim on the medical services."
"That is exactly what is happening to Afghanistani women - a horror scenario forced on them by the Taliban Militia ruling in Kabul."
"With fanaticism veiled in religion the women are deprived of their most elementary human rights and the Taliban are not the slightest bit timid in sweeping away all international conventions and humanitarian agreements with unimaginable brutality, financed and supported by the international heroin trade."
"The women of Afghanistan have been robbed of their voice."
"They need our solidarity."
"If they attempt to denounce abroad the violation of their most elementary rights they do so - on pain of death."
"The courageous Roses of Afghanistan, as I would like to call these women, need our solidarity, and the European Parliament, above all the women, supports all organizations, all projects which might improve the situation of women in Afghanistan."
"The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission must combine their forces and use the humanitarian aid just agreed on worth 34 million German marks in particular for the women, who are especially burdened and needy."
"The Taliban have denied foreign aid for women."
"We should not allow that!"
"One emphasis of this year's International Women's Day on 8 March will be to draw attention to the glaring violation of women's rights in Afghanistan and exert international pressure on the government in Kabul."
"The Mullah dictatorship must be ended."
"The sexual apartheid must disappear from the world stage like a passing nightmare!"
"Madam President, ""life under rubble' was the name of a television documentary after the earthquake in Afghanistan."
"Life under the veil - as we have already heard - is the fate of Afghanistan's women."
"Not only is this veil extremely unusual even for Islams, but it is a walking prison; those who wear it can see the outside world only through a double grill."
"They may not go out alone, they may not go to school, they have practically no access to health care."
"This is all because - and I do not like to say this - fanatical men have enslaved their own people, the mothers of their own children, a people who knew about education, whose women practised academic professions."
"They are destroying their own dignity along with the well-being and the education of their own children as free people."
"What on earth is going to become of these children?"
"If on 8 March the International Women's Day really has any meaning, then it is for these women who cannot fight against their repression."
"Flowers for Kabul must mean many voices for the women of Afghanistan."
"We can of course argue about the differences in cultures, but not about a culture which for reasons of gender puts half a nation in prison, simply because the fanatics - the men - see themselves as bearers of their culture, but at the same time earn their money through drugs and weapons."
"What kind of concept of honour is that?"
"Not only all the women of this world but also all the men should rise up against it in the name of the dignity of every human being."
"We appeal to the Commission to see to it that the humanitarian aid for Afghanistan goes directly to the women."
"For human rights, which are also women's rights, as we know, will remain hollow and meaningless if this does not happen and will lose their impact. And, ladies and gentlemen, this is all taking place in the year of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Madam President, the case of Afghanistan leads us to further reflections than those already made."
"Often, when we are dealing with the problems of the developing countries, we unintentionally mistake the perspective. We have passed from a critical over-assessment of the western civilizations and their values to just as critical an acceptance of everything that takes place outside Europe, owing to a misunderstood sense of respect for other cultures."
"The west has values that really belong to the whole of humanity: the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and, in this case, in particular, women's rights."
"We therefore cannot accept the lack of respect for these principles by the current Kabul regime, particularly with regard to respect for women's rights."
"We should not forget that the tolerance and recognition of other people are a common wealth of the three large monotheistic religions and therefore that of Islam too, whose distorted interpretation cannot be adopted to justify any political or other measure contrary to those principles."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union, concerned about the prolonged civil war in Afghanistan, has recently delivered a common position on the ongoing struggle, the continuing instability in the region, the human rights situation in the country as well as the drugs and terrorism which come from Afghanistan."
"As can be seen in the common position, the European Union wants to ensure that there is no sexual discrimination and that the donating of aid takes place in accordance with the needs of the most vulnerable sections of the population."
"Faced with possible discrimination in new or ongoing projects, the Commission will put a hold on these projects."
"As regards the situation of women, the Commission is very much in favour of a coordinated approach with the other donors in order to create sufficient incentive."
"In this respect, the European Commission's position is the following: recently, Angela King, Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations and special adviser on women's issues, visited Afghanistan and her report has just been published."
"The Commission proposes that all positions on this sensitive matter conform to the guidelines set out in this report."
"This does not mean that the Commission is abandoning having its own view on the Afghan problem and, in particular, the problem of the situation of women. However, we believe that, taking into account the situation in the country, and the war, it is much better to concentrate all efforts by using the guidelines that have just been set out by the United Nations as a basis."
"The European Commission warmly welcomes the solidarity maintained by Parliament with respect to the situation of women in Afghanistan, as well as its support for the campaign on the 8 March, ""A flower for the women of Kabul' , which it is organizing to mark International Women's Day."
"As regards the drugs situation, which is a very sensitive topic, heroin and opium are at the moment a major concern for the whole society, since we are certain that in Afghanistan the cultivation of opium is becoming more and more popular, precisely in order to manufacture heroin."
"Nevertheless, we ourselves, along with Parliament, share the doubts concerning the viability of the programme aimed at substituting large-scale cultivations proposed by the UNIDCP (United Nations International Drug Control Programme)."
"This does not mean that the European Commission is against alternative development - we practise it in other parts of the world, such as in the Mediterranean with Morocco, Latin America, Bolivia, Colombia and Peru."
"We agree with alternative developments but we do not believe that, at the moment, the situation in Afghanistan, currently at war, is capable of implementing a programme of alternative development to fight against the cultivation of opium, at least until things change radically in the country."
"As regards the earthquake in Tajar, we are working via ECHO and through emergency operations with the Red Cross and Médecins sans frontières (Belgium), and when there is a bit more breathing space, the Commission will have no problem in moving on to rehabilitation efforts."
"In terms of some of the questions just raised by Members here, the global plan for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan for 1998 comes to ECU 17 million."
"This will be the course of action the Commission will follow and naturally, to answer some of the questions raised, we are aware that the situation in Afghanistan is very difficult."
"Finally, we should not deceive ourselves: what is happening in Afghanistan, as in other conflicts, comes in response to a new form of geopolitics, a series of interests linked to drugs, terrorism and discrimination, which are converging."
"You know exactly what I am saying: the Cold War in that part of the world has been replaced by a war of interests."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0184/98 by Mr Bertinotti and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Cermis tragedy; -B4-0187/98 by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the Cermis tragedy; -B4-0209/98 by Mr Bianco and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the Cermis accident; -B4-0210/98 by Mr Azzolini and Mr Santini, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the accident in Italy caused by an American military plane; -B4-0221/98 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the Cavalese catastrophe; -B4-0243/98 by Mrs Aglietta and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the Cermis tragedy; -B4-0250/98 by Mr Colajanni and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the death of 20 people caused by an American plane in Cavalese (Italy)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, what happened on Mount Cermis was a tragedy that has been widely reported."
"It has been reported by the repeated accusations made by the local authorities which, on several occasions, had presented the danger of the aviation games that started from the Aviano base and, through the Trentino valleys, tested the bravery of the pilots from the US base who tried to fly under bridges, under electricity cables and under cableway cables."
"A tragedy had to happen sooner or later, and now it has done."
"We are faced with a basic problem, which is that of the meaning of the bases of a foreign power in the territory of an EU Member State."
"In my opinion, this needs to be discussed."
"There is, however, an immediate problem: we need to prevent, immediately, a repetition of low-altitude military flights and revise the regulations governing military flights, which I believe should be carried out in specific and fairly restricted areas, and at least in uninhabited regions."
"There is one further point I would like to bring to the Commissioner's attention, a point on which the Commission ought to have an opinion, if not an initiative."
"I believe it is necessary to ensure that the United States waive jurisdiction on the proceedings over the tragedy and allow the proceedings to be heard in Italy as soon as possible."
"I would like to remind you that the victims of this tragedy belong to six European countries, five of which are part of the European Community."
"I think it would be too much if, after such a tragedy, responsibilities were not even identified, not for revenge or punishment, but to ensure that such tragedies do not recur in the future."
"Madam President, I would like to tell Mr Pettinari that, just a few minutes ago, I heard from a news agency that this morning the Italian judiciary formally asked for the file, in a certain sense asking the Americans for release from the London Convention."
"If that were the case, it would be my intention, at 17: 30, on agreement with the other authors of the resolution, to submit an oral amendment to note this important fact."
"On the same lines as the previous speaker, I would like to say, and I don't know how much the Commission can help us in this, that provisions which in 1951, in the midst of a cold war, could be justified (with a kind of extraterritoriality, a bit like that enjoyed by the Church in the Middle Ages and in other times) now seem obsolete and constitute an offence to the victims and to the judiciary who have every possibility of investigating and doing justice where it is very often a case of acrobatics in the air rather than real military requirements."
"Madam President, it has already been said but I wish to confirm that, on 3 February, twenty innocent citizens of German, Belgian, Italian, Polish, Austrian and Dutch nationality in an Italian tourist spot, Cavalese, enjoying a few days' rest and leisure, lost their lives owing to an accident caused during a military exercise from a US air base in Aviano, which cut the cables of the Mount Cermis cableway and caused the tragedy."
"The draft resolution presented seeks not only to express due sympathy to the relatives of the victims, but also to bring to the attention of the European Parliament questions ranging from the establishment of the causes, the truth, to respect for the international regulations governing training for civilian and military flights."
"In confirming what has been stressed several times by the local Trentino-Alto Adige authorities on the dangers of military flights in low-altitude exercises over territory in the Trentino and Alto Adige valleys, and therefore on the need to suspend them, the draft resolution asks the US civilian and military authorities to cooperate fully in the investigation aimed at establishing causes and responsibilities, with the transparent use of all sources of information and evidence."
"A further agreement on safety procedure is requested between the US and Member States of the EU involved in the NATO, with a total prohibition of low-altitude military flights in regions at great risk of safety to the civilian populations."
"Madam President, when a tragedy happens in which many individuals lose their lives, the International Community is dumbfounded, upset and often takes measures to provide aid."
"When the tragedy is absurd, like the Cermis tragedy, the first reaction is one of anger and disbelief."
"There is no reason justifying what happened on 3 February in Cavalese, in Trentino-Alto Adige, where, unfortunately, there was a further demonstration of the terrible consequences of men's stupidity when it is applied to powerful means, built for our defence, but capable of being transformed into means of destruction, if used incorrectly."
"In Cavalese, a US military aircraft, probably involved in a crazy game played by its occupants, flew at a foolish speed several metres from the ground, in a region used for sports tourism, and, in so doing, cut the cables of a cableway, causing the cabin and its unfortunate occupants to crash to the ground."
"I do not wish to accuse the Atlantic Alliance forces, whose historic merit should be recognized for defending the free world when the planet was divided into blocks and for continuing to defend it today."
"However, we cannot tolerate absurd and tragic accidents, such as that on Cermis, caused in the best of cases by atrocious thoughtlessness, and in the worst by malicious stupidity."
"For this reason, the Union for Europe group supports the compromise resolution brought to the attention of Parliament today and hopes that, if it is approved, it will be followed by specific measures resulting in its implementation."
"Madam President, an incident like the tragedy on Mount Cermis should be firmly condemned."
"No political consideration can be higher than the protection of human life which any political action and therefore any armed forces have the specific task of serving."
"That is why the US authorities should cooperate with every means and as far as possible with the Italian authorities for clarity to be established."
"I have to point out that this requirement is reinforced even further by the status of a great power enjoyed by the USA; real power is not, in fact, measured in military but above in all in moral terms; the US first have to prove this morality, of which they have so often been the champions!"
"Madam President, I think that, as pointed out by previous speakers, everyone is aware that non-observance of the rules laid down and agreed for military aviation exercises has led to a serious tragedy."
"This tragedy also highlights other aspects, such as the fact that, although the South Tyrol and Trentino authorities have often reported aircraft flying over inhabited regions at very low altitude, at the limits of suicide and homicide, as we have finally unfortunately witnessed, these flights have continued unperturbed for a very long time."
"What is puzzling is that, despite the fact that exercises of this type have been reported as dangerous for a long time, no solution has been found."
"The solutions are for training to be provided in areas suitably chosen for that purpose, areas in which there is no danger to people or property, that are defined as safe aerodromes."
"But nothing of the kind has been done."
"It is therefore obvious that, to safeguard the physical safety of people and property, strict regulations need to be established at European level, or the States need to be asked to do so, with regard to the use of aircraft in exercises."
"This accident also shows another aspect, which is the problem of the limited sovereignty of the European countries with NATO or American bases."
"In fact, not only do these bases not fall under the jurisdiction of the host countries, but any offences committed by the American personnel at these bases lie outside the jurisdictional scope of the country in which they have been committed and fall into the sphere of competence of the American judges."
"We therefore urge a revision of Article 7 of the London Convention governing jurisdictional competence."
"Madam President, the tragedy of the Cermis cableway has firstly affected the families of the victims and their grief will certainly not find solace in our words."
"We obviously hope that we can at least give them a message of respect for their grief."
"The tragedy has affected Trentino and Alto Adige, provinces in which military exercises had given rise to protests that had unfortunately remained unheeded for some time."
"Citizens, mayors, advisers and even MPs had unfortunately pointed out the risks in vain."
"We certainly all know that the bulk of these exercises were connected with the peace mission in Bosnia, in which in recent years our involvement also extended to the pilots and soldiers ensuring the success of the mission."
"The protests were rightly made, however, in view of the excessive risks taken; new regulations on exercises were therefore necessary and urgent."
"Those who turned a deaf ear at first are guilty of pride and vanity at least, attitudes that do not go with respect for the life of the citizens, of all the inhabitants of Bosnia, the aircraft pilots, the inhabitants and tourists in the valleys of Trentino and Alto Adige."
"Madam President, the tragedy has affected the population of my province, Bologna, in particular, because, seven years ago, a damaged military aircraft, abandoned by the pilot, fell on a school, causing the death of 12 children and a further 60 wounded."
"It was on 6 December 1990, Mrs Fontaine."
"You will not remember, but they were in Israel together."
"We had just been visiting the Yad Vashem Museum, when the ambassador for my country 'phoned me with the news."
"Just a few days before the tragedy on Cermis, the three people accused of the disaster in Bologna were finally acquitted, the judges believing that the event did not constitute a crime."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is embarrassing to have to meet the parents who lost their children only guilty of being at school, and tell them that justice has been done."
"The proposals contained in the resolution we are going to approve, as a group, have this object: to avoid a repetition of the proceedings that ended with the words: no-one is guilty!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that the European Parliament is taking a position in response to the accident in Cavalese, because not only should there be stricter rules, but it appears from an investigation which has progressed a little further today that the existing rules have not been complied with."
"The crew may say it feels sympathy for the relatives of the victims, and it may declare, I quote, that they would never do anything to endanger the lives of others, but it has been proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that the aeroplane did not respect the primary rules."
"It was flying at barely 150 meters where the permitted minimum flying height is 300 meters, or according to Italian standards, as much as 600 meters."
"Moreover, witnesses have stated that they saw the aeroplane involved in a kind of joy riding , and for years the local population has been complaining bitterly about the genuine nuisance of these flights."
"It also turned out the pilot was flying with American ordnance survey maps which do not even show the ski lift, instead of using Italian ordnance survey maps which do show it."
"Talk of arrogance."
"From all of this, ladies and gentlemen, we can only draw the following conclusions."
"From now on the American authorities must cooperate with the Italian judiciary, in an atmosphere of great openness, otherwise the investigation cannot move forward."
"Low level military exercise flights must be forbidden where there is a danger to civilians."
"Stricter rules coupled with enforcement must be introduced, and stricter rules for all air force units, anywhere in Europe."
"To conclude, the local Italian judiciary should be authorized in this case to set up complete investigations, and moreover to administer the necessary justice."
"It would be even more dramatic if we were not to draw the necessary conclusions from what happened."
"Madam President, I wish to express profound grief on the part of the Alleanza Nazionale for the victims of the Cermis tragedy and accuse the sharks and the intellectuals of making an outward show of antimilitarism, jumping at every opportunity to flaunt their sentiments and their sermons against the armed forces which, if they are not reformed and if they do not continue to operate as they are doing in Italy, we too are convinced will be useless and out of time."
"We wonder, however, how the Trentino and Alto Adige valleys can have become a exhibition theatre for the supersonic military aircraft flying at very low altitude, without our authorities intervening, with the authorization of the Ministry of Defence, despite the protests of the populations and the local authorities."
"We are certainly asking the American authorities to cooperate with the Italian judiciary to establish responsibility and penalize non-observance of the safety regulations that would otherwise have averted the tragedy."
"We believe it is necessary for the work of Council to give greater authority to the governments of the member countries, to ensure observance of the rules laid down by the regulations in force so that military exercises do not jeopardize the daily lives of the citizens."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in a very difficult position because, naturally, the European Commission shares the sorrow felt by the Members for the victims and understands the irrationality of the accident, which should never be repeated."
"However, as you know, the Commission has no authority in this matter to implement many of the measures you ask for in your resolution."
"Nevertheless, to the best of our ability, we will forward them to the two parties concerned - the American government and the Italian government - with the aim of ensuring that, at the very least, they pay fair compensation to the victims. In addition, of course, as regards the use of the Aviano base, which is a NATO base and thus outside the Community's authority, we will try to ensure that they review all plans for flights at low altitude."
"Having said this, we believe that the best solution is for the Italian courts to establish the facts, to decide who is responsible for the events and to determine what type of action will need to be taken in the future."
"Madam President, I support the statement of the British Council Presidency that the fatwa against Salman Rushdie is null and void because it is a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and it is illegal because it is an attempy to interfere in national sovereignty."
"I would add on behalf of my group I request the suspension of the critical dialogue with Iran."
"A dialogue presupposes a common basis of the parties talking to each other."
"Between those who are convinced of the tradition of human rights and bound by a religious tradition, one of the core precepts of which is ""Thou shalt not kill!' , and those who call for the murder of writers or seek to force a prisoner to accept a religion with death threats, there can be no dialogue, only an unconditional condemnation."
"Madam President, time again criminal justice in Iran is arouses our aversion."
"We as Europeans have, rightly, I think, have respect for Islam and Muslim culture, but political Islam as it reaches us from Iran, damages the reputation of Muslim culture, an damages in my view the respectable position of Muslims within the European Union."
"For that reason I would like to say that I fully understand people getting annoyed with people who overstep the limits of courtesy, or who insult someone's religion on purpose, but the punishment which is administered from government beats everything."
"We are thinking of Salman Rushdie, of course, it was said earlier, who even abroad is heavily persecuted."
"This literally oversteps all limits."
"The punishment imposed on Helmut Hofer, who oversteps the limits of courtesy in Iran, is of course out of all proportion."
"The punishment of a publisher who publishes matters which are not agreeable to the government, is another example of something of which it can be said that a country which has signed the United Nations Charter cannot inflict punishment of this kind."
"I am also thinking the 99 strokes of the cane for the lady who was involved in the incident with Helmut Hofer."
"It is truly out of all proportion for a civilized nation to do something like this."
"The fact that Iran is nonetheless open to criticism and to an urgent call to turn from its ways, is demonstrated by the release of editor Faraj Sarkouhi."
"I think that from within this Parliament we need to make an urgent and civilized plea to the Iranian government to turn from the path that we consider damaging to Muslim culture and Europe's reputation."
"Madam President, the election of Dr. Khatami as president showed great promise in principle."
"At least he spoke out about the need for reform and democratization."
"But if you have nothing, it is difficult to measure the degree of such reform or democratization."
"He was given encouragement by the Union to put his ideas into practice, and not for nothing."
"The actions of the Iranian regime appear to be heading in a different direction at the moment."
"The official reaffirmation of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, as Mr Oostlander said quite rightly, and the subsequent proposals to raise the price on his head, incredible as it sounds, are clear indications of this."
"Vigilance is called for and the internal political events will have to be followed carefully."
"The Union must naturally turn itself forcefully against the human rights violations in Iran, this we already know, and this will act as support for the country's reform minded forces."
"International attention must also be paid to the individual cases as mentioned in the resolution, so that this may save the lives of citizens."
"Madam President, the editor of Iran News , a German national, an Iranian woman, and a writer all have the death threat hanging over them in a country with a centuries old civilization in which religious dictatorship lays down the law."
"A few thoughts on this, Madam President."
"The editor of Iran News did not receive a public trial."
"How can one threaten someone, coincidentally a European citizen, with execution because he fell in love with a woman?"
"During its final phase, the previous government in Iran declared that it would not carry out his execution."
"For a long time attempts were made to propagate this as a positive step during the 'so-called' critical dialogue which never amounted to anything."
"But now it has been very clearly stated that the fatwa against Rushdie is irrevocable, and there are even reports that the price on his head has been raised."
"If you are familiar with the fact, Mr President, that the current President Khatami was the Minister of Culture nine years ago and the fatwa against Rushdie came under his responsibility, then one has to seriously question the call this same Khatami now makes as President for dialogue and relaxation in the sphere of culture."
"When, moreover, official government officials compare the Rushdie affair with pronouncements made by Roger Garaudy, who denies the genocide of six million Jews, then we may conclude that we are a long way off from any relaxation with and within the Iranian regime."
"All these horrific events are taking place in a country which offers enormous economic potential."
"Apart from the d'Amato Law, absolutely apart from this, which badly frustrates and hampers the EU, apart from this law, one may ask oneself if one should invest in such a dictatorship."
"We are told that the government's story is for internal use, and that it has another story for external use."
"But what is the true face of Iran?"
"With so much oil in the back garden, the production of long-range rockets, the export of terrorism, and religious terrorism, well, Mr President, this true face of Iran, I feel very uneasy about this."
"If Iran does have good intentions, and if the positive signal of the release of the editor really does mean something, then the concrete step-by-step dialogue will start, and today's resolution in which we ask for these people not to be executed, might be a good example of this."
"Madam President, Commissioner, for the umpteenth time we have to deal with serious cases of violation of human rights in Iran."
"We were all under the illusion that the new course of Khatami would have made it unnecessary, but that was an illusion!"
"Reality is dramatically different."
"Only in recent months have tens of death sentences by stoning been pronounced in Iran."
"Stoning is not just a death sentence, but something more, a barbarous and unacceptable method for any civilian society."
"One of these sentences by stoning was pronounced against a girl who was still breathing an hour after being stoned and died later in hospital."
"As recalled, Morteza Firouzi, the editor of Iran News, has recently been sentenced to death."
"The citizen Helmut Hofer has also been given a first-degree death sentence."
"Another barbarity is that of the 99 lashes inflicted on the young woman accused of having sexual relations with the German citizen."
"Finally, the death sentence against Rushdie has been confirmed and the reward for killing him has been increased!"
"I think that these incidents show that the Iranian regime cannot offer any guarantee today, not so much with regard to democracy but over the minimum values of human civility."
"I think that Council and the Commission should exert all possible pressure, at all levels, to guarantee at least a minimum level of civility."
"Commissioner Marín, do you not think that the critical dialogue the Commission rightly undertook should at least be subject to this minimum level of civility and should now be reviewed?"
"Madam President, my colleagues from the various groups have reiterated the concern we all have."
"Far from having improved, we all have the impression that the human rights situation in Iran is getting worse and that, despite the countries of the European Union holding out their hand, the Iranian regime is answering with provocations with respect to the two European citizens that have been mentioned."
"In fact, in the case of Mr Rushdie, they are even threatening to increase the reward for whoever kills him on behalf of the Iranian regime."
"Individual cases have been mentioned here, but we do not how many other cases and situations we are unaware of, due to the situation in the country where the regime does not permit the basic rules of democracy and transparency."
"We should devote our solidarity and concern to them. I also support the points which have been made here."
"It seems to me that, rather than improving, the human rights situation has deteriorated; the Community institutions must therefore reflect seriously and set out the reasons why they believe that this is the case."
"I get the impression, Commissioner and Madam President-in-office of the Council, that the situation has deteriorated, and I believe that reflection on our political relations, whether it be called critical dialogue or something else, must also be reviewed."
"I would like to mention a point made by Mrs van Bladel, because I believe that mixing human rights and economic interests or economic relations is tremendously cynical. We here in the Parliament are left with the impression that this reflection - that the situation has not improved - should lead to a more critical reflection on the policy favoured by the Council and the Commission."
"Mr President, the election last year of Dr Mohamed Khatami as President of Iran was expected in a number of quarters to herald a substantial improvement in the state's attitude on human rights issues."
"Sadly, these expectations have not been fulfilled and it is becoming increasingly clear that the influence of the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and of the most fanatical sections of the revolutionary guards is continuing to shape the regime's policies on human rights and that the new president is apparently in complete accord with this."
"This is demonstrated most clearly in the reaffirmation of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie and the death sentence by stoning on the German businessman, Helmut Hofer, which has already been referred to by many Members in this House."
"In the last six months, there have apparently been seven official executions in which individuals convicted by an Iranian court have been stoned to death."
"In the last 12 months, some 200 executions are estimated to have taken place in all, 9 in public in the last week alone."
"At the same time, there has been no let-up in policies which have led to other violations of human and women's rights by the regime and the case of Morteza Firouzi is referred to in our resolution today."
"The conclusion must therefore be that there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in the Iranian Republic."
"In some respects the situation is actually getting worse."
"In these circumstances, it is important that Parliament reiterates its appeal to the Council and to European Union Member States to maintain and increase the pressure on the Iranian regime on human rights issues."
"This has been called for from every quarter of this House and I hope that the Commission will in fact respond positively to our appeal today."
"Mr President, what is really serious about what is happening in Iran, with the repeated attacks on human rights, is that it is taking place in the name of Islam and in reference to the Koran."
"In this way people are given a false impression."
"Respect for this great world religion is undermined, not only among Europeans and Americans, but throughout the world."
"Obviously it is Parliament's business to protest against what is happening in Iran, and not only there, but also in Algeria and other places."
"But it is even more important that the Muslims who feel the same as we do, i.e. that this cannot be right and that it must be changed, now have the courage to speak out and to unite with us in a clear repudiation of attacks on human rights in the Muslim world wherever they may take place."
"Mauritania"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the different groups that supported the European Radical Alliance's initiative concerning Mauritania and I would like to give you some details about the resolution."
"The Mauritanian authorities were disturbed at the fact that our text, according to them, exposed the practice of slavery in Mauritania."
"Our text does nothing of the sort."
"It condemns slavery in general and points out, on the contrary, that, according to the Mauritanian government, slavery no longer exists in their country."
"We hope that these declarations correspond to the reality of the situation, and we note that, in all cases, neither the Mauritanian authorities nor foreign observers have been in agreement on this point."
"Moreover, if slavery has disappeared, why do they refuse to accept the legal existence and right of expression of organizations trying to ensure that slavery is effectively and definitively abolished?"
"The aim of our resolution was precisely to defend this right of expression and, in the case of legal proceedings, to ensure that everyone receives a fair trial."
"It is clear in this matter that the Mauritanian public authorities, in pursuing people who had expressed their opinions on a French television programme, wanted and obtained the justice that it denied political opponents and supporters of human rights. This is shown perfectly through the type of accusations they made, that is, the membership of unauthorized organizations and the propagation of false news abroad for shameful political ends."
"You can see right through it."
"I believe that our Parliament must firmly reiterate through its vote that all signatory countries to the Lomé Convention must submit to the democratic rules that form the basis of our partnership. It should also point out that the Mauritanian government would stand to gain if it abandoned the legal proceedings it had begun and the sentences it had imposed, and that all forms of slavery in all countries should be universally eradicated."
"It is now up to the Mauritanian authorities to demonstrate, through a liberal attitude, the truthfulness of their statements on this last point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 12 February four Mauritanian people were convicted."
"People who are all active in human rights organizations, or in an organization called SOS Esclavage."
"But the strange thing is, and I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to this, that these two organizations are recognized and have observer status with the African Commission on Human Rights, and with the nations belonging to the Organization of African Unity."
"If they are given recognition on this level, it must mean that these organizations mean something."
"The only thing I wish to draw attention to in this debate is the severity, the weight of the punishment which was pronounced, compared to the facts."
"Because only one out of the four people made declarations during the broadcast in question."
"The others did not even do so."
"Yet they have been sentenced to thirteen months unconditional imprisonment and extremely high fines."
"This does arouse suspicion."
"I believe the Mauritanian authorities when they say that they have legally abolished slavery, but then they should be interested in cooperating with all those who also want to see the last remote corners of this practice removed."
"Commissioner, it is already quite some time that here in Parliament we talked about Mauritania, and I am afraid that this is because this country is spiritually so far away from us and also unfortunately because we have to some extent expelled it from our minds."
"I am fully convinced that we, as Europeans, bear much of the responsibility for the present situation in Mauritania."
"Of course, what is condemned only in cases of emergency must be condemned absolutely."
"But we should consider what we can do better."
"If we look at the situation and consider that in the 1960s Mauritania - on a very low basis - was still a relatively wellfunctioning nomadic state and really only the great famine and our utterly wrongly applied development aid led to the situation there which we now see, namely that all the nomadic inhabitants have gathered around Nouakchoff, the capital, just waiting for the aeroplanes which came with aid, which has led to the situation that they no longer in any way lead their normal lives with their normal social structure, this should really give us food for thought and we should consider how we can manage things better in future."
"The fact is, - and that has been appropriately documented on television - that there still exist horrors such as slavery."
"But we must also consider and say that the international community of states is really called upon to do everything in its power - and this applies not just to Mauritania, but also to other states where slavery still exists - to bring this situation to an end."
"The old slave route still of course operates in Africa unfortunately."
"There are of course other states - I am thinking for example of Mali - which have a similar situation, with which we must all be concerned, but then please in cooperation with the Arab League."
"For we cannot do it alone, we must work along with our partners on the spot in the appropriate manner."
"If a country like Mauritania wants to meet its obligations, keep the Lome-Agreement and accept appropriate standards, then it must also take full heed of certain standards which we set."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the shocking images on television have revealed that slavery does exist in Mauritania."
"This is contrary to the official statements which say that slavery was abolished in 1981."
"The government's response leaves no doubt."
"Instead of tackling abuse the messengers were detained."
"The present reaction from the Union is right."
"You are aware that Mauritania belongs to the Lomé Convention, so human rights ought to be respected and slavery naturally banned."
"The arrest of anti-slavery activists must be rectified immediately."
"The Commissioner knows what I am talking about."
"He has often witnessed this in ACP situations."
"During the next session of the ACP Assembly, Mauritania will have to have its obligations with respect to the Lomé Convention clearly spelled out."
"Quick changes are needed, and I obviously call on the Council, but also the Commission, to follow the developments in Mauritania closely, and to come up with proposals if the problems in Mauritania turn out to be structural."
"I hope as they do that this is not the case."
"Mr President, like other African countries, Mauritania is in the process of institutional reform."
"Compared with several years ago, several significant steps have certainly been taken, although they are anything but perfect, on electoral matters and on the organization of the institutional and political system."
"Our resolution, however, rightly seeks to point out and denounce a series of events and situations, that have been echoed in the international press in recent weeks, that risk jeopardizing this process and that highlight several disturbing aspects."
"Firstly, we should note that, despite being abolished by law, the practice of slavery still exists, at least in certain parts of the country."
"What we are asking is that, in addition to the existing legal regulations, the Mauritanian authorities should firmly undertake to eliminate any situation of unacceptable limitation and degradation of the dignity and individual rights involved in slavery."
"For this purpose, the role that can be played by the associations and organizations of civilian society is very important, both in denouncing existing situations and in providing specific, moral support for past and present victims of slavery."
"From this point of view, the position of the Mauritanian authorities therefore seemed surprising and unacceptable to us, for they have begun a campaign of repression against the exponents of associations committed to the defence of human rights."
"What the militants of these associations are accused of (those who have been arrested and, in some cases, sentenced to long prison sentences) solely comprise expressions of opinion as an offence."
"The fact that activities carried out for humanitarian purposes is considered a prosecutable offence casts a fatal shadow on the nature of the process of institutional reform and on the wishes of the Mauritanian authorities."
"We well know that Mauritanian society is based on a delicate ethnic balance between the various members of the population."
"It is precisely for this reason that we are urging the application of the basic principles of any democratic regulations, including freedom of association, abolition of expressions of opinion as an offence and, naturally, the total abolition of any remains of slavery."
"The first gesture we are asking of the Mauritanian authorities is the immediate and unconditional release of the exponents of the humanitarian organizations imprisoned and the end of all proceedings brought against them."
"Chile"
"Mr President, it is with much regret that the whole world has heard the news that in March the Chilean dictator, Pinochet, will be able to become a senator for life."
"As also stated in the resolution of the Partito Popolare, it is true that a basic constitution still exists in Chile whereby all former Presidents of the Republic, democratically elected, become senators for life; it is amazing, however, that this political group here present has nothing to say, either on the fact that Pinochet may be considered a former President democratically elected, or on the torture he has practised."
"At the moment, Pinochet is accused of genocide, not just in his own country, but also in an EU country, Spain, as genocide has been committed against the populations of Spanish origin, as maintained by a Spanish court."
"For these reasons, we cannot accept logic of this kind and we believe it necessary to help the Chilean population and the Chilean MPs opposed to this initiative."
"In particular, we believe it necessary to amend the Chilean Constitution, not as an act of interference but as political support for those suffering the consequences of a criminal dictatorship."
"Mr President, we are all aware of the complicated transition process experienced by Chile, that the progression from an awful dictatorship to democracy has not exactly been easy and that it caused many scars which still remain."
"I would like to point out two of them: some of the sections of the current constitution, and the fact that General Pinochet has been active as head of the Armed Forces and is trying to continue in the same way as a senator for life."
"Pinochet is today the clearest example of the impunity in Latin America, and I would say in the world."
"Can you imagine, Mr von Habsburg, having to sit alongside Mr Karadzic in this House for the rest of your life?"
"I think that many legitimate, Chilean representatives feel disgusted, not only at a personal but also at a political level, at the possibility they face."
"A large section of Chilean civil society is opposed to this situation."
"This includes the Christian Democrats, whose political judgment in this matter is support by socialists and supporters of other tendencies."
"There is also the application from the Communist Party to have Pinochet brought to trial for genocide."
"We do not want interference from here, but we do want to help the democrats in Chile to complete their transition period and to put Pinochet in his place, because human rights are inviolable, indivisible and have no boundaries."
"How, for example, could this House not help the family of Carmelo Soria, who is calling for the two murderers who are free, despite it being known that they carried out that terrible crime against an international official of Spanish origin, to be brought to justice?"
"How can we not come out in solidarity with Judge García Castellón's initiatives, which are trying to find justice for so many murder victims and missing persons, who also came from my country?"
"In the European Union, there are unfortunately still some people - for example, Attorney General Cardenal or the prosecutor for the National Criminal Court, Mr Fungairiño - who do not understand that in Chile there was a dictatorship and that those responsible for it are still active."
"In effect, this is not interference; rather, we are supporting the democrats, and I hope that everyone here in this House understands, precisely because credibility is becoming easier to win every day and in every case."
"Mr President, it is obvious that this is a democratic Parliament which makes democracy the focus and objective of its actions and which has always displayed enormous interest in and concern for the evolution of countries which have come out of a dictatorship, and particularly in Chile."
"We have showed such interest in Chile that during the time of the dictatorship and over the following years we have been able to have a budget heading devoted exclusively to Chile's transition to democracy."
"In addition, at the same time, we gave our support and approval to the process of democratization, and we can today gladly state that Chile is a democratic country."
"I am totally against those who argue that this type of intervention is interference in external affairs of another country."
"I believe that in the global village the world has become, we all have the right and the obligation to give our own opinion, particularly when there is a case of interference in human rights."
"Through this resolution we are showing our support for the Chilean government, the political parties, the institutions and the citizens in general who are looking for justice."
"We know how difficult it has been for them on many occasions and how they have had to overcome many obstacles."
"However, we believe that it is illogical and incomprehensible, as well as the fact that it presents a bad image of the country to the outside world, that the greatest representative of the dictatorship and of the attack on the government and on the people be appointed a senator for life without a vote, particularly when there are clear judicial grounds against it, as laid out here."
"Whatever the result of the vote may be, and I hope it will be positive, it will not upset the relations between the European Parliament and the people and democratic government of Chile."
"I believe, as stated here, that it is a direct action against impunity, and the best way to prevent future dictatorships."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has a strong record of condemning violations in Chile under the former military dictatorship of General Pinochet and of welcoming the return to civilian rule and the genuine progress which is being achieved in the observance of human rights in that country."
"This is why we cannot allow the appointment of Pinochet to Chile's Senate, due on the 11 of next month, and subject to protest by all the main political parties in Chile, to pass without international protest from ourselves."
"We do not forget the 3, 000 people killed at the hands of the military despots."
"We know that today there are still 542 outstanding cases of disappearances, of which no evidence is known."
"We were watching, when just last September, political activist Gladys Marin was jailed for five weeks, simply for speaking of Pinochet's human rights violations."
"So why, when this House voted to debate this question yesterday, did the Christian Democrats vote against?"
"It was only by the narrow margin of 206 votes to 200 that we were able to hold this debate at all."
"It cannot be, as Mr von Habsburg says, because this is regarded in Chile as international interference, when the main political parties and civil society have communicated to us in advance that they are supporting the terms of this resolution."
"It cannot be because this would be injurious to the process of national reconciliation in Chile."
"What could do more damage to that than the continued public office of a man with one of the bloodiest records in Latin America's bloody history?"
"And it cannot be out of some misinformed support for constitutional principles in Chile, which Pinochet is seeking to exploit, because critics have long known how the military wrote the rules of transition precisely to protect Pinochet from being removed as chief and to allow him to serve now as a non-elected senator."
"Europe understands only too well how the tools of democracy can be seized by dictators to undermine democracy itself."
"We should condemn Pinochet with a single and united voice, and I hope the Conservatives and Christian Democrats will examine their consciences before they decide to do otherwise."
"Mr President, when you ask the man in the street in the Netherlands who is the president of Chile, you will get a deafening silence."
"When they say, well, is it not Pinochet?"
"Yes, that rings a bell , because it links in with what we experienced, or at least Chileans experienced as one the darkest periods in their otherwise illustrious and democratic history."
"That is why we show solidarity with the actions, the amazement and the protest against the appointment of presidents or senators for life."
"It is a good thing we do not have this in the Netherlands."
"So be it, because we are very modest, as you know."
"To get to the point, I do not think it right that the Chilean people, the Chilean government, which has been on the right path to democracy for years now, award this honour to this man who was the model, the negative model of the terrors of the time."
"Belarus"
"Mr President, the resolution before us is long overdue."
"It was discussed for a long time and is a compromise.."
"Many suggestions and alterations from various groups in the House were incorporated into it before it was submitted."
"Therefore I do not claim that it is a green resolution but I believe that it is a resolution of this House."
"The news about arbitrary arrests and deprivation of freedom, about repression of the free press - for example the film maker Saschewatzki was attacked in his apartment because he showed a critical film on German television - requires a response from the European Parliament."
"We have been exposed for a long time now to the questions; why is the European Parliament silent when faced with the fact that there is practically a war against the media in Belarus?"
"Is it perhaps that we do not care about the fate of people?"
"Is there maybe a creeping acceptance of Lukaschenko's policies?"
"I hope that with this resolution we give a clear answer."
"Lukaschenko has long recognizedd the isolation into which he has driven his country and its people, and he is very interested in international recognition."
"But he is not prepared to make concessions in the direction of democratisation."
"Therefore any demand for international human rights is a precondition of recognition."
"I hope that we do not betray the trust of the Belarus people and that the resolution receives the broad agreement of this House."
"Mr President. Thank you, Mrs Schroedter."
"Of course I must say that you have pointed out that we have worked it out together."
"You are right."
"We have discussed it, of course we have not at this precise moment spoken about this resolution."
"But we do not want to debate it now, that is not important."
"It is certainly important to mention that the European Parliament is not silent."
"The European Parliament has several times pronounced on Belarus."
"Moreover it has always been you who, with others, have pointed out very emphatically that we must do something, and we are naturally very grateful to you for this."
"Allow me to refer briefly to a few points."
"The European Parliament is not silent and something is being done in Belarus."
"Not driven by the government, that is true, but we are pleased to note that there is once more an opposition which is re-forming, which is finding its feet and which clearly has the chance, with the aid of the international community, with the aid of the European Union actually to become a political force."
"We confirm that we have succeeded in equipping the OSCE mission, that the government has made concessions and that is a step towards a positive future and we want and ought to do everything together with the Commission to ensure survival and hope that we quickly achieve positive results."
"We confirm that hopefully - the Commission will perhaps be able to say something about this - we have re-established the TACIS Democracy Programme."
"Mrs Schroedter has rightly referred in her resolution to the fact that we must extend it to the exchange of young students who can come to us to gain experience."
"The programme which we have now is too narrow but we are grateful that we have been able to set it up."
"Something is being done, and we must do everything possible to show Lukaschenko again that democratically stable and healthy circumstances must be created so that the integration of Belarus into the European context can finally succeed."
"The European Parliament has moreover always said: ""The door is open and it will remain open' , but of course on condition that general, universal human rights are recognizedd, and I hope that we in the European Parliament can continue to speak positively in favour of this."
"Mr President, I too would like at this point to thank Mrs Schroedter for her efforts on behalf of White Russia."
"I believe that, simply because it is one of the last major dictatorships on European soil, it is necessary to give appropriate signals and to say that we in the European Parliament do not want such a regime in our immediate neighbourhood."
"I would however also like to thank Mrs Mann and say: Something has undoubtedly been done in White Russia, something has changed for the better."
"Organisations today can become active, albeit on a restricted basis, which was not all that long ago really not the case, and we should admit that here in this Parliament."
"Of course it is clear that these steps do not go far enough."
"I believe we must also cast a glance at the conditions under which Belarus exists at the moment."
"The fact is that the relationship of dependency on Russia is a very close one, that the cooperation between Belarus and Russia is very, very close."
"I once permitted myself at question time - if I remember rightly it was two months ago - to ask the responsible Council Representative the question, whether there might be a possibility during the next negotiations with the Russian government to insist that Russia makes its influence on Mr Lukaschenko tell, to improve these circumstances."
"This was accepted at the time very positively."
"I would also be very grateful if Commissioner Marin would take this idea further and say: we cannot apply the lever in White Russia."
"We must undoubtedly apply it in Russia in order to achieve a better result there."
"Nevertheless the resolution is necessary and it is important that we state our case."
"But we must also be quite clear that as soon as something really changes for the better we must also honour it appropriately."
"Congo"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when Mobutu's dictatorial regime fell in May 1997, the international community expected and hoped that in an era of pacification and democratisation would finally dawn in the Congo (formerly Zaire)."
"However, almost a year on, it appears that a very different situation has emerged."
"As stated yesterday in Geneva by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kabila has done no better than his predecessor Mobutu."
"A number of facts bear out this statement, in particular, frequent public executions by firing-squad following summary trials by military tribunals, as occurred recently in a number of cities including Goma, Kizangani or Kinshasa, the banning of all political activities and of all parties (the Minister for the Interior has stated that they will be severely castigated), beatings and all forms of corporal punishment, obstruction of the United Nations mission responsible for investigating the massacre of Hutu refugees in which Kabila's's troops participated, with the result that last December the mission was obliged to leave the country at a moment's notice, imprisonment and deportation of prominent members of the political opposition."
"A few days ago, the opposition leader Tshisekedi was imprisoned and removed to an unknown destination, as reported by a number of news agencies, prompting fears for his personal safety and offering further unequivocal proof of the new government's intentions."
"It appears that this climate of violence is spawning an internal guerrilla movement which could spread to other central African countries such as Rwanda, Burundi or Uganda, causing a renewed upsurge of refugee movement."
"In addition, the long and painful peace and democratisation process in Angola could suffer further set-backs on account of instability in neighbouring Congo, thereby jeopardizing the stability of the region as a whole."
"For these reasons, the draft resolution submitted by this Group urges the Council and Member States to make every effort to guide the Congo back to the road of democratisation, and the Commission to review the terms and conditions of EU aid."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I had hoped that in this European Parliament I would never have to speak again about what we call the Republic of Congo, the country which until recently had been called Zaire for a long time."
"The change of regime and Mobutu's disappearance offered an excellent opportunity for this potentially rich country to finally be governed intelligently, honestly and ably."
"What was required was of course trustworthy, reliable, and able people to help govern the country."
"What needs to be done is not difficult to describe."
"It is clear that attention must first be paid to public health, food supplies, to agriculture in other words, to transport which is in a state of chaos, improvements in education, if economic development is to be achieved."
"In addition to political issues, the rule of law, human rights and reconciliation with the population."
"This presupposes people working together to achieve this peace, this cooperation."
"Under the Mobutu regime cooperation existed between the able opposition people."
"They called the association within which they cooperated l'Union sacrée : the holy union."
"The holy union produced remarkable texts; a draft constitution, a plan for a transitional regime and so no. If these had been followed up, another regime could have assumed power without bloodshed."
"But Mobutu never understood this, and now, to our disillusionment, we note that Mr Kabila has not really understood this either, and that he is not taking up the opportunities to work together with positive opposition powers of former times."
"Mr Tshisekedi has expressed his willingness to cooperate, but Kabila has rejected this."
"Worse still, Tshisekedi's offer is not only being rejected, but he was arrested, as well a few young leaders and they are now - the terrible phrase crops up again - political prisoners."
"Well, this Parliament must not let something like this slip passed, and must point out in all its relations that we defend the development, but also human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in this big African country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Congo Democratic Republic, which had given rise to so many hopes at the time it was established, is profoundly disappointing and disregarding the legitimate expectations of the International Community."
"The brutal arrest and unlawful internment of Etienne Fishekedi, in Kinshasa on 12 February are just the latest episode in a deliberate design of the authorities of that country to destroy any real opposition."
"The restoration of the rule of law and the real commencement of a process of genuine democratization are the minimum conditions for maintaining EU aid."
"The European Union, but also all the Member States, should send the Kinshasa government a firm reminder before it is too late for the Congo Democratic Republic as well, as has often happened in the past."
"Just over ten years ago Tshisekedi was imprisoned on a number of occasions."
"He was also banned to the interior, to his place of origin."
"These are scenarios which repeat themselves."
"I must say that I am not surprised that we are witnessing a repeat scenario, because the way in which Kabila came to power had little or nothing to do with a real uprising form within, but more with several countries surrounding the former Zaire wanting to settle something."
"So we are having a situation which starts off with someone with weapons coming to power, who promises elections at some point in the far future, but in the meantime forbids political activities, creates problems with regard to free media and deals with political opponents in a completely impossible way."
"I think what matters now is that measures and actions are taken, that we not only take note of what is happening, but try to gain influence, for example through the pressure which can be applied by the European Union and the Member States."
"Mr President, I would like to clarify some of the various points on human rights put forward by the different speakers."
"As regards Iran, the Commission is extremely concerned about the violations of human rights, which are clearly documented in the reports by Mr Garretón, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in Iran."
"The Commission would be prepared to urge the Iranian government to permit the special rapporteur to enter the country as soon as possible, in order to allow him to draw up a report on the human rights situation in Iran."
"As the Union has reiterated many times, the Commission still deeply regrets the existence of the fatwa against the British author, Salman Rushdie, which has already been in place for nine years."
"I can confirm that this situation is contrary to international law and puts not only Mr Rushdie in danger, but also the people connected to him."
"The Commission is seriously concerned about the recent measures taken by the Iranian authorities against a German citizen, Mr Helmut Hofer, and a publisher of an Iranian newspaper, Mr Mortesa Firuzi, who have been unjustifiably sentenced to death for crimes allegedly committed in Iran."
"The Commission has already made its opinion known, and is counting on the Iranian authorities to ensure that these cases are reconsidered."
"We welcome the recent liberation of Mr Faraj Sahouhi and we hope that his case will set a precedent for more liberal individual human rights policies on the part of the Iranian government."
"The Commission also warmly welcomed the decision by the Council of General Subjects on 26 January to reconsider European Union relations with Iran under the current circumstances, and this question - relations with Iran - will in fact be one of the main points at the meeting of the Council of General Subjects next Monday."
"As regards Mauritania, the Commission has, through the usual channels, followed with great concern the arrest and sentencing of Mauritanians who were demonstrating in favour of human rights, and it has informed the Mauritanian ambassador in Brussels of our concerns and also that we want to be kept informed about the situation."
"In general, cooperation between Mauritania and the European Commission has been aimed at consolidating democracy and the rule of law, as well as respect for human rights and fundamental liberties, and we must recognize that, at least in the case of Mauritania, very positive efforts have been made in recent years with respect to the country's situation and a significant process of democratization has been started."
"Naturally, in terms of the laws and the constitution, we all know that slavery is forbidden, but we must realize that traditional practices still survive - as reported - where, in certain regions, although not actually slavery, similar types of work relations are still practised."
"We can therefore state that we are making the necessary political gestures to reveal this situation to the Mauritanian authorities, in order to resolve it through the normal diplomatic channels."
"Having said this, however, the Commission, as you know, is financing a whole range of activities aimed precisely at promoting the rule of law by way of the Mauritanian Indicative Programme."
"As regards Chile, as most of the Members have pointed out, the process of democratization is - or has been - one of this Parliament's concerns and I believe that it was Mr Pons Grau who noted that it is one of the rare budget headings in the Community budget where there has been constant financial support for political parties, trade unions and civic organizations during recent years in the country."
"Nevertheless, the Commission must admit that it is a complex process, and consequently it is inevitable that it will involve contradictions which may seem difficult to understand from a European standpoint. Objectively speaking, we all know that there was a dictatorship - who would deny that? - but in the case of Chile, the country is undergoing an internal process which must be understood in all its complexity, and by this, I am in no way excusing the crimes or abuse which took place under the dictatorship."
"In fact, you know that the Chilean government has already made it known that it will not accept this resolution."
"It is a matter which must obviously be considered with much subtlety and delicacy."
"But I am here to represent the institutional position of the Commission."
"I have my own opinion on the matter."
"And, in the same way as if don Otto were here, I would have no problem saying - because he used to point out that he was older than General Pinochet - ""long live Mr don Otto' , but I would not dare to say ""long live the other younger veteran' ."
"I would never say that."
"As regards Belarus, the violations of human rights of individuals or groups opposed to the Belorussian regime are unfortunately true."
"However, European Union relations with Belarus depend on two delicate matters. I admit, as one speaker pointed out, that an element concerning working in Belarus is that it also means operating in cooperation with Russia."
"But I also have to take into consideration the Commission's institutional position."
"The two delicate matters are: firstly, the creation of an OSCE inspection and advisory group in Minsk, in the field, which is planned, in principle, for the end of February, and the execution of its mandate; and secondly, the possible adoption by the Belorussian authorities of the TACIS programme for the development of civil society, expected, in principle, in March."
"If Belarus - either the government or the President - cooperates constructively with the OSCE and accepts the European Union's programme, we will reevaluate our relations with them, since we are allowed to do this under the Council's resolutions."
"Therefore, these two conditions are going to be set out in February and March."
"If, on the contrary, instead of receiving a positive response, we received a negative one in this respect - if there was no group set up in Minsk, if obstacles were put in the way of the development of the programme to support civil society -, the European Union would consequently apply the Council's decision and we would have to declare that it was not possible to work with the Belarus government."
"For that reason, you will have an answer regarding the OSCE in Minsk after February, and regarding the negotiations with the government after March, and the Commission will present its evaluation to the Council and Parliament in April."
"As regards the Democratic Republic of Congo, I must point out that we all need to show - particularly given the concern of a veteran of the Lomé Convention such as Mr Tindemans for the country- that we thought that, with the fall of Mobutu, things were going to change. Arbitrary arrests are taking place and certain leaders of the Congolese opposition are moving outside the city."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed"
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p. m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following draft resolutions:"
"B4-0185/98 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on sub-critical nuclear testing; -B4-0195/98 by Mr McKenna and Mr Schroedter, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on sub-critical nuclear testing; -B4-0237/98 by Mr Manisco and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on sub-critical nuclear testing; -B4-0245/98 by Mrs Theorin, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"Mr President, I am pleased that what we started in the Subcommittee on Security and Disarmament, a treatment of the so-called sub-critical testing, has a follow-up, a sequel in an urgent debate."
"It is vital that the European Union makes efforts to convince America to abandon these nuclear tests."
"These sub-critical tests - I will briefly explain, they are tests to see whether one's nuclear material is still in good condition - are not contrary to the letter nuclear test ban treaty, the CTBT, but they do violate its spirit very seriously."
"This treaty will only enter into force with difficulty, because it requires the ratification of countries such as India and Pakistan."
"And it is these countries which use their resistance against the American tests to not ratify the CTBT."
"These developments might mean the entire house of cards of international disarmament might collapse."
"The nuclear nonproliferation treaty is linked to the CTBT and will therefore be under great pressure."
"The opportunities offered by the end of the cold war to get rid of large categories of weapons of mass destruction, are thus lost."
"It is very unpleasant and very peculiar that this is the result of American actions at the same time that this big America is coming down so strongly on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, and rightly, by the way."
"The Member States of the Union are wrongly keeping very quiet."
"Instead, the EU Member States should lodge a protest with the United States, and invite them to end these tests."
"Moreover, the Union should make a joint effort to get other countries to ratify the CTBT Treaty."
"European efforts are needed to save this treaty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, classical case for the EU to prove that it is serious about a common foreign and security policy, for the comprehensive banning of these tests has been signed by all EU Member States."
"Thus the Member States assume the responsibility for ensuring genuine adherence to this treaty."
"The danger that it will be surreptitiously undermined - Mr Bertens has already said this, - is very great if the USA continues to test and, above all, confidence in this treaty will be greatly undermined."
"It must therefore be made clear: this treaty is valid and it must not be secretly destroyed by the USA's tests, for there is no international verification system by which it can be determined whether or not the test is subcritical."
"Atomic weapons are weapons of mass destruction and the USA is demonstrating to us right now the methods it would use against weapons of mass destruction."
"I am in any case of the opinion that it is absurd to use military methods and I prefer a diplomatic solution."
"The EU must in this case prove its qualifications in the diplomatic sphere."
"I hope that it now puts massive support behind making the agreement work."
"I believe Mr Marin owes us an answer about exactly how this is going to happen."
"Mr President, after many years of negotiations and strong opposition both from nuclear powers and threshold states, it was finally decided to have a comprehensive ban on all nuclear weapons testing."
"In September 1996 the treaty was opened for signature and all the countries of the EU have signed up to this treaty."
"The intention of a comprehensive test ban treaty was to stop further development of nuclear weapons."
"After the end of the Cold War this was an obvious thing, even if France, against strong world opinion, first reserved the right to carry out a series of nuclear weapons tests to improve its nuclear weapons."
"Many citizens were not convinced of the goodwill of the nuclear powers and warned that development of new nuclear weapons could take place through laboratory testing."
"In the treaty the signatories commit themselves to refrain from any action which would defeat its object and purpose ."
"Unfortunately, we are now forced to note that the USA has carried out a series of subcritical nuclear tests and intends to carry out four more before September this year."
"Some of the world's leading nuclear weapon scientists have strongly questioned whether these tests are indeed subcritical , not least because they are taking place underground and are not verified."
"The argument that these tests have to be carried out in order to be sure about the safety and reliability of existing nuclear weapons stocks fails on its own absurdity."
"It is true that tritium slowly deteriorates after many years, but not in such a way that there is no longer any risk that nuclear weapons will explode and cause the devastation for which they are intended."
"Many countries and a large number of members of the American Congress have expressed their concern over these tests."
"The crux of the matter, however, is that these tests and new nuclear weapons development seriously jeopardize the international test ban treaty."
"Even if, contrary to expectations, they did not contravene the letter of the test ban treaty, it is clear that they contravene the spirit of the treaty."
"This is one of our most important international treaties, and it is unacceptable for the USA to seriously undermine the treaty through these tests."
"Our resolution therefore demands consequently that the American government should stop these tests, that it should state in an official declaration that these tests are not part of a new weapons development programme and that the development of new nuclear weapons is not part of the USA's policy."
"Mr President, the position of the Group of the European People's Party's on the other resolutions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is well known."
"This is the first resolution to be presented on the topic of nuclear weapon testing and sub-critical testing."
"We have submitted no motion for a resolution, we are not going to table any amendments and, in fact, the Group of the European People's Party intends to vote against all of these resolutions."
"It plans to do this for one reason only and that is because we believe that it is not the right time to submit them."
"At the moment, there is a serious situation in the Gulf, and we are talking about a weapon whose main strength is deterrence. Taking into consideration the fact that the only thing which can change the situation in the Gulf is dissuasion, we believe that it is the worst possible time to talk about such things."
"That is why the Group of the European People's Party is going to vote against all the resolutions."
"Moreover, it would be better if we gave it some time and the United States Senate ratified the CTBT Treaty."
"Mr President, I can immediately follow on from what the previous speaker has said and I also share his estimate relating to the choice of time and agree with him that it is not necessarily a matter which requires great urgency."
"I also have doubts whether the authors of these resolutions have really taken the trouble to find out exactly what subcritical tests are, for they are tests in which no chain reactions ensue, in which no radioactive substances are released above the tolerance limits."
"Here the question arises why the reasons given by the USA cannot be accepted, namely that this amongst other things serves to check the safety of existing stocks."
"Each of us would prefer if we could do without all these things, but since we have people in the world like Saddam Hussein and the like we cannot in my opinion afford as it were to divest ourselves completely of all our defence capabilities whilst Saddam Hussein for his part has no thoughts of following a good example which under certain circumstances could be given here."
"Nowhere have I read that one of the countries which even today still produces weapons of mass destruction including anti-personnel mines would consider supporting the test ban treaties and destroying its own weapons of mass destruction if these subcritical tests were now halted."
"Again I ask for this proof to be offered."
"It might perhaps be appropriate to explain to Günther that the reason for our criticism is precisely that it has not been possible to check that these tests really are subcritical."
"We base this on information from the world's leading nuclear weapons scientists."
"That is what we are demanding, i.e. that these tests should be stopped until it can be proven that they are subcritical."
"There is every reason in the world to question these tests. The Americans still have nuclear weapons."
"All the nuclear powers still have nuclear weapons. But we should not develop new nuclear weapons."
"Mr President, the Commission supports the work carried out by the European Union and participates in it in order to convince third countries which have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty."
"In this respect, within the Union, all the Member States have begun national procedures to quickly ratify the Treaty."
"The entry into force of this Treaty will undoubtedly lead to a crucial stage of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation at international level."
"And any element which obstructs this ratification or any delay which might take place in any of the ratifications, as Mr Fabra Vallés pointed out, would cause great concern."
"That is the Commission's view on this matter."
"We want a rapid and unanimous ratification of the Treaty."
"Mr President, I had asked the Commissioner to tell us in concrete terms what the Commission plans."
"Will the Commission make a proposal to the ""Foreign Affairs' council, about how this test ban , on the assumption that everyone is ready to ratify it, even on w worldwide basis, can be implemented really effectively by everybody?"
"Is there in this respect a concrete proposal, is there a plan?"
"And when will the Commission present this to the Council?"
"Madam speaker, I am as in favour of the suspension of nuclear testing as I can be, but the fact is that it is very difficult for the Commission to make a proposal since, as you all know, it has no authority to do so."
"This is why I did not respond; if I could do it, I would, but, as you know, we have no authority in this matter."
"Thank you, Commissioner, Marín."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following draft resolutions:"
"Floods in Greece -B4-0216/98 by Mr Trakatellis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the disastrous floods that have occurred recently in various parts of northern Greece and in the Greek islands of the Aegean Sea; -B4-0226/98 by Mr Daskalaki and Mr Kaklamanis, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on the floods in northern Greece and in the Greek islands of the Aegean Sea; -B4-0238/98 by Mr Alavanos, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the disaster caused by floods in Greece; -B4-0251/98 by Mr Avgerinos and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the floods in northern Greece and the Aegean islands."
"Storm in Malaga -B4-0257/98 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Hernández Mollar, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on storms in the province of Malaga."
"Floods in Greece"
"Mr President, on 2 and 5 February catastrophic floods of unprecedented severity afflicted many parts of Eastern Macedonia, Thrace, and some islands in the East and North Aegean."
"They caused the death of 4 people and injured many others, resulted in great damage to buildings, vehicles, crops and to the infrastructure of the areas, such as roads and bridges."
"With this motion we are calling for an expression of solidarity and expressing our deepest sympathy for the families of the victims and the dwellers in those areas who have suffered."
"We are also asking the European Commission and the Council of the European Union to contribute towards the effort to make good the damage, with urgent economic aid."
"I think the natural disasters which unfortunately take place every year in various parts of the European Union provide us all with an opportunity, and the European Union's bodies as well, to demonstrate our presence at the side of our citizens who sustain such damage and trials as those brought about by the recent disastrous floods in Greece."
"Mr President, as a subject, natural disasters repeatedly come up in the European Parliament and every time that a Member State or even a third country is afflicted by weather conditions, fire, earthquake or whatever else, there is a lot of debating."
"This time it is parts of Greece which have been hit, and it is natural for us to ask the Commission and the European Parliament to express solidarity with those affected, and therein lies the problem. Because each time, we decide unanimously that those affected must be helped - and the Commission too agrees about this aid - and we ask that the often enormous damage caused should be made good, each time we in here vote for all that unanimously, but the aid often remains confined to words alone because thereafter the matter passes into the hands of the governments involved, of course, and then grinds to a halt."
"So besides adopting specific resolutions - and there are clearly no objections to that, which is why we are debating it here -, perhaps we ought in future to examine another more effective way not just of expressing solidarity but of becoming more effective in substance."
"Because in this specific instance, in Eastern Macedonia, Thrace and the Aegean islands and elsewhere where entire regions were flooded, not only were estates destroyed but there have been human victims and enormous damage was caused. So in this case something more is needed besides an emergency resolution."
"What we vote for and decide upon must come to pass. Perhaps, besides the legitimate appeal for aid and for its approval by the Commission, this is an opportunity to re-think the whole procedure and see how we can act more effectively."
"Mr President, my colleagues have told us what happened as a result of the floods, it is stated in the resolution, and I do not want to spend time needlessly."
"I just want to draw Parliament's attention and that of Mr Marín who is present today, to the type and manner and timing of aid."
"It must be direct, and must be enough to make good the damage and help those people who have been left without incomes, whose products have been destroyed, who have been left homeless, with no water supply, no trace of transport and communications and other infrastructure."
"All that must be made good at once."
"But that, Mr Marín, is not enough."
"Such disasters take place every so often, usually in border areas among the poorest in the Community, and they must be given special treatment."
"There should be a scale of aid in the sense of the Community's structural policy so that such natural disasters will result in less damage."
"They need special protection."
"Instead, what do you do?"
"You exclude the islands of the North and East Aegean from the operational programmes of the structural policy."
"Energy, transport and other such programmes."
"And consequently you leave them unprotected while they are the most vulnerable to natural disasters."
"Since these are border regions, there towards the Aegean, towards Evros and Turkey, they also fail to attract investment because everyone is uneasy about stability in those areas because of the notorious policy of the Turkish leadership."
"Consequently, Mr Marín, please look to those two phases, immediate aid and a scale of regular aid for the protection of those areas by means of structural programmes, so that disasters will not cause such widespread damage."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the severe bad weather that has recently affected many countries in Europe and all over the world is the result of man's ill-considered intervention in the environment."
"Huge areas of forest have been destroyed, lakes have dried up, rivers have been blocked up."
"Nature warns but also takes its revenge."
"The same thing has happened in Greece, where last week enormous destruction was caused by severe rainstorms."
"People lost their lives, crops were destroyed and people who had toiled to create their estates lost them."
"We express our sympathy to the victims and to all those who suffered destruction, and Mr President, we ask the European Commission to express its sensitivity in practical ways by providing financial aid as soon as possible."
"Storm in Malaga ."
"Mr President, I presume that you, as a neighbour from the region, although from another country, are aware of the heavy rains and violent winds experienced in Malaga from 31 January to 5 February."
"This damaged farming and livestock products, land and woodland infrastructures and capital assets of all forms."
"The damages represent more than 21 000 million pesetas."
"I, on behalf, I would say, of almost all of the Spanish delegation, regardless of the group they belong to, would ask the Commission, through this resolution, to secure emergency aid to relieve the damage in the province of Malaga."
"I am sure that Vice-President Marín will have the same degree of interest in the problem in Greece and the problem in Spain, but the truth is, Mr Marín, that in this case we have you as our defending counsel."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares in the suffering of the families of the victims in both Greece and in Malaga, and it regrets the physical damage caused. But I must tell you that you have put me in a difficult position, since the problem we have is that the budget heading relating to emergency aid for Community citizens who have been the victims of catastrophes has been cancelled precisely on the initiative of the European Parliament."
"Therefore, it seems a bit dramatic for the Commission to have to remind you of it and maybe ask you to include it in the budget again for the coming year."
"Thank you, Commissioner Marín."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended for 15 minutes while awaiting Voting Time)"
"We shall now proceed to the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"During the vote on the accident caused by a plane in Italy:"
"Mr President, as the news has been published today that the Italian Government has asked the US Government to allow proceedings to be heard on the incident in Cavalese in Italy, we believe this new fact should be included in the resolution and, with the agreement of many colleagues, I would therefore like to submit the following oral amendment: ""notes the formal request made by the Italian Government to the US Government to allow proceedings to be heard in Italy' ."
"If everyone agrees, we can approve it."
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment and adopted the resolution)"
"After the vote on floods in Greece :"
"Mr President, concerning the four resolutions on floods which the House has just voted for, three-quarters of an hour ago an insult was offered to the dignity of Parliament."
"After the toil and trouble taken to prepare the resolutions, and after we took the trouble to listen to them for over half an hour, the Commissioner responsible, Mr Marín, rose and though he is not a cynic, told us most cynically that none of all that was worth a groat, because the budget line providing compensation aid has been abolished, for which Parliament shares co-responsibility."
"I raise the issue as a question."
"In that case, why did the Bureau accept that we could table resolutions that can have no force?"
"For what reason?"
"Besides, even when that budget line had not been abolished, such aid was non-existent, very limited, or it never reached its target."
"Now, he tells us most cynically that it is no longer even provided for."
"Then why this debate?"
"Why this trick against Parliament?"
"Mr. President, I am not raising the issue personally, nor out of national egoism."
"Today it concerns Greece."
"Tomorrow it will concern other countries."
"Are we to continue playing this game?"
"And if the budget line in question has been abolished, it is impossible for us to tolerate that and as a body with special responsibility for the budget we must bring it back, because it is unacceptable that fellow-humans should be suffering, afflicted by floods and natural disasters, while the Community sits there twiddling its thumbs."
"Mr President, this House should know that Mr Marin is absolutely right: we were party to removing that budget line."
"That is one of the reasons why Mr Avgerinos, your colleague in the Bureau, is in the process of re-examining the system of urgencies."
"So it is no news to most of us."
"What is ridiculous is that we keep tabling motions asking for money to be spent when there is no budget line, and Members should know that when they table resolutions."
"Mr President, our Greek colleague is partly right."
"Mrs Green is also only partly right."
"In the resolution on Greece we are not asking for money from the Diaster Fund, but from the Structural Funds, and therefore not the ECU 5 million from before."
"That was my first point."
"Secondly, Tuesday afternoon, but perhaps Mrs Green did not receive a complete copy of the report, the man sitting behind you, myself and a number of colleagues agreed to ask the Presidency to consider once more whether we should discuss these resolutions on calamities in future, and to come back to this point the next time we are re-examining everything related to urgencies."
"The Greek possibilities continue to exist."
"In fact, before the vote, I had to explain, particularly to Mr Ephremidis - and I believe I did so calmly - that I was sorry to have to say that we cannot secure any aid for natural catastrophes because the budget heading B4-3400 has been removed."
"Secondly, as regards the Structural Funds, there is another problem: the Structural Funds Regulation does not allow for payments to cover natural catastrophes."
"Consequently, there is no legal basis for doing so."
"Mr President, I had already risen to speak."
"I would like to support Colleague Ephremidis in his efforts on behalf of the flood victims but not in his demands to the President to declare such resolutions to be inadmissible."
"It is my view that it is better for us to discuss the crime which actually exists all around buildings in Brussels - discussion on this was rejected - instead of a budget line which does not really exist."
"I am of the opinion that it is not the President who should make such decisions but this House."
"Mr President, clearly there has been a misunderstanding by the interpreter."
"I, on the contrary, said quite clearly that Mr Marín, though he is not a cynic, ... etc."
"I did not say he is a cynic, but indeed, said: ' though he is not a cynic' , but that with cynicism, in other words with extreme composure, he said that the budget does not provide for it."
"I want to state that, Mr President, because I have served in this Chamber for about 20 years and never have I directed personal comments against a colleague and far less against holders of office in the Council or the European Commission."
"That concludes the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance"
"Mr President, I would simply like to point out that, to my knowledge, the bell did not ring to announce the votes, or else it did not ring everywhere."
"I arrived ten minutes late."
"I was listening very carefully for the bell because I had a meeting."
"I should have looked at my watch, but I believe that, given the stakes which have become quite significant during voting time, it would be better to ensure that the bell does ring."
"Thank you."
"We will check that but your presence will be recorded."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.50 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.)"
"Confidence in electronic means of payment (continuation)"
"We are now taking the continuation of the debate on confidence in electronic means of payment."
"Mr President, it is possible to keep the interests of consumers very clearly in view and yet at the same time be fully open to the possibilities of new technical developments."
"Madame rapporteur has given us convincing proof of this by shedding bright light with her report on legal problems arising from the Commission's communication, - for example the question which has not yet been solved satisfactorily, about the definition of the methods of payment covered by the communication and\or a directive still to be drawn up."
"Is this now to include only physical or also purely electronic payments - for instance via the Internet?"
"No less urgent are the liability problems dealt with in detail by the rapporteur, which are of prime importance for the consumer."
"On both questions I consider a response from the Commission, also with regard to any directive which might be issued, to be urgently necessary."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs passed the report by Mrs Thors unanimously."
"It would be desirable if this high House could do the same - in the interests of the modernisation of our payment systems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Thors' excellent report tackles with determination an extremely new and complex field in which the traditional psychology of the consumer plays a significant role."
"The current market economy is still largely based on the consumer's physical assessment of the materiality of the currency and the quality of the retailer."
"This assessment also determines to a large extent the consumer's confidence, with attitudes which, in addition, are quite different throughout the European Union."
"Indeed, we are currently undergoing a revolution which is vastly upsetting our traditional attitudes. It is a revolution of a size similar to that which, in the past, saw the introduction of physical currency and the substitution of the barter economy with the market economy."
"It is clear today that physical currency is disappearing and being replaced by a simple electronic record; in particular, the sector known as cybereconomy is developing and the retailer is disappearing to be replaced by a network of electronic exchanges which are no longer represented by the faces of millions of shop assistants, but by a few multinationals which face up to the consumer and which are out of his reach."
"It is this change which is leading to the consumer's distrust."
"It is therefore the consumer that needs to be taken into consideration if we want to instil new confidence in modern, technological procedures."
"In a few years, as President Clinton said in a speech on 1 July 1997, billions of dollars will be exchanged in this way. Thus, it is not enough to worry about organizing consumer protection in terms of electronic payment cards."
"We must firstly create the conditions for emergence of a legal framework in order to allow for competition in the provision of exchange of procedures, by establishing rules which prevent the setting up of monopolies providing software and servers through discriminatory procedures."
"Certain societies are in fact already trying to control this burgeoning cybereconomy."
"Moreover, many people are amazed at the success of Bill Gates, for example."
"These companies are so powerful that they already elude the reach of most of our governments."
"The United States seems to want to establish only those rules which will be necessary from now on to best serve the interests of American societies simultaneously."
"The European Union must assume its role as a great world economic power."
"It must therefore, in our opinion, establish a directive, which defines, classifies and standardizes the exchange procedures, as well as organizing them into a hierarchy."
"That will be a first defining step in the setting up of a competition law in this new field and in forming consumers' confidence in the new technologies."
"It is in this spirit that the Group of the European Radical Alliance will give its support to Mrs Thor's report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say how satisfied I am with the report and to emphasize its many positive elements."
"Firstly, the report agrees with the Commission's policy in respect of new payment methods, including electronic methods."
"The Commission also believes that it is advisable to avoid imposing unnecessary administrative requirements which hinder innovation, growth and competitiveness in the sector."
"Therefore, faced with the arrival of this new generation of products - particularly electronic money - which is still at a relatively early stage, the Commission decided to propose a non-binding recommendation."
"Before the end of 1998, the Commission will carry out a study analysing the extent to which the principles included in the recommendation have been applied."
"If it appears that their application is unsatisfactory, it will propose a directive."
"The Commission will, of course, keep Parliament informed of the progress in this matter."
"Secondly, the Commission agrees with the principle stating that a free and open market economy must prevail in the sector, as provided for in the Treaty, and that, in principle, it must not thus be unduly regulated."
"Thirdly, the Commission believes that the main objectives should be to increase confidence and consumer acceptance as regards electronic means of payment as well as to promote the single market and encourage electronic commerce in this area."
"Fourthly, the Commission considers that, for the single market to work at full capacity and for electronic commerce and the information society to develop, then electronic money products and electronic payments must be solvent, easy to use, efficient and safe, as the Commission highlighted in its communication on a European initiative on electronic commerce."
"Finally, the Commission believes that transparent and safe electronic money products would make the change to the single currency easier, particularly during the transition period."
"Mr President, I would like to move on to make a few points about the follow-up planned for the communication and Parliament report."
"As we stated in the communication, the Commission is prepared to draw up initiatives in the field of new means of payment with a view to promoting electronic commerce and the information society."
"In this respect, the Commission issued a recommendation in July 1997 where it pointed out that transparency, responsibility and compensation for damage were the principles which should govern the relations between the issuer and the holder of the payment instrument."
"And, in the future, the Commission intends to clear up the application of the Community competition standards in these markets with a view to achieving a balance between an adequate level of interoperability and healthy and vigorous competition. It also aims to propose a draft directive on the issuing of electronic money whose aim would be to guarantee the stability and the solvency of the issuer of electronic payment instruments, since we believe that this also serves to promote consumer confidence."
"On the other hand, to respond to a specific solution from the Amsterdam European Council, the Commission is also studying different possibilities in the field of fraud and the falsification of the means of payment, including, of course, electronic money."
"In conclusion, as outlined in the report, the Commission intends to study specific initiatives in the field of the digital electronic sector whose objective would be to establish a Community framework in this area and thus do away with any obstacles within the European Union."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Simpler legislation for the internal market (SLIM)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0033/98) by Mr Crowley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on simpler legislation for the internal market (SLIM) and the results of the second phase and the follow-up of the implementation of the first phase recommendations (COM(97)0618 - C4-0660/97)"
"Mr President, in the absence of my colleague, Mr Crowley, I wish, at the outset to place on the record of the House his appreciation to the Secretariat of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights for all its assistance and advice in preparing this second SLIM report and also, to thank the other draftsmen for their additions to the text."
"He also wishes me to put on the record his thanks to the Commission for taking on board some of the committee's concerns with regard to prior consultation."
"I am sure that it is obvious to all Members of the House that the easier and more accessible we make legislation the greater the opportunity for real business and commerce to expand which will lead to bigger growth and more employment."
"We must take seriously our responsibilities under the Treaties not to impose unnecessary administrative or financial burdens on smalland medium-sized enterprises which are recognized as the greatest engine for growth in employment terms."
"Within the report there are a number of areas specifically mentioned: extension of the scope of SLIM actions in the agricultural area; use of plainer and simpler language; it also points out that codification is a useful tool to improve the situation - for example, 16 fertilizer directives being reduced to a single directive."
"The report also recommends that Member State governments should establish SLIM teams as there is evidence that some of the hindrances to the internal market are a result of the non-implementation or non-transposition of EU legislation."
"It suggests that the duration of the SLIM teams should be extended to a minimum of six months and that the third phase of SLIM should address freedom of movement and social security for migrant workers."
"It should also address health and safety at work, public procurement and directives on the maintenance of dangerous substances."
"For the fourth phase the rapporteur suggests a machinery directive, an environmental waste management directive, a telecommunications equipment directive, an electromagnetic compatibility directive and the implementation of pollution controls."
"Finally, as all Members will know, many times Member States use the European Union as a scapegoat for unpopular national rules."
"This practice must not continue and must be responded to vigorously by the European Parliament offices in each Member State."
"The rapporteur wishes me to commend this report to the House."
"Mr President, I would like to commence by apologizing on behalf of the draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"Like Mr Hyland I have been asked to step in and it would seem that Mr Hyland and I are the godparents of this report in the European Parliament while the real parents are elsewhere."
"I would also like to note the success with which the Luxembourg Presidency really kicked off the SLIM programme."
"As a British Member, I am optimistic that the British Presidency can maintain the momentum that was picked up originally by the Luxembourg Presidency and that will be carried on through the Austrian and German presidencies because there is much to do in this particular area."
"At issue is improving the environment for business."
"It is an essential part, as the single market action plan pointed out, of the completion of that programme."
"Red tape, when it is reduced and when those rules are simplified, will make things much clearer for businesses and much easier for business to operate within the single market."
"It will be a particular help to small and medium-sized enterprises who must spend more money proportionally in order to comply with EU legislation and national legislation when it has been transposed."
"In particular, more money must be spent on decoding some of the complex texts when they arrive in their language in their respective Member States."
"It will also promote enhanced economic activity which can only be good for the single market because the outcome would be an increased number of jobs."
"Some of the prime examples of the areas that have been covered are, in particular, directives that can be codified into a single directive - in the case of fertilizers, for example, or, clearly, machinery, environmental waste, telecommunications equipment and electromagnetic compatibility across the electrical equipment and, indeed, pollution control."
"The other issue is transposition which needs to be dealt with effectively."
"Much of the legislation, when transposed at the Member State level, is transposed into very weighty legislation."
"This is partly due to some of the complexity in the original text but it is mainly, I believe, due to bureaucratic interference at national level as civil servants wish to include bits of their own interpretation of legislation as well as their own pet projects in national legislation."
"SLIM is a plan meant to reduce the bureaucrat's appetite for legislation and to propose wholesome legislation which will provide a healthy framework for the operation of the single market."
"A healthy single market is one which will create jobs and therefore I commend Mr Crowley's report to this House."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group may I very, very sincerely thank the rapporteur in his absence for his report and his continuing commitment to the SLIM initiative."
"The SLIM initiative receives cross-group support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights of this House and with minor exceptions is unopposed."
"However technical and detailed the work in the context of the SLIM initiative may seem to be we must never lose sight of the fact that it is a matter of a central project for the acceptance of European Union amongst its citizens."
"However great may be the enthusiasm for Europe, if daily life is determined, particularly for companies, by incomprehensible rules, innumerable statistical forms and complicated VAT procedures, then even the greatest enthusiasm will totter and fall into discontent and annoyance."
"Apart from these problems of acceptance and the costs associated with the carrying out of many regulations - and often it is not Community regulations but actually national regulations - it must also be of some concern to us to guarantee and increase legal certainty is ensuring that legal requirements are comprehensible and enforceable."
"Initiatives so far by the Commission are certainly welcome but go too slowly and not far enough."
"I can therefore only support the rapporteur in his demand for the acceleration and extension of the process of simplifying the law and for the rapid implementation of the proposals drawn up by the SLIM teams."
"A sphere which would be very suitable for many successes in this area would certainly be that of agriculture."
"If however we complain about excessively complicated regulations we should not lose sight of the deeper reasons for them."
"One of these causes is surely that in the European Council in many matters unanimity is required or when where it is not formally required the broadest possible agreement is sought."
"In order to be fair to everybody or to as many people as possible exceptions to the exceptions and very hairsplitting adjustments must be laid down."
"I also believe that in our capacity as the European Parliament and as law makers in matter we must take ourselves in hand and more often keep to the basic principle that ""less is more' ."
"I would thus like to propose in conclusion that this Parliament creates an instrument whereby we can check whether we can frame our legislative proposals in simpler and more comprehensible terms."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the activities of the Commission in the context of the SLIM programme started back in 1996 are extraordinarily welcome."
"The report now before us represents a further step towards improvement and simplification of Community law, even if it is only a small step, considering the massive and urgent necessity to create simple regulations for the single market."
"Of course I wish that the SLIM programme would be reflected very much more quickly and more clearly in solid results which everyone can see."
"Then in addition a less important role is played by the series of projects subjected to the SLIM procedure."
"I wish this programme would lead to perceptible relief for the medium, small and very small companies, but also for the big ones, thus strengthening their ability to compete and bringing more jobs."
"The monitoring of Intrastat and the sphere of value added tax are really worthwhile objects in this respect."
"I wish the SLIM programme to be perceived as a real blessing and that it would inspire the Member States to thin out their laws in the same way, voluntarily or even perhaps subject to deadlines."
"Our laws must no longer be perceived to be the expression of blind legislative madness on the part of Brussels or national bureaucrats."
"The legislature must not overstep a mark still recognizedd as reasonable with its frequently compulsorily burdensome effects on the citizens and companies."
"These wishes and demands can of course be addressed only to the Commission."
"The legislators, Council and European Parliament were and are also asked."
"We, the European Parliament must ask ourselves self-critically: What is our contribution to the achievement of the goal which has been set?"
"When I measures our resolution which we have put to the vote, with the same criteria of clarity, legibility, conciseness and focus then I am disappointed."
"This is by no means a reproach for the rapporteur, absolutely not at all."
"It is primarily the result of our own internal parliamentary voting procedures, at the end of which frequently many unconnected points are lined up together."
"This statement applies quite generally."
"Independent of this I find it hard to see what sense, for example, points 10 and 11 make in this resolution."
"I of course unreservedly support the demand for a European form of company."
"These points 10 and 11 really have very little to do in my opinion with the aims of the SLIM programme to improve and simplify the existing legal arrangements."
"If Parliament is trying to implement the SLIM programme then I cannot quite work out why it wants to be included in point 15 and 16 even during the individual monitoring procedures of the Commission in the context of SLIM."
"As co-legislator it should concentrate on cooperating in the conclusions and not drag out the process in its initial stages."
"SLIM is a worthwhile undertaking."
"I thank the rapporteur, the Commission and in particular Commissioner Monti for his perseverance and I am pleased that the current Council Presidency accords the SLIM programme a particularly prominent significance."
"Mr President, the Dutch word 'slim' means 'clever' in English."
"The English 'slim' means 'thin' in Dutch."
"Neither qualification applies to the programme the Commission has put before us."
"Because the Commission has as yet failed to meet its promise."
"I think this is a pity that Commissioner Monti is not with us here tonight, because I would like to have a seen a firmer commitment from the Commission to get serious about both deregulation, simplification and consolidation of European legislation."
"We have one actual example of consolidation."
"This is Community customs legislation."
"Those who see the fat volumes this consolidated legislation occupies, and those who know that relatively rudimentarily educated people throughout the Union have to work with this, know that we have failed to simplify Community legislation and make it more manageable."
"When we see the tasks we set ourselves in Community legislation, for example, returning Tdocuments within 14 days, and when we know that over 85 % of these documents to not arrive back in time, what kind of legislation are dealing with, if we know that people cannot keep to it?"
"When we know that, on driving and resting times for instance, we have only now, at the beginning of 1998, the figures for 1993 and 1994, whilst four Member States actually manage quite simply not to submit any figures at all, and the Commission is just sitting here, saying: yes, we are going to simplify, deregulate and improve legislation, then I would like to see genuine results!"
"The Commission will have to give its word."
"Mr President, Mr Wijsenbeek, I would have thought that SLIM means slim in German - in any case I see that written in the shirts which unfortunately have long since ceased to fit me - slim also in the sense of slimming down the legal and administrative regulations which are obligatory throughout Europe."
"The Austrian Economics Minister described this task, in agreement with the British Council representative, as a major theme of the Austrian Presidency."
"We shall observe carefully whether and how the Austrian Council Presidency in the second half of the year 1998 comes to terms with mastering Parkinson's Law, and we are already looking forward to positive effects of the initiative announced by the Austrian Economics Minister entitled ""Better regulations are better for jobs.'"
"SLIM is one of the initiatives by which work we have started can be continued, and simplification can be pushed forward; the financial burden due to the costs of bureaucracy is extremely high particularly for small and medium companies and its limitation by means of simplified legislation is therefore a necessity."
"We are of course of the view that the general mandate proposed in point 21 of the report means a transfer of authority for the Commission, which we reject."
"Of course we are in agreement with the report, which we think is excellent."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would of course like to join in the congratulations to Mr Crowley for the really great work which he has done towards the simplification of the administration in the context of the single market."
"If one looks at what is required in terms of economic statistics even from some small and medium companies one gets the feeling that the strangers to reality who invented these statistics obviously believe that customers primarily pay their prices for the filling in of forms and not for a product."
"This therefore requires something from a company which it cannot give."
"The logical result is simply that jobs are lost."
"Would it not be considerably better if the state, instead of as usual threatening fines if companies do not meet their statistical obligations, were instead to offer incentives, e.g. certain premiums, and then otherwise leave it up to these firms whether or not they produce statistics in the context of economic statistics."
"For a historically-aware person this system inevitably calls to mind the compulsory labour of the Middle Ages, but in those days they had the advantage that they just had to supply one tenth, whereas today the State usually requires considerably more than 10 % of the income of the working time."
"When we hear how for example today in Austria the Finance Minister thinks aloud about a reversal of the burden of proof in cases of suspected tax evasion, one can scarcely imagine what this would mean in terms of extra work for our small and medium firms and how this would be reflected in astronomical unemployment figures in Europe."
"It is small and medium firms in particular where jobs are created and maintained."
"In this sense the SLIM programme can really do some pioneering work on behalf of the individual European citizen, and I very much hope that the various parents and godparents of the SLIM programme continue their efforts to drive this SLIM programme forward and keep it alive."
"Mr President, I wonder how long we are going to continue to speak in appreciative terms about the SLIM programme."
"It is now 1998."
"The programme was launched in 1996, but, as my colleague Mr Wijsenbeek said, we have still not seen a single proposal."
"That is the first serious objection."
"I would like to issue a final warning: don't come back again and speak about the SLIM programme if we have not got any concrete proposals."
"I am beginning to tire of this 'SLIM liturgy' ."
"Secondly, I really hope that the message reaches the whole Commission, i.e. that we want these principles to be extended to cover all legislation within the Commission, since there is a need there also."
"Furthermore, I would like to underline what Mr Murphy noted at the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, namely that one of the SLIM proposals which has been put forward, regarding the keeping of statistics, is not feasible."
"I hope the Commission takes this seriously and that it revises it, since this proposal would lead to double bureaucracy and double nomenclatures for companies, and go in precisely the opposite direction to what all of us here wanted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SLIM initiative is a very important initiative because it makes Europe pleasant."
"Pleasant because people are thinking about how existing rules can be made simple and how they can be made more useful."
"When one considers that we have about 50 000 single market regulations then one knows the magnitude of the task which has to be faced."
"When they talk about new public management then we know that SLIM has a very significant role here."
"In addition to FICHE-IMPACT which is to try to simplify new legal regulations and to make them clear for the benefit of citizens then SLIM is designed to simplify the existing statute book."
"We also need the bench marking system, so that we can see how the quantity, the quality, the various spheres develop, in other words so that we get comparable criteria for how efficiently we work."
"We need these SLIM programmes so that the single market does not just exist on paper but can also be experienced in practice."
"Simplified and standardised single market regulations will benefit not only the companies, no, particularly the Consumers, because they will make it possible for products to be cheaper."
"The firms can then be more concerned with delivering the service or manufacturing the product instead of with the entering of statistics."
"It is in fact possible, to obtain the documents and the necessary data for the statistics from other spheres."
"We give sufficient information to the Treasury, the banks can measure turnovers, the social security offices get the data."
"I believe that in this sphere we have some scope."
"I would also suggest that for example the Economic and Social Committee should concern itself more intensively with these problems, for relieving the load on business leads to more jobs."
"Mr President, people may well think this is a step in the right direction, but I believe it must be looked at in a much broader way."
"It is good that people are dealing with legislative area by legislative area and can extend it to cover more areas if that should be of importance."
"It is also good that the level of detail is examined properly, so that more of the principles are left to EU rules and EU law and more details are left to individual Member States regarding whatever may be concerned in agriculture, such as cucumbers, bananas or strawberries, so that this debate is avoided."
"I have a serious objection, namely that we are starting with such a rule about SLIM, which in itself is good, but are not tackling the big problem - the constant flow of new EU rules."
"In 1992, when the principle of subsidiarity was introduced, there were around 8 050 EU rules affecting the Member States."
"In 1996 it was 14 000 and the number is increasing year by year."
"It is the mass of new rules and details which makes the problem so great."
"That is where we must begin by leaving more of the principles to the EU and more details to the nation states."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Short-term statistics"
"The next item is the report (A4-0047/98) by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on short-term statistics (COM(97)0313 - C4-0417/97-97/0171(CNS))"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the topic we are looking at - the legislative resolution on a proposal for a Council Regulation on short-term statistics - has a technical dimension, but it also has a dimension which concerns the completion of the European Internal Market and the single currency, with the introduction of the euro."
"It is becoming more and more evident that our economic reality at European Union level is already exceeding what the mere effectiveness of the Member States could be, since it is clear that with the Internal Market and especially with Monetary Union, it will be essential to have a political orientation for the economic and monetary policies of the Union, and this orientation will thus have to be based on statistics which are reliable."
"This proposal for a regulation tries to ensure that these statistics are reliable, that is, that those aspects and economic quantities to be considered at economic and monetary level in the Union are comparable and reliable: that is the hope and the intention of this regulation."
"It is important then that there have been two types of consultation before this regulation was drawn up: one in the European Monetary Institute - the embryo of what is to be the European Central Bank - in order to give the Union's monetary policy the correct orientation; and another in the Commission, in order to determine from its economic guidelines the type of shortterm statistics needed, the type of clarification needed and, therefore, the type of demands which must be established."
"This leads to a range of proposals which are set out in the explanatory statement."
"Eleven different characteristics are noted including monthly production indicators, manufacturing orders information, monthly information on stocks, production broken down by activity, employment and hours worked and, from the Commission, a range of indicators referring to small and medium-sized undertakings and to some specific sectors, such as construction and services."
"These indicators are established through different types of modules which allow this comparison to be made."
"This question was debated in committee and there was a large consensus."
"I, as rapporteur, put forward two proposals: firstly, that we took into consideration the indicators at regional level, among other things, because there are regions which are of equal or superior weighting to some countries."
"There was then another much more complicated proposal which involved defining some modules in terms of the accounts concerning, for example, the number of hours worked by part-time workers, which is one of the questions which is now being studied most carefully."
"Under this second heading there was a series of observations on the part of some PPE colleagues in reference to the SLIM programme stating that we should not excessively overload businesses when giving them statistic questionnaires to fill in, and in the search for agreement we dropped this second aspect."
"We agreed on the remainder and this makes me, as rapporteur, very happy since the amendments that I am proposing to the report - accepting the initial Commission proposal, they are proposals or amendments which I see as improvements - received the unanimous support of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, so I am, therefore, presenting a report without discrepancies at committee level."
"Mr President, a misinformed man or woman, a misinformed official and a misinformed population reacts badly and decides badly."
"This statement of the obvious especially affects those who take the decisions in our European Union, who, if they are misinformed, or if the information they receive is false and, more particularly, incomparable, run the risk of taking bad decisions which could end up being to the detriment of the Union's citizens."
"This is why a regulation on short-term statistics is not only a question of statisticians or technicians, but also takes on a significant political importance."
"That is also why Parliament is looking into the matter."
"Following the evolution of businesses in order to be able correctly evaluate the evolution of the Internal Market, so as to define monetary, economic, social and industrial policies is, in fact, very important politically, in particular during this transition period we are currently undergoing, as we prepare for the single currency."
"I learnt at university that using statistics can be the most sophisticated way of lying and that, after all, we should only trust statistics that we have fixed ourselves."
"But since, in the European Union, we must trust the statistics provided by the 15 Member States, which have the responsibility of collecting the data, we must define standards, rules and definitions which are necessary in establishing comparable statistics."
"We therefore agree with the regulation's objective and with the approach proposed by the Commission."
"We particularly approve of its desire to reconcile the burden on businesses, which must supply the data, with the increase in information needed to satisfy at the same time, for example, the European Monetary Institute and businesses themselves."
"Therefore, I know that we are torn between, on the one hand, the desire to lighten the burden on businesses, particularly the SMUs, which must supply the data, and on the other hand, the needs of the users, including businesses themselves which also need information, who often need very detailed information since it is essential for trade and investment policies."
"We certainly understand some amendments to the Commission's text, in particular as regards comparable statistics, not only at national level, but also at regional level, given that the short-term statistics will in future have to cover both the industrial and services sectors."
"However, we must not exaggerate and guarantee that we cannot identify where the data collected at regional level comes from."
"Nor must we exaggerate in another sense, like the amendments from the Greens, which, in terms of the variables, exceed what is necessary and useful."
"We must not forget that we are talking here about short-term statistics which are not destined to replace the social statistics and those on the employment market."
"If we try for too much, we will end up with less."
"We must guarantee the availability of comparable short-term indicators for the European Union, no more and no less."
"The superfluous is always very necessary, but it is not the path to take in this field and the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, has not done this."
"We will follow his lead."
"Mr President, the availability of statistical data is particularly important at times like these."
"The introduction of the euro should also give us the opportunity to observe closely how the economic situation, in particular business activity, develops."
"Therefore I very much welcome the report and I also congratulate the rapporteur - it is an excellent piece of work - and I am particularly pleased that he has pointed out that there should be no additional burden for the CMU but just the opposite, that in future we are striving for a reduction."
"Reduction means that we are not starting a paper war, as in the Middle Ages - as somebody has already said today - but that we should try to collect data as automatically as possible."
"It should be our aim to make available computer software so that the data can be piped as quickly, as up to date and as directly as possible into our systems."
"If you travel round companies, and I myself am a smith and spend a lot of time out at my customers' premises, and they often show me 20 page statistical declarations which they have to fill in - then you can understand the fury of these people against the statisticians and against this Europe that just loads red tape onto them for which they can see no immediate use."
"I believe we should really try to create an incentive system in order to have data automatically, if possible with a modem, immediately and quickly available, so that no mechanical work is involved and not much paper gets sent backwards and forwards - that is of course a mammoth burden for the Central Statistics Office, when it is confronted by tonnes of paper."
"Instead we should find an intelligent, clean solution, which makes it possible for our firms quite simply and if possible without cost to supply this data, whilst we at the same time receive exact and appropriate data for our really good future in Europe."
"Mr President, the initiative taken by the Commission with a view to improving company performance statistics deserves our strongest support."
"The introduction of the single currency and the enlargement of the market in line with the current action plan render such objectives all the more important."
"This is the only way to obtain an accurate and continually up-dated perception of on-going developments, thereby permitting the necessary adjustment measures to be taken."
"In this sphere, we cannot confine ourselves to the principle of subsidiarity, when the advent of monetary union means that responsibilities relating to the Union as a whole must be assumed."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Gasòliba I Böhm on his report, which deserves our fullest support, particularly as regards the need more clearly to distinguish between internal and external movements and to provide regional statistics."
"Indeed, these issues are connected, to a certain degree, since it important to be familiar with extra-Monetary Union movements, between Member States and, also, between regions."
"Over and above such movements, it is only with an accurate and up-to-date knowledge of all indicators at the regional level at a given moment in time that it will be possible to take action that is appropriate for such diverse circumstances, with differences sometimes proving greater within countries than between countries."
"I will not here discuss the survey of structural differences between regions, which are not covered by this regulation, but where a great deal remains to be done under the responsibility and with the support of the European Union, in order to guarantee the rigour of a policy which should occupy an increasingly important place in a stronger, more cohesive Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation you are considering today is trying to provide the Community with harmonized short-term statistics for all economic sectors."
"National statistical practices differ in this field between the Member States, so that the information available is often incomplete or incomparable."
"Through its Decision of 18 June 1992, the Council adopted a programme aimed at developing the statistics on services and particularly the trade sector."
"The definition of new policies relating to the economy, competition, social affairs and businesses, calls for initiatives and decisions based - as Mr Gasòliba was saying - on statistics."
"In addition, the sources of the statistics need to be complete and reliable in order to make the most exact calculation possible within the quarterly accounts system."
"Moreover, we are moving increasingly quickly towards the next phase of Monetary Union and the Treaty on European Union has created a new, extremely important user of short-term statistics, the future European Central Bank."
"And to apply an effective and objective monetary policy, it is essential that the ECB has complete short-term statistics which are totally comparable between the Member States and that it can also get hold of them quickly."
"The draft regulation we are discussing on short-term statistics is trying to respond to all these demands."
"However, the previous directives referred exclusively to the manufacturing industry and construction sectors, while the draft regulation rectifies this situation by including in its field of application all sectors, including services and trade."
"I must warn you that the draft regulation does not try to satisfy all the needs of the Commission and the European Monetary Institute - since this would entail a massive burden for businesses - but it does try to fill the most obvious gaps, for example, those related to such an important aspect as the consumer price index."
"As regards the greater harmonization of the results, the draft regulation sets out, for the first time, the level of breakdown of the results and the time limit for data-transfer."
"The advances which have been made in data capture techniques lead us to believe that already it is no longer necessary to draw up costly and exhaustive lists. The draft regulation also allows the Member States to use sampling techniques and administrative information, thus offering them the possibility of relieving the burden imposed on businesses."
"The Commission believes that Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are acceptable."
"However, we have problems in adopting Amendment No 8 since, in our opinion, it is redundant as a result of the adoption of Council Regulation No 322 on Community statistics, which defines the confidentiality standards applicable to all Community statistics: the so-called statistical confidentiality."
"As regards the remaining amendments, Nos 9 to 26, the Commission believes that they deal strictly with technical precision and, given that we do not want an excessively long-winded text, these amendments might mean that the normal work of companies would suffer."
"Consequently, we include the majority of the amendments from the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Gasòliba, apart from the difference we have in that we consider that the question of statistical confidentiality was already resolved in the previous regulation, and the fact that the other amendments seem, particularly to Eurostat and the Union's statistical services, to concern details which are excessively technical and which would create more problems than benefits."
"I would like to thank, then, Mr Gasòliba and the other members of the parliamentary committee for this favourable vision of the essential elements of providing security for and harmonizing short-term statistics while making them more reliable."
"Commissioner, is the Commission prepared to offer a software package which in all participating States offers the same standard and the same data collection facility and makes possible the fully automated management of statistical recording?"
"The Eurostat officials tell me that this would not be a problem."
"Moreover, in fact, when this regulation enters into force, as with all the measures involving the Internal Market, there will be an almost inevitable harmonization."
"And I do not believe that there is any difficulty with the technical advances, so it should thus be possible to have access in real time to any type of short-term statistics which can be recorded within Eurostat."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make a short point about Mr Marín's speech on the Commission's position. I would obviously like to express my satisfaction at the position he outlined and the inclusion of the amendments to which he referred."
"Amendment No 8 did not include the regulation I mentioned, but surely it makes this amendment redundant; as regards the others, my position as rapporteur is that they should not be adopted."
"Therefore, during voting time tomorrow, I recommend that we do not vote in favour of them."
"I wanted to mention a matter on which we were in agreement with the Commissioner, which seems to me important to consider, namely the fact that there will be a monetary policy and monetary management on the part of the European Central Bank, and that this will oblige us to review and analyze the precision of short-term statistics."
"In other words, there is a monetary policy which, in economic jargon we can call fine tuning - that is, almost immediate and precise adjustment - and which can obviously not work if the statistics are not extremely precise."
"Thus, we will be forced to look for a new balance between not placing an excessive burden on businesses in terms of the data needed, and not forgetting that the European Central Bank will demand more precise information, and so we will have to come back to this matter."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.05 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Thursday, 19 February 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, having spent the previous twenty-four hours agonizing over how I should vote on Iraq, I was rather concerned to see that my vote was wrongly recorded on Amendment No 12."
"In fact I had voted against Amendment No 12 rather than for it."
"Can that be corrected please?"
"Mr President, it is indeed true, as Mr Habsburg-Lothringen and Mr Posselt said yesterday, that there has been no debate on crime in Brussels, but I would nevertheless like to draw Members' attention to the fact that President GilRobles Gil-Delgado said in his letter to us: ""Please rest assured that I share your concern and I shall press the Belgian authorities for a satisfactory solution, as far as the safety of Members and staff of the European Parliament is concerned' ."
"Mr President, you will note from yesterday's Minutes that I asked the President-in-Office to rule whether Mr Titley's personal attack on me casting aspersions on my mental health was a crime against the rules of the House and I ask you to rule on that point."
"You may share his opinion but, of course, I trust that you, as a good guardian of the rules of the House, can say whether under Rule 108 I am entitled to make a personal statement on that response."
"Mr Kerr, it is a matter of interpretation whether Mr Titley questioned your mental health."
"From reading the contribution it is not clear that was the intention of his remarks."
"Mr President, in the Minutes it says that I asked for confirmation that Parliament would be able to give its views when the instructions were modified."
"I think there has been a lot of editing, because what I said was that the changes in the rules - because I believe that is what they are - should be brought to this House for confirmation before they took effect."
"That is a very important correction."
"Mr President, in relation to Mr Kerr, all I said was that I was now convinced that in the United Kingdom care in the Community was no longer working."
"There is a saying in the United Kingdom that if the cap fits you should wear it!"
"Mr Kerr, do you wish to make a personal statement?"
"Votes"
"Mr President, there seems to be some confusion as to why I did not record my presence in the last vote."
"The reason for it is quite simple."
"I am not recording my presence when I indicate a roll-call vote out of solidarity with yourself and other colleagues who come here Monday to Friday regularly."
"In any case, votes do not win prizes on Fridays. The roll-call vote does not count on a Friday."
"Mr President, on a number of occasions this week mobile phones have again gone off in the Chamber; this was particularly embarrassing when the President of Portugal was here."
"I wonder if the services could put notices on the glass doors reminding Members to switch off their phones prior to entering the Chamber."
"It is very easy to walk in having forgotten that, and it might just help to eliminate embarrassment in the future."
"That is a very good suggestion."
"The rapporteur has done his job well."
"I have no comment to make in that respect, but I think reports of this kind should not be considered by Parliament."
"Members of Parliament do not have the competence as far as competition statistics are concerned (in this case), and anyway this is a question which should be referred to an administration and not to a parliament."
"I do not think there is any other parliament in the world which concerns itself with detailed questions of this type."
"Thors report (A4-0028/98)"
"There are many problems with the rapidly growing use of electronic means of payment."
"Technical developments in this area are moving very fast, and legislation cannot keep up. This applies, for example, to rules on liability when cards are lost, and the growing retail trade on the Internet."
"However, people can lose their cards in countries other than the 15 EU Member States, and Internet selling is also not limited to EU countries."
"In order to achieve good consumer protection, international rules are required."
"Crowley report (A4-0033/98)"
"The quality of EC and EU legislation needs to be improved."
"However, the question is whether SLIM is the right method to achieve this."
"If you disregard the use of complicated language, the inability to find political solutions to problems, and bad compromises which leave legislation far too open to interpretation, SLIM can be critically examined from the following angles."
"Firstly, simplification as such should not be an end in itself if it leads to legal certainty being jeopardized and complicated questions being oversimplified."
"Secondly, we know what the flaws in Community legislation actually relate to, namely:"
"a lack of codification; -endless references to other directives, regulations, treaties and rules of various kinds - apart from being user-unfriendly, if the contents of the reference are not always particularly well coordinated with what is found in the texts referred to, this also leads to problems of application and interpretation; -an unwarranted use of annexes, which regulate substantial parts of the legislative areas in question, but whose contents may often be decided by other expert committees whose work nobody appears to have an insight into or responsibility for (for example BSE).On the other hand, SLIM is itself something of a technocratic empire. A group of 'experts' , five from national administrations and five from 'representatives of those who use directives' (it is not said who these are), slim down a directive."
"It is thought that the outcome should be 'processed' quickly and painlessly through Parliament and the Council."
"My colleagues and I did not in fact succeed in finding anything apart from the packaging and packaging waste directive which could perhaps be in need of simplification according to the SLIM model."
"Perhaps more could be found, but what is needed is better standard legislation rather than new special procedures."
"System of own resources"
"The next item is the report (A4-0041/98) by Mr Bardong, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC, EURATOM) amending Council Regulation (EEC, EURATOM) No 1552/89 implementing Decision 94/728/EC, EURATOM on the system of the Communities' own resources (COM(97)0343 - C4-0395/97 -C4-0575/97-97/0188(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know the financing of the European Union is carried out neither through credits nor by means of European taxes, but through the so-called own resources, primarily duties and adjustment levies, proportions of VAT and GDPs."
"The European Community sets the Common Duty Tariff, but the raising of the duties is carried out by the Member States, that is their civil servants."
"The Member States must, on the basis of their legal and administrative regulations, take the required measures to guarantee the establishment, bookkeeping, inclusion and allocation of these own resources."
"Of course, for doing this they get back 10 % of the duties, which really belong to the Community Budget, to cover their administrative work."
"For a long time now the annual reports of the General Accounts Office have made it clear that there are significant defects in the collection process."
"Also, the Investigating Committee on transit fraud uncovered considerable infringements and abuses in the dispatch procedure, which have not yet been satisfactorily eliminated."
"In the context of SEM 2000, the European Council of Madrid planned an intensification of the collection of the own resources, and the Commission is now presenting here a proposal for an order to amend Basic Order 55/89 relating to the system of the EU's own resources with the intention of meeting this goal."
"This does in fact mean two amendments."
"Firstly, the own resources order has not so far dealt with the following cases: that the establishment of own resources has become impossible due to a mistake by the customs authorities; or that those owing customs duty have not been informed of the amount due within the specified time limit."
"The Member States should be liable for these mistakes, and beyond a certain level they should therefore even be expelled."
"Such sums can then under certain conditions be claimed from the Member States."
"Secondly, within the various Member States the cancellation of indebted sums is governed by widely differing regulations."
"The readiness of the Member States to issue communications about such cancellations is expressed in quite different ways."
"The Court of Auditors discovered that in 1995."
"Of course, the Member States do not need to declare to the Commission amounts of money which have become resistant to inspection because of greater force or for reasons for which they do not themselves have responsibility."
"But the Commission must be in a position to be able to assess the care taken by the Member States, and in certain circumstances be able to require the payment of sums of money."
"We are absolutely convinced that the Commission could be somewhat stricter in this matter, according to our own resolutions, for instance for the approval of the Commission for the financial year 1995, and according to the view of the Court of Auditors on this amendment."
"This proposed amending order is simply not a contribution to the reform of the finance order which everyone expects and recognizes as necessary."
"It is only a considerably delayed completion of this existing finance order."
"As far as the task of reforming the finance order is concerned, the Commission considers itself to be fully covered on the whole line."
"Meanwhile, in some Member States the front lines are being drawn for the so-called net-payers' discussion."
"Several states complain that they are paying more into the Community budget than they can get out of it."
"However, the Commission also does absolutely nothing to correct publicly the false impression that individual Member States could get out exactly as much as they pay in."
"Many Community payments flow directly to third countries or cannot clearly be attributed to a specific Member State."
"Therefore the net-payer calculations are often based on false assumptions."
"The duties should not of course be included in the netpayer calculations. They are not even something achieved by the country in which they are collected - at most they are an achievement of the end-users who then pay the prices, in some circumstances, in a completely different country."
"The Commission has hitherto constantly refused requests from Parliament and the Council to publish its own calculations or assessments of the net-payer items."
"It is therefore to a considerable extent equally guilty of creating the current disarray in discussions on the financial order of the Community."
"It is high time the public was better informed on this matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this report by Mr Bardong is another example of a report with such an off-putting title that nobody will read it."
"It is presented on a particularly attractive day at a particularly attractive time, and nobody will take any notice of it, especially since we are all in agreement."
"We shall follow Mr Bardong's proposals in all respects without question, and everyone will say: ""What happened there?"
"Did anything actually happen there, and why are they talking about it?'"
"However, Mr Bardong has addressed the basic problem."
"It is a question of the Union's own resources and the way we treat them, the correct way to collect them and pass them on to the European Union."
"Even if the Member States collect the own resources it is in fact our money and not theirs."
"We cannot stress that too much, and Mr Bardong has also given us the background to it."
"There was a small but interesting debate on this report in the committee, and I would like to confine myself to this."
"The debate has not really been conducted between the Member States, but between the Members and the Commission."
"It was in fact about whether we should adopt a certain threshold value."
"The Commission took ECU 50 000 as its starting point and we took ECU 10 000, as Mr Bardong suggested."
"The argument now was that with a threshold value of ECU 50 000, one covers in principle the same as if one is so small-minded that one takes ECU 10 000 as the threshold value."
"There is another aspect that really must be considered: this is all much too complicated."
"The administration is too expensive."
"This is no longer a cost-benefit calculation, and it is important to recognize when it is time to stop inspecting."
"Inspection is becoming too expensive."
"Now we can talk about it, administration is supposed to be efficient. Also, the cost-benefit calculation should play an important part in the administration."
"We support that."
"But in doing so we send out signals."
"We are saying that whatever is below this threshold is not worth bothering about."
"We then check only if the inspection is financially worthwhile."
"In doing so, we overlook the fact that certain existing rules were not brought in so that they could be viable and pay for themselves, but because they helped us achieve other things."
"Duties are not there simply to put money in the kitty - in that case we would have to keep increasing them. Duties are also specific regulatory mechanisms."
"We protect ourselves, to some extent we protect our industries, we protect our standards and we tie them to conditions if we reduce duties."
"That is politics."
"That is not bookkeeping."
"To that extent it is very important what standards we set when we check adherence to these regulations, as expressed, for example, in the duties."
"It is not even just a question of whether the calculation works out, but a question of sending out a signal. We do not take it by any means so seriously."
"It is too complicated for us."
"It is much too expensive."
"If it is just a certain amount - forget it, we do not look too closely at it."
"That costs more than it brings in."
"Even then, ECU 10 000 or ECU 50 000 - what difference does it make?"
"So are all the authorities, all the tax authorities of our Community so indulgent in the case of ECU 10 000 when they are dealing with the tax of an employee?"
"Whole families can live on ECU 50 000 for a whole year, and ECU 10 000 - well, who pays ECU 10 000 in tax in a year?"
"What if they were to refuse to pay the tax?"
"It costs too much to chase that."
"It costs more than it brings in."
"It would be convincing."
"Maybe we could look at it like that - I know it is an unfair comparison - and perhaps we would come to another judgment."
"Mr President, the Community's own resources are made up of gross domestic product, value added tax and customs duties."
"Of these, the most open to interpretation is customs duties, because the Community does not have its own monitoring mechanism, but has to rely completely on that of individual states."
"I agree with Mr Bardong, the rapporteur, that there is no justification for reckoning customs duty as net contributions from individual states."
"For example, Holland charges a considerable amount of customs duty for transit traffic, adds it to its own net contribution and says it is paying money to the EU, although, in actual fact, it is EU money which it is only accounting for to the EU."
"Thus these customs duties, which are collection items very hard to categorize, are also distorting the picture we have of net payments."
"So in this regard it would be a radically better idea if customs payments were not accountable to the EU at all, but were kept by individual countries themselves."
"A corresponding sum could then be due to the EU in the shape of GDP."
"In this way, the Member States would have a keen interest in collecting all these customs duties, as they would keep them themselves."
"So there would be no malpractice arising from whether to collect duty and account to the EU for it or not."
"It would solve the problem, but it would be a very radical solution."
"Member States do not gain from the fact that they do not collect customs duty according to common regulations."
"From the point of view of the common interest, however, we are justified in making regulations so that Member States will suffer if they flout them."
"In assessing depreciation in bookkeeping, Member States might thereby try to shake off responsibility for mistakes."
"That is why these depreciation laws cannot be free, and the business of each individual country alone."
"Because of growing administrative costs it is right that we should not start to examine minor depreciation laws, and should endeavour not to inherit areas of malpractice."
"It is important to focus sufficient attention on big issues like this."
"Mr President, as part of the work on SEM 2000 it is intended to improve the financial administration of the EU's own resources."
"This report by Mr Bardong on the EU's own resources, which the Member States are responsible for collecting, says that the Member States have a duty to take greater responsibility for what is required in matters of bookkeeping, collection and so on of the funds, in order to ensure that it works."
"However, there are significant weaknesses in the system, as has been shown by the European Parliament's ad-hoc committee of inquiry into questions of customs transits, among others."
"The Commission's proposal that the Member States should be financially responsible for serious administrative errors is logical and welcome."
"Not everything is the fault of the EU, even if it often is."
"This technical report is not going to solve all the problems, but it is a simple first step in the right direction."
"It is important to note that at the same time as the Commission is trying to strengthen the legislation, the proposal also contributes to making the legislation even more complex, which is less good."
"The Green Group is going to support the report in its entirety."
"Personally I think that Seppänen's contribution on a total reform is interesting, and something which the Commission should look at in future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendments in Mr Bardong's report on the Commission's proposal to tighten up the rules relating to the administration of the Union's own resources reveal the extent of Parliament's interest in the own-resources system, and the importance it ascribes to the transparency by which these resources are administered."
"On the amendments, the Commission has adopted the following position. The amendments which aim at both editorial simplification and a more transparent and just procedure are accepted."
"This applies firstly to that part of Amendment No 1 which aims to specify the cases in which the Member States must take financial responsibility for mistakes which result in a loss of own resources; secondly, to that part of Amendment No 2 which aims to clarify the conditions under which amounts are not recoverable or are declared to be non-recoverable; thirdly, for that part of Amendment No 4 which provides that amounts included in the cancelled debt, which are not accepted by the Commission, should be calculated according to the book."
"Likewise, the Commission will change the procedure for cancellations which it has allowed."
"In this case this agreement should no longer be implicit, but the Member States should be informed in writing."
"On the other hand, the Commission cannot follow the European Parliament on certain amendments or parts thereof."
"This applies particularly to the amendment relating to the retention of the threshold value of ECU 10 000 for the notification of cancellations, that is, Amendment No 3."
"If this amendment were accepted the result would be an enormous increase in the administrative costs."
"The suggested rise in the amount to ECU 50 000 would have the effect that about 69 % fewer cases would have to be checked, but 90 % of the income at stake would be covered."
"Mrs Wernheuer, I must say to you in this respect that this does not mean that these cases below ECU 50 000 are not subject to any kind of inspection."
"Of course these would also be checked under the usual system of inspection."
"It is just that they would not be included in these specific procedures."
"Even the reduction of the threshold value for the cases in which the national administrations will be held financially responsible would result in excessively high administrative costs and therefore cannot be accepted."
"That is part of Amendment No 1."
"Amendment No 5 on the other hand appears to the Commission to be superfluous, since the information requested about cancellations is already given to Parliament in the Four-Year Report, that is the 1993 to 1996 Report, and for the latest year it is in the next report which will, according to the planned sequence, be in the year 2000."
"However, information relating to cases of fraud is already available in the Annual Report."
"The Commission understands and fully shares the concern of Parliament to subject the Community's own resources to a strictly precise system of inspection."
"It does however seek understanding for its requirement of a reasonable cost-benefit ratio."
"In conclusion, the Commission thanks Mr Bardong again for his report."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"I cannot support this report."
"The rapporteur rejects the Commission's limit of ECU 2 000, and wants instead to keep the unofficial limit of ECU 10."
"However, in my opinion that will lead to an unreasonable number of small cases of no economic significance having to be considered by the national authorities."
"The costs of this increased bureaucracy are not compensated for by the income."
"The Union should not be small-minded in its relations with the national authorities."
"Development finance"
"The next item is the report (A4-0050/98) by Mr Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the draft Financial Regulation applicable to development finance cooperation under the Fourth ACP-EEC Convention amended by the Agreement of 4 November 1995 (COM(96)0676 - C4-0101/97-96/0307(CNS))"
"Mr President, this is one of those Friday morning reports, with no amendments. It went through committee quite smoothly and, I suppose, no-one is going to lose any sleep over it."
"It is interesting to be heckled by Mr Falconer, because I have just looked at yesterday's voting record."
"Some things do change: I notice that he has actually voted for nuclear power!"
"I am very pleased about that, Alex."
"It is extremely good that you have been converted at last."
"This report in effect is saying that there comes a time when Parliament has to say enough is enough (' sod it' in colloquial terms); we go so far and we can go no further."
"We are not going through the motions any longer of trying to give some legitimacy to something that we have no part in."
"Let us stop the pretence; let us stop kidding ourselves that if we were to give an opinion on this Financial Regulation, things would be any different - they would not."
"The eighth European Development Fund, and our reaction to it in this report, cannot be considered in isolation."
"You have to know the history to it, and that is quite simply that Parliament has always advocated the budgetization of the EDF."
"It has been a consistent approach that we have always taken."
"If we look at what has happened in the past, at the scenario to see where we are at present, we base our case on Article 199 of the Treaty which states that 'all items of revenue and expenditure of the Community... shall be shown in the budget' ."
"We have said, therefore, that the EDF should be budgetized and Parliament should have some say in the matter."
"In fairness to the Commission, it supports us in that."
"In fact, when I first came here in 1989 the Commission made it quite clear then that it expected the eighth EDF to be budgetized and it made the case at Amsterdam."
"So our criticism is not of the Commission but of the Council, which has resisted the inclusion of the EDF."
"Proposals were put to the Council at Amsterdam and they were ignored."
"When the seventh EDF came before Parliament, Parliament was once again consulted and we said that, because of Article 199 of the Treaty, it should be budgetized and we therefore delayed somewhat in giving our opinion."
"Because of that delay the Council then adopted the regulation without our opinion."
"That was bad enough, so we went to the Court of Justice and said that the Council should not have done this and we expected the Court to rule in our favour."
"However, the case hinged on whether the EDF was Community expenditure or not."
"The Court said that the EDFs were not Community expenditure: it was Community financial assistance that was paid in the Lomé Convention."
"In other words, the Commission was a subcontractor for Member States which were paying money into the Lomé Convention and the Commission administered that money."
"As someone said at the time: ' Never expect the Court to rule against the Council in a dispute with Parliament' ."
"It is the Council, of course, which appoints the judges but, more importantly, reappoints the judges."
"Therefore, although we thought it was a logical argument, we were not surprised when the case went against us."
"When we come to the 1996 discharge in the next month or so, it will be seen that the sixth and seventh EDF monies are actually being used already to finance the eighth EDF."
"We have no financial regulation for the eighth EDF but the Commission is taking monies from the sixth and seventh EDFs already without a legal base."
"I have to say that I am glad we are not associated with that practice."
"But you can see the root cause of this."
"Even when we had the 1994 discharge, and we refused to give discharge in 1994 to the EDF, the Court of Auditors said that the legal framework for the EDF was directly responsible for many of the failings in terms of sound financial management."
"We have a problem, and it is a big problem."
"But you have to look at the statement from the Commission in the explanatory statement which states: ' The Council must give its opinion by a qualified majority, having first received the opinions of the European Investment Bank and the Court of Auditors on this draft ' ."
"It does not ask for our opinion."
"Then so be it, we are not going to give it!"
"Mr President, I should just like to draw to Mr Wynn's attention the fact that I took part in the vote on Amendment No 3 on the Kyoto Summit. This was the amendment from the Green Party which, if you voted for it, was actually saying that nuclear power could not be regarded as a safe means of energy."
"I, along with the majority of the Labour Members and my socialist colleagues, voted for that particular amendment."
"Mr Wynn, unfortunately, was in the minority on that occasion."
"Mr President, I should like to tell Mr Falconer that in the Minutes it says that those who intended to vote against Amendment No 3 included Mr Falconer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our colleague Terence Wynn has said what had to be said and he can say it very much better than I could."
"There will no doubt be other things said on the subject."
"It is a long story."
"It is to one very particular point in this long and unhappy story that we shall return."
"I speak on behalf of my group in order to thank Terence Wynn publicly for his work, for only what is said publicly finds its proper place and is not completely forgotten."
"Terence has looked after this report for a long time with great commitment and he will continue to do so."
"Terence Wynn has refuted the prejudice that housekeepers are people who concern themselves with figures and nothing else."
"He has done so much work in this sphere and shows that he was always a committed housekeeper, but also a man who was personally committed in development politics and who has been very successful in bringing both together."
"This can be seen from his speeches, from his report and from his commitment."
"I know we can support him here in only one way, and that is by accepting his report unanimously and also by supporting him in the future."
"But I would just like to say this clearly in front of this House: simply, personal thanks, Terence Wynn, and please carry on the good work!"
"We need people who can so convincingly combine the thrifty and the substantial!"
"If only other Members of this House would see for once that we are not just concerned with figures and narrow-minded bookkeeping, but there is always also a political aspect in the background, and we can sometimes represent this even with passion and emotion. Maybe then the acceptance of our work, and also of the work of this Parliament, might be somewhat greater than it is."
"Mr President, if it does not embarrass Mr Wynn too much, I would like to heap further praise upon him."
"(Laughter ) It is nice to see him blush."
"The Committee has been entirely behind Mr Wynn in the stand he has taken over the years on this particular point."
"It seems odd that the Court of Justice rules that our opinion may not be necessary."
"But if we look back to the isoglucose case, it says that no legislation can pass unless Parliament has given its opinion."
"Here, Mr Wynn is proposing to Parliament that we should not give an opinion."
"How does this silly situation arise between Parliament and the Member States?"
"I think it is due to two rather simple things."
"Firstly, donor countries look for gratitude of some form for the fact that their national money is going to help in a particular part of the world."
"That argument might fall away when every currency is called the euro, and no longer the franc, pound, peseta or lira."
"We shall wait and see."
"The other is the rather interesting point that the civil servants in the Member States have convinced their ministers that there is a better cost-benefit for national aid going to developing countries than for aid from the European Union."
"I think this is wrong, but I would not expect the civil servants, whose jobs are involved, to say anything different."
"We come up against these two rather simple things and get into a very complicated, legalistic argument with the Member States and the Council."
"It is about time the Court of Justice saw a little bit of sense in this and argued that money which is being handled corporately on behalf of the Member States should be considered a part of the European Union budget and be budgetized accordingly."
"I support Mr Wynn's report, and my group supports it too."
"I would be amazed if any Member of this House voted against."
"Mr President, Mr Wynn's proposal that the European Parliament should not express an opinion on the Commission's draft Financial Regulation, applicable to the European Development Fund in the question of development cooperation with ACP countries, is a logical consequence of the absurd situation which is prevailing."
"The Green Group does, of course, support Mr Wynn's proposal."
"This Financial Regulation is going to be adopted with or without the European Parliament's opinion."
"That is quite clear. The EDF is outside the European Parliament's budgetary mandate, but we are still expected to grant exoneration and give our views on possible legislation concerning budgets."
"This procedure is absurd!"
"The only reason for this absurd situation in the Regulation is to try to get a democratic alibi for this 'story' ."
"The European Parliament should not cooperate in being a democratic alibi."
"On the other hand, there should be no doubt that the Green Group supports and is strongly committed to the development work with the ACP countries."
"Mr President, Mr Wynn takes a very unusual position in his report."
"The Council asks Parliament for its advice, but if it was up to him Parliament would refuse to give it."
"His reasoning is: ""We want to integrate the European Development Fund into Community budgets."
"We will not put up with a meagre little recommendation on financial regulations' !"
"Parliament proves itself a bad loser when it takes such a line."
"The European Treaty contains no provision for the inclusion of the EDF in the Community budget."
"Nor was this altered in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The Court of Justice has completely ruled against Parliament with respect to the nature of the expenditure."
"The Court does not think it is Community expenditure."
"The Council is therefore not obliged to ask for Parliament's advice on the financial regulations of the EDF."
"Refusing to give one's opinion reminds me of a petulant child which does not get what it wants, and therefore pushes aside everything it does get."
"By refusing, Parliament is not applying any political pressure, otherwise I might understand it."
"As a Council, I would not lose any sleep over this kind of attitude: ""You do not want to give your opinion?"
"Fine, we will sort it out without you.'"
"My criticism of the report is not only procedural, but also substantive. It is true that Parliament has been arguing for years for the budgetization of EDF expenditure."
"But there are quite a number of arguments against it."
"We have to realize that in the Lomé Convention we are dealing with the Member States' contractual obligations towards Lomé countries."
"The Member States fulfil an important role in the implementation of this agreement, which is by nature intergovernmental."
"Bearing that in mind, there is much to be said for not letting the funding go via the Community budget."
"Of course, coordination between the Community and the Member States is necessary."
"But this necessity does not disappear when the EDF is included in the Union budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this week we have already had several opportunities (on the occasion of reports on tourism) to reconstruct above all how seriously this House takes its task of representing the interests of taxpayers in the European Union."
"We have also seen how necessary it is that we perceive these interests solidly and with great determination."
"We see here - and our rapporteur stated it at the end of the arguments he put forward - how the Commission regards our concern for greater involvement in development policy, namely, and I quote: ""The Council must give its opinion by a qualified majority having first received the opinions of the European Investment Bank and the Court of Auditors on this draft.'"
"We are talking about development policy, in theory, because it is not present in the European Budget. It is the fourth largest Budget item, the fourth largest expenditure item which the European taxpayers have to make."
"At the same time, we see ourselves confronted by the fact that the Council - and in this connection apparently also the Commission - really places no value on being appropriately inspected by the institution which ultimately is responsible for monitoring the implementation of European policies."
"Mr van Dam, I believe we shall have no problems at all, not even in public, in following our rapporteur's arguments."
"As Mr Pasty has said, we should stop frittering away our time with things which they obviously think are nothing to do with us."
"The only thing is, the taxpayers are sitting there and we have to say to them quite clearly that the gentlemen of the Council - and probably those of the Commission too, as I deduce from this document - will open themselves up to inspection when we, supported by the votes of our constituents, force them to do so."
"Not otherwise."
"We should perhaps be guided by this thought when we deal with the reports before us, which we have to adopt in this house in the near future, relating to the monitoring of European policies."
"We should not allow ourselves to be led astray by any chalumeau sounds - which even I as the rapporteur for the 1995 approval clearly followed, for in contrast to Mr Wynn I proposed approval at that time. Instead, we should make sure we fulfil to the letter the task given to us by our constituents."
"Mr President, I must firstly say that I disagree with Mr Wynn, but I disagree with him on the only thing we could disagree on today: whether this debate is going to be boring or not."
"I do not think it will be, because the fact that we all agree on this matter does not necessarily mean that the debate will be boring. This is shown by the fact that, although there are no amendments and we are all in agreement, if we look at the list of speakers we can see that not only are there speeches from all the groups, but, in fact, there are several speakers from every one of the groups."
"And I believe this, Mr Wynn, proves we are all united in the belief that this matter is extremely important."
"I would suggest that it is one of the most important topics, since we are talking about the budget and the budget is what allows us to implement all the Union's policies."
"We now find ourselves with the special provision - as you rightly said - whereby, although we are allowed in all policies to contribute to the budget, we are prevented from contributing to the budgetary procedure in spite of the fact that we are nevertheless asked for our commitment when the management of the budget is being approved or rejected."
"So I believe Parliament cannot accept this role, since it is so significant."
"Nor can we say, moreover, that this is an unimportant subject."
"We know perfectly well that the sixth and seventh EDFs required more than ECU 18 billion."
"This is an extremely significant amount and Parliament must place on record that it is not prepared to play the role it has been assigned."
"Of course, I believe we must also explain that this does not mean we are against development cooperation."
"This is certainly not true."
"Nor are we against the Commission's work."
"I am saying once again that what we require is a more solid basis for this policy, within the budgetary framework of the Union."
"Mr President, I too would like to compliment the speaker, Mr Wynn, and the Committee on Budgetary Control for their work on this subject and for their proposal, which I believe should be approved, to refuse to give Parliament's opinion on the proposed financial regulations for the Eighth European Development Fund."
"I firmly believe in cooperating towards the development of the EU and, for me, this is a positive and useful provocation and an act of political and institutional responsibility on the part of the European Parliament."
"We are now in an inexplicable situation in the sense that it is difficult to explain it abroad, and substantially untenable, from both a logical and a political point of view."
"This obviously relates to the characteristics of the EDF and the fact that it is not included in the budget."
"I would like to remind you that, with regard to cooperation in development, the EDF's inclusion in the budget was almost the only request made by the European Parliament to the Intergovernmental Conference, but was hardly mentioned."
"This highlights the fact that Parliament's consultation is purely optional on many measures and that, on implementing measures and even on negotiations on the Lomé Conventions, its prerogatives are simply shown to be a power of political influence - being able to give its opinion which, however, is never binding."
"Consequently, in many cases, Parliament does not have any influence on the definition of significant aspects of the Convention itself and subsequently, above all, on its management."
"By way of example, the proposed regulation on which we will not be giving an opinion does not provide for any Parliamentary role, even in the procedure for justifying the budget, even when this concerns the resources of the EDF managed by the European Investment Bank, which comprise an ever greater part of the EDF itself."
"Who is asking Parliament not to give this opinion today?"
"Obviously, those more concerned with the outcome of the cooperation policies and the institutional and managerial correctness of the measures taken by the Community institutions."
"Rather than legal, the problem is therefore a political one."
"Our opinion is therefore all the more important as we are dealing with the debate on what to do after the year 2000 - that is, after the Fourth Lomé Convention."
"We obviously have a problem, and despite the fact that the Lomé Convention has been and continues to be a unique means of exceptional importance today, the fact that Parliament has been unable to exercise its role on control and on the definition of managerial means to the full is obviously a problem, and has certainly limited its scope and impact."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to echo the thanks to Mr Wynn, particularly as regards his point that we should give a clear signal here."
"The budgetization of the European Development Fund is a permanent topic in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and we also know that we have the Commission on our side there too."
"The disappointment over the fact that it has not gone further in the negotiations in Amsterdam has just been expressed by Mr Vecchi."
"Gradually we are perhaps making a little progress, for only recently the German Bundestag made the cross-party decision to move closer to this budgetization of the EDF, particularly with respect to an effective monitoring system."
"I am beginning to find it somewhat amusing that precisely those institutions which deprive us of budgetization, on the one hand complain that it would above all be a question of inadequate monitoring, but on the other hand do not supervise the use of European development funds with the care which we really want."
"Seen from that point of view, I think this criticism collapses somewhat, because a more effective monitoring system than the one we can offer through Parliament and the Committee for Budgetary Control, which covers the entire field and does not restrict itself merely to the section which might at times be part of a national budget - in other words a better system - is therefore scarcely conceivable."
"So I do not understand why the Council and our governments do not make more effective use of this instrument."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation had also stated in its argument that the draft before us really offers no improvement with regard to monitoring, and that is broadly unsatisfactory."
"We have already underlined this here."
"I can only repeat it again, loud and clear."
"Mr President, I would like to concern myself primarily with what Mrs Wemheuer said in her very nice speech to Mr Wynn, in which she emphasized that there are also human aspects to housekeeping."
"Occasionally, as an emigrant from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, I take part in sections of the Committee on Budgetary Control - unfortunately much too rarely, because our committees always meet at the same time, which is something I very much regret."
"I can only say that I have experienced in the Budgetary Control Committee just how highly this work is valued, and that there is a human element there."
"However, I would like to take issue with Mrs Wemheuer on one point."
"She said this Friday sitting is somewhat less important."
"No, look around, Mrs Wemheuer, and you can see that at least the quality is here."
"The fact that there are spaces here and there is of no interest."
"I am happy that we are finally deciding to send out a signal."
"If you go out and talk to people, you see a growing suspicion of what our Community, our Union, is doing with the taxpayers' money."
"I, too, share this suspicion, for why would someone refuse to accept our monitoring if they had nothing to hide?"
"The Council should be told."
"I thank Mr Bosch, who raised this question earlier."
"In that context I would say that this rejection is a clear signal sent by us to those gentlemen up there in the Council, and a policy which is correct, and we should of course ensure that it is made well known."
"There is no doubt at all, this is a sign that the administration of the Fund is not working as it ought to."
"Moreover, we should in no way give these unilateral Council decisions a dubious democratic legitimization, for the Council is the most undemocratic element in our Community."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the finance regulation for the eighth European Development Fund is a question of a document in which the implementation rules (that is, the financial order, the management of resources, the implementation measures and organs which carry them out, as well as the checking and the statement of accounts) are fixed as an internal agreement between the Commission and the Member States."
"The financial regulation is adopted, as you know and as was carried out here, with a qualified majority when the agreement comes into force."
"According to the internal agreement, the European Investment Bank and the Court of Auditors give a non-binding opinion on the draft of the text drawn up by the Commission."
"On the other hand Parliament's opinion is facultative, since the EDF, as we have frequently stressed, is not part of the budget plan, and yet it was called for as early as the draft stage of the financial regulation for the seventh EDF."
"The Commission fully understands your great dissatisfaction here in Parliament over the continuing failure to include the EDF in the budget plan."
"The Commission has in fact already taken initiatives of its own accord in this respect in the past."
"Nevertheless it does regret Mr Wynn's proposal, supported by the Committee on Budgetary Control, by which Parliament will refuse to adopt a position on the draft financial regulation for the eighth EDF as submitted by the Commission. However, that does not mean that I would not like personally to express my admiration for Mr Wynn."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"The EDF should be incorporated into the EU's ordinary budget work where Parliament also has insight and influence."
"I have voted for the report, but more constructive efforts are needed than refusing to give an opinion on EDF legislation."
"Community cereals trade"
"The next item is the report (A4-0021/98) by Mr Giansily, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 5/97 on management of the Community cereals trade involving export refunds, special import arrangements and regional aid schemes, together with the Commission's replies (C4-0351/97)."
"Mr President, since for good reason he cannot be present today, Mr Giansily has asked me to draw your attention to his text, which he wrote in his capacity as rapporteur."
"I thank the House for accepting this rule whereby, as Chair of the Committee, I represent the rapporteur."
"The Court of Auditors' Special Report on management of the Community cereals trade with regard to export refunds, special import arrangements and regional aid schemes has been the subject of numerous statements in recent years, at the centre of which were the three main parts of this report."
"First there is the Community cereals trade, for which export refunds are guaranteed - an area in which the Court's monitoring has brought to light several problems which impair the effect of the rules."
"The first problem, raised by both the Court of Auditors and the Commission, concerns the quality of the data submitted to the Commission."
"It has been shown in fact that some national disbursing offices do not list the individual amounts refunded for the export of cereal products under the individual KN-codes."
"This has probably contributed to the fact that a status quo has been created which does not favour a proper functioning of the system."
"For it was shown that the flat-rate conversion coefficients had remained unchanged for 24 years before they were reduced to 1.37 % in 1991."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the failure to correct the coefficients may have led to considerable additional costs, which is why in future care should be taken that these coefficients are checked at regular intervals."
"A similar problem was also discovered in the case of export refunds for barley malt."
"Here the implementation of the relevant regulation in France and the United Kingdom was unsatisfactory."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control therefore calls upon the Commission to recall sums which were improperly paid because of a failure to check the origin of malt exports, and to clarify the regulation which fixes the export refunds for mixed fodder."
"As far as the quality of physical inspection of cereal exports is concerned, there is a clear lack of coordination in the monitoring of multinational companies by the competent national authorities."
"The Commission is requested to take measures to eliminate these defects as quickly as possible, and to inform Parliament of the results achieved."
"Secondly, the Court of Auditors' Special Report is concerned with special arrangements for the import of maize and sorghum to Spain and Portugal."
"It will be recalled that after the entry of Spain and Portugal into the Community an agreement was made between them and the United States in order to guarantee the annual import of two million tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum to Spain, and 500 000 tonnes of maize to Portugal."
"The Spanish authorities - according to the rapporteur - impeded the proper implementation of the regulation by submitting inaccurate import data to the Commission, and this submission, moreover, was late in arriving. Meanwhile, Portugal bought maize directly on the world market and then sold it at intervention prices on the Portuguese market."
"These practices led to considerable additional costs for the Community's budget."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control demands that care be taken when the regulation is implemented in future, so that no additional costs for the budget of the European Union are incurred."
"Finally, the third aspect of the report concerns the supply of cereals under the POSEIMA scheme."
"This applies primarily to Madeira and the Azores, and the relevant comments of the Court of Auditors reveal a whole series of operational failures and weaknesses, which a rapid check of the programme might confirm."
"In this sad business it must also be mentioned (as emphasized by Mr Engwirda, member of the Court of Auditors, in a letter to myself as Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control) that it is not possible to recall the excess amounts paid, since the profits improperly made by the importers are due to a mistake by the Commission."
"So there needs to be a reform of the POSEIMA Programme on the basis of the comments from the Court of Auditors, in which, of course, the requirements of distribution between the islands are taken into account."
"Mr President, I have a worry about my own mental health (since this topic was mentioned this morning) when I can get excited by something that says ""Special Report 5/97 of the Court of Auditors on the management of the Community's cereals trade involving export refunds, special import arrangements and regional aid scheme together with the Commission's replies' ."
"But it is one of those reports which are worth reading."
"It is succinct and to the point."
"The Court of Auditors have done a really good job in highlighting the problems that we have in this area, as Mrs Theato has stated."
"However, it is not as good as previous special reports on the very same issue."
"The one that caught everyone's attention was when we were giving extra export refunds for exports from Germany, and ships were coming with grain into Germany, unloading, reloading the same grain, going away and getting monies for it."
"That showed the total folly of the system, but the flaws persist."
"Here we have export refunds from the period 1991-1994 totalling over ECU 11 billion."
"That amount was actually more than the total spent on training, social policies, research and development, and anti-poverty programmes."
"These monies were going through that scheme with a number of mistakes as well as a number of unsatisfactory practices."
"There are two points I want to highlight."
"Firstly, on the POSEIMA schemes where we had monies going to the Azores."
"When you read the report it is absolutely incredible how such monies could be spent in that way."
"Flaws and defects in the programme were revealed which would warrant it being overhauled."
"I am sure the Commission would agree with that."
"One can only endorse the Court's finding that with the current system, factors irrelevant to the special requirements of the POSEIMA scheme will dictate aid levels. It is absolutely unbelievable that we could have been paying money out in the way we did under those conditions."
"I now wish to dwell on the area which covers comitology, an area in which I have quite an interest."
"This ECU 11 billion was actually managed by a management committee over which Parliament has no control, no right of scrutiny and about which we have great difficulty in obtaining information."
"Not too long ago, when the price of cereals actually reached record highs on the world market, the management committee stopped export refunds."
"Fine, but we were never consulted or asked whether it was the right thing to do."
"After all, it is only a couple of billion ECU!"
"During the couple of months when it was suspended, that money would have served to finance the rural development which Commissioner Fischler is trying to promote, and to reconvert our spending in CAP."
"When the refunds returned, once again Parliament was not consulted."
"No consultation, no information, just a fait accompli ."
"I do not think this is the right way for Parliament to operate when it comes to agriculture, but I know I am digressing on that."
"The Commissioner may ask what that has to do with this report?"
"It has a lot to do with the report."
"It is about the way the management committees operate."
"I have to laugh that the opinion from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development says that Parliament is not in a position to monitor the activities of the management committees."
"If that is the case, it shows the inadequacy of the present system."
"We have 79 agricultural management committees."
"That was the figure given when I did the budget."
"In 1994 alone, the management committees took 4, 679 acts."
"That is a lot of legislation and money."
"The report is calling for transparency, and that is exactly what we should be doing."
"I am pretty sure the Commissioner would support that approach."
"We have to change our method of operating."
"We have to change the way we spend our money in agriculture - away from export refunds, away from this comitology structure which deals with these large amounts of money."
"We need a system that is more transparent, with fewer loopholes, fewer shortcomings."
"I honestly think that the next special report should be a darned sight better than the previous ones."
"Commissioner Fischler will, of course, have a lot to say about that and how that comes about."
"He knows that he will have the support of this Parliament when he tries to bring about those changes because they are essential."
"Mr President, I am somebody who generally supports the Common Agricultural Policy, so I hate to admit this in front of Terry Wynn, but I agree with some of the points he makes about the complications of the policy which have led to so many opportunities for fraud."
"That is one of the things about the proposals for reform."
"The aid that we pay out will be better targeted, will find its way to the farmers, the farms and the rural areas where it is supposed to go, and there will be fewer opportunities for abuse. Less will go to middlemen and traders, who by comparison with the farmers we hope to assist, have a great capacity to cream off vast amounts of money in some of these areas."
"The direct aid will solve a lot of the problems we are talking about."
"Insofar as the POSEIMA programme is concerned, we have to admit that you could not think of a more complicated or indirect or inefficient way to aid islands or remote regions, because in the first place there is no guarantee whatsoever that this money is going to the aid of the people who need it or for whom it was intended."
"Again, the subsidies can be creamed off by people in the middle as well as creating immense opportunities for irregular practices."
"The only question I have about the Giansily report is paragraph 5, which talks about importing products without any cost to the European budget or disruption to European markets."
"Of course, as long as these products are cheaper on world markets than they are in the European Union and as long as we have surpluses, there is no possibility that anybody can comply with that order, because it will obviously mean cheaper cereals from outside."
"The one area where I have a slight disagreement with Terry Wynn is over the whole question of export refunds, where I think he went a little bit astray."
"Because this is an automatic mechanism, and if we have surpluses in the Community and a policy designed to get them out of the Community to sell them to markets where prices are lower, then it is obvious from day to day and month to month as world markets change that we need an order to get these surpluses out of the Union."
"We need to employ a flexible system, and the subsidies we pay will go up and down."
"Similarly when prices on the world markets are higher than they are in the European Union, as has happened thankfully recently, we save ourselves that cost and the money is retained in the budget and we can use it for something else."
"As long as we have surpluses this system will be necessary."
"I agree that the sooner we can get to a system away from all these complicated measures to assist the regions, the better, just like in the case of the structural funds."
"We have made such complicated regulations that I do not believe they are helpful to the regions they are intended for, and they create immense opportunities for the sort of abuses that have been identified here and which we hope will be corrected."
"Mr President, it is a pity Mr Giansily cannot be present, otherwise I would have been able to congratulate him, but I would like to congratulate Mr Fischler who I expect has given up his Friday morning especially to hear the debate on this report."
"I am also a supporter of the Common Agricultural Policy, but I am convinced that when there are rules they have to be implemented properly."
"I believe this Parliament has a special role in this area, and this is really all Parliament can do."
"I think the most surprising thing about this report is that while everything in the world is changing, and everything in the agricultural policy is changing, a number of things have remained constant."
"For flour made from cereal the coefficient has not been amended for 24 years, and for malt which is made from barley, the coefficient has not been amended for 18 years!"
"How is this possible?"
"How has it been possible for the committee which decided on these things, and for the representatives of the Member States making up this committee, to have been able to calculate their own advantage from it for so long?"
"What conclusions is the Commission drawing from this?"
"Another of the things I found unusual in the report from the Court of Auditors is that it states clearly that not one Member State has the ability to exercise the necessary physical control on implementation restitutions."
"This strikes me as a serious observation."
"Billions of ECUs are spent on this, and then the Court of Auditors makes the observation that not one Member State is able to check this."
"What is the Commission doing with this knowledge?"
"I want to make one last point. When Spain and Portugal joined, special arrangements were created - to ease the transition, I take it."
"It has now become clear that these arrangements are very disadvantageous to the European budget."
"I wonder whether they are advantageous to Spain and Portugal."
"Could that be looked at again?"
"To conclude, Mr President, what measures is the Commission going to take on the basis of these conclusions?"
"What will the reclamation of the wrongfully paid out sums be?"
"One of these days we will be discussing payment for the 1993 budget."
"This one here goes up to the year 1994, if I understand correctly."
"To what extent is the Commission charging the Member States for their errors?"
"Are the extra tariffs used, which have been introduced at the insistence of Parliament?"
"For instance 25 %, when it has been occurring for so many years."
"Does the Commission intend to do this?"
"Furthermore, what is the need for special arrangements for Spain and Portugal when, if I have understood correctly, they have served absolutely no purpose, at least not during the past ten years?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is our view that some aspects of the motion for a resolution in Mr Giansily's report are unbalanced."
"The explanatory statement contains certain considerations regarding the possibility of Portugal and Spain importing given quantities of maize from the world market, but which are not reflected on an equal footing nor in an appropriate manner in the motion for a resolution."
"The fact that one of the two Member States belatedly submits data that is not only late but also inaccurate is mentioned nowhere in the political resolution."
"Meanwhile, the other Member State is required to exercise the right to import without any consequent adjustment of the Community budget and, ultimately, without affecting Community production, when such a requirement is not even justified, in that this right was created precisely to bolster the processing industry of the Member State in question."
"This reference in the political resolution is all the more unjustified in that it appears at a time when it is already known that the Portuguese Government has decided to substitute direct importation, to which it would however have continued to be entitled by means of a public competition."
"Extensive references are made to the supply of cereals under POSEIMA."
"As we have repeatedly stated, and not just in connection with cereals, the Court of Auditors' report confirms that the impact of subsidies to the end-user lacks clarity (since there is no clear definition of who or what the end-user is). The extent of the effect on the end-user is not readily identifiable (on the basis merely of the accounts of importing companies) and, finally, the monitoring system introduced by the regional authorities is not satisfactory."
"We are waiting to see what measures will be implemented by the regions to change this situation and to render the system of subsidies transparent, as well as to ensure that the overall allocation of funds to the recipients for whom it was intended can be monitored."
"The report also discusses the fact that the dispersed nature of islands considerably raises delivery costs, as does the absence of appropriate port infrastructures. It further states, correctly, that the level of subsidies must be stipulated in specific provisions in POSEI based on the difficulties to which the regions are subject and not on the fluctuating world prices of cereals (the drop in which has considerably reduced the level of subsidies, while the difficulties with which they must contend remain unchanged)."
"In this context, we naturally support the request for a reform of the POSEIMA programme regarding the supply of cereals, and urge that a fair mechanism for fixing cereal import subsidies should be introduced, and that inter-island transport costs should be clearly specified and quantified, as part of a series of amendments which should go hand-in-hand with the necessary allocation of the respective additional funding."
"This is the only way in which we can give substance to the formal recognition of the ultraperiferal status recently enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mr President, the Court of Auditors' Special Report contains several observations which are both interesting and startling."
"One of these, as several speakers have already mentioned, is that the flat-rate processing coefficients have not been changed for a full 24 years."
"How is this possible?"
"The Commission's reply leaves this question unanswered and suggests a serious omission on the part of the Commission."
"This omission has doubtless led to substantial additional costs for the EU through the years, which is more than regrettable."
"During the years 1991-1994, export refunds for cereals amounted to ECU 11 billion, a substantial sum."
"The Court of Auditors' observations have revealed several serious flaws and defects which mean that the system does not work satisfactorily."
"The same is true in the area of exported cereals."
"These flaws (it may even be a matter of out-and-out fraud within the sector) are encouraged so that payments of these export refunds become incorrect, which in turn leads to increased additional costs for the EU."
"It is absolutely essential that the Commission does something about this fact."
"Flawed control systems are also found in other areas, such as the much criticized POSEIMA scheme."
"As far as the malt sector is concerned, where the Court of Auditors has taken up the unsatisfactory application of the rules in France and the UK, the Green Group supports the rapporteur's call for the Commission to demand the return of the amounts which were unduly paid."
"In addition, I assume the Commission is going to change the rules in order to prevent a similar problem occurring in future."
"Finally, I would just like to draw the attention of my Swedish colleagues to the fact that there is a mistake in the report in paragraph 1, where it says in the Swedish version that Parliament regrets (beklagar) the flat-rate processing coefficients. It should actually say that Parliament deplores (beklagar djupt), which is a further sharpening of the text."
"Mr President, the Court of Auditors' report analyses a number of aspects of the importation and exportation of cereals, including the implementation of the export refunds mechanism in terms of administrative management and fraud."
"European agricultural producers have rightly emphasized the problems caused by special import systems for maize and sorghum in Spain and Portugal."
"In fact, these systems were established at the time of accession by those countries to the European Union and are still in force, and have even been consolidated within the framework of the GATT agreements."
"Two million tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum imported each year by Spain and 500 000 tonnes of maize imported by Portugal, mainly from the United States, are affected by the measure."
"As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has pointed out, it is necessary to prevent these imports from causing serious problems within the Community market, due to irregular commercialization."
"For example, it was observed recently that maize imported by Portugal under this system was being sold at a lower price than Community maize."
"These distortions cause cost price differentials for food processing manufacturers and can therefore lead to the relocation of food processing companies."
"Therefore, these zero-rated import quotas associated with the accession of Spain and Portugal, which the Commission has allowed to become institutionalized within the framework of GATT, not only benefit the United States to the detriment of European producers, but also cause distortions due to non-compliance with the rules of competition within the single market."
"Finally, I would like to highlight another real problem: the difficulties experienced by some operators when exporting their cereals."
"Paradoxically, in recent years the Commission has imposed European export taxes on cereals, although we subsidize farmers for obligatory fallowing."
"This year, at the beginning of the season, when world cereal prices were high, the Commission only granted export contracts in homeopathic doses."
"Since then, the market has fallen and the European Union is going to lose market shares because of the limitation of the volume of refunds."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, neither farmers nor manufacturers understand the logic of this, and I must admit that I myself do not find it very easy to follow."
"Mr President, for the EU taxpayer much of what this report contains must be really hard to swallow."
"The simple fact that with astronomical amounts of refunds, like ECU 11 million from 1991 to 1994, the quality of data submitted still leaves much to be desired, is a revelation that really must not be described as a problem but rather as a scandal!"
"The problems of the Common Agricultural Policy, with all its weaknesses and susceptibility to improprieties of all kinds, are highlighted once again."
"It is shocking that additional costs of ECU 9.3 million were incurred because Portugal buys large quantities of maize on the world market and then sells it on the Portuguese market at intervention prices, thereby giving the imported maize a considerable price advantage over that produced in the Community."
"Equally shocking is the fact that the conversion coefficients pertaining to the level of export refunds were not changed in the period from 1967 to 1991, and the fact that the export refunds for cereals are paid even though the Member States are not in a position to carry out physical checks."
"This contradicts the relevant regulations and proposals of the European Union."
"This report once again makes clear how necessary it is to reform the Common Agricultural Policy in terms of ecologization and renationalization, and above all to ensure that these drastically deplorable abuses are eliminated."
"Mr President, it is an undeniable fact that there has been malpractice in the area of grain export subsidies in the Union area."
"This is one of the cankers in our agricultural policy, quite apart from cases of malpractice in the meat trade."
"It is, for example, quite unbelievable that free market grain and intervention grain could have been stored together."
"As Mr Giansily's report suggests, we should look at the maize quotas for Spain and Portugal."
"It is obvious that imported maize is, at least in Portugal, being mixed with EU maize at considerable profit."
"The fault in the system does not end there but also crops up in Agenda 2000 negotiations."
"We obviously try to eliminate the possibility of malpractice there by making the cultivation of maize more profitable in the European Union area."
"When it is a matter of zero-sum games being played with agriculture in the EU or a spiralling dive to fund enlargement, we pass the problem of maize quotas in Agenda 2000 talks on to Finnish dairy farmers."
"It will not do."
"We cannot make our farmers pay for other people's abuse, Mr Fischler."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Special Report No 5, for the year 1997, from the European Court of Auditors deals with three particular problems."
"Firstly it considers the cereals trade and especially the question of guaranteed export refunds; secondly it deals with the import of maize and sorghum to Spain and Portugal; thirdly it concerns the supply of cereals under the POSEIMA programme."
"The Commission welcomes the Court of Auditors' report and also the rapporteur's proposed resolution, on which you will vote today."
"Even though the Commission does not share the Court of Auditors' opinion on all points, the report will nevertheless be of very valuable assistance to us in our efforts to improve the arrangements for the management of the cereals market, not least the improvement of monitoring."
"I think Parliament is justified in complaining about the fact that the flat-rate coefficients for the conversion of export refunds for processed products were not changed for 24 years."
"The Commission, however, places value on the statement that during this period it several times requested and suggested changes, but that this was on each occasion rejected by the Member States."
"Only when we updated the coefficients in 1991 did matters improve somewhat."
"In any case, it can be pointed out in the European Union's defence that our coefficients are stricter than those of our trading partners and competitors."
"In connection with the export refunds for malt and mixed fodder, the Court of Auditors indicated some differences and difficulties in the interpretation of regulations."
"In the Commission's view, these terms are intrinsically quite unambiguous."
"The problems which arose in two Member States with regard to the origin of exported malt have been solved in the meantime."
"As the Commission states in its response to the Special Report, the financial consequences are drawn in the context of the procedure for closing the accounts, which are necessary because of inadequate supervision of the applications for export refunds."
"The difficulties in the interpretation of the combined nomenclature for mixed fodder are being checked at the moment by the Commission's officials."
"We think that it will soon be possible to find a satisfactory solution."
"The Court of Auditors' findings in relation to physical inspection of exported cereals to a large extent concur with those of the Commission."
"I am pleased to be able to tell Parliament today that the committee on trading procedures is currently working on a consolidation of the basic refunds order, that is Order 3665/87."
"This should mean, as suggested by the Court of Auditors, that the rules governing the guarantee of export refunds are phrased considerably more strictly."
"The notice of export must in future be handed in at the point at which the goods are actually loaded."
"As regards inspection of the exports made by international firms, the Commission has in my view already given the Member States very clear instructions."
"We shall however pursue this matter even further."
"Finally, I would like to mention the fact that by the time we have presented proposals for the reform of the whole cereals sector, most of these rules will really be obsolete, because we would then, de facto, have to claim for hardly any export refunds for the export of cereals."
"However, the Court of Auditors also criticizes the special rule for the direct sale of maize on the world market for import to Portugal."
"The fact that part of these imports were arranged by the Portuguese interventions office is the result of a compromise reached in the Council in December 1993."
"I would not conceal from you the fact that the Commission was aware from the outset that this rule would lead to distortions."
"Because of this, and because of the Court of Auditors' comments, this regulation was not renewed in 1997."
"The rules for supplying regions on the extreme periphery under the POSEIMA programme are by their very nature difficult to implement."
"Nevertheless, the Commission regards them as necessary."
"It has therefore carefully noted the comments and recommendations from the Court of Auditors on the aid programme for supplying the Azores and Madeira with cereals."
"The aim will be to develop the programme further and very much more precisely, to adapt it to the needs of these actual regions."
"The Commission is striving to make progress here, within the parameters stipulated in the corresponding Council orders."
"The Commission is of course keeping to the September 1996 agreement between Parliament and the Commission on the comitology process, addressed in point 7 of the resolution."
"Certainly, the administrative committees sometimes work with very short deadlines."
"But the agendas and reports on the committee meetings always go automatically to Parliament, and in the meantime the reports of the meetings can also be called up on the Internet and are thus made accessible to a very wide public."
"Finally, I would like to inform you that the report you requested from Parliament on the consequences of the Court of Auditors' findings will be with you shortly so that it can be included in Parliament's formal acceptance of the statement of accounts."
"In conclusion, please allow me to say that this Special Report and its concerns are in my view a good example of how the Community bodies, namely the Court of Auditors, the Parliament and the Commission, can cooperate here in order to be able greatly to improve the implementation of various EU policies."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 6"
"Mr President, I did vote, but somebody has removed my card."
"I did not look, and I have no idea where my card has got to."
"My colleague can confirm this."
"I always sit here."
"I did vote."
"Firstly, I must remind you once again that votes on Friday are free."
"So you have no cause for concern."
"Secondly, the House will note that you have voted and, thirdly, I would like to know which way you are voting."
"So would you like to tell us how you are voting?"
"In favour?"
"Thank you."
"Mr President, for one thing I would just like to say that Mrs Mann is now experiencing something which has also happened to me, namely that on Friday the card was stolen."
"Also, I would like to respond to your comment by saying that Mrs Mann is certainly not sitting here because of the money."
"Mr Posselt, the House knows, because you have repeated it many times, that your card has been the target of wrongful removal."
"We hope you have recovered your voting card because I see you are ready to vote."
"You must be more careful now and look after it well, since you have seen that your card is obviously especially valuable."
"Mr President, it is just very specifically on what you have said, because you are the second Vice-President this morning who has referred to the different system."
"Mr Martin said that the roll-call votes on Friday did not count and you also have made a distinction."
"I wish you would make it very clear to the President and the Vice-Presidents that these votes count: they are very important indeed."
"Thank you, Mr McGowan, but if you had listened to me you would have heard that I did not say these votes do not count."
"I said the opposite, and you know I am always here every Friday to give them the value they deserve."
"Mr President, on the same lines, I was going to say that all of us here have heard what you say, but there is a group of Europeans above, who are quite young in fact, for whom I think you would need to clarify exactly what you wanted to say."
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, it means that on Fridays the votes have exactly the same importance as they do on any other day of the week. I thank Mr Fabra Vallés for asking me to explain this, and I am happy to do so."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"The rapporteur takes up much of the criticism which the Court of Auditors has directed against administrations in the above-mentioned matter."
"I think, however, that criticism could also have been taken up against the Spanish authorities (concerning the late reporting of the import of maize and sorghum) and against the management committees (concerning the lack of information about their activities)."
"However, I freely concede that this is an observation and not a major criticism."
"Mr President, we now have unanimous acceptance of a report in respect of which there were no amendments."
"We have spent seven minutes voting on this minor matter - this does not relate to the contents but to the number of amendments."
"I must say that this week it has been unbearable how we have had to proceed during the votes, with constant points of order in between."
"I have intentionally not registered during these interruptions to the order of business in order not to delay any further."
"However, in my capacity as one of the committee chairmen, who are of course responsible here for getting these resolutions through the House punctually, I must request most urgently that a tolerable solution is found in the Presidium now, as quickly as possible and certainly by the next plenary session, in order to eliminate these intolerable delays during the votes."
"Mr President, I would like to repeat the comment I made last night."
"As you rightly say, votes are as important on Friday as they are on Thursday."
"Yesterday evening, I pointed out that the bell announcing the votes was not working."
"The same thing happened this morning."
"The situation is even more serious because on Friday mornings the votes are extremely disjointed."
"May I ask you, Mr President, to take measures to ensure that the bell announcing the votes is working, otherwise voting is likely to be seriously disrupted."
"It would be a great shame if we could not hear anything when it is time to vote except mobile phones ringing."
"I would firstly like to say to you, Mrs Theato, that, luckily, Friday mornings are quiet and relaxed."
"So we can even slightly prolong the votes at times, because, as I say, Fridays are quiet, relaxed days with a pleasant atmosphere."
"I would also like to ask you to congratulate Mr Giansily on the favourable vote his report received, since it was voted for unanimously by the House."
"Participation of Poland and the Slovak Republic in Community training, youth and education programmes"
"The next item is the report (A4-0057/98) by Mrs Leperre-Verrier, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on"
"I.the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the Community position within the Association Council on the participation of Poland in Community programmes in the fields of training, youth and education (COM(97)0422 - C4-0628/97-97/0224(CNS)); II.the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the Community position within the Association Council on the participation of the Slovak Republic in Community programmes in the fields of training, youth and education (COM(97)0422 - C4-0629/97-97/0224(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the involvement of the central and eastern European countries in the education and youth programme is well under way."
"The proposal submitted to us by the Commission today is a perfect example of this, and we should be pleased to see Poland and the Slovak Republic join the ranks of the countries taking part in the Socrates, Leonardo and Youth for Europe programmes."
"Last July we gave the go-ahead for the involvement of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania."
"They were able to take advantage of the programmes during the 1997 financial year."
"It is now the turn of Poland and the Slovak Republic."
"I should like to say a few words about the origin of this decision."
"Further to the signature during 1996 of additional protocols with a number of CEECs, the Association Councils defined the method for these countries to participate in Community programmes."
"They decided to make education, training and youth the first link in the chain of actions undertaken."
"Other agreements should be signed at a later date in the areas of culture, the environment and health."
"This aim of this policy, defined at the Dublin Summit, is in particular to familiarize applicant countries with Community policies and procedures."
"So we cannot fail to be pleased that cooperation with regard to education and youth has been selected as a priority."
"It is true that these are essential for bringing people together and for the creation of European citizenship."
"Furthermore, exchanges in this field have been taking place for many years, and the three programmes in question were already able to support actions involving CEECs."
"Similarly, the Tempus programme set up in 1990 within the framework of Phare and Tacis has established the foundation of cooperation between universities."
"It is obvious that this process has been reinforced by the adoption of Agenda 2000 and the decisions of the Luxembourg Summit, which have brought these pre-accession procedures into the operational phase."
"In this respect, we can see that there is synergy not contradiction between the actions recommended in Agenda 2000 and the procedure adopted by the Association Councils."
"Furthermore, the choice of countries involved is in full compliance with the wish expressed by this House to avoid discrimination between applicant countries."
"So although not selected amongst the first countries, it has been possible for Romania yesterday and now the Slovak Republic to be amongst the associated countries."
"Under the terms of this agreement, Poland and the Slovak Republic can take part in all the actions falling within the scope of these three programmes."
"Furthermore, these two countries will be involved in the monitoring of their participation in these programmes, and will be invited to coordination meetings."
"However, they are responsible for setting up the national structures and mechanisms required for their participation."
"On a financial level, the complement to these countries' contributions which must be provided by the European Union has been included in the 1997 budget."
"This expenditure must be made without fail before 31 March, which explains the urgency of this debate."
"In addition, Poland has been offered the opportunity of using up to a maximum 10 % of its Phare allocation."
"Note that the financial contribution of the Member States must cover the grants and aid given to their participants, and that it is obvious that the cumulative amount of grants and aid received must not exceed the financial contribution paid."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a participation agreement is therefore signed between partners, not an aid contract."
"This is an extremely important point, because the CEECs have sometimes felt themselves to be like poor relations in their relationship with the European Union, and that at least is how it appears in the evaluation of the Tempus programme."
"It would therefore be a good thing to avoid that problem today."
"Although there are no major obstacles to the participation of Poland and the Slovak Republic in these programmes, and although - as we have emphasized - this process represents a major political step forward, some questions remain."
"The Leonardo, Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes, voted for under the codecision procedure, were set up during 1995."
"They are now almost coming to an end and because of this must be evaluated and redefined."
"We must be aware that these three programmes operate in synergy with other European Union actions in the field of education, training and youth."
"Article 126 of the Maastricht Treaty has given the European Union competence in this respect, and however limited, they are proof of a real determination to take action."
"So it can be stated that young people and their employment has become one of the main concerns of the European Union, and we can only regret the lack of accompanying measures as far as the signatory countries are concerned."
"Also, the problem of resources must be mentioned."
"Certainly the budget of the Socrates programme has been substantially increased thanks to the tenacity and efficiency of our colleague, Doris Pack, whom we should once again congratulate on her activities, but there is now a real demand for the education and youth programmes, to which it would be a pity not to respond."
"Secondly, there is a need to ask questions about the CEECs' needs with regard to education and training."
"Poland, like the Slovak Republic, cannot escape the need to adapt its educational system, not only in relation to the European Union, but also in the context of globalization and the development of the new technologies we are seeing today."
"These three programmes can provide answers and not inconsiderable help, but the nature of their activities is multi-directional, which means they do not have an obligation to respond to these objectives."
"Now the enlargement procedure, and its corollaries - the principles of free movement and mutual recognition of diplomas - presuppose real progress in education."
"Furthermore, the Commission itself has emphasized this in the opinions it has issued on these two countries' applications for accession."
"With regard to Poland, the Commission has highlighted that country's spectacular progress with regard to education, whilst observing that efforts still have to be made."
"In fact, we must recognize that Poland has allocated 16 % of its budget - that is 6.2 % of its GDP - to education, and aims to considerably increase the number of young people receiving secondary and university education, so that 20 % of 20-24 year olds in particular, can receive higher education."
"The Slovak Republic is developing a less aggressive strategy as only 3.2 % of its budget is allocated to education, that is approximately 1.5 % of its GDP."
"As well as the need to increase the number of secondary-school pupils and students here too, considerable efforts must be made to give minorities the same educational opportunities, and I am thinking of the Hungarian minority, in particular."
"That is why, in order to evaluate how involvement in our education and training programmes can help these countries to modernize their educational systems, I have recommended the creation of a specific steering committee."
"I know that the Commission is not really in favour of such a measure."
"However, I have to say, Mr Commissioner, that the answers I have received have not been entirely convincing, with regard to the refusal to set up an evaluation structure, and I must say I regret it."
"In fact, the enlargement process means that many bridges have to be crossed."
"Socrates, Leonardo, Youth for Europe are all steps in the right direction but, ladies and gentlemen, we still have a long way to go."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we decide to include Poland and the Slovak Republic in the Youth and Training Programme of the European Union, this is an important step."
"But this step is also a logical result if we want to go further down the road which we took with the decision to enlarge the European Union eastwards."
"Why?"
"A politically stable and peaceful Europe is the goal we have in our sights when we open our Community to the states of the former Eastern Bloc."
"We hope to achieve this goal by helping the future Member States strengthen their democratic structures and reinforce their economic power."
"But how can we achieve this?"
"Only by learning from each other; by exchanging experiences, knowledge, ideas and concepts; and by trusting each other."
"The more citizens of the Union are involved in this process of growing together, the more successful it will be."
"The younger the people are who take part in this process, the more deeply a feeling of belonging together can take root in their hearts, and the less susceptible the future Community will be to breaking up."
"The Leonardo, Socrates, and Youth for Europe programmes seek to prepare the ground for such a development."
"They help people to cross linguistic barriers, and encourage the transfer of training and the exchange of students, employees and young people in Europe."
"They work towards helping young people in existing and future Member States learn to conceive democratic values as worthy of protection."
"The Slovak Republic is not a member of the circle of countries which will initiate the eastwards expansion by their entry."
"The judgement that democratic culture in that country must make further progress has led to the postponement of its entry into the Community."
"The estimation, however, that the population of the Slovak Republic is open to further democratic development of its political system has led to our desire to see the participation of that people in our programmes."
"In July last year, the European Parliament had already decided to include the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania in the programmes."
"The Slovak Republic and Poland had to wait, since we first had to see whether we got additional Socrates resources."
"We have achieved this and so I am pleased today that after Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania, the Slovak Republic and Poland will come into our programmes."
"Thank you, Mrs Leperre-Verrier, for your fine contribution."
"Mr President, the involvement of Poland and the Slovak Republic in a joint action on training, youth and education, as proposed in the report by Mrs Leperre-Verrier, is a good thing."
"It is another small step on the historic road which will be taken with the European Conference at the end of March to make countries in central and eastern Europe full partners."
"In reality this is also a useful method to familiarize the candidate countries with the various policy areas and procedures within the Union."
"The choice of education, training and youth is a good one to start with and to gain experience, and the role of Commissioner van den Broek in this choice is to be applauded, because those who have youth have the future."
"A good basis for future cooperation with these countries can be found in the shared financial support for the relevant programmes, as well as the Phare programme."
"I can therefore be satisfied with the fact that the total sum of subsidies and other financial support will amount to no more than the financial contribution."
"It keeps matters neat, does not arouse excessive expectations, and can be monitored."
"But to my mind it is clear that the substance of this initiative far exceeds the financial limitations as far as the significance of the initiative is concerned."
"Poland and the Slovak Republic, like other countries in central and eastern Europe, will have problems adjusting their education systems, not only in relation to the Union, but also in the context of the new information technologies."
"On that front, the Member States often have barriers to overcome too."
"As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, I wanted to express my appreciation for the initiative, as the way the programmes is tackled offers a contribution to rapprochement between the Member States and the countries in central and eastern Europe."
"This is a strategic political goal which serves stability and peace in Europe. This is ultimately what our work here is meant to do."
"Mr President, I think this is one of the European Parliament's most important tasks: to strengthen the cooperation between the professions, youth, countries and people."
"So it is a good thing."
"Language training is a part of this process."
"It is important that consideration is given to the languages which exist in the EU today, but at the same time people should ensure that dialogue is developed with the central and eastern European languages, and that they get the same opportunities to develop as the current EU languages."
"As far as influence is concerned, I think both Poland and the Slovak Republic should be included from the start and should help decide the shaping of the programme."
"This is important because it is in fact an agreement which is being made between the EU and these countries, and means that these agreements will be financed approximately equally by the two countries and the EU."
"We should see this within the framework of the partnership between the Commission, the Slovak Republic and Poland."
"The programmes concerned here are mainly Leonardo, Socrates, Youth for Europe, Tempus and Phare."
"They should be implemented regardless of what happens with the negotiations - that is, however quickly or slowly they progress."
"However, I have an important point to add: namely, I think it needs to be very clear that the programme should not only be about a one-sided adaptation to the EU's institutions, to our approach, our level of training and our training requirements, but it should be a versatile, mutual exchange between the EU and the countries which have now applied for membership."
"Only then will these programmes be good."
"So the EU should not appear as some kind of big brother, but should always recognize that this is a dialogue between independent countries which have reached an agreement."
"Under these conditions this will be good, and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports this proposal."
"Mr President, Community training and education programmes are of the utmost importance."
"I therefore welcome this report on Poland and the Slovak Republic."
"If you want to contribute to increased youth exchange over national borders and contribute to young people learning more about other cultures, traditions and countries, these programmes are a good start."
"The Green Group is therefore going to support this report."
"Personally, however, I have two observations to make."
"Firstly, I do not think the Youth for Europe programme should be included in this agreement."
"It is not an educational or training programme, but rather a one-sided propaganda organization."
"That is the case in Sweden."
"So I think it should not be included as a part of the agreement."
"Secondly, I think that in a spirit of solidarity the EU should pay for the larger share of the costs of these agreements, because the part of Europe in which we find ourselves is very well-off compared with both Poland and the Slovak Republic, where there are shortages of many things."
"If we are serious about support for central and eastern Europe, we should also pay for the main costs in this politically important area."
"Mr President, we vote in favour of this report, although I regard it as unnecessary automatically to attach the label of eastwards expansion to every sensible measure concerning our eastern neighbours."
"I consider it important to emphasize that it is a matter of an agreement on participation between partners, and not a treaty on guaranteeing aid."
"From my own experience I know that Austria's neighbouring country, the Slovak Republic, is especially very unhappy to be treated as a recipient of aid."
"I am genuinely pleased that the rapporteur also deals in her statement with the very worrying situation of children in these countries."
"It is particularly the children there who represent the population sector most at risk."
"The UNICEF Report discussed last year by the European Parliament put this very forcefully and provided proof."
"Socrates and Youth for Europe should therefore be used very specifically to improve the prospects and quality of life of children."
"The most intensive cooperation between the educational institutions and the improvement of training systems will certainly contribute to the realization of the enormous intellectual and educational potential of Poland and the Slovak Republic, and ultimately of the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, I also thank Mrs Leperre-Verrier for her excellent report."
"My group welcomes this report and the gradual opening of the programmes to the countries of central and eastern Europe prior to the entry of these countries."
"Most of all, this represents another real door being flung wide open for young people to gain new experiences."
"However, these programmes also offer the opportunity to exchange experiences in education and careers and to initiate an innovative dialogue, for these countries have something to offer us too."
"So the principle of ""Learn Your Neighbour's Language' does not just apply to the countries of western Europe, but it must also apply to our eastern neighbours."
"This money is very well spent. The transfer of knowledge and experience takes place nowhere more effectively than through personal experience and residence in the other country, and I very much hope that personal meetings eliminate prejudices which unfortunately exist today or are being preserved as in the olden days."
"I could imagine that educational cooperation will one day lead to common teaching materials - perhaps even to a common European history book."
"Mr President, I would very much like to join in the dance of those who are thanking Mrs Leperre-Verrier for the report and the work which she has done here."
"One must indeed point out that this report belongs in a greater context."
"Everything started with a report by Mr Posselt who at the time said that these reports must be extended to all the central and eastern European countries."
"This is also worth mentioning, and very important."
"We need only imagine the terribly short time available to these countries of central and eastern Europe, who were held back for so many decades under a Communist yoke, for making their short dash to catch up. They are doing it in a really great way, inspiring us with enthusiasm."
"One of the great philosophers of our century, the Dalai Lama, was once asked how he came to terms with the fact that there was still so much destruction and annihilation in the world - especially in his own country. ""At the moment we cannot do anything about it' , he said."
"Really he is a very positive person indeed, and all his listeners were astonished."
"Then he looked up and said, ""Yes, but there is a possibility: we must win over the young people, for he who wins over the young people, to him will also belong the future.'"
"This report turns to the young people - in this case in Poland and the Slovak Republic, previously (in fact last year) in Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic. If we win over the young people in these countries then the future of Europe belongs to them, which is what we want for them."
"It is our task to show and suggest to these young people our European values, granted to us by 50 years of peace which have provided us with great prosperity, a great epoch, so that they can accept them of their own free will."
"This report helps this to be achieved."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank Mrs Leperre-Verrier for putting together this balanced report."
"The European Union education and youth programmes are crucially important channels for improving European integration at the level of the people and bringing eastern and western Europe together."
"The experience that individual citizens, students and people doing research derive from multi-cultural colleges throughout Europe is far more valuable than any of the diverse proposals for projects from the Commission with the name of Citizens' Europe."
"It is vital to stress that the problems of cooperation in education between the present EU Member States and the applicant countries will not be solved merely by increasing funding."
"Although, for example, the Socrates programme funding has been increased for the next round of funding, the money will certainly not be enough even for the needs of the internal programmes of the present Member States."
"So the greatest challenge rests with the applicant countries."
"They themselves must be able to modernize and adapt their educational systems and colleges so that they can guarantee the quality of their exchange programmes regarding course content, administration and the external aspect."
"Practice has shown that facilities for foreigners studying in many eastern European countries are still very borderline."
"To take just one example, I am afraid I can cite the University of Tartu in Estonia, where Finns studying there have already taken the university authorities to court right in the middle of term over massive fee increases."
"Funding foreign students has no part in the exchange programmes."
"Countries preparing for EU membership have to grasp this notion."
"The exchange programmes rely on reciprocity, which cannot in all reason be based on decisions made in court."
"There is therefore much scope for improvement."
"Mr President, Karl Habsburg-Lothringen kindly mentioned that I am, as it were, the grandfather of this report, because I had the honour at that time of presenting here in Parliament the supplementary protocols relating to the association agreements."
"I believe the report on which we are voting today is a significant step forward."
"Firstly, it deals with the cultural and linguistic diversity in present-day Europe and in the future EU."
"I am very grateful that the regional and minority languages, the Slavonic languages and Hungarian are given appropriate dignity in this report."
"Secondly I am happy that this report is a step towards greater partnership."
"We have grown accustomed to a certain arrogant paternalism vis-a-vis the candidates for entry in central and eastern Europe and it is the amendments which were put forward today which bear witness to a great spirit of partnership."
"Quite simply, we are seeing here the future Member States."
"In this connection I would like to take issue with Mr Lukas, for I am of the opinion that he should campaign energetically in his own country for eastwards enlargement."
"Thirdly, I would like to say that in this report we are considering two countries which are particularly important to us: Poland and the Slovak Republic, which are closely linked together by their great histories and culture."
"The Slovak Republic is in fact in danger of being isolated."
"I have spoken with the President of the Slovak Rectors' Conference, Professor Stern, who fears that because of the politics in his country which we have justly criticized, the people themselves are isolated, the educational institutions are isolated, and the students, young scientists and specialist workers are isolated."
"We must work against this."
"We should place a financial emphasis on the Slovak Republic, for none of the associated states requires our support as urgently as the Slovak Republic, which is a profoundly central European country."
"That is why I welcome this report and the emphasis it places on Poland and the Slovak Republic."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research, infrastructure and education are the bases for success for an eco-social market economy, for success, for employment."
"So I welcome these programmes."
"We members of the eastwards enlargement delegations did in fact have some very intensive discussions in the last week in Strasbourg with Commissioner van den Broek, and we made it clear that we particularly welcome the importance of this European agreement to include the central and eastern European states."
"Of course, this applies especially to cooperation in the realm of education."
"I would also like to emphasize, like the previous speaker Mr Posselt, that this is of very special significance for the aspect of integration, particularly from the time when the political situation in that country makes entry possible."
"It is a well-known fact that the deadline for applications for the office of President expires today at 4 p.m. and the President is likely to be elected on 5 March."
"It is interesting that President Kovac has applied, and that he will also arrange the referendum decided by the Constitutional Court."
"So at the moment a very interesting development is unfolding in the Slovak Republic."
"Precisely for that reason, we must do everything we can to give valuable assistance for this rapprochement."
"Of course, many adaptations can be made from the outset."
"Immediate integration into the Community's programmes should also be an expression of a strengthened introductory strategy."
"The treaties of association with those countries which wish to join must be strengthened immediately, particularly with regard to the Slovak Republic."
"The fact that we commence with cooperation in the fields of education and youth is not only to be welcomed but also well thought out."
"I agree with the rapporteur: a common future in a common house called Europe can only be constructed in cooperation with young people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all sincere thanks to the rapporteur Mrs Leperre-Verrier, and sincere thanks also to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media for their cooperative attitude and extremely rapid procedure in this matter."
"On the eve of the opening of negotiations for entry, the Governments and people of the central and eastern European countries and the Member States displayed a perceptibly heightened degree of sensitivity and receptiveness towards this matter."
"As we have recently seen from the Luxembourg conclusions, participation in these programmes offers the central and eastern European countries the possibility of becoming familiar with the policies and instruments of the Community, not only on a political and administrative level but also on a much-quoted basis."
"Many students, teachers, young people, professors and freelance workers will thus have an opportunity to make connections, via networks with their colleagues in the Member States."
"Such exchange is really extremely important for the consolidation of democracy, which is of special significance, particularly in the case of the Slovak Republic."
"The concrete fulfilment of the promise made so long ago regarding participation in these programmes is highly valued amongst the Governments and the future promoters of projects."
"Moreover, participation in Community programmes in general but particularly in the spheres of general and professional education will contribute significantly to the institutional structures in the applicant countries."
"The central and eastern European countries accord participation in these programmes a high priority. They include an appropriate level of resources in their education budgets, and make them available."
"Also, in the strengthened introductory strategies special emphasis is placed on the opening up of these Community programmes."
"The European Parliament inspired the opening up of Community programmes for these countries, even before the European Council decided this in 1993."
"It also supported the conclusion of supplementary protocols for the European agreements."
"It is now called upon to permit the rapid passage of Association Council resolutions, and thereby allow the selection of the first projects on which partners from these two applicant countries can cooperate even before the summer."
"As far as the last amendment is concerned, I would like to say that we completely agree that there should be a follow-up in relation to participation in these programmes."
"But this should take place within the existing structures, particularly because this is the only way we can guarantee that we remain coherent and that we treat all central and eastern European countries equally."
"I would like once again to thank sincerely the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and the rapporteur for her work and flexibility, and above all for the fact that we have come so quickly to the first reading of this report, and that this furthermore has operated so smoothly."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, I am sorry, I have no wish to hold things up, but I see from repeated readings of Amendments Nos 3 and 8 - the text is the same for both countries- that a slight error has crept in."
"It says there that some of these languages already enjoy the status of official languages within the EU and it mentions, for example, Slovene in Carinthia, Styria and Italy."
"That is unfortunately not true."
"I would therefore request as an oral amendment that the following is written in instead: ""also enjoy the status of an officially recognized regional language within the EU, for example Slovene in Austria and Italy' ."
"The expression ""officially recognized regional language' is correct, but not ""official language.'"
"Thank you very much, Mr Posselt."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to know Mrs Leperre-Verrier's opinion."
"Can you tell us what you think of this oral amendment?"
"Mr President, I would like to say that I am in complete agreement with the proposal which has just been made, which is of course in the form of an oral amendment, as the deadline for tabling amendments has now elapsed."
"Is anyone opposed to this oral amendment?"
"No."
"(During successive votes, Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions)"
"We think the message in the report is very positive."
"We regret, however, that the Council is not allocating sufficient resources."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have completed the agenda. I would like to express our sincere thanks to Parliament's services, the ushers, the interpreters and the Bureau services, not just as a formality but because they deserve it."
"Before taking my leave, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say that I am sure that if you have had a chance to stroll through this beautiful and hospitable city, in spite of how much work we have, you will have noticed the first somewhat premature signs of spring and revitalization. The trees are covered in buds which are about to explode."
"I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that those are the only explosions we hear over the next few weeks."
"In other words, I hope the visit by the UN Secretary General bears fruit, that rationality prevails over irrationality and that good fellowship imposes itself on the confrontation - in other words, that peace wins over war."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you have a good journey and that when we meet again next month, those from the most northerly regions will tell us that the thaw has taken place, and that we will all have seen thousands of leaves explode in peace and harmony ."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.35 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 20 February 1998."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Friday, 20 February 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to go back to the discussion on crime in Brussels which we kept having in the course of the last part-session."
"Assurances were given by the Presidency that appropriate talks would take place with the various offices in Brussels that might actually be able to do something about this."
"We would be grateful if the House could be informed as to what sort of talks have taken place and what results these have produced."
"Last week two more Members of Parliament, namely Mrs Pack and Mr Schiedermeier, were attacked."
"I know about these two attacks but perhaps it has also happened to many more people."
"It would not be an understatement to say today that this is an intolerable situation. We have long since exceeded the level of what is acceptable."
"I would be very grateful if this House could receive more information from the Presidency as to what is actually happening in these cases and what we can do to really increase safety in Brussels."
"I would like to point out to all the Members that there is an oral motion available for signature and would ask them to sign it so that something can be actively done to combat this criminal behaviour in Brussels."
"Thank you very much."
"As you will appreciate, that matter does not relate to the Minutes, nor is it a suitable subject for debate here and now."
"I will be very happy to inform you in writing of the steps we are already taking with the Belgian authorities to guarantee security, as far as possible, in the vicinity of the European Parliament buildings, since Brussels is a very big place."
"Mr President, I refer to Friday's Minutes, where you wrote in a letter to me: ' rest assured that I share your concern and shall do my utmost with the Belgian authorities to find a satisfactory solution where the safety of the Members and staff of the European Parliament is concerned.'"
"I would also like to state that I have completed a survey of my own."
"A colleague of mine was in over 300 offices, in more than half the offices of Members of the European Parliament."
"She told me that exactly one third of the offices had given accounts of criminal incidents in Brussels."
"I would also like to inform you that the perpetrators of the attack against my assistant were apprehended and appeared in a line-up this week."
"I therefore thank you for your efforts in this area!"
"Thank you very much, Mr Rübig."
"I would refer you to the answer I have just given Mr Habsburg-Lothringen."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, unfortunately, at the opening of almost every Parliament sitting, you are called upon to express the Chamber's grief over the victims of despicable terrorist attacks."
"Only a few days ago, a Catholic and a Protestant fell victim to the fanaticism that uses the language of arms instead of ideas."
"Recently, in a declaration made by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the French government declared its intention not to grant the extradition, requested by Italy under the Schengen agreements, of 200 Italian terrorist refugees in France after the lead wars that caused so much grief for Italy."
"This refusal can be interpreted as indirect encouragement of the impunity and immunity of the terrorists of yesterday, today and tomorrow."
"At the moment, France also risks coming within the terrorists' sight..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Tatarella, the European Parliament is not competent to deal with questions of extradition law between Member States."
"Furthermore, you have exceeded the time of one minute allowed for these matters."
"Mr President, last Friday there was a disastrous train crash in Finland in which ten people died and almost forty were injured."
"On behalf of the Finnish delegation from the Group of the European People's Party I would respectfully ask that you, Mr President, on behalf of Parliament, might express a few words of sympathy and consolation."
"It will be done."
"Resignation of a Vice-President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that Mr Capucho has written to inform me that he wishes to resign from his position as Vice-President of Parliament, with effect from 10 March 1998."
"I would like to thank Mr Capucho for his work throughout his vice-presidency."
"The deadline for tabling candidacies for the vacant post of Vice-President is 6.00 p.m. today."
"The election will be held on Wednesday, at 11.30 a.m."
"Order of business"
"The report (A4-0073/98) by Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on negotiations in the framework of the OECD on a multilateral agreement on investments (MAI), should be taken at 4.00 p.m. so that the Commissioner concerned can take part."
"The PSE Group and the PPE Group support this proposal."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"The PPE Group requests that the debate on the report (A4-65/98) by Mr Cornelissen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on road safety in the European Union, which was originally scheduled for Wednesday, should be reinstated on the agenda for Tuesday, before the other three reports from the Committee on Transport by Mr Watts, Mr Novo Belenguer and Mr Bazin respectively, so that the Commissioner responsible can take part."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Wednesday:"
"I would remind you that Mr Cornelissen's report has been added to the agenda for Tuesday."
"Thursday: no changes."
"Friday:"
"The ARE Group has requested that Mr Cunha's report, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission's annual report to the Council and the European Parliament on the results of the multiannual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets at the end of 1996, be taken off the agenda."
"Mr President, I rise to support this request, not just because the issue is important but because this Parliament is in danger of making a fool of itself by saying that Friday votes are not important."
"We have a report from my good friend Mr Cunha which I think makes some fundamental mistakes, and in particular challenges the legal base of the common fisheries policy in an own-initiative report."
"There is no other mechanism for challenging this and I believe it has to be dealt with by Parliament as a whole."
"I would therefore move that we postpone this report until we can be sure of a full House, which, as you know, is not the case on a Friday."
"I note that the Commissioner for fisheries is here."
"I hope she will take note of this, because it is an important point."
"If this Parliament were to give the impression that it does not care about the Treaty basis of the common fisheries policy, that would be a terrible signal to send out to the industry and to the Commission."
"I beg to move."
"Mr President, we have discussed this report sufficiently within the Committee on Fisheries; we are convinced that Parliament should give its opinion now, and so we fail to understand the reasons for a postponement."
"Mr President, I would like to rise in support of Mr Macartney."
"All too often this Parliament and those who arrange its agenda seem to put fisheries debates on a Friday."
"It is time that was ended."
"This is a very important report and fisheries are extremely important to the regions of this Community."
"I would agree with and support Mr Macartney on this issue."
"I put the ARE Group's request to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal)"
"Mr President, I asked for the floor earlier to raise two issues."
"With regard to the statement on Kosovo on our agenda for Wednesday, the contact group is meeting this evening to discuss the situation."
"I wonder therefore if we could have an extension of the deadline for the submission of resolutions until midday tomorrow, which would allow us to take into account the outcome of that meeting."
"That is my first request on behalf of my group."
"Secondly my group has informed you that we would like to vote in the plenary on removing from the agenda the oral question on the Mediterranean programme which was scheduled for Friday."
"I gave notice of this in the Conference of Presidents last week."
"As I said in the Conference of Presidents, the Budgetary Control Committee of this House is dealing with exactly the issues raised in this oral question."
"It seems entirely incongruous that certain groups are raising it in exactly the same way on the floor of this House before the Committee has completed its deliberations."
"My group would like it to be removed from the agenda for this week."
"If the plenary decides not to support that view - although I very much hope it will - it is my group's view that this is a very important and sensitive political issue and I would like to ask that the gentlemen's agreement on taking such issues on a Friday morning should be adhered to and the vote be held at a later date."
"Thank you, Mrs Green."
"On your first point, the services say that it is perfectly possible to hold over the deadline for resolutions until noon tomorrow."
"Mr President, as Mrs Green said, the matter is still pending and has not been finalized by the Committee on Budgetary Control yet."
"We therefore think it is quite inappropriate that it should be raised as an oral question in the meantime."
"We know that during the most recent sitting there was a disagreement between Mrs Fabra Vallés and the Commissioner, who, we should add, gave a rather crude reply, but that should be no reason to devote a rushed debate to it here on Friday morning."
"We request that the matter be completed by the Committee on Budgetary Control, and not hastily on a Friday morning amongst other things which have nothing to do with the core of the issue."
"Mr President, I fully agree that this is an important matter."
"But it is also important for Parliament to come to some decision about the way we are being blamed."
"When the Commissioner appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Control, he blamed Parliament for blocking the MED programmes."
"The following day, on the 26, a DirectorGeneral spoke at a MED-MEDA conference and in front of twelve ambassadors from the Mediterranean zone he said that the European Parliament was responsible for the fact that the MEDA programmes were blocked."
"In the evening of that same day, in Madrid, the Turkish Ambassador took me to task, as a Member of the European Parliament, because he thought we were responsible for having blocked the MED programmes."
"All we are trying to do with this question is make it quite clear that Parliament is not responsible, and that is why I think it is urgent."
"The responsibility lies with the Commissioner, who has been blocking the programmes since 17 July."
"So we cannot accept that we are responsible for blocking the MED programmes. The reputation of this House is at stake."
"Mr President, I hope Mr Fabra Vallés made that case to the Turkish Ambassador and others who raised the issue with him."
"We can deal with this issue in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"There is no reason why that cannot be dealt with there."
"It is as much a..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the item stays on the agenda we agree that we should not vote on Friday, but at a later date."
"I would like to add that I do not really understand why this cannot be discussed in a democratic Parliament, even though it is a sensitive issue."
"A democratic Parliament is in essence a place where difficult and sensitive matters can be discussed."
"We submitted an oral question and we wish to hold a debate."
"We are calling on Parliament to give us this opportunity, but we are prepared to vote on it at a later date."
"I put the request from the PSE and GUE/NGL Groups to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Women's rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following statement and oral question:"
"statement by the Commission on International Women's Day and the violation of women's rights; -oral question (B4-0177/98 - O-0044/98/rev.) by Mrs van Dijk, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, to the Commission, on International Women's Day - 8 March 1998: combating violations of women's rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr van Dijk rightly recalled, yesterday was International Women's Day."
"The Commission fully shares the analysis made and the statement that women's rights form an integral, inalienable and essential part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Women's rights are human rights and I believe that, based on this statement, the Commission should follow the Beijing Conference with a whole series of initiatives I would like to mention."
"Mr van Dijk will allow me to begin this brief speech by thanking the European Parliament for the idea, expressed in its resolution passed on 23 October, to dedicate 8 March to the women of Kabul, a symbol of the violations and discrimination that are still present in many parts of the world."
"I would like to point out that this is a very special case, particularly because the women of Kabul have had great difficulties, at least in the urban areas, and certainly that of Kabul, which has been at war for 20 years and is therefore in a very difficult situation, particularly for the civilian population and for women and children, obtaining a series of rights, including freedom of the veil, as long ago as 1960, and university entrance, and played a more active part in society, as teachers, doctors, nurses, midwives, perhaps because the male population has been primarily engaged in war for 20 years."
"Whatever the reasons, women in Kabul and in other urban areas played the more active part."
"Unexpectedly, these rights have been lost and denied in 24 hours, and not on account of religion as far as I know."
"I would like to point out that religion has nothing to do with this situation because it was actually a question of making the obsessions of one person into law."
"However, as the Moslems taking part in this campaign did not fail to point out, neither religion nor Islam, nor the Pushtu traditions of these women was in dispute."
"One positive factor, I believe, is that, starting from an idea put forward by the European Parliament, supported by the Commission, and particularly by the Office for Humanitarian Aid, women of all religions, cultures and leanings have come out throughout Europe, but also in Sarajevo, in the African countries, in the USA and in Japan, to say ""no' to this step backward we have just witnessed."
"I think we should be pleased that, for once, they are in favour of an idea put forward by Europe and the European Parliament, contrary to the statements we usually here, when public opinion protests against the initiatives taken by a European political institution, whether it be the Commission, the Council or the Parliament."
"We are also too accustomed to seeing our citizens come out against the European initiatives and, for once, I think it should be pointed out that citizens, and women in particular, have come out to declare themselves in favour of an idea first put forward by the European Parliament."
"With regard to your question, I think several points should be made: it should be stated very clearly that violation may take various forms, that exclusion from political participation, from education and from employment are violations of human rights, that physical violence and harmful and cruel practices are a violation of human rights because they are detrimental to the most fundamental human rights, and to reaffirm that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the main objectives of the Commission's policy, both in internal policies and in the policies applied to third countries, starting with Community cooperation in development."
"A series of initiatives has been taken and has been supported by the Commission within the scope of the action platform stemming from the Beijing Conference and from the Council Resolution of 20 December 1995."
"To fulfil this commitment, the Commission is exercising its political influence where it may be a means of ensuring respect for women's rights, it can and does invoke the human rights' clauses included in its cooperation agreements, subjecting official cooperation to respect for fundamental women's rights, it is endeavouring to introduce the dimension of equality into its policies, particularly in its development activities, with regard to strategies, programmes and projects, adopting laws such as the draft Council Regulation on the integration of the man/woman theme, as well as appropriate administrative procedures."
"The Commission is also taking positive action, for example by helping the partner countries prepare to implement their national plans stemming from the Beijing Conference through the UNIFEM in the Mediterranean countries, and by preparing an observatory on equal opportunities policy for Africa, which should be based on Ethiopia."
"The Commission is contributing towards improving the situation of women by supporting non-governmental organizations and citizens' groups promoting human rights, working for full participation in political, economic and social development in their countries, and is seeking to foster an improvement in the condition of women in various sectors, incorporating this policy into the projects of the ACP countries."
"The Commission is also financing micro-credits for women, awareness campaigns on the role of and relations between men and women, and the Beijing Conference action platform."
"I think it would be useful to draw up a detailed written list of the programs, their financing and their state of implementation. There are too many to list them all in detail here, but I believe in particular that this equal opportunities policy should be a transverse policy, present in all Union policies, both internal and external."
"The policy on women is not separate, it is not completely isolated, but, according to the Commission, it should be the inspiration of all its own policies."
"I would also like to recall that the Commission will note the conclusions of the Committee meeting at the United Nations to monitor post-Beijing actions, which still has one week's work."
"The Commission therefore reserves the right to take the idea from the conclusions reached by this Consultative Committee and be able to implement any suggestions and specific measures deriving from it."
"Mr President, Mrs Bonino, thank you for the campaign you initiated on behalf of the women of Kabul."
"It was in Copenhagen in 1911 that the first International Women's Day was proclaimed by the International Conference of Socialist Women, as a day of action for the rights of women."
"There had already been some initial success: women in Scandinavia had won the right to vote, although other countries had still to wait for this."
"We broke into a male preserve - politics."
"Step by step, we women fought for access to university education and parliamentary representation."
"At management level, however, in business, the media and leading social positions, we have remained largely on the periphery."
"Despite four world conferences on women's rights, the list of inequalities and discrimination against women is a long one."
"Every year on 8 March, we train the world's spotlight on it."
"This year, International Women's Day focused on the flagrant violations of women's rights by fundamentalist regimes and movements, and thousands of events sought to highlight these violations."
"Afghanistan and Algeria in particular were cited."
"We debated this in the last part-session, adopted a resolution and your campaign is now off the ground."
"However, offences against women are being recorded everywhere."
"As socialists, we must speak out against events such as this, for instance the fact that yesterday in Istanbul women who demonstrated were deprived of their right to speak and dispersed with tear gas."
"In our compromise resolution, we have summarized the most urgent demands for women, and I shall not grow tired of calling for women's rights to be seen as an indivisible, integral part of universal human rights, which means there are obligations in this respect for the EU and our Member States."
"The platform for action negotiated in Beijing now needs to be implemented, and I should like to say on behalf of my group that we will insist that a woman's right of self-determination in relation to her body is at the top of the agenda."
"We must demand the sexual self-determination of women and their right to decide when and how many children they will have."
"That is the unique right of every woman."
"Genital mutilation is one of the most abhorrent violations of this right of self-determination, and we must do everything to ensure that, firstly, this does not occur in the European Union and that, secondly, this inhuman practice is brought to an end as far as possible globally."
"We sometimes appear to have made greater progress in developing women's rights in Europe than other regions have."
"We have had to fight hard for all these advances, and there is still a lot to be done."
"Where, for instance, have we ensured in the Union that we are paid the same for identical and equal work?"
"Nowhere in Europe!"
"And where in Europe has male violence towards women been eradicated?"
"Nowhere!"
"Male violence towards women is a phenomenon which, according to Union-wide independent studies, will befall every third or fourth woman once in her life."
"That is why I most urgently appeal again to the Commission and the Council and call upon them to act."
"1999 needs to be declared European Year against Violence towards Women, and it must, as Mrs Bonino has explained, be launched as a Union-wide campaign of zero tolerance towards violence within the Union."
"We will need to have requested this ruling in the Council of Ministers and have implemented it by 30 June, or else the deadline will have passed."
"Budgetary or other reasons should not be allowed to get in the way where the well-being of our women and children are concerned."
"The European Parliament has sided with the oppressed."
"We should not remain silent."
"As long as equality between men and women is not a universal reality, democracy will not really be in force."
"Mr President, every year we celebrate Women's Day and every year we come to the same sad conclusion that equality, if it exists and where it exists, concerns a minority of women in the world."
"For the majority of women even the most basic human rights are an unattainable goal, for the simple reason that they were born women."
"This year we decided to dedicate Women's Day to those women who are oppressed by religious fundamentalism."
"It is therefore not by chance that we should be paying particular attention to the unprecedented oppression that is taking place in Afghanistan: the women held by the Taliban are in the worst position of all."
"For this reason, the initiative of the Commission is worthy of our congratulations."
"Mrs Bonino also deserves our congratulations for the very fine poster she produced for the occasion."
"We spoke at length about these women during the previous part-session."
"Bearing in mind their hardship and the fact that we must never cease in our efforts to help them, we must not forget that a great deal still needs to be done for the women who live in more developed societies, where religious fanaticism, imported or not, is nevertheless very real."
"In addition to this fanaticism, the exploitation of women by international crime networks and the violation of basic human rights against women who, for a variety of reasons, are more vulnerable and unprotected than others, are events which still occur throughout the world, and we must not forget, in my opinion, those regions of our planet where women are not allowed to go on living, simply in order to solve the problem of overpopulation."
"There are very many women for us to think about today."
"We must think about the women who have become refugees of the recent wars."
"We must think about the women who are threatened by exclusion, by unemployment and by poverty, and all those women who are unfortunate enough to be treated as unequal."
"We must continue to demand again and again, perhaps monotonously, what is self-evident to all, that is, basic human rights, which are women's rights too."
"Mr President, women's rights are human rights, and therefore universal rights, and all women derive rights from these, whether they live on European Union territory or not, and whether they are Member State nationals or not."
"The international community, including the European Union, has made moving statements about this."
"But what can and must we, the European Union, the Commission, the Council and the Member States do to actually implement these paper tigers, these paper rights, these statements of principles?"
"My group, the Liberal group, is presently focusing its attention on nonEuropean Union nationals."
"Firstly, as regards non-European women living in the European Union, I think it is essential that the Commission and the Member States pursue a much more active and much more accessible education and information policy on what their rights are."
"These non-European women who live within the European Union must be actively supported in putting their rights into practice."
"This means a ban on sexual mutilation in Europe and the enforcement of this ban, but it also means that they should receive the same treatment Member State women are entitled to, and that these rights should be asserted in all areas."
"Secondly, in terms of the many millions of women outside the European Union whose human rights are being violated, Mrs Bonino, what would the Commission do without you?"
"I need say no more, we totally support your initiative. The women of Kabul are a metaphor for all countries in which human rights are violated."
"International political pressure is needed, in particular towards the fundamentalist regimes, and, Mrs van Dijk, it is not just to do with clothes, that is too narrow a view, nor is it to do with the Koran, it is to do with the interpretation of the Koran."
"The Commission, as Mrs Bonino pointed out, must use its powers much more consistently."
"You would like to do so, but we would like the entire Commission to be permanently behind it."
"This means consciously and critically putting to the test the human rights clause in the association agreements, and to draw the necessary conclusions from this."
"The same goes for development cooperation."
"Mrs Bonino would support this, but I would like the entire Commission to do the same."
"I think Mrs Bonino could use a great deal of support from Parliament to turn fine words into practice, so that human rights are actively asserted, both in association agreements and in development cooperation, otherwise we will just keep on talking and no one will take the slightest notice of what we are saying."
"Mr President, Mrs Bonino, I am very pleased that you are here today because we have a lot to thank you for. Your work helped to ensure that all of us in the European institutions had a very positive, very active attitude towards the celebrations on 8 March, and that the public all realized that the denial of rights to women in Afghanistan is a denial of rights to all the women of the world."
"Anyway, I wanted to say that here in the European institutions we are still experiencing difficulties and this year, once again, we are seeing that the problems suffered by women in matters relating to work still amount to a lack of rights. Furthermore, domestic violence continues to be a blot on our society, which also merits some self-criticism."
"Since I have barely a minute's speaking time, I especially wanted to say to you, to the Committee on Women's Rights and to all the Members of the European Parliament, both male and female, that we should work to make 1999 the year against violence against women."
"Because if, by commemorating a single day, the European institutions have made society come to that realization and support us in our defence of women's rights, then I think there will also be a lot of public support if we manage to designate 1999 as the year against violence against women."
"Since we need to keep on fighting, that is an appropriate objective."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to say how pleased I am that after all these years Women's Day has taken on a real importance; this is an important step forward from some time ago."
"Remember the half smiles, the scepticism, the derision with which it was greeted back then."
"Have those working women won at last who, on a certain March 8, marked in history with their sweat and blood the day to day fight of women?"
"Unfortunately, despite obvious advances and considerable efforts, we note the inadequacy of the results so far which, in come cases, are the exact opposite of what we were hoping for."
"Sadly, there is a long and familiar list of the ill-treatment to which women are subjected nowadays."
"The European Union must continue to fight on a daily basis for the respect of the equality of rights, even within its own territory. This is why my group strongly supports the compromise resolution which has been presented today."
"I think we ought to use Women's Day to place the emphasis on the fight of some women who are particularly in need of our active support."
"Here I am referring especially to the women in Afghanistan. In this respect, I would like to pay tribute to and thank you for the remarkable work which you, Commissioner, are leading on behalf of the women of this country to restore their fundamental rights."
"I would also include Algerian women and their exemplary fight, and I do not want to forget the women of Kosovo, who came out into the streets yesterday to protest against the repression which they are suffering at present."
"In addition, allow me this display of chauvinism in paying tribute to the Corsican women who rose up with courage and dignity against the terrorism which is still rife in that region."
"There too, the women expressed the need for enlightenment, hope and freedom, which are as universal as human rights which, as everyone knows also encompass women's rights."
"I have received six motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, women are the victims of many forms of violence, either invisible and silent, through pressures, threats or dependence, or glaring forms of violation, aggression and total oppression."
"There is an ever-present terror experienced by women when they witness violence inflicted on themselves, on their children and on the elderly, so often without even knowing why!"
"Their lives, and the lives of their loved ones, are constantly threatened, although they have never done anything to deserve it, and can do nothing to prevent it."
"We must do all in our power to condemn this situation, and particularly what is happening to the women of Algeria, Afghanistan, and Timor, so distant and yet so close to our hearts."
"We must be the voice of the women who have been denied the right to have a voice."
"I asked Commissioner Emma Bonino to lend me the cloak that the Afghan women are forced to wear as they live their daily lives, so that everybody here may see with own eyes the nature of the prison in which women are forced to confine themselves."
"Putting on this garment made more of an impact on me than any number of speeches."
"I felt like a prisoner, isolated although surrounded by people, looking out onto the world through bars, able to see no further than my own feet, with barely enough air to breath, unable to move my arms far enough to write the words that I am reading to you, unable even to make the woman's natural gesture of picking up a child in her arms"
"We must cry aloud: free these women from this prison, from this torture, from this violence!"
"Our cry of alarm, our solidarity, our friendship must reach these women."
"They must know that they are not alone."
"They have been deprived of everything: the right to study and to teach, the right to health care, the right to a free and responsible job, the right to respect as individuals, the right to live freely and in peace, even the right to see and breathe freely."
"No human being can remain silent in the presence of this inconceivable violence."
"We certainly will not, and we will do all in our power to designate 1999 the year against violence towards women."
"Madam President, human rights are the foundation of each national constitution and a major benefit for every man and woman."
"Yet at the end of the 20th century, the distance between professed intention and reality is still great, despite all the successes achieved."
"International Women's Day, which yesterday saw not only women take to the streets, but also a substantial number of men, including myself, has focused attention on Islamic fundamentalism."
"The joint campaign launched by the European Parliament and the Commission 'A flower for the women in Kabul' condemns the reign of terror in Afghanistan, in which women - as we saw today - are robbed of their personal dignity and status."
"They must wear veils."
"Their view is limited by a guard of fabric, as if they were looking through a cage."
"They have become second-class citizens who are no longer able to express themselves publicly, and Afghanistan was once a progressive country!"
"They are no longer allowed to practise their previous activities as doctors, teachers, members of parliament."
"The Islamic regime has degraded women to second-class citizens."
"You, Madam Commissioner, have experienced it first hand."
"Our respect and all our sympathy goes out to you."
"We will do our utmost to mobilize international publicity against the Taliban regime and conduct a sustained campaign."
"Nor let us not forget today that the idea of equality has still to be realized in Europe."
"A start has been made through the directive regulating the burden of proof in questions of discrimination, the new equality article in the Amsterdam Treaty and the Marshall judgement supporting women in promotion."
"The advancement of self-assured women is unstoppable."
"The support for women at the Luxembourg summit is a good basis for further integration in professional life, yet picking up a career after child-caring is still a vital problem."
"Careers at management level are the exception, and we are miles away from equal payment for equal work."
"Hence, 8 May is an incentive to implement the concept of main-streaming in all areas of society."
"If I had one wish, it would be that in May the flowers for the women in Kabul blossom in full view throughout the world, in both the western and the eastern hemispheres!"
"Madam President, yesterday thousands of women and several hundred men, so I believe, were out in Sweden's towns and cities supporting the campaign 'A flower for the women of Kabul' in various different ways."
"On the same day there were almost as many who lit candles for women who had died during the year either from injuries caused by or directly at the hands of men who claimed to be the people who loved them most in the world."
"I therefore agree with Mrs Gröner and others who have said that we would convince both the women and the men in the EU that we must also carry out a campaign against violence against women in the European Union."
"Madam President, I would also like to thank Mrs Bonino wholeheartedly for her work on behalf of the women in Kabul."
"Not only has she finally put the spotlight on the women in Afghanistan, but she has given International Women's Day a new impetus, and made the women's movement stronger than before."
"You said yourself, Madam Commissioner, that Afghanistan was a symbol of the suppression of women throughout the world."
"So I presume you will not mind us expressing our particular sympathy towards the thousands of women in Algeria who for years have been the victims of barbaric rapes and massacres by the fundamentalist terror groups of the GIA."
"These are religious fanatics, not ordinary Muslims, who, through the massacre of more than 80 000 people, including many women, children, and elderly people, want to do away with peace and democracy in Algeria once and for all."
"Violence is indeed the instrument of fanatics, of terrorists, but let us not forget that this violence is thriving in a country where democracy has been suppressed for a long time and which suffers from extremely high unemployment and great poverty. It is a country where a large section of the population is not accorded any human rights, and I am referring here in particular to women, whose rights have been suppressed for years because, since 1984, Algeria has one of the most backward systems of family law."
"It degrades women, treating them like creatures without rights, wholly governed by their men and guardians and, for that matter, it contravenes international conventions which Algeria has signed, but does not implement."
"There is a very broad movement of women's organizations in Algeria which is pursuing a non-violent battle for peace, democracy, human rights - and women's rights - and which is therefore opposing this family law, with exceptional courage."
"I hope we can count on you, too, Madam Commissioner, in this battle for Algeria, for Algerian women, for perseverance."
"Barbaric violence can only be fought when democracy is supported."
"But a democracy cannot exist without respect for human and women's rights."
"I think we should give our full support to this women's movement in Algeria."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, Parliament has designated this Women's Day, on which particular attention is drawn to the situation of Afghan women."
"We express our solidarity towards the victims of this particularly extreme manifestation of discrimination which lends full weight to the designation of this day and to the struggle that gives it meaning."
"However, although nothing must be allowed to detract from this solidarity, it cannot overshadow the need to be fully aware that Women's Day originated as a result of the working hours of female textile workers in New York and that, closer to home, other particular gestures of solidarity are essential, as in Portugal, where abortion is made a factor of the party political struggle, to the detriment of the rights of women in defence of the perpetuation of a situation that is unacceptable in legal, health and moral terms, with the hypocritical justification of moral principles that are declared to be unassailable."
"The defence of women's rights is a struggle to be waged by all, men and women, and in all areas."
"Madam President, 50 years since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, too often women's rights have still not been affirmed, are still not being applied and are still being violated."
"More than three years since the approval of the Beijing action platform, should we be satisfied with the actions taken by the EU and its Member States with regard to European women and women throughout the world?"
"Unfortunately, no!"
"It is not the fault of this Parliament, nor that of the Commission, that the fourth action programme which, while including the Beijing guidelines, does not have a budget that is able to finance the many, necessary initiatives planned by the women's associations in our countries, often in vain."
"In many countries, either the national action plans intended to make the Beijing platform into a national reality have not even been presented or the action has not followed the presentation."
"The years go by and women continue to suffer various forms of violence, ranging from physical to sexual, including harassment at the place of work."
"Violent practices connected with cultural and patriarchal traditions continue."
"Discrimination continues over access to education, training and the world of employment, careers, access to justice, health services and playing a part in decisions."
"It could be said that some of this discrimination concerns women in developed countries and some concerns those in developing countries, but that is not the case, because it all concerns all women on the whole planet, even if we should remember that those most affected are women from poor countries, countries with violent dictatorships and countries at war."
"To this depressing view we should add phenomena we are already aware of, but which have become of enormous numerical and social significance, such as trading in women for sexual exploitation, and the greatest problem of all, unemployment."
"There has been no shortage of initiatives and it is only fair to recall, as others have already done, the great undertaking made by Commissioner Emma Bonino, that has been made by the European Parliament and by national and international organizations, by women's associations in many countries, not only in the EU, in favour of Afghan women, as well as Commissioner Gradin's active undertaking against the trade in women for sexual exploitation, of which the victims are women in the southern hemisphere, but also European women and those from countries once oppressed by the Soviet Union."
"Today, however, on the eve of the 80th anniversary of 8 March, we should tell ourselves, the Commission and the Council, that we need to do more to affirm and establish the principle that women's rights are the rights of human beings and should be interpreted, recognized and, at all costs, established as such."
"Madam President, during the course of this century important advances have been made for women's rights, but there still remains a great deal to be done as regards gaining complete and total equality and recognition of their place in our societies."
"So, in many countries within the Union, they must fight against discrimination at work, disparity of salaries and tackle unemployment and the uncertainty of work, which affects them in particular."
"They must also resist regular attempts to challenge the fundamental experience of controlling fertility."
"I am delighted that demands for equality are on the agenda in France."
"This could prove to be a lever to firmly establish the desire for full and unrestricted citizenship for women and their access to the full range of political responsibilities."
"The plight of the women in Kabul has shocked us all, and I welcome the initiative which the Commission has taken on this."
"Their situation provides a clear, if horrifying, illustration of the conception which the Muslim fundamentalists have of women."
"And again it is Islamic fundamentalism which is responsible for the rape and murder of courageous Algerian women."
"Unfortunately, the list of countries where women are looked down on and ill-treated is much longer than this."
"It has been said that you can judge the degree of civilization by the situation of its women."
"This gives us a measure of the fight which is still ahead, far beyond the symbolic day of 8 March."
"Madam President, once again everything seems to be conspiring towards helplessness."
"The institutions of the European Union are more and more coming to resemble some great machine carefully prepared to promote helplessness. Meanwhile, we in those institutions hypocritically split ourselves in two between our wishes, on the one hand, and the facts, on the other."
"So, Madam President, remembering the case of Ana Orantes, the woman from Granada who was tragically burnt to death by her ex-husband, and in view of the scandalous statistics of male violence against women in my country, Spain, where there were 91 cases last year - far more than from ETA's violent acts of terrorism -, I wonder whether today's discrimination, today's hypocritical non-discrimination, is any better than yesterday's discrimination."
"It is also hypocritical - ridiculous even - that even at this stage we are unable to recognize discrimination in terms of salary."
"How is it possible that we can detect water on the moon, but cannot see that discrimination at work is tolerated and permitted in this hypocritical Europe, without us even acknowledging it?"
"We agree to it."
"It is not allowed, but we prefer not to notice it."
"Madam President, yesterday millions of women asked us to do something about it once and for all - to follow up our words with deeds."
"Madam President, before we finish the debate I should like to bring to the House's attention the many women whose children have been abducted to countries where these women have no rights whatsoever before the courts."
"Many of them have lost their children for ever."
"This is an ongoing human rights issue and I agree with Mrs Larive that when looking at our relationships with many of the countries to which these children have been abducted, we must regard this as being one of the essential human rights."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Sale of consumer goods and guarantees"
"The next item is the report (A4-0029/98) by Mrs Kuhn, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees (COM(95)0520 - C4-0455/96-96/0161(COD))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, where consumer goods are concerned, we have a single internal market."
"In 2002 we will have the euro in the majority of EU states."
"This will allow consumers to make price comparisons much more easily."
"Teleshopping, cross-border mail ordering and Internet selling could all profit from this."
"However, according to a survey, consumers generally have reservations about purchasing goods outside their own country because they fear problems, should a product be defective."
"This fear is completely justified at present."
"Within the European Union, not only does the statutory guarantee period vary in length, but the concept of a defective article is also defined differently."
"Both the legal claims for remedying a defect and the terms for claiming on a guarantee are not standard."
"The Commission has highlighted the differences between the Member States in its Green Paper 'Consumer Goods Guarantees and After-Sales Service' ."
"In a resolution on the Green Paper, the European Parliament has called on the Commission to produce a draft directive for the minimum harmonization of the statutory guarantee and for a legal framework for the commercial guarantee."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was the rapporteur at the time."
"The proposal put forward by the Commission is to be welcomed from the consumers' point of view."
"It provides for the minimum harmonization of individual state provisions for the statutory guarantee and greater transparency with the commercial guarantee."
"This statutory guarantee should be for two years."
"During the first year consumers can choose between four types of redress which they can assert with the vendor: free repair, replacement, reduction in purchase price or cancellation of contract."
"In the second year, they have only the right to free repair or a price reduction."
"As rapporteur, I have said from the outset that this freedom of consumer choice is too consumer-friendly and unreasonable for retailers or manufacturers."
"Many consumers would not have defective products repaired, but instead choose an alternative product or cancel the transaction altogether."
"The retailers would then be effectively sitting on virtually new, used goods, which would have to be sold as second-hand products."
"Hence, both the advisory committees and the main committees are proposing a hierarchy for the two-year guarantee: free repair without depreciation, if sensible and feasible, a replacement if repair proves to be neither sensible nor feasible, and should both not be possible, cancellation of contract or reduction in purchase price."
"This proposal should help to remove the serious reservations normally expressed by the retailers."
"Therefore, false cost accounting should no longer end up with the elected representatives, as has happened again today."
"With the greatest sympathy for certain representatives of industry, some of whom have even furnished us with a complete voting list - another novelty since presumably parliamentarians are not considered capable of independent thought -, the consumer has a right to a defect-free product."
"You almost get the impression that defective products are the general rule."
"The draft directive also applies to second-hand goods."
"Automobile clubs have welcomed this."
"The Committee, however, is proposing that buyers and vendors should be able to impose contractual restrictions on second-hand articles."
"I have one other point: most Member States want second-hand goods to come under this directive because so far this has been the case under national law."
"Affected parties have also criticized the fact that the manufacturer's public declarations are also included in the defect definition."
"In my opinion, this is only right and proper since it is often the statements in advertisements that cause consumers to purchase a particular product."
"The Commission's proposal assumes that any defect that occurs in the first six months after parting with the product must have been present at the time of sale."
"This is only of limited application, however, if the vendor is able to prove the contrary."
"Hence, the buyer may not, as is sometimes suggested, complain about his canvas shoes five months after buying them because these have since developed a flaw through wear."
"Nor can I present the glaring crack in a new expensive vase that was there when I bought it as a fault some six months later."
"I would ask critics of the directive to consider that, in contrast to the commercial guarantee, claims under the statutory guarantee can only be made if a lack of conformity with the contract was evident at the time the product was surrendered."
"The same critics should also kindly consider that the internal market has brought suppliers great benefits, while the consumer still needs to make up for lost ground."
"I am of the opinion that consumers have a right to expect that the statutory guarantee claims are not dependent on the country of purchase, but instead that they have the same minimum rights across the Union."
"The directive should lead to a balanced relationship between suppliers and buyers because consumers in many Member States, including my own, are better placed through it and consumer confidence in cross-border purchases is enhanced."
"In this sense, the proposed directive represents an important step towards increasing the level of consumer protection in the European Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share in principle the opinion of the rapporteur, who has told us that this directive is basically pointing in the right direction."
"It means that we will be able to coordinate an important area in the European Union, which is also crucial for the smooth-functioning of the single market."
"I am thinking of the problems experienced in the area of cross-border traffic, where today a customer who lives in Germany, say, but would like to shop in the Netherlands or Belgium, is not so certain which rights he has as a purchaser in these countries."
"To this extent, the directive is a genuine contribution towards achieving harmonization."
"I do not wish to deny either that I am sympathetically disposed to the possibility that, through us now getting this European legislation, the debate surrounding the law of contract, which for some time has been dormant, will start up again, in my native country of Germany as well."
"Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that this proposal which the Commission has made is unbalanced in a lot of aspects."
"Hence it will require the necessary changes being made by this Parliament."
"This particularly affects - Mrs Kuhn has said so - the question of maybe limiting the right of option."
"Under the Commission's proposal, it is theoretically conceivable that, for example, a buyer might buy a car, drive around for months in it, clocking up some 50 000 km, park up and claim once there is damage to the engine, ' I'd like to have a new car, please.'"
"That would be unreasonable, without question, since such an expensive item normally should be repaired first."
"Let's take a second, reverse scenario: I buy a hair dryer for 30 marks in a cut-price supermarket."
"According to the wording of the directive, in theory the consumer could insist on the hair dryer being repaired eleven months later."
"That would be absurd, too, because such cheap products are not repaired but replaced."
"That is why I actually think this change in the right of option is crucial."
"I also believe, and this is a proposal from my group, that we need to provide exemption clauses for the low-grade products sector as well and not just for second-hand goods."
"I do not consider it prudent of us to create a directive at the end of which is the possibility that certain low-grade products might need to be raised so much in price in order to cover the risks incurred by the warranty."
"Ultimately that would be a disadvantage for the consumer."
"That is why we will also be requesting through an amendment that the low-grade products be included in the exemption provisions that allow this to be circumvented."
"We have problems too with the manufacturer's liability decision made in the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"We refuse to go along with this as the Group of the European People's Party."
"It failed to meet with support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, too."
"On the question of shifting the burden of proof, we have come up with a solution in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights that is better because it does not envisage the drastic ruling of the directive, from which there is no possibility of deviating, even in cases where injustice has occurred."
"Against the background of the changes I have partly addressed - there are more amendments in the motions file - we are nevertheless of the principled opinion that this directive is heading in the right direction and therefore support in principle the Commission's proposal, albeit with the corrections which I have outlined and which proceed from our amendments."
"Madam President, my group warmly welcomes the fact that this directive is now at long last before Parliament, and congratulates our colleague, Mrs Kuhn, on the sustained work she has put in to achieve a desirable result."
"This proposal will give a minimum standard for sale of goods right across the whole of the single market."
"With a fair wind, it will come into effect by the time that the final fruition of that single market is achieved with the currency reforms at the end of this century."
"If that is so, consumers will, for the first time in all Member States, have the opportunity for redress and restoration of what properly should be theirs, which all too often is denied them."
"In the 1993 Green Paper on guarantees and after-sales services, this Parliament called on the Commission to present a proposal for a directive."
"We are extremely glad that this has now come before us."
"In my own country the legal provisions are already running strongly in this direction so under the UK presidency there will be a mood to move to bring this into law very quickly indeed."
"We have found over the past six years that in trans-European transactions, which are now becoming an increasing part of our intra-Community trade as individuals, 70 % of cases brought concern faulty products."
"52 % of consumers mention the difficulties they encountered in exchanging goods or having repairs done as the main barrier to purchasing goods across borders."
"Far more people quoted that, rather than language difficulties, as a reason."
"Surely, therefore, something is wrong."
"Mrs Kuhn has done a remarkably good job in addressing this issue, with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, to look at ways in which compromises can be found."
"We have a reasonable compromise now over the length of time of the guarantees."
"One year is not long enough, and those who propose five and six years are unrealistic."
"They were voted down and the reasons will no doubt be put once again by Mrs Bonino."
"We believe in a hierarchy of remedies which is rational."
"A hierarchy of remedies which is rational, of course, attempts to maintain and protect the rights of the consumer whilst at the same time not burdening the seller with entirely unrealistic propositions, like having to replace a motorcar which is brought back with a few scratches after a couple of months on the road."
"The wording of Amendment No 45 is actually better than EMAC 9 - the amendment which was adopted in the Environment Committee - because it sets out a form of words where the natural economic interest of both the buyer and the seller must coincide if the hierarchy of remedies must mean repair rather than replacement."
"It also looked again at the question of the timetable for a rescission of the contract or a reduction in price."
"There are one or two things where I think we need further time and perhaps further consideration."
"This is, after all, only the first reading."
"One is the question of second-hand goods."
"There are areas where this directive ought properly to apply to second-hand goods and areas where we can all see, despite all the complaints in this field, it would be inappropriate to apply the full rigour of the directive as though the goods were new."
"My last point is that, on consumer information, the area where industry complained bitterly about offices being set up in each Member State, we think we have found an appropriate amendment which suggests exactly the right level of information which the consumer needs state by state."
"Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Kuhn wholeheartedly for the excellent way in which we have been able to arrive at a satisfactory result for this directive."
"I hope that our cooperation will last until the vote on the first reading tomorrow, because our group sees major advantages in this directive."
"The consumer will become a major player in the market."
"This is necessary if we believe there should be an internal market which should ensure that the consumer is able to buy products throughout Europe, and that there should be a service attached to the products he buys."
"Our group recognizes this, but when I say that the consumer should be a major player in the market, this does not mean that we should start laying the burden disproportionally on small and medium enterprises."
"That is why we have tried to improve some aspects, in particular with the amendment to Article 3, Clause 4, where we are introducing a hierarchy in the way the consumer can claim or recover his losses when his agreement is broken."
"I believe that with this hierarchy we have solved many of the problems for small and medium enterprises."
"This means, and a journalist has asked about this, that with respect to the hierarchy, we have removed some rights from the original European Commission proposal."
"But I can back this up, because it means that we have ensured that the ecological, energy-consuming, throw-away economy which we would end up with if people just took everything back, is removed from the draft in Amendment No 45."
"I therefore believe that from an energy and environmental point of view, we have achieved something with this amendment, but that it is also good for small and medium enterprises."
"It is a heavy burden for small and medium enterprises that when selling goods to consumers from abroad, they have to produce whole lists for the consumer in case they want to make a claim."
"I therefore ask Mrs Kuhn if we could have another good look at the amendments on that front."
"We would in any case advise you to vote against."
"There is one problem: the trapped small retailer."
"The trapped small retailer, who might be dependent on products delivered by the manufacturer in a faulty condition, or with faulty information, must be helped."
"I think that, when the amendment to this section, Amendment No 31, is supported by this entire House, we will have a solution to these problems."
"Reversal of the burden of proof."
"The text as it is before us might pave the way to abuse, and I therefore think that the amendments submitted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is much better."
"Mr Lehne has already mentioned this a short time ago."
"Then there is the issue of the second hand market."
"We would like our amendments to be taken over."
"We would like second hand goods to be included in the directive, but in a reasonable form."
"This means that when you pay a high price for a car, you should be able to get a guarantee."
"An organization such as BOVAG in the Netherlands would concur with such a view."
"Let expensive goods come under the scope of the directive, but allow for exceptions."
"I have a few more amendments of which I would like to ask the Commission, Parliament and other groups to have a look at."
"I am referring to Amendments Nos 6, 8, 9 - I am using the Dutch text - 22, 25, 28, 29, 34 - I just mentioned these, 35, 36, 37, and the new amendment replacing Amendment No 41."
"If this can be arranged I believe we will have a decent text which will show us in a good light to small and medium enterprises, but also most definitely - because that is who it is intended for - to the consumer."
"Madam President, there are provisions in the Consumer Credit Act (1995) which ensure that consumers are made aware of the nature and content of any credit agreement or financial accommodation which is advertised by banking institutions."
"In addition, advertisements of consumer credit must contain details of any charges additional to payment of capital and interest; a statement of any security which may be required; a clear indication of any restrictions on the availability of credit and the cash price of relative goods and services; the total cost of credit; particulars of the number, amount and timing of instalments; the amounts of any deposits and the number of any instalments which must be paid before the delivery of the goods."
"The content and requirements relating to credit agreements are defined and set out in the legislation."
"Consumers are able to assess any agreement before they enter into it and are made aware of the type of agreement involved: for example, hire purchase and hire agreements etc."
"In the light of the forthcoming commencement dates for our economic and monetary union, all these provisions must be analysed, reviewed and updated in the context of future banking transactions for the Irish and European consumers."
"From 1 January 1999 all non-cash transactions can be carried out in the euro denomination."
"Mortgage-holders and those consumers seeking mortgages at a future date must have confidence in the terms they are given in the new euro denomination from national and European banking institutions."
"I congratulate Mrs Kuhn on her report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Liberal Group is in favour of harmonized rules on after-sale guarantees, but is a little disillusioned with the Commission proposal, and for the following reasons. Firstly, for the time being the problem of the internal market will not have been completely resolved for the consumer."
"Secondly, the proposal will lead to additional costs for shopkeepers, costs which are disproportionate to the protection of the consumer."
"At the same time it could result in job losses in the labour intensive repair services sector."
"Finally, it will cause more waste, and this while the Commission is working on a document on competition in the recycling sectors. In this document it apparently expresses its concern about the scrapheap of electronic equipment."
"In order to arrive at a transparent and balanced piece of legislation, my liberal colleagues and I have drafted a few proposals, first and foremost with respect to means of redress."
"My group cannot agree that a consumer, in the case of a fault in the purchased item, is given four means of redress. We therefore propose a hierarchy."
"In the case of a fault the vendor is obliged to repair the product to full working order within a reasonable period."
"How this is done is his business, as long as he guarantees that it is the quickest and most efficient method, and as long as the customer is satisfied."
"If this fails, then the consumer has every right to demand a price reduction or the cancellation of the agreement."
"Secondly, the consumer should be able to turn directly to the manufacturer in three instances, namely when the vendor is located abroad, has ceased trading, or when he cannot be reached."
"I am referring to our Amendment 25 which was approved by a large majority in the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Finally, we believe second hand goods should be excluded."
"They do not belong in this directive."
"We would like a clear and explicit exception for these goods, but do not rule out that they will be subjected to separate regulations at a later date."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group wants to work towards a clear and balanced text, which not only benefits the consumer, but also employment, business and the environment."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the draft directive from the Commission in so far as it envisages at least a two-year guarantee."
"That is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough."
"It would be an improvement for countries at the bottom end of the EU like the Federal Republic, which only provides for an extremely short warranty period of six months."
"But what we want is actually a breakthrough to sustainability in production, and that is why five years would be better in our view."
"We need to get away from the disposable product mentality and the short life of goods and move towards sustainable production."
"Manufacturers and distributors should not be released from responsibility either."
"I have absolutely no sympathy with all the whining and whingeing letters we receive from industry."
"Industry is always telling us it is prepared to accept responsibility."
"I think manufacturers and distributors need to be called to account."
"We therefore need to stem the flood of rubbish and demand a longer life for products."
"That is why we have introduced an amendment providing for a 5-year guarantee, so as to finally achieve this breakthrough to sustainability."
"This also enjoys the support of Finland, by the way, which makes it clear that even in the Council of Ministers there is support for sustainability in production."
"We want to see that both the average life and the rate of consumption of products is disclosed with the manufacture and use of the product."
"It is quite clear to us that repair must come first."
"We want to put an end to the wasting of resources and create an incentive for curtailing production of non-recyclable goods."
"We believe that with this directive the European Parliament needs to come clean at the vote tomorrow as to just how serious it is about sustainability in production."
"Madam President, most Member States already have some legislation on guarantee periods and consumer rights, but it varies considerably."
"Now that goods are produced and consumed on an increasingly international scale it is high time we had harmonization and consumer protection."
"We therefore support the drawing up of a European directive on after-sale guarantees."
"Each time a product is found to be faulty, the question will arise: was it already faulty or did the user break it?"
"In practise it turns out that it is sometimes impossible to answer this question."
"Sometimes the consumer will lie."
"He knows he was responsible for the defect, but acts dumb."
"In such circumstances should an extensive procedure be undertaken to establish proof?"
"A company will not want to do so if it concerns a relatively low-cost item."
"Sometimes the fault was already present at the time of purchase, or occurred shortly afterwards through no fault of the consumer."
"It is clear that an arrangement must be made to indemnify the consumer."
"But the first case is of course the most difficult."
"The report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection clearly takes the side of the consumer when it comes to burden of proof."
"He is not to blame."
"This comes back to an imbalance in power between buyer and seller."
"We back this choice."
"It will occasionally lead to an increase in cost for the manufacturer."
"But on the other hand a good reputation will benefit him, both with respect to the product and to his service."
"Nothing is better advertised than the quick replacement of a product."
"I am therefore not terribly impressed with the many letters from the business lobby saying that it will all be so expensive and that in the end the consumer will have to pay more."
"The shopkeeper will need right of recourse which he can use to recover his costs from the manufacturer."
"If the legal guarantee is used too often to make claims, then there must be something wrong with the product."
"We can therefore support many of the amendments in the Kuhn report."
"Madam President, the draft directive before us is an example of how standardized, trans-European rulings can antagonize the people and shake their confidence in the Union."
"Open borders and an open market demand uniform consumer protection guidelines."
"This also applies to the buyer's statutory right to protection from defects in acquired products, in short to a standardization of warranty law."
"However, if a proposal for a directive is presented, as it is here, where the periods within which the seller is liable for defects in his product are quadrupled - as in the case of Austria, for example - this is hardly indicative of great tact and sensitivity."
"There is little fine feeling too in the arrangement planned for allowing the consumer a free option in the first year of warranty between repair, price reduction, rescission of contract and replacement."
"It seems reasonable to suppose that, in the majority of cases, the buyer will prefer to receive a new product rather than have the old one repaired, a solution which, we believe, is neither economically nor ecologically sensible."
"And if one brings the proposed change in the burden of proof into the equation, i.e. the supposition that the fault was already present at the time of purchase, this overall arrangement represents an increased burden on the small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, who would in no way be in a balanced position in relation to the improved consumer protection brought about by this change."
"It is precisely in today's difficult employment situation that this additional imposition is not acceptable and will in the long term reduce the number of consumers protected."
"We therefore share the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, of waiting for the study into the impact of this directive to come out, which has been commissioned due to the contentious nature of the subject matter."
"There is no reason to be overhasty in approaching this issue."
"It would do the cause more harm than good."
"Madam President, I do not have a script, just two observations."
"There is no competence of the European Parliament for coordinating civil law."
"There is no coordination taking place, as it happens."
"Only minimum standards are being set down, i.e. we will probably be left legally with a patched-up job."
"Where then is the coordination that might perhaps be still justified?"
"I do not believe, incidentally, that within the European Union of the single market there has ever been a cross-border purchase made or omitted simply because another warranty system operates in the other country."
"That is an utterly ridiculous assumption."
"One other word, on the shift in the burden of proof, since I cannot say more about the substance."
"This has become something of a magic formula: ' shift in the burden of proof.'"
"It is quite clear that we can do nothing to change the facts of the matter, namely that the one who asserts a claim has to prove the facts justifying the claim, and a reversal in the burden of proof can only come into it if the one making the claim has absolutely no access to the information justifying his claim."
"Only then can shifting the burden of proof be considered."
"This clearly is not the case here."
"This shift in the burden of proof means that fundamentally the seller can never produce the proof."
"He took his iron that was all packed up down from the shelf and gave it the customer - and then three months later he is expected to prove that this iron was in order."
"Legally this is rather suspect."
"Madam President, in the internal market the consumer is free to obtain products and services from other Member States, and he sees this as one of the biggest advantages of that internal market."
"But an important obstacle stands in the way of his being able to enjoy this freedom fully, namely uncertainty about after-sale guarantees, and about what he can do when a product he bought turns out to have hidden defects."
"I welcome a proposal for a directive to harmonize a number of things in this field."
"It is also positive that this directive offers the consumer a high degree of protection."
"But a degree of protection is not the same as absolute cover against a host of things at the expense of something similar."
"Consumer rights must also be economically and legally justifiable."
"Sadly, this balance is lacking in several places."
"It is lacking where the Commission systematically gives the consumer complete freedom of choice as to the means of repairing a defect."
"It is also lacking where there is resolute reversal of burden of proof."
"I fully agree with the comment made by Mr Rothley on this issue; on both fronts it is necessary for some serious adjustments are made."
"But unfortunately the lack of balance is reinforced by some of the amendments submitted by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"I would mention only Amendments Nos 6 and 34 on the contact addresses in the other Member States."
"In our group we are really amazed at the misjudgment of the economic and legal reality as far as distribution in the internal market is concerned."
"But, if we think it is good we say so, too: Amendment No 31 receives our approval."
"This amendment should prevent the seller, often a small or medium enterprise, being squashed between the devil and the deep blue sea, between a non-reducible liability towards the consumer on the one hand, and liability shifted onto him because of the supplier on the other."
"We insist that the seller's right of recourse can be exercised effectively, and we would like to emphasize this as one of the essential conditions for our ultimate approval of this resolution."
"Balance does not stand in the way of a high degree of consumer protection."
"Let us use this notion as a starting point for consultation between the groups so that we will arrive at consensus."
"Madam President, let me first of all make it clear that I am not at all enthusiastic about this proposed directive, neither as presented by the Commission nor with the proposed modifications of the Environment Committee."
"Even if the Environment Committee's policy document appears to improve on and clarify some points, there are nonetheless many uncertainties and problems remaining in relation to the consumer, the seller and the Danish legal tradition in the area of the Sale of Goods Act."
"It is worrying when even someone who is not a lawyer is able to find several unclear formulations and other problems in the text."
"What, for instance, is 'appropriate after-sales service' ?"
"Moreover, these proposals for a directive appear excessively intrusive as touching the Sale of Goods Act, which, indeed, lies at the heart of transactions."
"We have vastly different trading cultures in the various nations of Europe and therefore, in my view, this is not an area that either can or should be legislated on."
"Incidentally, the proposed directive does not solve the problems the consumer experiences with cross-border transactions."
"There are huge gulfs separating consumers and sellers in different countries, both in terms of geography and in terms of language."
"Therefore, it could be asked whether harmonization serves any purpose whatsoever and whether it will have any effect on this area."
"I am, in fact, against the idea of harmonization for harmonization's sake."
"Here and now I can only point out one single specific problem of the policy document, that is, the rights of the consumer in the case of defects or deficiencies."
"The proposal of the Commission is completely unacceptable on this point."
"It would be horrendously expensive if a large number of consumers required agreements to be waived when not strictly necessary."
"And at the end of the day, these costs will have to be borne by the consumer."
"Moreover, this is also completely untenable from an environmental point of view."
"Conversely, the proposals of the Environment Committee are unacceptable from the consumer's point of view."
"We are really talking about a right to repair and replace for the seller without taking into consideration whether this is a great inconvenience to the consumer."
"As a minimum requirement, the consumer must be given a choice where there are recurring defects, and the consumer should under all circumstances be allowed to opt for replacement rather than repair."
"Therefore, this motion should be rejected in order to allow us to achieve a reasonable sharing of the burden between consumer and seller."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, following the Green Paper published in November 1993, on 18 June 1996 the Commission adopted the draft Directive on the sale and guarantees of consumer goods."
"The draft Directive seeks to guarantee for the consumer a minimum common basis of rights that may be exercised under identical conditions, irrespective of the place of purchase of the goods in the EU."
"This is simply to enable consumers and economic operators to make full use of the benefits of the single market and to guarantee a high level of protection of consumers' economic interests."
"It is somewhat surprising, by the way, to me at least, to note in this debate how consumers are regarded as irresponsible or incapable of understanding what something reasonable is, or of being consumers, i.e. citizens who, as described here, should benefit or want to benefit from knowing what's what."
"If we want to talk of a balance between industry and consumers, frankly I would not want to waste more time explaining to this House where the balance lies between the producer or the seller and the consumers."
"Without any desire to always want to regulate everything, we are simply talking about establishing minimum rights for European citizens and consumers, equal for everyone, irrespective of the place where the consumer goods in question were bought."
"In November 1996, the Economic and Social Committee gave a favourable opinion of this proposal."
"However, I have heard references to high costs echo in this Chamber."
"You are familiar with the final report on the study which the Commission has begun on the economic impact of this proposal, which has been forwarded to the Parliament in its provisional and final versions: you can all see that these costs are not so huge."
"However, the Commission would like to point out that the consumer's trust is of value to the seller, and is specifically of value in a competitive market, so this value probably merits investment in some cases."
"With regard to the amendments being discussed and voted on, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kuhn, for her work, because I believe it is thanks to her work that the Commission can accept many of the amendments drawn up by her."
"To be more precise, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23 and, if Amendment No 46 is not accepted, No 29; it also accepts Amendments Nos 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42 and 45 and Amendment No 46 as an alternative to Amendment No 29, as I said earlier."
"Amendments Nos 12, 16 and 40 will be accepted provided there are amendments to the wording, while Amendment No 33, in the Commission's opinion, requires a fundamental change."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 41 and 54, the Commission accepts their logic and accepts them provided there are a few amendments to the wording."
"Finally, Amendments Nos 2, 13, 24, 26, 31 and 41 will be partially accepted."
"I would now like to make a few comments on Amendment No 45, which seems to me to be the key factor in this debate, to emphasize the importance the Commission attributes to the possibility of giving the consumer a choice at two different levels in the hierarchical scale, enabling him to apply these rights: it seems essential to us that this choice should not be with the seller failing to observe the contractual obligation to provide goods as stipulated in the contract, but rather with the consumer."
"For example, if I bought a camera for a trip and I find there is something wrong with it three days before the trip, there is no point the seller repairing it if the repair will take three weeks; in this case, it seems logical to me to demand a replacement before leaving."
"The same applies to a whole series of other examples we can give."
"The British Presidency intends to reach a political agreement at the end of the ""Consumers' Council on 23 April."
"The Commission, for its part, will endeavour to present an amended proposal to the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Parliament's amendments, according to the procedure I have just described."
"Finally, I hope that this legislation, which I consider important, will make fast progress to enable the European Commission to establish a key aspect of the single market and consumer protection."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Green Paper on food law"
"The next item is the report (A4-0009/98) by Mrs Graenitz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the Commission Green Paper on the general principles of food law in the European Union (COM(97)0176-C4-0213/97)."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Green Paper on the general principles behind food legislation in the European Union has, after lengthy discussion, been presented at a point in time which is marked by changes in the organizational structure of the Commission's services and in the economic debate."
"This became clear not only from the lengthy discussion I mentioned, within the Directorate-General concerned, but also through the fact that, whilst in the original version of the Green Paper the prime aim of legislation was formulated as being the free movement of goods within the single market, priority was given to safeguarding health and to food safety following the submission of the report from the BSE committee of inquiry and the assurances given in this regard by the Commission President, Mr Santer."
"The priority of health protection is something that has greatly shaped our debate on food law from this time on."
"The principle is self-evident - for the European Parliament, for the other parliaments, in fact for every individual: each item of food legislation should guarantee that the permitted foodstuffs, including all additives and methods of production, are consistent with good health."
"This is a sine qua non, and it would seem unnecessary to keep stressing it."
"Yet the events of the last two years have shown just how much the market relies on consumer confidence and how dangerous, and ultimately expensive, it is for all concerned to permit lax standards in food safety."
"Equivalence of procedure is easier to verify and calculate in the mechanical and technical field than it is when dealing with organic materials."
"So it is in this context I think that Parliament -we will be having a further debate on this area tomorrow -welcomes the amendments to Articles 129 and 129a adopted in Amsterdam, and I hope that ratification by the national parliaments will take place in a short while."
"We all know that perfecting the single market requires clear, plain legislation, where compliance can be suitably monitored."
"Not only your rapporteur, but the majority of Member States and very many of those who have commented on the Commission's Green Paper, are of the opinion that a framework directive on food law would be the very way to create concise legislation and a clear framework, and thereby adapt, if necessary, existing legislation, removing or coordinating overlapping or conflicting sections and to design the legislation in such a way that consumers and producers alike enjoy stability of the law and know how to proceed in which circumstances."
"Such a framework directive for foodstuffs should, of course, mirror the legislation on hygiene so that it is clear exactly which hygiene belongs to which food legislation in a particular area."
"I think that the submission of a framework directive may be the very thing the Commission has in mind in the foreseeable future."
"I believe there is already some work in progress, and I think that there should be no need to wait here for further findings and deliberations or for additional reports to be submitted by the Commission."
"I also consider it necessary in this context to come up with an arrangement as to how vitamins are added to foodstuffs and this has then to be labelled, and - as the Commission proposes and can then be adopted by Parliament -how one should deal with health claims, that is to say claims regarding the effect on health of certain foodstuffs."
"A very important area is the HACCP."
"I think this area, which has not yet been universally recognized in terms of its significance and effectiveness, should be investigated further and that a lot of assistance needs to be provided, especially for small and medium-sized firms, chiefly agricultural enterprises."
"I believe that this would be a lot easier if consumers were involved."
"Where consumers are concerned, information is the most important aspect."
"Here it is a question of giving the consumers clear and easy-to-understand labels and information on the food."
"Proceeding from the labelling, more information can be provided through other media, perhaps on the basis of voluntary arrangements too, because it is apparent to everyone that labelling has its limits."
"The area is very broad, and I do not have the time in my six minutes to refer to all its significance in detail, what sort of economic relevance it has and how important the question is in connection with the World Trade Organization and the Codex Alimentarius."
"I also think it necessary to continue to discuss, albeit through a further report, how a food and health policy can be promoted by the Commission as part of an overall nutrition policy and general health education."
"Finally, I would like to voice my conviction that legislation should contain a clear declaration of preventive consumer protection, that this would be the political dimension to strengthening consumer confidence in the single food market and that food safety is definitely necessary as a counter-balance to the economic dimension and internal dynamics of the single market in the food sector."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Agriculture Committee I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report and thank her for her acceptance of most of the points made in the opinion from the Agriculture Committee."
"It is a measure of just how far we have moved over the last two to three years that there is such a large degree of unanimity between the Environment and Agriculture Committees on the principles which must form the basis of European food legislation."
"There is now widespread recognition of the need to reassess some aspects of modern farming methods, particularly high-tech, high-import intensive production, which can lead among other things to the loss of many jobs in rural communities."
"What exactly should be put into high-protein animal feeds?"
"There must be clear labelling of the contents, which should also be appropriate to the animals to which they are fed."
"How densely should animals and poultry be herded together - something which could lead to the rapid spread of disease?"
"The answer must not be the routine administration of antibiotics which then find their way into the human food chain, but ensuring that animals and poultry are kept in humane non-overcrowded conditions."
"There must be strict rules in abattoirs to maintain the highest levels of hygiene."
"Furthermore, rules on collection and collation of animal zoonosis need to be improved to ensure best practice throughout the European Union in dealing with animal diseases presenting risks to human health."
"High use of artificial fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides can lead to harmful residues in fruit and vegetables and other plant products and must be carefully controlled and monitored."
"Good farming practice and animal welfare cannot be considered in isolation from food legislation as a whole."
"Wholesome raw ingredients from the farm gate are the basis of good-quality safe food."
"I welcome very much the acceptance by the Environment Committee of the recommendation from the Agriculture Committee that producer liability should only go back to the point in the food chain where responsibility for any defects actually lies."
"This will allay the anxiety of many farmers."
"Likewise, whilst welcoming the proposals for hazard analysis and critical control points systems, the Agriculture Committee is concerned that there should be an assessment of their impact on small farmers and food processors, who should continue to be guided by clear regulations."
"What is important for consumers is to know that their food comes from healthy plants and animals and that all along the food chain at each stage there is sensible, comprehensible legislation in place with effective monitoring and that the food eventually sold in shops carries clear informative labelling to ensure a wholesome quality product."
"We have all become only too used to food scares concerning salmonella in eggs, risk from BSE and e-coli in beef and pesticides residues in carrots."
"I hope that the revision of EU food legislation incorporating the European Parliament's proposals will help to consign such scares to history."
"Mr President, on this very day the Phillips inquiry into BSE and its relation with CJD opens in London, in my country."
"It is a great tribute to Mrs Graenitz that she has brought these clear and lucid proposals before Parliament at a time when we are reminded of the dark side of food production in the BSE tragedy, and also of the high hopes that we had after the Treaty of Amsterdam was passed, that we would take an entirely new view of our responsibilities for health and safety in the food field."
"It is in the spirit of Amsterdam, Commissioner, that we are all addressing you today."
"The progress of this Green Paper through the European Parliament has been accompanied by detailed conferences and major debates."
"I think it is timely that we now hear the view of the Commission."
"There are just two or three points that I would make, briefly, from the consumer point of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Firstly, we want the Commission to state here that there will be a framework directive on food and to tell us what the timetable for that directive would be."
"We support - and hope to hear a robust view on this from the Commission - the notion that primary products should be included in any product liability directive."
"Whilst I hear what my colleague, Mrs Hardstaff, has said, we hope that our colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will listen to what we say about the need to encourage consumer confidence in foodstuffs, which is also in the interests of the primary producers themselves."
"We also wish to see the consumer voice integrated into European Union policy-making procedures."
"In the wake of BSE, DG XXIV was given a significant role in the whole area of food policy."
"But we still see the agriculture and industry directorate taking the predominant role."
"We do not for a moment question that all these directorates have their own responsibilities, but we would ask Commissioner Bangemann and his colleagues to tell us that the consumer voice and the consumer interest should always be taken into account - formally so - when legislation concerning food and food safety is before the Commission and this Parliament."
"My last point is on labelling."
"We had a great march of the farmers a couple of weeks ago in London."
"But the petition that was handed in to Downing Street this week, bearing a million signatures, referred to the need for proper food labelling, which can counteract the misleading claims that are often made."
"We believe that the labelling provisions currently buried in myriad different directives need to be drawn out and brought together if we are to have a proper and effective control of this area."
"We have to sustain the European Union as a major food producer and a major exporter."
"The best way we can do that is by setting standards that can command the admiration of the whole world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all delighted with the Green Paper and all of us sitting here would wish to have - and we would also like to hear this from the Commissioner -a framework directive."
"Please allow me to say that the present report can be judged very positively."
"I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Graenitz on it, though I would also like to clarify one particular point of her report, namely paragraph 59, in which Directive 79/112/EEC is addressed."
"The European Commission envisages in its proposal to amend this directive that the Advisory Committee on Wine of the European Commission will be responsible for determining appropriate labelling requirements for wine, and not the food committee permanently set up by the directive."
"In its first draft, the Economic and Social Committee still intended the food committee to be responsible for the labelling."
"In its final opinion, the ESC comes out in favour of the Commission's proposal."
"Parliament too declares itself in favour of the Commission's proposal in a draft opinion."
"Please allow me to state at this point that beside the practical reasons for a special approach to the labelling of wine and wine products -where all wine producers and all wine-producing regions are of a like mind -there are many arguments in law in favour of the Commission's proposal."
"And I would not want the opposite view to arise through any misunderstanding in the present report."
"In March 1997 the Legal Service delivered an opinion on the legal base for the proposed regulation introducing a system of labelling and registering of cattle and for identifying beef."
"The issue centred on whether Article 43 of the EC Treaty (agricultural policy) or Article 100a (Single Market) applied as a legal base."
"The report concluded from reference to numerous judgments of the European Court of Justice that Article 43 of the EC Treaty is the correct legal base."
"Legal instruments on the production and marketing of the agricultural products specified in Appendix II of the Treaty may contain provisions for the harmonization of the national regulations without Article 100 or Article 100a of the EC Treaty being referred to."
"In pursuing the aims of the common agricultural policy, the demands of the general interest, such as consumer protection or the safeguarding of the health and life of man and animals, should not be overlooked."
"Health protection should be regarded as being paramount with any agricultural measure."
"Hence we have the European Court's embargo on British beef."
"Because of the reservations I have cited, the respective market organization provisions and the procedures contained therein should be adhered to where the more detailed labelling requirements for additives in wine are concerned."
"I can only hope that a majority of this House shares my view, and I would not want this report to give a false lead in any way."
"Mr President, after thirty years of food law harmonization, the European Commission quite rightly wants to start a debate on ""whither now' , by means of a Green Paper."
"Does the present legal situation surrounding food law still meet the needs of today?"
"In view of the BSE crisis in the United Kingdom and the outbreak of swine fever in my own country, the Netherlands, this is very much a relevant question."
"The Graenitz report is a serious attempt at giving the debate more substance."
"More attention must be paid to labelling, and consumer confidence will increase as a result of the farm-totable approach, which means that complete information on production methods must be given."
"It is also important that the issue of liability is developed further; a proposal for this is ready and waiting at the European Commission."
"Attention is quite rightly drawn to the provisions made by World Trade Organization, the Codex Alimentarius, although this should not lead to lower levels of food protection."
"The report is also about transparency."
"Of course it is essential that results and proposals made by special forums and scientific committees can be monitored, but the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party is against the proposal of a forum to monitor the conversion and implementation of Community regulations which includes Members of the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament has a different responsibility, and should not get involved in such a forum."
"After all, by not being represented on such a forum, the European Parliament's independent position is guaranteed."
"That is why we oppose the last sentence of paragraph 18 of the report, and this we already made clear by way of preparation in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Finally, Mr President, despite that one reservation, I would like to express, on behalf of my group, our support for the Graenitz report."
"Mr President, very briefly I should like firstly to thank the rapporteur, and secondly to welcome this proposal for a Green Paper. It has opened up a debate which is necessary for two reasons: firstly because of the results of the committee of inquiry into BSE - and also the follow-up committee -, but most of all, because of Agenda 2000 and the common agricultural policy reform."
"So we need to know the results of this debate and put them into effect."
"Nevertheless, I think there are already some clear ideas, which are included in Mrs Graenitz' report."
"Examples include: the need for clear, transparent labelling, especially for new products and foods; secondly, the consumers' organizations should have a clear role in this debate; thirdly, we need a very clear idea of what Community law should consist of as regards food, given that at the moment there are so many regulations, sometimes contradictory - as in other sectors -, which need to be simplified and clarified; and lastly, we have to welcome the relative speed with which the Commission has implemented the new scientific committees and the new type of inspection."
"Only experience will tell whether these measures are effective, but the work of the scientific committees will need to be clear and transparent, and they must also have a clear agenda for each of their sessions."
"Mr President, I am speaking in place of Mrs Barthet-Mayer who was due to make this speech but is unable to for health reasons."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to read her speech to you."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Graenitz on her hard work on this report."
"In fact, by publishing the Green Paper, the Commission officially recognizes the huge shortcomings in the Community food system."
"Although the Union has a strong agricultural policy, its policy on food remains to be defined."
"Over and above what appears to no more than anecdotal, there are real economic, political and public health issues at stake."
"The presence of hormones in beef, the fat content of chocolate, the consumption of cheese made from milk straight from the cow, the use of genetically modified seed, all these are not insignificant questions for the public, their elected representatives, the producers and especially for the legislators."
"The main difficulty lies in the actual definition of security and quality, for without a common definition there can be no harmonization."
"What criteria do we use, which scientific basis is our point of reference?"
"How do we make allowances for the irrational or the emotional?"
"Where do cultural differences stop and protectionist manoeuvring or commercial opportunism start?"
"The Commission is proposing to sort out the multitude of regulations and directives which deal directly or indirectly with food."
"This is absolutely necessary, for at the moment it seems that, without having succeeded in defining a real food policy, the Union has drawn up too much legislation, which paradoxically has not resulted in better harmonization."
"So we can only welcome this initiative in the more general context of efforts undertaken to guarantee food safety."
"Mr President, the Commission's Green Paper should have been used to present an in-depth critical analysis of the situation, but all it does is describe the problems."
"They are all presented at some length, but none of them is examined in any depth."
"This is in direct contrast to the reality of the situation we are all experiencing day by day."
"Public opinion still has no faith in the Commission's ability to exercise control."
"The European Parliament has not been given reliable answers to the many criticisms it has raised during the past few months. Even international bodies such as the World Health Organization have expressed great concern and alarm at the risk of the spread of epizootic disease within the European Union, because of the lack of an effective coordination system at local, regional, national and Union-wide levels."
"It has even withdrawn its proposal to create a food safety agency, to this House's surprise. All it has done is implement an administrative reorganization - which will not achieve anything - and increase the number of scientific committees which, unless they are co-ordinated, given muscle, and balanced one against another, will not be at all effective either."
"We still think there is a need to set up a European food safety agency, and to coordinate and stimulate the great potential of the Member States as regards scientific ability and, of course, inspection. We must not forget that more than 45 000 inspectors throughout Europe are a great deal more than the small handful of inspectors which can be created from scratch, and would be much more efficient."
"What we need is to create high-level inspection, and boost the abilities of the Member States, because that will increase consumer confidence."
"Mr President, the European consumer needs to have increased confidence in food, not least after the BSE crisis."
"In this context I would like to congratulate Mrs Graenitz on a good report which raises many issues, perhaps even too many sometimes."
"However, there is one thing I do not agree with: Amendment No 28."
"We must have food production which means that there are no residues of chemicals or medicines, for example, in our food."
"However, we must also have food production and a production system which means that we do not handle foods in the wrong way during production."
"On this point there is a mistake concerning the use of antibiotics as growth stimulants in our food, not because there is any problem with the food, but because it means that antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria will also become a problem for human health."
"This should therefore be added to the text."
"Mr President, I would like to ask a rhetorical question. How do you explain a situation in which ECU 1.5 billion worth of animal hormones are sold in the EU every year, although their use is prohibited?"
"I will provide an answer to my own question: an insatiable thirst for profit."
"We were once in a position to avoid animal and plant disease through border controls, preventing the importation of vermin and pests."
"In our common market we are at the mercy of others, and Mrs Graenitz' observations are mostly quite justified."
"I do wonder a little at the attitude of the European National Party when it intends to revise and thus weaken them."
"In Holland and other countries the original nature of national identity is being stripped away in the name of chicken and pig feed."
"We possibly need antibiotics for the prevention of salmonella and other diseases."
"And how can we explain away the fact that genetically altered maize, soya and other natural produce may be used in the production of food without notifying consumers?"
"The same goes for irradiated food."
"Choice means being able to make conscious choices."
"The Green Paper is not enough."
"We must dare to face up to the reality of the matter."
"Mr President, a major problem with the EU's food legislation is that from the beginning it was not actually aimed at producing better food, but at guaranteeing free movement of food products."
"Mrs Graenitz has a completely different approach, a consumer-friendly approach, which is quite admirable, but she has not dealt properly with the question of the extent to which harmonization for the purpose of securing the Single Market is perhaps not always such a good method for bringing about the highest possible food standards."
"As an Austrian, she knows that this has created problems for the newest Member States."
"For example, because of EU rules, Sweden has already been forced to permit banned feed additives, relax controls against salmonella and relax labelling requirements, especially with regard to allergy risks. And we now risk being forced to permit irradiation of food and the use of antibiotics."
"If instead we had made use of minimum standards , giving the Member States complete freedom to go further, developments could have been aimed more unequivocally at promoting good food quality."
"I would therefore like to put the following question to Commissioner Bonino: would it not be a good idea if the Commission concentrated more on minimum standards which raised levels everywhere, but which did not prevent some countries from going further?"
"Would that not be better than total harmonization, which is fundamentally a commercial rule aimed at promoting commercial interests, not food quality?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all congratulations to Mrs Graenitz."
"She has handled an extremely wide-reaching area very well, because it is clear that food law in the European Union has gained considerably in importance with the realization of the Single Market and the pursuit of an active consumer policy."
"In view of the large number of regulations and amended provisions, as in relation to BSE, to say nothing of changed expectations, we cannot avoid thinking about simplifying and rationalizing food law, of reviewing the existing provisions."
"Certain basic aims, I think, need to be taken as the starting point of the discussion."
"All foods must be guaranteed to be both safe and harmless."
"The consumers must be able to rely on foods being safe and harmless, and do so in the full knowledge that the diversity and quality of foods in the European regions has been preserved."
"This involves both a healthy and competitive agriculture and food industry."
"A few points about the key words 'simplification' and 'rationalization'."
"It should be the obvious aim of European policy -and we have been fighting for this for some time now - to make European law clearer and easier to understand."
"Inconsistencies need to be eliminated, and above all the comprehensibility of the legal text needs to be improved in the interest of consumers."
"It is also a question of greater transparency for the citizen."
"This is not anything new, but in the area of food law the creation of confidence is vital for people."
"They need to understand what they read."
"Hence a framework food directive is necessary here, which includes both a unified definition of central concepts and the regulation of the general principles governing food law in one outline text."
"Let me quote a second example: the directive on the labelling of food has been in existence since 1979 and has been amended six times since then."
"In addition, there is a wealth of special provisions that make reference to the labelling of individual foods, such as wine, fresh fruit and chocolate."
"The subject of wine has already been addressed today, and I must say to you quite simply, Commissioner, that we are striving for another position to Mrs Flemming's, who is no longer here incidentally."
"I do not find it proper that a Member of Parliament should not claim their vested right to codecision in this matter."
"I think we need to agree that codecision applies to wine every bit as much as to chocolate and fruit."
"That is the way to make progress."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank not only the rapporteur, but also everyone who has taken part in the debate, because it is clear from the general tenor that Parliament is thinking along the same lines as the Commission."
"We have 150 opinions on the Green Paper before us."
"We want to summarize our own opinion on this in a statement before the summer."
"That is all I can say on the timetable."
"We agree with Parliament that we should present a framework directive, but I cannot say when."
"It all sounds very nice to demand that such a framework directive should include a general definition of the various terms and so on, but that is precisely where the problem lies."
"We obviously need to proceed with caution when doing something like this."
"We need to ensure we make it clear, too, where individual provisions need to be amended."
"That is to say, I cannot tell you exactly when we will do this; we will do it as quickly as we possibly can."
"Certainly, we want to implement a clear overall concept."
"The framework directive is part of this process."
"It is quite clear to us that this tangle that has arisen needs to be removed and that the recent deliberations on consumer and health protection need to be taken into account more than they have been in the past."
"It might not be our intention to depart from our successful horizontal regulations, because these are good for innovation and encourage consumer choice."
"Yet there is to be no conflict with quality assurance requirements either."
"Here you find, I hope, the common interest of consumers and producers alike, especially agricultural producers."
"We have already made it clear on various occasions that European industry is essentially competitive through the quality of its products, and agriculture should be the same."
"There should be no unnecessary inconsistencies."
"If the aim is to ultimately arrange things legally, then you can bet we will fall out over this."
"It is always funny to observe how someone who wishes to defend their particular little interest quickly sets up a committee for the purpose, which no-one can look into."
"Things really should not be this way."
"Simplification is a very important goal we are pursuing, as is transparency."
"We will probably be able to rescue ourselves from the dilemma that has so far existed with a series of modern information options."
"The more transparent and comprehensive information you wish to give a consumer, the more the labelling overlooks the consumer's interest in having simple, clear and easy-to-understand rules."
"That is the dilemma in which we find ourselves, so to speak."
"Since today, in the age of the information society, we have very easily accessible information facilities at our disposal, you could imagine that labelling should include the most important information and actually go into detail if particular consumer interests need to be taken into account. However, the great mass of information needs to be available in other ways or else we would run the risk of the labelling not being looked at all."
"As regards genetically modified organisms, I said months ago that, if we take this as far as certain sections of Parliament envisage, then practically 90 % of all foodstuffs will have to carry an appropriate label."
"I recently heard - to my amazement as well as to my satisfaction -the same opinion expressed, if I am not mistaken, by a German member of the Green group, who said: well, if 90 % is labelled, what significance does that have for the consumer?"
"I have always made a point of saying this too at conferences we have held and I hope we will be able to agree on what is really in the interest of the consumer and what does not amount to simply translating quasi-religious convictions into practice."
"I would like to note on the question of food control that we want to build up our own team of inspectors and begin training European veterinary and foodstuff controllers."
"It goes without saying that inspectors from the Member States can be included in this too."
"I think those are the main points."
"I have just another brief comment on the foreign trade aspect."
"There are two reasons why we share Parliament's view that we need to be careful here."
"Firstly, the proposals for the legal provisions will obviously need to bear in mind the international obligations."
"There is no other alternative."
"If we are a member of an international rights community, then we must stay with it."
"We cannot take our leave when it suits us."
"Secondly, we should try to implement the things we believe to be right at international level and actively collaborate on the work programme of the Codex Alimentarius and the World Trade Organization, instead of simply reacting defensively towards them."
"We have been actively involved in this sense in trying to get other legitimate factors, besides the scientific findings, included in the elaboration of food standards within the framework of the Codex, because, as we have all bitterly experienced, scientific findings merely epitomize the state of knowledge at a particular point in time and become dated at another."
"That is to say, it is possible to do more for the consumer in terms of prevention."
"And this is precisely what we wish to do!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 12.00 noon tomorrow."
"Decentralized Community institutions"
"The next item is the report (A4-0035/98) by Mr Kellett-Bowman, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposals for Council Regulations amending: I. Regulation (EC) 40/94 on the Community trade mark (COM(97)0489 - C4-0601/97-97/0253(CNS)) II."
"Mr President, this report proposes revised financial rules for the statutes of the nine decentralized bodies or agencies."
"It is complicated because it deals with all nine separately and it is necessary to submit amendments in nine sets."
"It was passed in Budgetary Control with one vote against."
"This is explained in the minority opinion which suggests that on three of the agencies Parliament is not clawing back as much power as it should."
"The amendments from Budgets are contained in Mr Tappin's excellent opinion which was supported unanimously in the committee, and the amendments were all taken on board in Budgetary Control."
"So much agreement, Mr President, that there have been some criticisms."
"Perhaps it would helpful if I explained what the report is not: it is not an attempt by Budgets and Budgetary Control to do the work of the appropriate spending committees; it is not an exercise which is being carried out without consulting the agencies themselves; it is not an attempt to turn agencies into milch cows which will feed the EC budget."
"The second-generation agencies were put in place by the Commission with statutes which did not contain the financial safeguards which exist for the two first-generation ones."
"Upon which safeguards are we insisting?"
"First, European funds should be expended only with the positive approval of the Commission's financial controller."
"With the help of their financial controller proper arrangements will now be legislated for."
"Secondly, there was no provision for discharge to be granted by this Parliament."
"The Director-General for the EC budget has cooperated so that EP grants discharge for six of the agencies; but three of them, those that are fee-earning, will be allowed to grant themselves discharge on the recommendation of this Parliament."
"Thirdly, the same three agencies, which can be funded by fees, are to be controlled by the rules whereby income should be considered Community own resources."
"Mr Tappin will explain how it is proposed to deal with possible problems in his area."
"Faced by a united front of the Budgets and Budgetary Control Committees, the Commission has been very helpful in assisting Parliament to regain control over the agencies."
"Unwittingly, this Parliament conspired to assist the Commission in its original proposals."
"The founding documents were passed to the spending committees but the Budgets and Budgetary Control Committees were not asked for their opinions."
"Much extra work could have been avoided if European Parliament officials had not been blind to the financial aspects of the Commission's proposals."
"More care should be given to the task of allocation of reports to committees."
"Failure to do so clearly weakens Parliament's position."
"All the agencies but one seem happy with our proposals, and it is very much in the area of Mr Tappin's opinion that their opposition is founded."
"But, in the main, that agency resents the fact that Parliament considers itself responsible - jointly with the Council - for providing funds."
"Its own responsibility for dealing with the matter of discharge is a matter which has raised a lot of correspondence, often ill-informed, and when I have had to deal with correspondents, the first question I asked them was: ' have you read the report?' ."
"And of course, they have not."
"That is the problem: you cannot comment on things that you have not read."
"Mr President, I invite the house to support this report."
"Mr President, I also take this opportunity to thank not only my friend Mr Kellett-Bowman, the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control, for his excellent report and also for the great support he has given me as draftsman for the Committee on Budgets but also to Mr Mingasson and his team for the very positive approach they have adopted in this matter."
"The background to this report goes back several years when both the Committee on Budgets and Committee on Budgetary Control were concerned about the lack of clarity in the founding regulations of the nine satellite agencies with reference to own resources, financial control and discharge."
"The report you have before you is the culmination of two or three years' work behind the scenes by Mr Kellett-Bowman, myself and the Commission to bring forward a document which will harmonize the regulations for the satellite agencies."
"We have had a number of disagreements on the subject but at the end of the day, while I could wish for some tightening of the proposals in certain cases, on the whole I feel that we have achieved a reasonable workable compromise."
"The work carried out by the agencies of the European Union which currently employ over 1 000 people is of great importance."
"They were set up by the European Union for a specific purpose."
"In fact, it is clear that although these bodies have legal personality, they would have no existence if they were not required to serve the EU and its citizens."
"So, it is necessary that they are able to carry out their tasks efficiently and with all the independence of action required to make the sort of operational decisions necessary to complete their assigned work programme."
"Equally, because they are not independent commercial organizations but part of a public corpus, they must be held accountable and responsible to the public through democratic and transparent processes."
"That is why this report has come about."
"It is to increase the levels of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the decentralized satellite agencies."
"It is not efficient to have a hotchpotch of different organizations and it is not accountable to have half a dozen different types of accounting, report-back systems and discharge processes."
"We also wanted to improve partnership relations between the decentralized bodies of the EU and those at its heart."
"Our research has shown that these agencies do not need more controls."
"They, in fact, need fewer but more efficient ones."
"I shall concentrate on the own-resources part of the report since the discharge and financial control aspects have been covered excellently by Mr Kellett-Bowman both in his speech and in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Despite the scare stories generated by one agency, what we are proposing is that self-generated resources - the own-resources component - which are surplus to requirements of that year's budget, after the needs of the reserve to cover the obligations of the coming year have been taken into consideration, and fully respecting the fact that fees shall quite rightly be renegotiated as a matter of course, shall be returned to the European Union budget."
"This should be done in line with the Financial Regulations which apply to all other generated resources."
"It does not indicate that Parliament intends to turn for example the Trademarks Agency or any other agency into a milch cow for the European Union, as Mr Kellett-Bowman has said."
"Nor do we intend to make the ordinary business of those who wish to register an EU trademark subsidize singlehandedly the common agricultural policy or the enlargement of the Union."
"Such stories are irresponsible."
"But what is also irresponsible is the commitment of one agency in Alicante to purchase an ECU 24 million building without properly informing either the budgetary authority or the Commission, which have responsibility for it, or without making any mention of that project in the budget estimates passed by the Commission and Parliament."
"If ever there was a case for mandatory transparency and accountability, I have to say that the director and the management board, including the Commission representatives, of the Alicante Agency have made it admirably."
"If this or any other EU agency ceases to be able to fund itself, there is no question that, according to the current regulations, the EU must have a responsibility for the bodies we establish, just as they have a responsibility to the institutions of the Union."
"We do not set up monopoly businesses and turn them loose to stand or fall."
"This report is about safeguarding those responsibilities."
"I urge the House to support it."
"Mr President, the agency is a matter for the initiated."
"That is why I would like to congratulate Mr Kellett-Bowman and Mr Tappin on their report, for the agencies are indeed something for specialists particularly from a budgetary point of view."
"As general rapporteur for the 1998 budget, I had the pleasure of gaining an insight into the activities of the agencies."
"I would like to report on this. We had a meeting with the agency director in March of last year."
"We reached agreements on the needs of these agencies in the 1997 budget and the 1998 budget, and we discussed the problems already mentioned here."
"We agreed on working together and developing the greatest possible transparency in order to create trust between the agencies and the section of the budgetary authority representing Parliament."
"Today I have to say that the majority have adhered to this, but some have not."
"The translation centre, for example, decided to increase its staff from 68 to 115, while Alicante - Mr Tappin has just spoken about this - and London quickly allocated ECU 300 000 from surplus income before the end of the budget year so as not to have to justify this in principle to the budgetary authority."
"Those are actions in themselves, which perhaps have their own reasons, but to take action without informing the budgetary authority is the surest way to generate mistrust."
"I consider Amendment No 1 in the Kellett-Bowman report to be the key element for the agencies in London and Alicante and for the Trademarks Agency."
"Here both the Commission and the Council should take the position of the European Parliament very seriously."
"For three years we have constantly decided in the budgetary procedure on zero growth for the staff of the Commission, as well as the other European institutions."
"Where the agencies are concerned, there has been an average annual growth of 17 % in staff."
"I ask myself whether this is an honest or dishonest game the Commission and the Commissioners responsible are playing, or have the agencies already escaped control here if such abuses are able to occur?"
"The Group of the European People's Party will not tolerate the EP being deprived of its rights through the formation of agencies and all that comes with it."
"I am not bothered about the work of the agencies; observing the Financial Regulations and respecting the budgetary authority is what concerns me."
"We cannot fight for the full democratic control of budgetary expenditure in the European Union, whilst the agencies continue to evade the Financial Regulations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial control of the activities of the decentralized Community agencies was simple when there was only a few agencies and they managed activities which had limited impact and small budgets."
"But the situation is very different today."
"There are now many more decentralized agencies which meet much more widespread needs."
"The difficulty in terms of financial control is that of organizing this diversity in order to arrive at a standard method which is simple and efficient."
"Mr Kellett-Bowman has proposed to include in one report the eleven discharge procedures which cover simultaneously the three agencies which are not financed by the European Union budget, but from financial resources resulting from their own activities, and the eight other agencies which are not self-financing."
"Basically, we want common standards applied to all Community agencies in terms of financial control, and to offer similar guarantees in terms of the legal and administrative management of credits."
"The proposal by the European Commission responds to this concern."
"However, the rapporteur proposes an approach which is more pragmatic and efficient in order to avoid the delays in unfreezing credit and payment commitments caused by the waiting period required for the approval of DG XX in Brussels."
"The rapporteur's solution has the advantage of side-stepping the pitfalls both of financial management which is too centralist and which could lead to freezing or at least blocking of the activities of the Community agencies, and a dispersal of financial control under the pretext of autonomy, running the risk of an upward drift in the use of public funds."
"The law must adapt to reality, and it is essential to give agencies which are undergoing full expansion the means to develop."
"I will quote only one example, that of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market in Alicante which has been hugely successful and whose achievements are generally greater than expected."
"Experts were expecting an annual volume of 15 000 registered trademarks in 1996."
"It received 40 000."
"Currently, the office publishes 1 000 registered trademarks each week, that is, twice as many as predicted."
"This sort of progress should be encouraged for other agencies too, and the control of their financial activities should not stand in the way of their development."
"So in this spirit, myself and my group welcome Mr Kellett-Bowman's proposals and we will vote for them."
"Mr President, we in the Green group have fought for and supported several of the decentralized EU bodies to which the report applies in various different contexts, for example, the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen and the European monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia in Vienna."
"Since these bodies are financed partly by the EU's budget, it is both logical and desirable for the European Parliament to be involved in granting freedom from liability through our role as a supervisory body."
"It is also necessary and logical for any income of these bodies to be shown in the EU's budget so that we can get a complete picture of the financial situation."
"These amendments are a step in the right direction, because they increase transparency and openness concerning EU bodies."
"It is a goal for all institutions and bodies in the EU to have increased openness, not least so that irregularities are prevented."
"The best system of supervision is openness and publicity."
"The Green group is therefore going to wholeheartedly support the KelletBowman report."
"Mr President, I wish to say that the report that is being submitted for approval by the part-session is one that we must support since it is the culmination of long and assiduous research and debate in the Committee on Budgetary Control and, I assume, in the Comment on Budgets."
"I would also like to say that, as a general principle - and this is also proposed by the Commission - there must be provision for a procedure of discharge for those independent organizations which are funded exclusively by Commission funds, as is proposed for the two formerly independent organizations, one of which is the well-known CEDEFOP."
"The problem arises for those independent organizations which are fee-earning and which are partly funded by the Community budget."
"In these cases the Commission simply requests in its proposal that there be a recommendation on the part of the European Parliament."
"I wish to say that, in this case, there are grounds for a minority opinion, and this is contained in the explanatory statement of the report."
"The grounds for this minority opinion are justified but they must not lead us to solutions other than those proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Kellett-Bowman."
"However, we must recognize this issue and it should be of concern to us."
"The fact that an independent organization can have self-generated resources does not mean it should be unaccountable in terms of its expenditure when, at the same time, it receives a part of its funds from the Commission and, most importantly, it intends to serve a Community purpose which is one of the aims of the European Union."
"I will finish with a request and a reminder, which I am constantly repeating: the European Parliament, the Presidency and the political groups must consider and must face the problem of the reorganization of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"This committee has developed into a major organ of Parliament and it cannot function with its present constitution."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report."
"In bringing all the strands together he has responded to the Commission proposal, which I also warmly welcome."
"I was in the House when the Commissioner gave his promise some two years ago - if I remember correctly - that he would come forward with this because it was an element which had been forgotten in the shaping of the operation of these agencies in the first stage."
"Our rapporteur is absolutely right that there is a need for financial safeguards for the second-generation agencies, but I am not convinced, myself, that we would have actually got to this particular point in dealing with these agencies if we, as a parliament, had not used our powers for putting money in the reserve to actually compel the agencies to do what we had wanted to do in terms of parliamentary accountability."
"So, looking at the substance, the rapporteur is right in terms of the proposals on discharge."
"It is not just desirable;"
"I think it should be a prerequisite, as he suggests."
"Secondly, in terms of financial control, we should make sure that we avoid, if possible, the need to put a financial controller in every agency."
"Let us hope, therefore, that the proposals of the Commission will be sufficient to make sure this job will be done effectively."
"The last point I would address is the question of the odd man out - of the agency in Alicante, where it pretends that it would like to be dealt with in a different fashion because it is not quite the same as all the other agencies."
"Once you have an element of an agency being controlled by European law, when you have the staff which are part of the European institutions, you cannot claim that there is an exception."
"You have to be treated in the same way as others."
"I conclude that our rapporteur has shown us the way to go, but that we, as a parliament, need to rest vigilant in the way in which these agencies will be operating."
"It is an entirely new area of activity."
"So we will keep our eyes open as the future comes along."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow."
"Closing of the session"
"I declare closed the 1997-1998 session of the European Parliament and announce that, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, Parliament will meet at 9.00 a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday, 10 March 1998."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.10 p.m.)"
"Opening of annual session"
"I declare the 1998-1999 session of the European Parliament open."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Monday, 9 March 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to refer to Item 2 of the Minutes of yesterday's sitting, and return to the subject of crime in Brussels."
"It states here that the President said this item should not actually have been in the Minutes, although it was certainly in the Minutes for the Friday of the last part-session."
"The President also mentioned that he would inform the two signatories of the request for a topical and urgent debate in writing."
"Could the Bureau please consider whether this could not be debated here in plenary?"
"We know that over a third of Members have been victims of criminal acts in Brussels, so that this really affects everyone and not just one or two people in this House."
"I really think it is high time something was done about this in Parliament."
"As you know, this matter is not on the agenda."
"Moreover, I have nothing to add to what Mr Gil-Robles GilDelgado said yesterday."
"The Presidency is very concerned about the problem and has taken all the necessary steps with regard to the Belgian authorities."
"We will report any concrete news immediately."
"Are there any further comments?"
"Mr President, my point concerns page 15 of the Minutes."
"There is a list there of the questions for Question Time to the Commission."
"My question, which is on structural funds and eligibility for structural funds, has been put down under 'Any Other Questions' , and yet earlier in the afternoon Mrs Wulf-Mathies, the Regional Affairs Commissioner, is answering questions."
"I would ask your services to look at that and see if this question about the structural funds could be transferred so that it gets an answer from the Commissioner concerned."
"Thank you."
"Mr McMahon, we will see if this correction can be made but, as you know, this is a task that normally falls to the Commission."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"The euro: public administrations, tourism and legal convergence"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0061/98 by Mr Arroni, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission communication 'Practical aspects of the introduction of the euro' (COM(97)0491 - C4-0524/97) and the Commission working paper entitled 'Preparations for the changeover of public administrations to the euro' (SEC(97)2384 - C4-0025/98); -A4-0078/98 by Mrs Torres Marques, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the euro and tourism; -A4-0070/98 by Mr Wolf, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the report of the European Monetary Institute on legal convergence in the Member States of the European Union (as at August 1997) (C4-0560/97)."
"Mr President, 11 Member States have already presented transition plans."
"The euro is now a reality that is becoming more and more concrete every day, but that does not mean we can regard it without particular apprehension and attention."
"Consumers, small traders and small businesses require a lot of attention, and we have taken them into consideration in drawing up the report and presenting the amendments. However, we must not forget the other operators who will also be involved in this important transition: the large financial institutions and large businesses which provide work for millions of European citizens, and which will manage to absorb the economic repercussions of the entry into force of the euro with greater ease."
"They are all involved, and public administrations will be the first to set the example: dual pricing will create a snowball effect which will then be imitated by the world of private business."
"I congratulate the Commission for setting the objective of reaching final decisions on the practical aspects of the euro on 2 May."
"Then everything will be clear and transparent, not only for the large operators but for the small traders as well."
"The administrations, trade unions and consumer associations of the Member States will be responsible for making these decisions known and making these choices understood, so that the transition to the euro takes place under the best conditions. They must ensure that the banking system observes its commitments and that businesses respect dual pricing, which will be essential in enabling the citizen to understand the transition."
"To do this, I believe it is very important not to forget the aspect of communication in these decisions, because these decisions have to be understood and accepted by the citizen."
"And for that to happen, the Parliament and the Commission need to reflect together to find the best means of making the euro popular."
"For this purpose, I have proposed a round table for all major European professional communicators to contribute towards explaining all the innovative aspects, not only to the large industries and banks, but above all to us, the consumers, and to our small traders, the local trade we need to protect and save."
"On 26 February, the Commission also organized a round table that developed well and broadly answered the concerns set out in my report."
"Once again, however, I wish to recall a few brief points."
"Particular attention should be paid to the disadvantaged social groups among the population, including the elderly, those on low incomes and people with disabilities."
"We should ensure that small and medium-sized businesses do not risk becoming less competitive compared with the larger businesses that can access information more easily."
"Dual pricing will have to be optional to give the markets greater flexibility."
"The period of dual circulation of bank notes - of national currencies and the euro - should be as short as possible to avoid complications for consumers and to limit additional costs to the financial system."
"The banking and financial sectors should adopt a code of good practice on conversion charges, observing the principle of free compulsory conversions between national currencies and the euro."
"The information sector will play an extremely important role as it will constitute an important vehicle for increasing public awareness about the euro."
"The transition to the euro is the most important challenge Europe has faced this century, and the wellbeing of we Europeans in the first century of the new millennium will depend on correctly and carefully meeting this challenge."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, legal convergence of national central banks is not just a technical detail."
"It is essential, institutionally speaking, for the introduction of the euro."
"This is not the right time to be discussing problems about the overall concept of the euro project."
"We will have a chance to do that when we discuss Mrs Randzio-Plath's report and when we debate the outcome of the Cardiff Summit, which will once again be considering how to match the single currency with an effective and coordinated European employment policy."
"But now to specifics."
"As members of the left, we have had to learn the hard way that institutions are not like Lego bricks that you can put together and pull apart however you like. They have their own history and must enjoy the confidence of the people they serve."
"The European Monetary Institute's report, which quite rightly takes as its theme the two key issues of the independence of the European Central Bank and of the European System of Central Banks, and the proper functioning of this system as a unified whole, goes somewhat beyond compatibility issues. The report more or less envisages standardizing all the various forms of anchorage found in the national central banks."
"In Austria this takes the form of participation in managing boards, in Germany consultation rights, and in France very close links with government as regards consultation and objectives."
"So there are wide variations in practice, and I think we need to approach all this very carefully. We have to decide which of these practices are genuinely incompatible with using the ESCB to develop a single monetary policy for Europe, and which are incompatible with the proper functioning of the ESCB as a single system."
"I have in mind various forms of consultation with governments and parliaments, and an inclusive approach towards civil society and social dialogue."
"We also have to take national economic policy into account."
"We should be advocating a basic strategy in all these areas, with a focus on eliminating incompatibility and providing a clear basis for single monetary policy."
"This also applies to the relationship between the ESCB and the tasks that will still be performed by national central banks, notably banking supervision in some cases and collateral business in all cases."
"Of course it is vital to guarantee compatibility here, but there is no call for standardization or harmonization."
"We should not embark on this process lightly, as it genuinely represents a great challenge and involves many uncertainties. We should treat the various existing forms of anchorage as a chance to construct a kind of network of anchorages for national banks, so that the European System of Central Banks is firmly rooted in the individual Member States, in much the same way as happened with the Bank deutscher Länder ."
"Monetary policy is simply too important to be entrusted to a small group of bankers in a democratic nirvana."
"That would be tantamount to making it subject to the whim of the financial markets and removing it from any kind of joint political decisionmaking arena."
"The various forms of integration that have shaped our national banks over the years, and which still exist today, could help to avoid this sort of mistake."
"So where existing systems work, we should allow them to remain, instead of trying to agglomerate and standardize everything."
"If we can approach this matter in this spirit, I believe we will be doing the euro project a great favour."
"If we take the opposite approach, we will be doing it a great disservice."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like the Peres Rojo report, the Wolf, Torres Marques and Arroni reports demonstrate that the days of theoretical debates about monetary union are over: the problems before us now are highly practical ones."
"I welcome the extent of progress on legal convergence, and the trend towards greater independence for national central banks in the European Union. At the same time, our discussions with the presidents of the central banks suggest that there is an increasing willingness on their part to enter into a dialogue on monetary matters with national parliaments."
"All this progress on monetary union is to be supported."
"The independence of central banks is certainly an important aspect of legal convergence."
"However, the panoply of practical questions surrounding the introduction of the euro is also important."
"Mrs Torres Marques has quite rightly pointed out that the first people to notice that something has changed, that they are living in 'Euro-Land' , will be tourists. As the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs' hearing demonstrated, that it why it is so important for us to explain that the advent of the euro will cut costs, and this will in turn result in savings for people travelling in the European Union."
"We know because of things like the International Tourism Fair that Europeans are especially fond of travel. Not only is travel a growth sector, it will also give a great many people their first experience of the euro and monetary union."
"However, all the other practical things involved in introducing the euro are also important, and it is therefore our duty as a European Parliament to express our regret that neither our citizens nor our small and medium-sized businesses have been given adequate preparation or information."
"The European Parliament must appeal not only to the European institutions to prepare people and SMEs for the euro - national governments and administrations also need to play their part."
"This is fundamental, as we cannot prepare ourselves without information."
"Consumer protection also has to play a greater part in the run-up to monetary union. I am therefore specifically requesting, and not for the first time, that there should be a period of dual pricing, that there should be no conversion costs, and that the transition period should be as short as possible, so as to minimize the burden on both companies and ordinary citizens."
"SMEs particularly need help, because the euro will enable them to take full advantage of the internal market for the first time."
"If this is to happen, the authorities absolutely must play a more positive and constructive role, and do what the European Parliament has specifically requested, and lead the way in introducing the euro, even if finance ministers have agreed to delay conversion in public administration until 1 January 2002."
"We need cooperation from public authorities at local, regional and national level, and I particularly want to see the tax authorities converting to the euro!"
"Mr President, in exactly 297 days the euro will be introduced in the countries taking part in monetary union."
"It is still just a little too far away to tell children it will be another so many nights' sleep before conversion."
"But for grown-up administrators it is high time to decide on the practical aspects of the euro."
"This, in any case, is what the man and the woman in the street expect of their government."
"They want clear answers to their questions, also the questions on the tiniest detail as to how it will all work, and they want a workable method without burdens and costs which could be avoided."
"The Arroni report has therefore arrived not a moment too soon, and it is this report I will be discussing on behalf of my Group."
"The rapporteur has done an excellent job, and we would like to offer him our congratulations. The report dwells not only on the obvious aspects, such as information programmes and costs, but it rightly draws attention to the weaker sections of society."
"We believe that the introduction of the euro will only be successful if the disabled, the very old and the poor are able to change over to the euro without running into problems."
"What must be avoided at all costs is that the introduction of the euro leads to a reinforcement of division within our society."
"As far as the display of dual prices is concerned, Mr President, I am glad to note that the report is on the same wavelength as the Commission."
"During the round table discussion to which the rapporteur referred, the Commission stated clearly that it is not a priori in favour of statutory regulations on dual pricing."
"Our Group fully agrees with this."
"Dual pricing can be useful for information purposes, but it is merely one of the many alternatives."
"We must ensure the consumer does not drown in a sea of information, and we should avoid forcing the retailer and the service provider to make one-off investments which will only be of use for a limited period."
"It would be much better to leave the price display options - which are by definition temporary - to the market and the creativity of the people involved."
"If the information the retailer gives to his customers is not clear enough, he will be the first to feel the consequences."
"As spokesperson for the Group of the European People's Party on this matter, I also think we should have sufficient confidence in the market and the laws of competition, particularly during the first phase. Statutory regulations will only be useful if and on condition that it is determined that optional dual pricing does not lead to the hoped-for result."
"We are therefore not able to support the amendments proposing that dual price display be laid down in a regulation."
"Another practical aspect of the introduction of the euro is the effective changeover from the relevant national coins and notes to the euro."
"There is a lot of disagreement on this issue, and a new debate is being held between those in favour of statutory regulation and those in favour of codes of conduct and voluntary arrangements."
"Here the Commission has also nailed its colours to the mast and has shown itself in favour of codes of good conduct."
"My group agrees, on condition that in these codes the guiding principle should be that there is no cost attached to compulsory conversion."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to one further aspect."
"The banks are considering charging small shopkeepers for converting large quantities of coins."
"This is not acceptable."
"The small shopkeeper will be asked to play an important role in the changeover process."
"The fact that this is expected of him should be enough."
"We simply think it would be too much if the banks were to make him pay for the kind of work they provide for free to a private client."
"In conclusion, may I perhaps suggest a short transitional period and, during this period, a sharing out of the cost benefit resulting from the fact that exchange rates will have disappeared during the changeover."
"Obviously, these paragraphs meet with my Group's approval."
"Mr President, from our understanding of what the rapporteurs have said, the euro is a small, peaceful, end-of-century revolution, which in practice will obviously change our entire modus operandi, whether as businesses or as consumers."
"But behind every revolution lie the specific psychological aspects."
"The great problem we will have to face in the next few years, particularly in the six months of coexistence between national currency and single currency, will be that of making businesses and the public understand that the euro is a means of building Europe - and a strictly economic means."
"We are hoping for an economic and social Europe, but at the moment the euro is the fundamental means of making people understand that Europe can be built with something that the citizens can actually touch, see and find in their pockets. Then, as the rapporteurs rightly said, there will be financial involvement on the part of the banks."
"However, the banks have broad shoulders and are organized to send us, as from 1 January, a statement in national currency and in single currency at the same time. The banks are organized with a computer system they have been using for some time, while the real problem of the euro is that of calmly getting it to the citizens as consumers."
"The commercial system, in particular, will perform this arduous task."
"The citizen, as consumer, will go into a bar, a shop, a supermarket, a restaurant or a travel agency and pay in national currency. He will receive the change in euros and it will be there that he actually meets the single currency."
"There he will find an operator, a small businessman, a cashier or an assistant who is familiar with the single currency system because, otherwise, the effect on us will be terrible psychologically."
"A confused consumer, or a small businessman confused over the commercial system when purchases are being made, will cause purchases themselves to slow down - a fall in psychological consumption that, at the moment, is precisely what we do not want."
"There is already a fall in physiological consumption in this continent, and if we add the psychological consequences of a fall in consumption owing to the uncertainty of purchases, we will create problems that are not easy to resolve."
"We should therefore take measures with regard to both information and training."
"Information should obviously be aimed at the public, training should be professional and aimed at different categories, particularly traders. By trade I mean commerce, tourism and services, in other words the tertiary market, the market that will physically meet the single currency."
"French colleagues will recall that in their country, 30 years on, the elderly are still today thinking in terms of old francs and new francs."
"Thirty years ago, two zeros were simply wiped off, and still today they talk in terms of old francs."
"Just think of multiplying the euro by a different figure in each of the 15 Member States when it becomes real currency, on 1 January 2002."
"By that date, it will be essential to have carried out this information and training action jointly, and to ensure that the three market components work together - namely industry, commercial distribution and, above all, the sector forming the vertex of this triangle, the consumers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is really very important, in the sense that it offers us various practical prospects for the application of the euro process."
"We are no longer talking about its chances or viability, because the predictions are that in May a very broad and stable group of Member States will be members of monetary union. Instead, we are talking about specific matters, and the three reports (by Mr Arroni, Mrs Torres Marques and Mr Wolf) deal with specific aspects of its application."
"I think we must stress the need for a major effort to inform the public and small and medium-sized enterprises, to promote awareness within consumers' associations, and to structure the preparations as well as can possibly be done in the two key areas which have been mentioned here: the financial area and the commercial area."
"Also, we must not forget that the European Commission needs to step up its support for small and medium-sized enterprises. That support has been developed over many years and will be strengthened by economic and monetary union."
"It is perhaps in the area of tourism that monetary union will first be noticed, because of the facilities it will provide. Also, the fact that there will no longer be any differences in exchange or currency within the European Union will have positive effects on the sector."
"There is also a more technical but equally important matter, which Mr Wolf spoke about: namely, accountability - in other words, the real transparency which should characterize this whole process, both at the level of Member States' national central banks and at the level of the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank."
"Mr President, I take this opportunity to extend a warm greeting to you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these reports are paving the way for the post-euro period."
"The subjects they discuss are so important, and time so limited, that I must be all the more selective and succinct in my remarks."
"The tourism sector accounts for a sizeable share of the economies of some Member States."
"To the complexity of that sector, with intricate upstream and downstream links, is added the complexity of the different situations existing in individual Member States."
"This complex complexity (if I may put it like that) is not reflected in Mrs Torres Marques' report, which I consider to be excessively optimistic and, if I may be so bold, excessively monochrome - that is, rose-tinted - imbued as it is with the author's unshakeable faith in European construction as it is currently proceeding."
"Tourism, and some individual tourists, will no doubt receive debatable advantages from the introduction of the euro."
"However, we cannot but doubt that there will be nothing but benefits and the benefited."
"Some tourists and, more particularly, some types of tourism, will experience increased difficulties with the emergence of a single currency designed to be strong, losing the ability to use the instruments and mechanisms they have employed in the past."
"It is true that such instruments have not always been applied to best effect."
"But if we deprive people of those instruments they have won but used wrongly, we will all end up empty-handed - and without coins, banking systems and financial policies."
"In the virtual reality of a single, strong currency, shared by countries with different tourism policies, whether complementary or competitive, we cannot ignore or underestimate the tendency for tourism flows to switch to destinations outside Europe, which make themselves more competitive through measures based on exchange-rate policy."
"For our part, for these and other reasons, we thank Mrs Torres Marques for her work but have serious reservations regarding her optimism, her ""tourism at the service of the euro' position, and her appeal for the creation of a European policy for tourism or, more accurately, for the modes of tourism that coexist within the confines of the European Union."
"Finally, I cannot end without briefly referring to Mr Wolf's report, if only to express my satisfaction on reading his explanatory statement in which he lists real problems in a balanced, thoughtful manner which counters a climate of intransigent, blinkered thinking and direction."
"Since I cannot at this time say what I think is necessary and right on this subject, I will reserve a number of comments on this report for an explanation of vote."
"Mr President, this spring the European Parliament is to conduct a very important debate on the democratic monitoring of the European Central Bank."
"It will certainly be a noteworthy occasion, as we will soon be going over Mrs Randzio-Plath's report, which the Green Group in the European Parliament fervently supports."
"Today we are discussing how national central banks and national political institutions can get involved in the democratic monitoring of a central bank and a central bank system."
"This is a subject which has, up till now, been given scanty attention, but now Mr Wolf has produced a very interesting report on the subject."
"He says that given the unfortunate absence of any common economic policy in the Union, the role of the central bank is a vital one as, in a way, it will have to use a certain kind of economic wisdom when taking decisions on funding."
"The European Monetary Institute has completed a report on how compatible the various national laws on finance are with the Maastricht Treaty."
"We are of the same opinion as the rapporteur that the EMI is too much concerned with emphasizing the independence of national central banks from national political institutions."
"We believe it is essential that individual country's parliaments and governments alike maintain links with a system which aims to create a stable currency and stable prices for Europe."
"But, as the rapporteur remarked, price stability is not a neutral concept."
"There has been no mention of what level of inflation would be harmful to the economy."
"In this respect, the EMI should certainly not go it alone in debating this matter."
"It is neither sensible nor proper that the European Monetary Institute should condemn certain national laws as incompatible with a central bank system."
"I shall give an example of this, the same one that the rapporteur also remarked on."
"The EMI is judgemental about Finland's central bank law which states that the President of the country can fire the managing director or any other member of the management if these prove to be unsuitable."
"It is our belief that this must be allowed to continue."
"The European Union is not one homogenous economic area: there is a lot of variation contained within it and that is why, when it comes to a central bank system, the national voice must be heard."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to say that our Group agrees with the reports by Mrs Torres Marques and Mr Arroni, and we fully support the direction they take."
"However, Mr Wolf's report calls for a number of comments."
"The rapporteur in fact allows himself to give a criticism of the EMI report on different levels."
"We would like to point out at the outset that we believe the EMI is perfectly within its remit when it attempts to identify the clauses in national legislation which appear to be incompatible with the requirements of the Treaty on European Union, and that, even if it does challenge this Treaty and all those which have gone before it, it would not be a question of leaving to the political bodies of the Union the task of interpreting and defining the demands and objectives of the Treaty."
"Basically, as regards the functioning of the ESCB, Mr Wolf stresses the demands for transparency and information, which we think are in fact necessary to gain the confidence of the citizens of the Union in the way their currency is managed."
"We share Mr Wolf's concern to prevent the ESCB becoming an ivory tower cut off from its institutional environment and public opinion."
"To ensure that the central banks have adequate information, they need in particular to be able to listen to the representatives of governments or national parliaments."
"It is also essential that the ECB presents and explains to the democratic institutions of the Union, and to the public in general, the decisions taken in carrying out its duty."
"But we believe these demands for transparency and information must not on any account compromise the independence of the ESCB, be it the independence of its members or that of the decisions it takes."
"We believe in this necessary independence, not through any anti-Keynesian convictions, but as a result of our European conviction."
"This conviction leads us to the opinion that it would be dangerous to relaunch the debate on the possible role of the monetary instrument in the implementation of national economic policies."
"In the Treaty on European Union, the Member States renounced the use of this sort of tool. For some this was for economic reasons, and for everyone the fundamental reason was political."
"Whatever the economic preferences of individual countries, it is clear that the choice of a single currency for Europe implies that it evades any national political pressure or manipulation, either directly or indirectly, even if this produces tension between the countries, which could be fatal for the European Union."
"There can be no single currency unless it is an independent currency."
"This is the true general consensus which Mr Wolf wishes for elsewhere."
"From that point on, we cannot follow him; for example, when he reproaches the EMI for considering incompatible with the treaty any legislative clause in which a central bank must take into account the economic policy of the government when implementing its own monetary policy."
"Of course, the independence of the ESCB would not mean that the democratic institutions of Europe were impotent."
"That is why we feel it is urgent to define, alongside the single currency, other means of joint economic action, and those other means would be in the hands of the democratic institutions of the Union, and called the European budget, European tax and European structural policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in both the communication from the Commission and Mr Arroni's report, the players in economic life have been called on not to moderate their efforts, but are we taking them into consideration other than to ask them to accept the euro, or in other words, to ensure the euro gets the best possible welcome?"
"In reading these reports it is thus clear that the rapporteur and the Commission constantly vacillate between uncertainty and contradictions."
"First and foremost physical persons are targeted, and at the forefront of these are those particularly exposed categories for whom the entry into force of the euro means the addition from now on of new problems to already considerable difficulties."
"The report states that these categories require particular attention, but what specific solutions can be proposed to deal with their practical problems?"
"In the light of the exponential increase since 1996 of the costs of media promotion of the euro, which are becoming extremely high, how much will this promotion finally cost for Europe, for the Member States and for each citizen?"
"Despite the investment of considerable sums of money, the citizen as consumer risks being the victim of permanent confusion."
"Mr Arroni recommends a transition period which is as short as possible, unlike the consumer associations which envisage that a short transitory period would mean total confusion for the most vulnerable clients."
"So, which of the options should be chosen: a short transition period which would cost less but create errors and confusion; or a long transition period - we should remember that it could be up to six months - which would allow better understanding thanks to a smooth adaptation, but where the high cost will lead to an increase in consumer prices."
"In terms of the second category of economic players - companies and tradesmen - if two incomes can be difficult to manage for a housewife, what about traders and others who will have to maintain two accounts systems and two cash funds, who needed no increase in the burden of management?"
"On the other hand, although Mr Arroni is proposing to take steps to help SMEs, at the same time he wants to make dual pricing obligatory, under the false pretext of bringing competitive advantage to traders."
"And if it is a matter of wanting to help companies, it turns out that the first possible aid - tax aid in the form of deductiblity of VAT on expenses generated by the changeover to the euro - has already been denied them."
"To sum up, I think the Commission, supported by the Arroni report is currently navigating visually."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Arroni report does not present new ideas, but requires some comment."
"How can we talk of confidence when the whole European monetary structure is built on lies, at least lies of omission?"
"The name of the currency has been changed in violation of the treaties which clearly named it ""ECU' ."
"Our colleague, Mr Berthu, has rightly tabled an appeal with the Court of Justice against this untimely change."
"No-one, neither the Council nor the Commission, much less the European Parliament, has risked the task of trying to evaluate the practical cost of changing over to the euro and to figure out the macro-economics of the move."
"Of course, no-one can hide the fact that there will be a cost."
"The report only mentions this once to say, in passing, that it should be minimal."
"In reality it will be the citizens who pay the hundreds of millions of francs, marks or lira for dual accounting, dual pricing, and the constant conversion between the euro and the national currency which will be required for three years. They will pay through increases in retail prices and bank charges."
"As an aside, everyone is very careful not to mention the consequences for individual savings, especially in France."
"All administered savings, savings bank books and building society savings plans are set to disappear."
"People content themselves with constantly trotting out the false old adages of the European structure: ""without the single currency, the single market does not work; without the single market, we will have a crisis and war' and then the next logical argument: ""without a single European state and integral unification of legislation, the single currency will not work' ."
"The single currency is not an economic necessity but a political wish."
"Everyone knows that but many people pretend not to realize it."
"Our technocrats are not evaluating very well the psychological consequences of the monetary upheaval they are proposing."
"We can inform the public as much as we want, but currency brings about scales of value which it is very hard to get rid of. For example in France, almost forty years after the new franc was brought in, television journalists would still rather refer to billions of centimes than hundreds of millions of francs, to stress the enormity of the sum."
"Old people, and some not so old, continue to convert everything into old francs, because in this form they can better understand relative values."
"Mr President, I believe the euro will electrify Europe, and these three reports demonstrate why."
"In the case of the Wolf report on the legal convergence of national central banks and their relation to the ECB, the essential point is to ensure the transparency and democratic accountability of the ECB and its relations with the national banks."
"Such democratic exposure is not at odds with ensuring the functional independence of the ECB; such ideas are complementary."
"In this regard it is pertinent to mention Mr Wolf's reference to the UK's Bank of England where, under the new Labour Government, the bank's independence and public accountability have both been strengthened."
"In the case of the Arroni report on the practical aspects of the euro, there is common agreement on most items, including the need to encourage Member States to publish changeover plans and, more excitingly, to publish the euro designs of the national face of coins."
"Where I part company with the rapporteur is in my belief that we will need European action to ensure that banks do not pass on to customers conversion costs in stage 3 of EMU."
"A code of conduct might not suffice."
"Finally, regarding tourism, I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs, and especially Mrs Torres Marques for her report."
"Tourism is Europe's and the world's biggest industry, yet here in Europe we have lost 10 % of market share since 1960."
"Tourism is classically an industry of the single market."
"The advent of the euro will be a tremendous supply-side fillip to that market, and to tourism in particular."
"I believe there will be three sets of winners as a result of introducing the euro."
"First, all those who work within the industry."
"Not only will the euro generate more jobs, it will bring transparency to wages and salaries, which in turn will be improved."
"Secondly, tourists - the consumers."
"Instead of giving away their hard-earned money to the money-changers at airports or ports, they will keep more of their holiday money to spend after window-shopping, made easier by the transparency of costs."
"This will make comparison of retail goods in shops easier and consequently, increase competition."
"Finally, entrepreneurs in the travel and tourism industry will make Europe's top industry more competitive, as the transparency of the euro will drive down costs."
"In addition, they will invest and expand in the industry because low inflation will breed lower costs of money."
"Remember this: the European Tour Operators Association reckoned that 3 % more American tourists were liable to choose Europe as their holiday destination because of the euro."
"To conclude, tourism and tourists will be the shock-troops of the euro, bringing the benefits of the euro immediately to the attention of all Europe's citizens."
"Mr President, after the Madrid Summit, at which the date for the introduction of the euro bank notes and coins was fixed, the Commission took a number of initiatives to speed up the necessary preparatory work for both the public and private sectors."
"It is evident today - and I must add that this is to be welcomed - that most sectors of the economy have begun to prepare for the changeover to the single currency."
"However, it must be pointed out - and this is the purpose of Mr Arroni's excellent report - that more information needs to be made available on the practical arrangements put in place in the different sectors of the economy."
"We need to identify the areas where decisions have not yet been taken and to know what level of harmonization is desirable."
"Initially we need to know which areas should be dealt with at national level and which at European level."
"Among the priorities for the Member States was the need to ensure that they presented their transition plans before the end of 1997."
"This included the requirement to make known their position on the statement of public accounting, reporting and tax declarations in euros."
"Decisions on redemptions of existing debt were to have been taken before the end of 1997."
"The Commission should inform us whether or not the various deadlines set for the end of 1997 in its communication have been met and fully respected."
"As regards the practical aspects of the introduction of the euro for those who are going to use the single currency on a daily basis, I want to underline the need for information on the changeover to be targeted on all users, just as it already is on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This is the biggest single economic event in European history, and it would be a disaster if it were allowed to fail because of an information deficit."
"As regards dual pricing during the changeover period, we need to keep our options open."
"The small and medium-sized businesses should be assisted in their efforts to provide dual pricing."
"The proposals made by Mr Arroni in relation to fraud and adapting the information technology sector to the euro are a step in the right direction."
"This also applies to the need for continual assessment of how small and medium-sized companies, including small shopkeepers, are coping with the introduction of the euro."
"Finally, it is accepted by all that the euro must be consumer-friendly if it is to be successful."
"As Mr Arroni says, the Member States must show particular concern for vulnerable social groups in our society, such as the elderly, the visually impaired, the disabled and the low-income groups, with a view to ensuring that the coins and particularly the notes are user-friendly for them."
"I say this as an Irish Member because we in Ireland have practical knowledge and experience of this because of the changeover to decimalization, when prices in our country increased."
"Schools should be closely involved in pilot projects regarding the introduction of the euro, particularly at the early stage."
"Mr President, here we are facing what has been described as the biggest challenge, the biggest economic event, and here am I, a reluctant Member of a Member State called the UK, unable to be other than an onlooker instead of a participant."
"I feel rather like the child in the Pied Piper story whose progress was so slow, who could not keep up with the other children and did not enter the promised land."
"I wish that we had another report before us today to tell us what is going to be the relationship in practical terms between the Ins and the Outs."
"My mind boggles when I think about it."
"There is irony in the fact that the UK presidency will be in the hot seat when the decision is made as to who will be in and who will not, yet the UK is staying outside."
"I say to the UK Government that it would be better to board the train at the beginning of the journey than to clamber on later."
"The latter option might be very difficult."
"I am disappointed that the Council is not represented here today for this big debate."
"Perhaps it is too embarrassed."
"The attitude of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, to this matter was described as if he were proposing marriage but putting off the event for five years and saying that there would be conditions but not saying what they would be."
"That is a ludicrous position."
"The other main British party's position is no better."
"Its leader has closed the door, despite the fact that many of the Conservative Members here are rather pro-Europe."
"My party and my country are pro-Europe on the whole."
"A Eurosceptic north of the Scottish border is quite a rare bird."
"When I go around speaking about the euro - sadly, as an onlooker - I find enormous support from business, exporters, industry and potential tourists."
"I welcome all that has been said about the vulnerability of small businesses and I wonder if the UK is going to introduce any measures to ameliorate their situation."
"Tourism is still the sleeping giant industry of Europe."
"Inter-state tourism could be much larger."
"Recently I addressed a conference of the heads of youth hostel associations for the whole of Europe, outside as well as within the Union."
"They are all in favour of the euro and see it making a tremendous improvement in the lot of their type of tourist, who is relatively poor."
"Tourists will be the first to have this magnificent experience, an experience which I believe will weld us together - at least those fortunate enough to be in the system - and make us true Europeans, when the money in our pockets is the same as we cross the borders."
"I applaud Ireland's performance as a tiger economy and its determination to enter monetary union."
"In conclusion, this is a magnificent piece of European history."
"I am very sad that I belong to a Member State that is keeping me out."
"Mr President, one section of the Commission communication on the practical aspects of the introduction of the euro is devoted to the preparation of coins, but nothing is said about notes."
"So I would like to return to this question which the institutions are trying to pass off in silence, and where I have so far had no response to my many requests."
"Basically, the Council has decided that future coins will have one European side and one national side - but nothing of the sort for notes."
"An obscure decision by the European Monetary Institute, wrongly applied from article 109 F, states that the notes will not display any distinctive national sign."
"So the Council seems to have chosen to discard this issue which is not at all technical, but which calls into question some very important principles, and leave it up to the officials at the EMI."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this House has been very concerned in recent times about the lack of democratic control in monetary union and we are going to discuss this during our next part-session."
"Well, here we have an excellent example of this lack of democracy."
"We must act now, for if we do not our protests will not sound sincere."
"The question of having a national symbol on one side of euro notes raises a number of points of principle."
"It is a question of whether or not we want an undifferentiated monetary union, or a monetary union which recognizes national identities."
"It is also a question of whether, at a later date, if there is a serious crisis, we will accept a country's departure with equanimity, or if we will seek to keep it forever within monetary union, even against its will, and even despite the conflicts this would inevitably cause."
"In this regard too, we must prepare ourselves for a serious problem of democracy."
"That is why the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations thinks the Council should accept its responsibilities, make use of the powers it holds pursuant to Article 109 L.4, and decide that euro notes will have a national side."
"Mr President, on behalf of the National Alliance, I would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs for their truly excellent work."
"The achievement of monetary union and the introduction of the euro as a single currency is one of the most important steps forward along the road to Europe, and tourism is undoubtedly one of the sectors most concerned by the imminent change."
"Tourists, including anyone travelling in European territory for any reason, will no longer have to change their currency and so will not bear the useless charges connected with it."
"They will certainly have a more stable currency and a greater transparency of prices for goods and services purchased in their own countries from abroad."
"Along with these individual advantages for the customer, there are advantages for tour operators, agencies, and everything produced by the tourist sector, certainly facilitated by the ordinary financial management of their business."
"The point I wish to make is that, although these advantages may be obtained, we need to draw up and duly implement a preliminary strategy for this change, for the euro to have the desired effects right from the outset."
"I therefore agree with Mrs Torres Marques when she insists in her report on the need for the national governments to begin a joint action to promote and spread the euro within their respective countries."
"Some examples of early widespread measures to increase awareness are already present in Europe, but we need these operations to be intensified and real simulations of the use of the new currency to be made, both by consumers and by businesses operating in the tourist sector, with adequate information and training for staff and a due adaptation of the computer support to the new financial management."
"These actions are all the more important in those less developed regions of Europe, where the tourist sector is often an economic lever of fundamental significance, where the lack of a timely and effective preliminary strategy for the euro could involve the loss of competitiveness on European markets, with undoubted negative repercussions on the respective local economies."
"I am therefore concentrating not so much on the large tourist centres, which certainly have the necessary infrastructure to control the change, but on the small countries of Europe, rich in culture and tradition, in which the interest of the average tourist is tending to increase."
"It is these countries that have to find adequate support, and to which particular attention should be paid, with appropriate structures to handle the change with a reduction in costs."
"We should not hide the fact that we are proceeding in a random fashion."
"There is no single strategy: if we proceed in a random fashion, the costs will increase and there is the risk that consumers will then bear the brunt of them."
"Those who, like me, have experience of the reality of public administration management are well aware of the need for a preliminary and timely strategy for the transition to the euro. The new currency should provide the local authorities in particular, and the community in general, with an opportunity for growth and development."
"For this purpose, we could perform a sample analysis of the European public authorities, taking care not to choose just the medium-sized to large municipalities, but also introducing into the survey the small municipalities whose requirements are different but no less important."
"To conclude, conducting a pilot project involving several European municipalities could lead to the creation of a real network of cooperation, with the possibility of extending the results of the analysis to other municipalities which are not the specific subject of a study."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's joint debate on the euro based on reports by Mrs Torres Marques, Mr Arroni and Mr Wolf is particularly important in that we are only a few weeks away from the famous weekend of 1 May."
"Of course, I agree completely with the report and conclusions by Mrs Torres Marques."
"Like her, I think the impact of the euro on the Union will be beneficial, not only for tourists coming from outside into Europe, but also for tourism within the Community."
"I also agree that it seems urgent to put in place programmes which would allow the completion of information on the euro for companies and staff in the tourism sector."
"The sooner they are ready, the sooner they will benefit from the effect of the euro."
"As regards the Arroni report, I recall that following our profitable debate in January, we voted together for measures to facilitate the transition from national currency to the euro."
"Today Mr Arroni has submitted a proposal concerning the optional nature of dual pricing, which I feel runs the risk of causing problems for the so-called vulnerable social groups."
"On the subject of conversion charges, I cannot help noticing a certain amount of backing down compared with the text produced by our colleague Mr Pérez Royo."
"Of course, in my capacity as rapporteur on industrial competitiveness, I can understand the concern of my colleague to preserve small and medium-sized enterprises."
"So we must identify specific measures in this regard to minimize as far as possible the cost of their changeover to the euro, but it is not a question of abandoning consumers."
"Finally, on the subject of Mr Wolf's report on convergence, although I can relate to his views on the fact that achieving the euro implies economic convergence and compatibility between legislation, the central banks and the European Central Bank, I must again voice my opposition to certain ideas which smack of excessive liberalism."
"The role of the Central European Bank and the central banks cannot be absolute, not more so than their powers."
"Setting up a dialogue between these economic bodies and political powers is the least we could do before very quickly constructing that political Europe which is the only guarantee of democracy and the voice of the people."
"To conclude, I would repeat that, for me, the euro is a great hope both in economic and employment terms, and above all, an excellent motor for European citizenship."
"There are three conditions for this: it should not be another motor for unbridled liberalism; the public should be informed better and more quickly; and consumers should be the first to benefit."
"Mr President, I will concern myself simply with the report by Mrs Torres Marques, which deals with the effects of the euro on the tourist industry."
"I do not intend to talk about what was discussed so positively in this report."
"I will mention however two points which were regarded as negative but which, in my view, were not sufficiently analysed and to which, ladies and gentlemen, no answers have been given."
"The first concerns the need to create information programmes for those who work in tourism, and also convergence programmes for small and medium-sized tourist enterprises."
"The question I would like to put, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, is: where will the money come from?"
"I remind you that not long ago, in this Chamber, we voted on a budget in which expenditure on tourism was drastically reduced, despite the attempts of several of us on the Committee on Budgets."
"So can you tell me where the money will come from to cover the necessary conversion costs?"
"If not, we are simply indulging in wishful thinking without submitting any concrete proposals."
"The second point concerns those small and medium-sized enterprises which are located in regions close to the euro zone but which will not be in the euro."
"In a question I put to the European Commission, I estimated on the basis of what I had read in the newspapers that each such SME needed approximately ECU 100 000 in order to carry out its conversion procedure."
"Could you please tell me if the Interreg programme is able to cover this expenditure?"
"Because if there is no money in this case, I regret to say that I am not at all optimistic about whether the euro will have positive repercussions for the tourist industry, especially for the SMEs which make up 90 % of this industry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to speak mainly about Mr Wolf's report. It is our firm belief that the Central Bank should be as independent as possible, and that means complete independence, both for the bank and its president."
"That does not mean we are not strongly in favour of transparent decision-making processes, nor do we think the bank will exist in a kind of laboratory situation, determining its policy in some kind of 'clean' mechanism."
"We assume it will do this through dialogue with the entire social framework which is jointly responsible for such processes."
"Mr President, some Members of this Parliament keep wanting to link issues relating to social disadvantage to the euro."
"Our group believes that these are matters which should be dealt with separately."
"All the same, both the Member States and the European Union have a responsibility to talk about policy competition after the introduction of the euro."
"In our opinion, this means we will have to strive towards a certain degree of convergence both in the field of taxation, and in employment and social security. We will also have to determine which issues we leave as subsidiary and which ones we come to a unified joint approach on."
"That is extremely important for the success of the euro in the long term, and for placing Europe on the world map."
"Mr President, the advent of the single currency will certainly create many changes and, at times, not for the better."
"I still believe we are going forward into the unknown with undue haste and without clear knowledge of the longterm effect."
"I listen with concern to those who are driving relentlessly towards the creation of the single currency in their own Member States, regardless of the views of their electorate."
"Some of the countries which are striving to join the first wave will be in for more than a mild shock."
"I would be grateful if someone could answer me one question: if countries that meet the Maastricht criteria become members in the first wave, will some of these countries then turn around and demand Objective 1 status?"
"Surely these two positions are totally incompatible?"
"I wish to refer to one problem I can see looming on the horizon between Member States which enter in the first wave and those which remain outside."
"My own part of the European Union, Northern Ireland, is the only part of the United Kingdom which has a land frontier with another Member State, and the fluctuation between the pound and the punt has caused extreme difficulties on both sides of the border on many occasions over a long period - sometimes one way and sometimes the other."
"I would certainly ask that this should not be allowed to spell disaster for business and agriculture in both jurisdictions."
"At present we can do nothing to improve the situation."
"But can we be assured that unfair trading advantage will receive consideration and equality will be ensured within the European Union?"
"Mr President, today we are discussing practical safeguards involved in introducing the euro, which means we also need to address the protection of consumers' rights."
"Dual pricing during the transition period is an absolute must, and should not be optional as envisaged in the report."
"Businesses' concern to have as much leeway as possible with labelling should not mean that consumer interests are pushed to one side."
"By ensuring transparency, dual pricing can reassure consumers during a period of uncertainty."
"Dual pricing can even give businesses a competitive advantage, if it means they can gain consumers' confidence."
"Even if the European Banking Association and the European Savings Banks Group recently agreed not to pass conversion costs on to their customers, we must watch that this promise is honoured."
"If you read the text carefully, you will in fact see that the banking associations are only talking about ensuring a smooth and fair changeover for customers."
"So the message is not really that the changeover will be cost-free for consumers."
"I therefore welcome a code of behaviour for the banking and finance sector."
"I was struck by the rapporteur's statement that special tax treatment for investment in connection with the introduction of the euro could lead to distortions in competition within a given sector or in relation to other sectors. I say this because just a few days ago, I was reading in an Austrian newspaper about precisely that point being made by an Austrian bank."
"I therefore think it is important to demand equal rights for all, to coin a phrase."
"But it will also be up to Member States' legislatures to safeguard this."
"Mr President, can I start by congratulating the rapporteurs Arroni, Torres Marques and Wolf on three excellent reports dealing in great detail with the euro."
"To date we have been very much concerned with technical questions such as budgets and convergence."
"It is very important that we deal with the practical aspects of the introduction."
"In particular the preparation for citizens and companies is essential."
"If they wish to continue to trade in the single market, SMEs need to make the conversion very quickly so that their software can handle the euro."
"That is even true for countries that have not indicated that they wish to go to stage 3 of economic and monetary union."
"In the UK the previous Tory government cast a great deal of doubt on whether or not the euro would actually happen."
"Many sceptics said that if the euro happens it may end in tears."
"That has led to many small and medium-sized enterprises not having made the preparation required."
"Many of those enterprises trade internationally and will have to deal with the euro as a foreign currency."
"I agree to some extent with a code of conduct on the conversion costs."
"I do not believe that the conversion costs, certainly as far as banks are concerned, should be passed on to the consumer directly because from 1 January 1999 the euro will only actually exist in electronic form."
"This essentially means that there will be no physical costs of actually exchanging currencies, notes and coins, for other currencies."
"All that will need to change is what happens anyway with banking institutions: an extra currency needs to be added to the list of currencies that the banking system deals with."
"I therefore ask what cost?"
"The costs will be significant after the notes and coins are introduced, not before."
"SMEs will have costs but there is a level playing field across the European Union."
"Therefore I do not see any competitive disadvantage as far as any companies are concerned because all companies will have to make the same changes."
"For tourism it is extremely important that the euro is introduced."
"I say that coming from a constituency which is very dependent on tourism."
"My constituency stretches from the Blackpool coast through the Ribble Valley into the Pendle Hills."
"With tourism now accounting for something like 20 % of economic activity across the European Union, either directly or indirectly, it is important that the euro is introduced and that those areas which rely on tourism for their prosperity take advantage of it."
", chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most Member States seem to have largely met the criteria for introducing the single currency on 1 January 1999."
"This applies above all to the inflation rate, where the EU average is now at a historically low level."
"Two aspects continue to give cause for concern."
"The first is government debt, where there is in fact every sign of a gradual improvement in the position. The other is something that I feel has scarcely been debated publicly, namely safeguarding the independence of the Member States' central banks."
"This is a really crucial issue."
"The independence of the European Central Bank can only be guaranteed if the national central banks are an integral part of the European System of Central Banks, free from state intervention."
"The European Central Bank Council will determine the Community's monetary policy."
"It comprises the members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank and the presidents of the national central banks."
"It is therefore vital that Member States should ensure that the presidents of the national central banks are genuinely independent."
"I regret to say that Mr Wolf's report, in its present form, does not adequately address this issue."
"There are a number of outstanding concerns."
"First the good news."
"All the relevant national central banks are now independent as regards setting interest rates."
"That is the first and most important step."
"But there are also certain problems about the personal independence of central bank governors."
"For example, we have been told that the President of Finland can still remove the President of its central bank from office, which would be contrary to the Maastricht Treaty."
"Then there is the matter of freedom from state intervention."
"For example, in one Member State that I know well, the central bank's decisions could be deferred for 14 days."
"That would also be contrary to the Maastricht Treaty."
"Arrangements of this kind still exist, and they must be changed."
"There is also the question of administrative independence, which is an important aspect of central banks' independence."
"There are a number of question marks hanging over that too."
"Let me be clear: the European Monetary Institute will be presenting its report to us on 25 March, and that is sure to include a detailed analysis of the independence of the central banks."
"We will be very closely examining this aspect of central banks' independence in both reports, Commissioner."
"Mr President, now that the introduction of the euro is approaching, we are getting more and more positive as well as negative views, not only within the Union, but also in the United States - witness the opening article in the Herald Tribune."
"I quote: ' what is good for Europe is also good for America' ."
"According to American economists, there is even talk in the US of the euro leading to more conflicts and friction, and less stability."
"I will leave this view for what it is."
"It is more important to look at what the European citizen thinks."
"The European citizen is by no means convinced yet of the benefits of the euro, nor of the practical aspects of the introduction, as argued for specifically in the Arroni report and by the Commission."
"Information programmes are starting far too late, sadly mostly dictated by motives of political electioneering, in my country as well. This is in fact anti-democratic."
"Not one single party, not one single political programme in my country leaves any room to be against the euro."
"I must say this is very strange in a Europe which proclaims that it wants to be transparent."
"It is beginning to look like a monetary dictatorship."
"Many elderly people - a considerable part of the European population - are wondering whether, under pressure of the euro, their pensions will be able to retain their value."
"We should treat these questions seriously."
"If we do not, the euro will become a disaster, and there will be no public support for any of the subsequent steps within the Union - and I am thinking of enlargement and changes to the agricultural policy and structural funds."
"We will achieve the exact opposite of what we set out to do with the euro."
"The Commission proposal and the Arroni report cover the practical aspects of introduction, which is fine, but they devote insufficient attention to the issue of public support."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Winnie Ewing on her contribution, which I agree with absolutely."
"Tourism is a key sector in Europe, and the euro will definitely provide a huge degree of additional transparency."
"But it will also reveal the differences in indirect taxation, value added tax in particular."
"That is why I have tabled an amendment on the report on the euro and tourism to highlight that to the Commission and the Council of Ministers."
"For example, if we take visitor accommodation in Luxembourg, France and Portugal, VAT is as low as 3 to 5.5 %, whereas, ironically, in two of the nations which are opting out of the euro - the United Kingdom and Denmark - the rates are 17.5 % and 25 %."
"This creates a double barrier for those countries and the tourist sectors within those Member States: first of all they lack the convenience of the euro zone and, secondly, they will become out-priced within the single market."
"I was delighted to hear yesterday that finance ministers were setting up a committee to look at harmonization of indirect taxation."
"They must give priority to the tourist sector."
"Failure will result in the loss of jobs in this precious sector."
"Mr President, declaration no 6 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the Community will commit itself to facilitating the renegotiation of the existing monetary arrangements between Member States of the European Union and third countries with small populations which adopt the currency of a neighbouring country as their national currency."
"By a most discrete sleight of hand, the Commission considers that this clause should allow the Republic of Saint-Marin, the Vatican City and the Principality of Monaco to benefit automatically from the euro as official currency."
"Although granting the euro to the Vatican and to San Marino does not pose any particular moral problem, the same cannot be said of the Principality of Monaco, which is ruled by an absolute monarchy which does not respect human rights and reigns over a tiny territory where tax evasion on an enormous scale takes place to the detriment of all Member States of the European Union, except France."
"I would ask our Parliament to make its voice heard and oppose a decision by the Commission in favour of Monaco which would be iniquitous and immoral."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to look particularly at certain aspects of the euro which are becoming more and more important as the political problems are resolved and people become more interested in the euro."
"The first question which concerns me is as follows. Since the manufacture of coins with a national symbol is due to commence at the latest on 1 May or 3 May this year, depending on the decision taken, it would be interesting to know whether the likely participants in the euro zone have already chosen the national symbols to appear on the coins."
"I greatly appreciated the measure taken in Italy, which tried to use the choice of this national symbol to thresh out the whole question of the euro and to get the people involved."
"I think all countries should do this; it should not be a technocratic choice by a finance minister and some civil servants."
"The people, the parliamentary members and the Community should be involved in this choice."
"There is another issue which interests me greatly."
"Everyone now seems to agree that the period in which notes and coins both of the national currency and in euros are circulating at the same time should be kept to a minimum."
"It has been decided that this circulation is to start on 1 January 2002."
"Can the Commissioner tell me if any countries have announced their intention so far to limit this period to less than the stipulated six months?"
"I think it should be possible to limit the period of dual circulation, for example in business, to as short a period as possible - two, three or maybe four weeks - although it may mean that in banks the exchange of national currencies into euros can continue for some time, for example until 30 June 2002."
"Some business people could make considerable savings in this way."
"I would like to know if this approach would be possible."
"Finally - and this is my last question, Commissioner - during the years 1999 to 2002, professional associations, for example in the commercial sector, will need a great deal of money for their communication and training programmes."
"Videos must be produced for the training of commercial employees, together with electronically-generated printed matter for communication."
"We must work more closely with the commercial grass roots and with consumers."
"Will the various planned programmes be unblocked soon by our partners in the Member States?"
"Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate the three rapporteurs on the reports we are debating this morning, especially Helena Torres Marques, whose approach I agree with completely. There are now only a few weeks left before the first euro countries are selected, and less than 300 days until the start of monetary union."
"In that respect, I want to underline some of the ideas which other speakers have already mentioned."
"The first thing I want to emphasize is what an important step economic and monetary union is."
"There is no doubt that it is the most important advance to take place in Europe since the birth of the Community, forty odd years ago."
"Secondly, I want to stress that this fundamental change to our lives will be happening as early as 1 January 1999, even though euro notes and coins will not enter circulation until three years later."
"From 1 January 1999, there will be a single monetary policy for those countries in the euro zone, stretching from Lapland in the far north-east of the continent to Lepe or Cape Saint Vincent in the extreme south-west."
"Thirdly, I want to repeat something I think is fundamental: the genuine and definitive players in the euro adventure are the citizens, both as economic producers and as consumers - as users, in short, of the new currency."
"The success of the euro will depend not just on it being used in the financial markets so that it can reach the famous critical mass, but also - I would even say, above all - on the public accepting it as a means of payment, right from the outset."
"On that point, I want to draw attention to a question I think is important, which has already been mentioned, for example by Mr Hendrick: the question of transaction costs for exchange into euros or for exchange between participating currencies during that long transitional period of three years."
"The people of Europe have repeatedly been told that from 1 January 1999 the mark, the franc, the lira, the peseta and so on will be united to form the euro, and will become non-decimal fractions of the euro. So they will not be able to understand how they can be charged a commission for changing one of those fractions (say the mark) into another (for example, the escudo), or why they should be charged for having their bill in marks converted into euros."
"If the citizens are treated like this they will conclude that they were misled when they were told there would be a single currency from 1 January 1999."
"They will see the euro not as a single currency, but as an extra currency in addition to the national ones."
"So our view is that we need a more determined approach than is shown in the Commission's announcement of a few days ago, saying that all compulsory measures will be free whereas optional ones will depend on the market."
"I think we need a more determined approach, and in that respect I want to conclude by reminding people of the vote in this House on the occasion of the report on the euro and the consumer, which I had the honour of presenting to Parliament a few weeks ago. That report tackled this problem directly and proposed a ban on that sort of practice."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Helena Torres Marques on her report on the euro and tourism, which is extremely timely and draws attention to the importance of the sector and to the way in which it will benefit from the single currency."
"As the world's third largest industry, after oil and automobiles, Europe's 60 % share of the tourism market is very substantial."
"Obviously, the relative decline that has occurred is a consequence of the emergence of new destinations on other continents, although European tourism has continued to grow in absolute terms with the anticipated creation of 1.85 million new jobs by the year 2007."
"Moreover, it is a sector with a reasonably balanced geographical distribution and many regions which have no alternatives in other spheres, including many rural regions, are attractive tourist destinations."
"The introduction of the euro will remove transaction costs, uncertainty and calculation, which today constitute very significant limitations, as has already been emphasized by a number of Members. Consequently, a substantial number of European citizens may be expected to start travelling more frequently."
"The benefits, moreover, will not be confined to European citizens, since the demand by citizens from other continents will naturally increase, since they can more readily move within a space where they can pay for everything in the same currency."
"So tourism operators have no reason to fear the euro."
"On the contrary, they will certainly benefit from it, although, as is emphasized in the report, they will be requested to refrain from taking advantage of its introduction to round prices up and introduce unjustified increases in the costs of the products and services they supply."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the three reports we are debating today have a basic point in common, on which the success of the single currency will largely depend."
"All three deal with questions which will determine how well the people of Europe take to the euro."
"The European citizens are the protagonists in this approaching change. They are the ones who must steer this transition, which is unique in world history."
"Tourism, which has become a mass phenomenon during this second half of the twentieth century, should serve to promote the euro - the currency of the twenty-first century."
"At the same time, the euro should stimulate tourism in Europe, with regard to tourists from within Europe and from other parts of the world."
"I want to congratulate Mrs Torres Marques on her excellent report."
"The prospects for growth within the tourism sector represent a real hope for solving the unemployment problem."
"The advantages which the single currency will bring for this sector are obvious."
"The public will accept the euro if it helps resolve the problems they are worried about. Unemployment is their greatest concern."
"Tourism will help to solve that problem. The euro will help tourism."
"We should be able to transmit that message to the citizens if we want the project to be a success."
"With respect to the Arroni report, I want to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on his excellent work."
"We must make sure that the introduction of the euro results in as little inconvenience as possible. We must reduce costs, and concentrate on those sectors which are going to experience most problems: small businesses, pensioners, the public and the disabled."
"We should provide ample resources for informing and training the public."
"Finally, on the Wolf report, about the independence of the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks, I wanted to make a slight clarification, a small point."
"The independence of the European Central Bank, and the way it is legally bound to the objective of price stability, constitute a guarantee for the citizens."
"Economic history is littered with examples of monetary authorities deciding to stimulate inflation in order to lessen the burden of national debt."
"That is no longer going to be possible."
"It will not be possible to apply that hidden tax of inflation in Europe."
"It has been the least well-off who have suffered most from that type of policy."
"The future European System of Central Banks will prevent it happening."
"When a government or a regional or municipal authority has to repay debts, it will have to do so in full view of its citizens."
"I am glad about that, and I am sure the people of Europe are too."
"Nevertheless, as we stand on the threshold of introducing the euro, it is essential that the central banks should adapt their legislation as soon as possible."
"We cannot allow the future Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks to be deprived of all the possibilities for success which would be bound to result from the merging of so many central banks without having such varied rules."
"As Mr Herman said, we need to speed up the time limits and say which regulations need altering urgently."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it might seem that everything that there is to be said has already been said this morning."
"Unfortunately, not everyone has been able to contribute, not least myself."
"There are some important points I would like to highlight. The Arroni report deals with how arrangements for the changeover can be optimized, and it touches on some key issues."
"Firstly, for example, it mentions the optimization of information strategies, and I believe that electronic media, via news broadcasts, can and should provide our citizens with precise answers to their questions, and this could be very helpful over the coming months and years."
"Secondly, I think it could be very helpful - and I am making a special statement now - if the euro could be used as an electronic means of payment at major events such as the Hanover World Fair in 2000, at which 60 million visitors are expected."
"That would be a marvellous pilot project."
"Thirdly, I would like to emphasize again that the public authorities have a special responsibility in the changeover to the euro, and I am thinking of dual pricing here."
"I believe, and several people have already touched on this today, that dual pricing could and should be applied for three years by authorities ranging from municipalities, cities, districts and regions to major state institutions, in setting and assessing charges and also in paying salaries and so forth. In this way people will be able to familiarize themselves with the euro by 2002 and will be able to relate it to their national currency and convert as a matter of course."
"It will also allow small and medium-sized businesses, which may not always be so well prepared, to get used to this process and to prepare more thoroughly for the changeover date in 2002. And it will also encourage trade associations to play a more active part, which some are already doing or trying to do."
"I also think it is important that national tax authorities in particular should be geared up to using the euro in tax assessments and suchlike as soon as possible."
"Nine or ten Member States who will probably participate in monetary union are already doing this."
"I hope that Germany in particular will be receptive to this system, which could be very helpful for the future."
"The state should be in the vanguard here with a high level of state commitment and not trailing behind!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to take part in this debate, referring in particular to Mr Arroni's report and to Mrs Torres Marques' report on the euro and tourism. I am well aware that much has already been said and there is little room for further contributions."
"I believe, however, that several concepts should be confirmed."
"Firstly, we should start from the fact that tourism provides fundamental scope for a thorough reflection on the methods of introducing the euro."
"The sector is characterized by economic activity that plays a unifying role within the Union, and promotes better reciprocal knowledge and a greater sense of common citizenship."
"Besides being one of the main sources of creating wealth and employment, it will be one of the spheres (together with the distribution and commercial system, as already mentioned) in which the methods of introducing the euro will condition its success or confirm the difficulties, as these sectors are in direct contact with the citizens and consumers."
"The euro will also have a considerable impact on the tourist sector as, on the one hand, there will be a reduction in transaction costs and, on the other, there will be a greater transparency of prices."
"This will stimulate greater competition, with the ultimate result of improving competitiveness, even in markets outside the EU."
"Consequently, not only is tourism fundamental to the success of the euro, but we are faced with a historic occasion for the revival of this fundamental sector although, as already stated, we should remember with regret that the budget has considerably reduced the funds available for the specific programmes planned."
"The practical aspects of introducing the euro are therefore of crucial importance, with the basic objective of making the citizens as familiar as possible with the new currency and reducing related costs to a minimum."
"From this point of view, I support the theory (already advocated by other speakers and by Mrs Thyssen first of all) that it is important to insist that the categories concerned should organize themselves with regard to information and the elimination or minimization of transaction costs."
"This will stimulate a fruitful interaction in the market between supply and demand in establishing the best possible conditions for consumers."
"Only if such self-discipline is absent will it be advisable to lay down compulsory rules from above - rules which should be limited to individual cases, so as not to make the transition process too rigid with excessively complex measures or rules."
"Mr President, there is good news and there is bad news with regard to tourism."
"The good news is that, soon, the tourist will not have to go through the miserable experience of constantly having to change money ever again."
"A miserable experience which also costs a lot of money."
"At the weekend I drove past a bureau de change at the border between the Netherlands and Belgium, and I noticed that the difference between the buying and selling exchange rates for the Portuguese escudo amounted to 15 %."
"That is a serious figure."
"With the introduction of the euro, the holiday-maker in Europe will gain one free day in every 14 holidays."
"This is a welcome benefit, because Europe's share in world tourism is steadily declining, and that is bad news for employment."
"May I therefore ask the Commissioner what progress is being made with plans to allow Member States to conduct experiments in which labour-intensive sectors such as tourism would be subject to lower VAT rates?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while listening to the debate, I remarked to myself what a change there is compared with the debate just eighteen months or two years ago; there is unanimity and consensus on the changeover to the euro and the single currency. It is good to see that, and to get on with dealing with the real and practical problems which face us in this process."
"Today's joint debate on three reports shows the extent to which preparations have advanced for the introduction of the euro, and how they are indispensable for a smooth changeover to European currency and its acceptance by public opinion."
"So first of all I would like to shed some light on the results of the last round table organized by the Commission on 26 February on the practical aspects of introducing the euro, which your rapporteur Mr Arroni has covered."
"I will then look at the real applications of these clauses in a particular sector - tourism - at the suggestion of Mrs Torres Marques. Finally, Mr Wolf's report will allow me to mention the progress made in terms of what we call legal convergence."
"So I will start with the practical aspects of the introduction of the euro."
"The Commission communication of 11 February and the round table of 26 February bear witness to the fact that considerable progress has been made since May 1997."
"Whether referring to the preparation of public administration or other practicalities, the round table which was organized with the support of the European Parliament provided the opportunity to indicate several reasons for satisfaction which seem to me to respond to a large number of the questions which some of you put to me earlier."
"Looking first at preparations in the public sector, today 11 Member States have presented a plan for moving over to the euro, in other words they have forecast possible relationships in euros between individuals, companies and their administration from 1999."
"All Member States are offering what is being called a broad ""euro 1999 option' for companies, and many of them are also offering it for individuals."
"Moreover, legislative work at national level to translate decisions into facts is moving ahead properly."
"In accordance with the wishes expressed by your rapporteur, the Commission is monitoring and encouraging these adaptations, particularly in national legislation, and will present an update of the state of preparation of public administrations in the spring."
"Mr Fayot asked about the number of countries which had decided to have national sides to their coins."
"According to my newly established counting method, seven countries in the European Union have already adopted the national sides: Belgium, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Portugal and Ireland."
"On the other practical questions, since May last year all the difficult points have been the subject of an in-depth examination by groups of experts, where consumers were represented together with the professionals involved and public authority representatives."
"These studies, the quality of which has been praised by everyone, enabled the round table to produce tangible results on the four specific points which answer your questions."
"My first point concerns dual pricing, on which a consensus has been reached."
"Dual pricing is an essential instrument, Mrs Raschhofer, but the imposition of an obligation at Community level is not desirable."
"Mrs Thyssen, you are right that we must not start by making impositions."
"What we should do is ensure that certain rules of the game are respected, as rightly suggested by your rapporteur."
"Secondly, a consensus has also been reached on the bank charges for conversion into euros."
"Two principles emerged during round-table discussions: firstly, non-discrimination between prices for services provided in euros and in national currency; and, secondly, the rule which says that all obligatory operations must be free of charge."
"There is no equivocation on this point, and that is my response to Mr Hendrick and Mr Amadeo."
"The Commission is pleased to state that the banking sector has already confirmed in writing its commitment to these two principles."
"Otherwise, encouraging progress has also been noted in three areas."
"The first concerns the specific situation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which has been raised frequently this morning."
"In particular, it has been noted that there have been a number of advances in their relationship with the large groups, and advances in preparations for changeover to the euro."
"I think - and time will tell - that this ought to answer the questions of Mrs Peijs and Mr Gallagher."
"To Mr Fayot, I can say that SME communication campaigns are being put in place, and to Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens, that the 1998 information campaigns give priority to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"As regards education, Mr Garosci, you are right; there is not enough information or training."
"I often say that to motivate staff you must train them, and to make loyal clients you must inform them."
"In view of this, education is essential and I will soon be announcing a specific network derived from the network of existing public administrations within the different Member States."
"And finally - it surprised me that nobody raised this point but I will mention it anyway - encouraging progress has also been noted regarding the setting up of local euro monitoring stations, which aim to prevent improper use. That is a desire of this House and of Mr Hoppenstedt, if I correctly understood his words earlier."
"The fourth specific point from the round table was the problem of the duration of the dual circulation of coins and notes, and this has been raised several times this morning."
"The draft regulation on the legal status of the euro states that this maximum period of six months from 1 January 2002 can be reduced by each Member State."
"It is a question of subsidiarity and is a national concern."
"Nevertheless, during the round table we managed to reach a broad consensus on the fact that a period of six months is too long and it would be wise to shorten it, and secondly, that the period of dual circulation ought to be harmonized throughout all the euro countries."
"It was noted that the Member States are currently reflecting on this since it poses a certain number of practical and technical problems, and it was therefore agreed - and the Commission offered to do this - to proceed to an informal exchange of opinions with the Member States."
"But you are right, Mr Fayot, we must forge ahead with this."
"However, for the time being we must wait for the result of the national studies and the contacts we will manage and follow up."
"In any case, the Member States must clearly make known their intentions on this question between now and the end of 1998."
"Only yesterday I gained broad approval at the Ecofin Council which was being held in Brussels on all the points which I have presented to you."
"So for the Commission, a new phase is now commencing in the same spirit of dialogue and transparency, and in a few weeks it will result in the adoption of detailed recommendations - and Mrs Peijs, I hope that these will answer your questions."
"These recommendations will be forwarded to you, to the Council and to professional organizations, as it is our intention that you should be able to discuss them properly and in detail."
"Secondly, I hope that on 2 May, when the European Council adopts the list of countries changing over to the euro, that it will also adopt these guidelines."
"Finally, as these guidelines will also be forwarded to the professionals concerned, we hope they will convert them into a code of good management and good practice."
"That will be the spirit of the recommendations, to avoid as far as possible the need to pass through a more regulatory and therefore more restrictive phase."
"I would add that very particular attention should be paid to vulnerable social groups and, Mrs Thyssen, you rightly mentioned older people and people with disabilities in this regard."
"That deals with the practical aspects."
"I come now to the second report, on tourism."
"You were quite right, Mrs Torres Marques, to draw our attention to the tourism sector."
"This sector is an area of very diverse activities which creates jobs and which will profit greatly from the arrival of the euro as highlighted, I think, by Mr Harrisson and Mr Rübig."
"The tourism sector has a particular importance to the European economy: 5.5 % of GDP, nine million direct jobs, 6 % of total employment."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises make up 85 % of this sector, representing a third of service exports in the Union."
"The development of this sector of activities has important knock-on effects on all the local and regional economies."
"The introduction of the euro must therefore produce benefits for all the activities in this sector, and we must take care that this is the case."
"Mr Ribeiro, it is not a question of limiting the advantages to a few enterprises (the largest ones) in the sector."
"And the introduction of the euro must produce effects as rapidly as possible, in other words right from the beginning of the transition period."
"What will the impact be?"
"As your rapporteur stresses, I think tourism will be one of the economic sectors, one of the areas of activity, which will benefit most quickly from the positive effects of introducing the euro."
"Why?"
"Because reducing exchange risks will stimulate tourism within the Community."
"The example quoted by Mr Rübig concerning his daughter is very interesting in this respect."
"But the euro will also facilitate tourism from third countries."
"I would refer you to a very significant study which the Commission published yesterday, 9 March, concerning (I believe) Europeans on holiday, and which my colleague Mr Papoutsis presented to the International Congress of Tourism in Berlin."
"It shows that one person in two from the European Union went on holiday in 1997: 91 % of Luxembourg citizens, 74 % of Belgians and 73 % of Germans go on holiday to countries other than their country of residence."
"That shows how much interest the euro will have for them, given that a quarter of Europeans - which could be considered few, but which I feel is still a lot - travel within the European Union."
"Even so, this is an ECU 75 billion market."
"The introduction of the euro will enable tourists and travellers not only to stop losing money in exchange commission, but to save on travel, accommodation and restaurant costs."
"Moreover, the creation of a stable currency will enable the euro to be used as an invoicing currency for international tourist contracts."
"This will be a source of economy and gains in competitiveness for travel companies throughout Europe."
"Having said that - and here I combine several questions which have been raised - some aspects must be looked into in more depth."
"This year the Commission will organize a seminar on methods of changing over to the euro, with all the professionals concerned - and of course you will be involved."
"I would make it clear that the fiscal aspects raised by your rapporteur will obviously be examined closely at this event."
"I do not want to go into details here and now, but you should know that they cannot be isolated from the general approach which the Commission has specified for fiscal matters."
"And to Mr Kaklamanis, I would repeat that I will postpone this to the next debate which you will probably have with my colleague Mr Papoutsis on tourism, because these questions go beyond the sector of the euro and concern tourism as an area of activity based on SMEs."
"So, to conclude, I will deal briefly with the report from the European Monetary Institute on legal convergence."
"I say ""briefly' because it is not up to me as a representative of the Commission to comment on the work of the EMI, but nonetheless, I would like to make it clear that, since its publication last August, legal convergence has evolved greatly in Europe and it is going in the right direction."
"Mr Wolf, you are right to say that this is not a question of detail."
"Mr Castagnède is also right to call for more transparency and more information."
"And of course Mr von Wogau is right too, saying: yes, but all that with respect for the independence of the European Central Bank."
"Mr Caudron says that the independence of the European Central Bank does not mean it is isolated, and this leads to the need for links as well as instruments of procedure, dialogue and discussion."
"That is what the Commission presented last week in its proposal concerning the composition of the Economic and Financial Committee which will prepare the work of the Ecofin Council."
"Numerous national legislation and central bank statute reforms have been completed or undertaken by the Member States since publication of the EMI report, in order to make them compatible with the requirements of the Treaty."
"I can tell Mr Herman and Mr von Wogau that they will have the answer to their question in the convergence report which the Commission will present on 25 March."
"Having worked on it fourteen hours a day, I can tell you I know what I am talking about when I say you will have your answers to this question, because the Commission must proceed to its own evaluation of the compatibility of national legislation with the Treaty and the statute of the ESCB."
"Mr Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, I will see you on 25 March about this."
"I apologize for having exceeded the time allotted to me by two minutes, and to sum up, I would simply stress that, like me, you are aware that the preparatory work for the introduction of the euro is coming to an end and that the key issue now is better to acquaint our fellow citizens with the euro and to encourage them to accept it."
"The task of mobilization and persuasion before us is without precedent."
"In view of this, Mr Arroni, the Commission notes with interest your suggestion to organize jointly, if Parliament so wishes, a round table with people from the world of communication to think about the psychological aspects of the arrival of the euro."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have not organized our efforts so as to meet the schedule or comply with the clauses in the Treaty for the introduction of the euro."
"So let us not yet relax our efforts now, when it still remains to inform the European public about the advantages of introducing the European currency and to disperse the fears which may still exist amongst some of us."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner, and thank you to the three rapporteurs and all the speakers."
"Mr President, I asked one question."
"Would the Commissioner like to respond to it now or later?"
"What is the situation on allowing Member States to carry out trial projects for lower VAT rates for labour-intensive sectors such as tourism?"
"Mr President, the Commissioner mentioned those countries which have already decided on the euro's national side."
"I would like to point out here that Spain has also now adopted the national side - last week, in fact."
"I have taken note of your question."
"We will respond directly to it."
"I do not have the details to enable me to respond to you today in detail, and I would prefer not to give you any wrong information."
"Thank you for the information on Spain."
"Sorry, I thought I was up to date, but the euro is progressing so fast that it is impossible to be totally up-to-date."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00 noon."
"Promoting road safety in the EU"
"The next item is the report (A4-0065/98) by Mr Cornelissen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission ""Promoting road safety in the EU - the programme for 1997-2001' (COM(97)0131 - C4-0180/97)."
"Mr President, on Friday night my wife and I were invited to dinner with some friends."
"During the meal our host was called to the telephone, and he was asked to come to the hospital as quickly as possible because his eldest son had been involved in a road accident."
"On Saturday morning we visited our hosts again."
"Their son had died."
"They looked ten years older."
"Their life will never be the same again."
"This was one of the 45 000 lives which are lost every year in the European Union as a result of road accidents - 45 000 a year!"
"That means 900 a week."
"In other words, every week a traffic disaster takes place on the scale of the sinking of the Estonia."
"More than 2 million Europeans are injured in road accidents every year, and many of them will remain permanently disabled."
"The grief and human suffering behind these figures is immeasurable."
"Furthermore, road accidents cause great economic and social harm."
"Experts estimate this at more than ECU 150 billion a year."
"This distress, and this waste of human life and financial resources, are not acceptable in a civilized society with all but unlimited technical capabilities."
"Having looked closely at various studies I would even go so far as to conclude that, despite the expected growth in traffic, the number of road casualties could be halved over the next fifteen years."
"That means reducing the number of road deaths to less than 25 000 in the year 2010."
"The Road Safety Programme presented by the Commission last year is an important first step."
"I recognize Commissioner Kinnock's great concern for road safety in this, and his determination to do what he can, bearing in mind the limited powers of the Commission."
"Nonetheless, we would like to go a bit further."
"We believe a numerical target which has the aim of halving the number of road casualties during the next fifteen years is essential and achievable."
"It is clear that, in the light of subsidiarity, meeting this target is not just the responsibility of the Union."
"I would like to point out, however, that those countries which have expressed their targets in concrete figures have achieved good results."
"I would like to mention the United Kingdom, the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands."
"A numerical target will also act as a signal to the public, and will give all those involved an objective to aim for."
"In order to fulfil the targets, priorities will have to be set for the 65 measures in the Commission programme."
"Allow me to mention a few."
"Firstly, legislation for safer motor vehicles - safer for passengers, but also with better protection at the front and rear to reduce injuries to cyclists and pedestrians in the event of a collision."
"The road, too, should and can become safer."
"We would like to see a safety impact assessment of all EU-funded roads."
"The introduction of 30 km/h zones in residential areas and around schools saves many children's lives."
"Irresponsibly high speeds destroy road safety."
"Drink-driving is not only anti-social, it is criminal."
"Is the Commissioner prepared to bring up for discussion again the Council proposal for a Europewide maximum driver's blood alcohol concentration of 50 milligrams, which has been on the table for years?"
"Recent studies show very clearly that the use of drugs is also responsible for thousands of road deaths."
"Many medicinal drugs, too, have negative effects on the ability to drive."
"Can the Commissioner, in consultation with the relevant organizations, check how these problems can be best tackled?"
"Could I also ask for particular attention to be paid to the opportunities offered by technological developments, such as systems which disable the start mechanism of the car when the driver has drunk too much?"
"Driving with the lights on during the day, and wider use of seat belts, lead to significantly fewer accidents."
"Improved first aid at accidents is also important."
"Finally, safe behaviour on the road - more than 90 % of accidents are caused by human error."
"Better training for drivers, road safety education in schools, information campaigns, enforcement of traffic regulations such as those relating to rest and driving times for professional drivers (with a serious chance of getting caught) are indispensable if this reduction is to be achieved."
"We think the introduction of a penalty-point system is desirable."
"Can I ask the Commissioner how he will proceed?"
"Following this debate, will he present a further stage of his plans, and can he promise that in 1998 and during the following years there are, or will be, sufficient resources in the budget?"
"Mr President, road safety is a joint responsibility shared by the Union, the Member States, car manufacturers, educators, road safety organizations, road users of course, and many others."
"To achieve success, a joint approach is needed with sufficient popular support."
"The subsidiarity principle must be respected."
"The EU must concentrate on measures where action at EU level leads to added value."
"Road accidents are not a natural disaster in the face of which we are powerless."
"On the contrary, we make the traffic and we can make it as safe as we want to."
"Mr Commissioner, you will be able to count on us in this fight, but we also count on you."
"Mr President, I sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Cornelissen, for both his speech and report."
"Mr Cornelissen speaks from both the head and from the heart in terms of his commitment to road safety."
"I pay tribute to the way he has skilfully steered this report through Parliament, embracing as many opinions as possible and reaching a conclusion which will be endorsed overwhelmingly in Parliament tomorrow."
"We should also pay tribute to Commissioner Kinnock."
"He has rightly brought this issue to the top of the agenda in the Commission's work programme."
"Why has he done that?"
"He is aware that 45 000 people - as Mr Cornelissen has already said - are killed every year and more than one million are injured."
"The cost to society is probably at least ECU 100 billion."
"He has set out in his communication the appalling figures."
"One in 80 of us will die as a result of a road accident; one in three of us will be hospitalized because of a road accident; the main cause of death amongst the young is road accidents."
"So I pay tribute to him for so graphically making the case for action in this area."
"Let us not underestimate the scale of the task that we face."
"It is very easy to do that because these incidents are often very individual, but collectively they represent the equivalent of two or three jumbo jet loads of passengers in Europe dying each and every week."
"If that happened to one, two or three jumbo jets each and every week, those particular aircraft simply would not fly; we would not tolerate it."
"And yet for some reason, society tolerates a similar toll of people being killed and many, many more being injured on our roads."
"Therefore we have a collective responsibility to ensure this issue receives the attention it deserves from Parliament, the Commission, the Council and society as a whole."
"We support, therefore, the ambitious but realistic target set by Mr Cornelissen - namely, a 40 % reduction by the year 2010."
"Commissioner Kinnock's proposals give us the tools to achieve that target."
"People may say it is unrealistic but we cannot tolerate a situation where thousands of our fellow citizens die needlessly on our roads every year."
"Something must be done on an ambitious scale."
"That is why the socialists are very proud to be associated with Mr Cornelissen's report and Mr Kinnock's communication."
"We would highlight six priorities for action."
"Many of these priorities reflect the views of the rapporteur and the Commissioner, but they highlight very clearly where action can and must be taken."
"Firstly, we must combat drink-driving."
"There are some 9 000 alcohol-related deaths every year on our roads."
"We have the means to address that problem by supporting the Commissioner's proposal for a 50 milligramme limit - a proposal, I understand, that has been on the table now for 10 years."
"Let us see some action."
"We would applaud the Commissioner's efforts to try and secure agreement in the Council as soon as possible."
"Secondly, we want to see the associated issue of drugs being examined by an EU research programme to make sure people cannot take drugs, drive and contribute to accidents as they do, on an increasing scale."
"Thirdly, we want to endorse the view of the rapporteur that a new vehicle design directive must be published to make sure vehicles are as friendly to pedestrians and cyclists as is humanly possible."
"The technology is there."
"What is lacking is the political will."
"Fourthly, we want to curb speed and introduce more 20-miles-per-hour limits."
"Fifthly, we want to see the mutual recognition of driving bans and finally, more research into driving behaviour."
"All these measures will contribute to our common goal of tackling this unacceptable, appalling, disgraceful figure of 45 000 deaths every year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are delighted to see that you have arrived safely, Commissioner."
"Like the previous speaker, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Cornelissen, on his excellent report."
"He has put an enormous amount of work into it."
"We appreciate his commitment to road safety, which has spanned several decades."
"So it is perhaps no wonder that he was asked to be rapporteur and that he has produced such a first-rate report."
"However, as it would be monotonous if we all agreed on everything, I shall highlight a problem: the Commission's communication on promoting road safety in 1997-2001 contains 65 proposals, and many of the proposals have to be presented by 1998/99."
"So my first request to you, Commissioner, is to speed up all the individual proposals."
"You know as well as I do that nothing will happen after spring next year."
"We will go on the election trail and Commission will either retire or seek reselection."
"This means that anything urgent must have a first reading in Parliament by autumn at the latest."
"Otherwise the proposals will just gather dust for two years until the Parliament and the Commission are up and running again."
"For that reason, Commissioner, I would urge you to encourage your people to present the individual proposals to Parliament and the Council as quickly as possible."
"Secondly, I would like to know if you support the list of priorities set by the rapporteur, and probably by this House when we vote tomorrow."
"Mr Cornelissen has quite rightly said that it is no good presenting 65 proposals if they are only implemented in a trickle."
"We need to have a substantial body of priority projects adopted to improve road safety."
"That is why we are so interested to know if you really support Mr Cornelissen's list of priorities, which we will no doubt vote for tomorrow, and if you are ready to pledge your support to them."
"I would also like to address a few points that my group considers urgent, as well as two or three points in the report that we will reject."
"We think it is important, as Mr Watts has so rightly explained, to make the car a safer means of transport, because can kill and injure people."
"Secondly, the majority of my group firmly supports European legislation reducing the legal alcohol limit to 0.5 mg/ml."
"We absolutely must jump this hurdle."
"In November 1993 we agreed in the Maastricht Treaty that measures can be adopted by the Parliament and Council."
"I believe that measures to combat drink-driving are crucial and that we should act jointly in this area."
"My third point is this: I think it is important to establish a European penalty point register or at least agree to this step."
"In some countries drink-driving is viewed as a trifling offence that your friends in the pub will virtually congratulate you on. So we must not just set an alcohol limit but also ensure that by maintaining a Europe-wide penalty point register and by enforcing penalties, we can change people's attitude and behaviour."
"I want to mention two other points that we cannot vote for."
"In my view, the requirement for daytime running lights for cars and not just motorbikes cannot be justified throughout the Community."
"It may be appropriate in Scandinavia because the light is different there, but what is the point of having car lights on in Spain during the summer?"
"We should respect the principle of subsidiarity and take account of varying weather conditions in the Community before we adopt such fundamental regulations."
"My last point is a curious one."
"I think it is unreasonable to call for a ban on selling alcohol at all service stations."
"Yes, we need to target drivers themselves, but it would be excessive to punish bus passengers who want the odd beer at a service station by banning alcohol there, and we do not want that!"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, it is important for these problems to be discussed clearly, even if we have already found that words alone are not enough to reduce the number of victims."
"We talked about it intensely last year at the Pan-European Conference in Helsinki (I myself drew up a report on the safety and use of telematics) but, unfortunately, we have not made any impact on the statistics."
"Statistics, I agree, are very important for assessing problems: 45 000 deaths a year is certainly an impressive figure, as is 45 000 million lire spent by the community."
"But statistics would be a mathematical exercise, an end in themselves, if they were not used to stimulate ideas and to help us draw conclusions."
"Alongside the proposals to catalogue accidents and assess their effects in order to assist the injured parties, I consider more interesting and important the analyses of the means and initiatives to try to prevent them."
"We have already seen that the simple accessories we all have in our cars are no longer enough: safety belts, airbags, helmets and intelligent speed control systems are just additional factors to accompany something else we still have to invent."
"I think one good idea contained in Mr Cornelissen's excellent report is to try and convince the car manufacturers to change the fronts of the vehicles, to make them safer for pedestrians and cyclists and, at the same time, more resistant to impact."
"It would appear that this measure alone could mean 20 000 fewer deaths a year, and it would therefore be worth trying."
"I still believe in means of assistance and behavioural measures, such as telematics as a means of control but also of assistance."
"However, I particularly believe in educating school children."
"It is useless to create different means if they are then used incorrectly."
"So we need to start at the beginning and include in the school curriculum the genuinely educational subject of behaviour on roads, and civilized behaviour in general."
"Mr President, road safety concerns us all, and this has been proved again this morning, not only by the Commissioner, but also by the rapporteur, whom we support in all aspects of this case and for the way he presented it."
"We also sympathize with him: all of us can, because we all have to battle continually with the terrible consequences of these kinds of traffic accidents."
"I would like to mention that in my family we are still suffering the consequences of an accident which took place in Belgium between a Dutch and a French driver."
"When it turns out that it is often human error which is to blame, then surely better measures could be taken, instead of just saying that people should take better care and learn more."
"When we see that in more or less exactly the same circumstances and at the same time, an accident similar to the one the year before happens on the A17 at Kortrijk, with at least as many people killed, then we might well ask when we are finally going to learn and do something about it."
"I submitted an amendment on behalf of my group pointing out that when young people are learning to drive, they should know a few things about what to do in the event of injuries."
"This amendment was suggested by the Red Cross, and I commend it to this House."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I can also say that we are mostly very satisfied with Mr Cornelissen's report."
"It touches a sore spot, and repeats for the umpteenth time that the figure of 45 000 fatalities a year, and many times more casualties, is unacceptable, and measures will therefore have to be taken."
"Two important issues are behind the huge number of casualties: namely speed and alcohol."
"It is on these issues that I would like to see the report sharpened up."
"As far as the 30 km/h zones in towns and cities are concerned, we do not need any more studies."
"The existing 30 km/h zones have more than proved their effectiveness, so let us start taking action."
"On the subject of alcohol levels, 50 milligrams seems a decent compromise, but I can tell you that large, heavy people still think they can drink more than others."
"It would be much clearer simply to ban drinking."
"It saves people having to think how much more they can have, how much they have already had, how much they can drink generally."
"What gets into these drivers' heads, that they insist on drinking before they get behind the wheel?"
"Twenty milligrams strikes me as quite enough."
"Mr President, we regularly express our sympathy with the victims of disasters."
"On our European tarmac 45 000 people die each year, and more than 1.5 million are injured."
"These figures have been mentioned many times today."
"Yet this is not the inevitable price of progress, but the result of our choice of unsafe transport modes."
"It is to the credit of the European Commission that it has placed road safety at the top of the agenda, and I can wholeheartedly support the action programme, whereby, to my mind, the emphasis should be on protecting vulnerable groups such as cyclists and pedestrians."
"The Commission thinks that, in view of the cost of one road death, a measure which costs ECU 1 million and saves one life should be taken on economic grounds alone!"
"The use of such economic arguments shows once again what little value human lives are accorded on the road."
"As a point of principle, I oppose valuing a human life at ECU 1 million."
"As the crowning glory of God's creation, every human being is unique and invaluable."
"This criterion could even lead to unfortunate choices being made, such as protecting working people in preference to the elderly."
"The rapporteur, Mr Cornelissen, rightly points out that the figure of ECU 1 million can lead to abuse, as the cheapest measures might be the ones to get priority."
"Regrettably, the Commission only focuses on making traffic safer."
"I think we must give some thought to the issue of reducing mobility."
"Less mobility instantly saves human lives."
"I also wish there were incentives for safer modes of transport, such as the train and the bicycle."
"All this does not alter the fact that I think highly of the action programme."
"I would like to thank Mr Cornelissen for his excellent report."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I think the figures are alarming. One person in eighty becomes the victim of a road accident and the resulting economic costs amount to 1 % of the GNP of the EU."
"It is also said that these costs are underestimated and may even be twice that amount."
"I do not think road education alone is enough, although it is important, nor do I think we need simply deal with the subject of the amount of alcohol consumed."
"We should develop more community and public transport services, and we should give people the opportunity to use them, especially during holiday periods and week-ends."
"Consideration should also be given to monitoring."
"One proposal could be to harmonize the times at which alcoholic drinks are sold, which are currently not harmonized at all in Europe."
"We have already talked about the possibility of using innovative technological methods."
"Telematics applied to transport undoubtedly produces significantly positive effects, such as satellite navigation in the event of particular weather conditions."
"We also need to weaken the resistance of the car manufacturers, particularly with regard to safety standards."
"To that effect, there should be an assessment of the pilot projects already being implemented by DG XIII and DG VII, providing for direct measures to improve the safety of means of individual and collective mobility."
"In this case, I believe telematics can play an important role with regard to both visual and oral communication."
"From this point of view, I think pilot projects involving the cities also need to be developed. Above all, however, if we want to take everybody into consideration, I believe we need to think of safety measures as being connected with the quality of life."
"Quality of life is measured with awareness, also taking into account a harmonic concept of people and objects. From this point of view, I think it is even more necessary to develop a real European concept of increased responsibility towards the citizens, which is fundamental if we want to provide a model and an advanced point of reference."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the extension in the Maastricht Treaty to joint competence for safety between the Member States and the European Union."
"I also give a warm welcome to the Commission communication and to Mr Cornelissen's excellent report."
"However, the real way forward to improve road safety is to ensure compliance with existing regulations."
"Currently the situation is that some countries fail to apply the regulations in force, while other countries, like my own, gold-plate the regulations with additional conditions."
"If you take the particular example of reducing the maximum amount of drivers' blood concentration to 0.5 mg/ml, this is only tinkering at the margins of road safety."
"We should instead take tougher action against persistent drunk drivers who are currently offending and causing road accident deaths and injuries where they are three or four times over the existing limit."
"I hope the Commission will contrast that with the proposed action against insulin-dependent diabetic drivers in the United Kingdom, which is out of all proportion to any likely danger they would pose on the roads."
"These drivers are now going to be banned in the United Kingdom and will lose their right to drive goods vehicles up to seven and a half tonnes."
"They will, however, still be entitled to drive such vehicles in any other Member State but the United Kingdom."
"I ask the Commissioner today, is this compatible with road safety in a single European market?"
"I urge the Commissioner and this House to take action."
"Mr President, this debate on the future of European road safety takes place at a time when mobile phone usage in Ireland and across Europe is rapidly increasing."
"The use of mobile phones in cars must be legislated for at a European level in the interests of better road safety."
"The European Union should ensure that car manufacturers construct all cars for the European market equipped fully with mobile phone kits."
"The European car manufacturers must assume the costs of equipping all new manufactured cars with car phones in the interests of the medium to long-term future of road safety for car users and their passengers."
"In Ireland car users utilizing mobile phones when driving can be prosecuted for careless driving under the Road Traffic Act of 1961."
"The European Union must complement Irish legislation on this matter, especially as there will be one million mobile phones in Ireland by the end of 1998."
"Finally, phone penetration in Ireland, which presently stands at 15 % of the population, is set to double by the end of the year."
"With so many mobile phones in operation in Ireland and Europe, mobile phone car kits in the future will come to be viewed not as a luxury item but as a necessity in the interests of safer driving and road safety, and the European Union must act on this issue immediately."
"I compliment Mr Cornelissen on his excellent report."
"The debate is now adjourned and will be resumed at 3.00 p.m."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Madam President, on a point of order, I would like to say that two anti-crime procedures are currently under way."
"The first is the request for urgent debate before Parliament and the second is the referral to the Council. The request can be signed here in the Palais in Room 1155, next to the Documentation Service."
"Thirdly, I would like to ask if the Committee on the Rules of Procedure has already dealt with the refusal of the request for urgent debate at the last sitting."
"Mr Rübig, I can inform you that the necessary steps have been taken and the President of the European Parliament will be in constant contact with the Belgian authorities about this serious problem. The College of Quaestors, which meets tomorrow afternoon, has added this matter to its agenda."
"In other words, we have treated your request with all the seriousness it deserves."
"Votes"
"Madam President, please note that my colleague Mr Smith is ill today."
"Otherwise he would have been present in the Chamber."
"In accordance with the Bureau's instruction, please note my presence in the Chamber."
"I have noted that you are here, Mr Falconer."
"Before the roll-call vote on Amendment No 63"
"Madam President, could my presence in the Chamber be noted."
"I will not be participating in this vote."
"I would also advise those Members in the House who are interested in protecting their rights that these are appropriate votes in which to do as I am doing."
"The majority is overwhelmingly against the Green motion and no political causes will be lost in any protest."
"After the roll-call vote on Amendment No 67"
"Mr Falconer, I scrupulously respect the Bureau's instructions."
"When I said earlier that you were at the sitting, I meant you were free to vote or not to vote, and that I had noted your presence."
"I think that is all entirely correct in accordance with what we decided."
"- After the roll-call vote on Amendment No 58"
"Madam President, I wished to indicate that I was going to participate in that vote."
"Would you please follow the Bureau's instructions!"
"Mr Falconer, I fully respect your freedom."
"As I said earlier, you may vote, or you may not vote."
"The main thing is that we have taken note of your presence."
"Madam President, in this Parliament we vote to adopt texts or amendments or not to adopt texts or amendments."
"If you wish to adopt a text or an amendment, you vote in favour; if you wish to reject a text or an amendment, you vote against; if you want to do neither of those things but show that you are present here, you can always press the third button - the abstention button."
"(Mixed reactions) I know that some people claim there is a difference between abstaining and being present in the Chamber and not voting."
"I personally fail to see the difference."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will appreciate that we are not going to start a debate on this."
"Personally, I think there is an important nuance between abstaining and not participating in the vote."
"It is quite clear."
"I think Mr Falconer agrees."
"Madam President, I would have hoped that Mr Corbett, with his long experience as a senior staff member on the Committee on Institutional Affairs, would also recognize that difference."
"Before the roll-call vote on Amendment No 59"
"Madam President, the issue of the mandatory vote is much too serious to degenerate into a dispute between the Presidency and Mr Falconer."
"Therefore I wish to announce that I am present and that I will not vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"I will not participate in the vote on this report, Madam President."
"Very well, we will take note of that."
"(During successive votes, Parliament adopted the 9 legislative resolutions)"
"Madam President, before we proceed to the vote, I would like to point out that in the voting list two amendments have not been allocated to the correct paragraphs, and that Amendment No 19 tabled by the Group of the European People's Party would not relate to paragraph 18 but to paragraph 19."
"In that case, I shall vote against, as it would replace paragraph 19."
"The vote on Amendment No 28 tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should not be taken after paragraph 36, but as an addition to paragraph 45, because the issue is dealt with in that paragraph and it fits very well there."
"Please keep an eye on this during the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, I do not wish to delay the vote."
"May I ask you to have a general correction made to the text, of which the original is in Portuguese, because in the languages I can understand I have detected unacceptable errors."
"I have received many requests for this report which must be sent out in languages that I cannot read."
"I would also like to request the floor regarding Amendments Nos 11 and 5."
"On Amendment No 11"
"Madam President, this is not a linguistic problem."
"This is the same text that was submitted by Mr Paul Rübig of the Group of the European People's Party."
"This text was rejected in committee, and I have used it because I consider that it best expresses what we want to say."
"Therefore, this is indeed the text that Mr Paul Rübig submitted previously."
"On Amendment No 5"
"Madam President, I cannot accept this amendment because it has nothing to do with the euro."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, I tried to catch your eye before this last roll-call vote."
"I would like my presence in the Chamber recorded."
"I did not vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Madam President, I did not wish to delay proceedings earlier but your answer to me was that an abstention was not the same as not participating in the vote."
"I would like this to be referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"That ruling is tantamount to creating two different forms of abstention."
"You will have Members who wish neither to vote in favour of a text or against a text, but who wish to indicate their presence in the Chamber by pressing the button of abstention."
"You will also have Members who wish neither to vote in favour of a text nor against a text by not pressing such a button and indicating to you orally which, as we have seen today, causes a number of problems."
"I would ask this to be referred to the Rules Committee."
"Mr Corbett, as there are not many of us, I will tell you my opinion."
"It has often been the case that I have abstained from a vote because I did not wish to take a stance in favour of or against it but I accepted that it had been put to the vote."
"However, it sometimes (but more rarely) occurs that I do not participate in a vote in order to show a firm intention, which is very different from that of abstention."
"We will not debate this just now, but the question is very interesting at a constitutional and institutional level."
"We could submit it to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities and open up a very interesting debate on the subject."
"Madam President, this particular matter has been debated long and hard in this Chamber over the last session and this session."
"It has also been debated within the Socialist Group."
"The line is quite clear within the group."
"If Mr Corbett wishes to change that, he should take it back to the Socialist Group."
"The line is quite clear that when Members do not wish to vote, then they do not have to vote."
"They do not have to press any buttons to abstain or anything else."
"They just express the view that they do not wish to vote."
"This relates to a decision handed down by the Bureau."
"It was never brought to this Chamber."
"If Mr Corbett wants to push anything, perhaps he might support my call - which I made in previous Parliaments - for the Members of this Parliament to have a vote on this issue to clear up the matter once and for all."
"I would be quite happy to participate in that vote."
"Once we have got rid of the anomaly which the Bureau has created, we can then get back to the business of this Parliament."
"Until that time it would be far better for Mr Corbett to leave aside his institutional matters and put his political hat on."
"Perhaps then we can have politics entering the discussion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, although there are not many of us, but since we still have some time left - even though we have to count the interpreters' time and the explanations of vote still pending - we could prolong this debate."
"However, since it is not on the agenda, that is not possible."
"Mr Falconer, I am sorry but other Members are waiting and are hungry and have meetings and I must proceed to the explanations of vote."
"I think I really have properly respected your right to vote or not to vote, Mr Falconer."
"It has all been noted very carefully."
"I really could do no more."
"(Several Members requested to speak on a point of order) Since you insist, we will first have the explanations of vote, since we are concerned to behave properly towards our colleagues."
"We will then stay here to sort this issue out."
"It is really very interesting."
"Despite some reservations, we have chosen to vote for Mendiluce's motion for a resolution on the Western Sahara."
"We give our full support to the content of the resolution, particularly because the peace plan in question has been presented to and adopted by the UN Security Council. We also give our support to holding a fair referendum on self-determination."
"However, we are concerned about how the resolution is to be put into practice, since it forms part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, which we oppose in principle."
"The CFSP is only one of the tools used by the EU in the construction of a new state."
"Kuhn report (A4-0029/98)"
"The primary objective of all legislation should be to draw up fair, clear texts which are easy to implement and which guarantee considerable legal security for the public."
"However, neither the original Commission text on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, nor the amendments proposed by the Kuhn report meet these criteria."
"On the one hand, they are unbalanced and place too great a burden on the vendor, and possibly the producer."
"On the other hand, they bring about legal insecurity in which litigation procedures flourish, which if not favourable to consumers, will certainly benefit lawyers and legal experts."
"Three examples clearly illustrate the unbalanced nature of the texts proposed."
"Firstly, the length of the guarantee, which varies from two years - in the original text - to five years - in the amendment by the Green group -, when a legal duration of one year would seem sufficient, especially since the range of goods guaranteed is very large - from hairdryers to cars."
"We should remember that we are talking about a legal minimum here and that contractual guarantees, which are a factor in competition and promotion, can go well beyond this."
"A second problem is the inclusion of secondhand goods within the scope of this directive, when some of the clauses are ill-suited to these goods, for which the idea of flaws is difficult to define since they have already been used."
"Thirdly, there is the reversal of the burden of proof to the detriment of the vendor, when it is a general principle of law that it is up to the person with the allegation to produce proof of it."
"Roman lawyers had already given this type of reversed proof the name ""diabolical proof' , since it is so difficult to establish."
"The legal insecurity which is a source of endless legal disputes is a result of the inaccuracy of too many definitions, which are nevertheless essential."
"During the Parliamentary sitting, certain amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection were adopted as additions to the notion of consumer expectations and the buyer's right to an alternative option, thus making the text extremely vague and favouring the development of litigation."
"For these basic reasons and reasons of legal practice, it was not possible for the French members of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations to vote in favour of this text."
"Furthermore, it deals with basic principles of civil law, which is not one of the areas of Community competence."
"Any political action or legislative initiative in favour of consumer protection is a good thing and should be welcomed."
"However, that does not mean that such protection should be seen as an objective for its own sake, in isolation from the general context in which it should apply."
"It is well known that all rights have their limit, at the point where they come into conflict with the liberties and rights of other people."
"The Kuhn report, on the proposal for a directive on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, aims to safeguard consumer protection but because of the nature of some of the amendments which have been approved, that consumer protection in many cases conflicts gratuitously with the rights of the other agents affected by such a proposal. This could potentially result in unnecessary legal in defensiveness on the part of sellers and producers, and could also constitute a particularly significant burden for small traders and small companies, at a time when SMEs need all the help they can get to become competitive, so that competitiveness can allow new jobs to be created."
"Therefore I have voted against the Kuhn report, in the hope that for the second reading it may be possible to reach a balance - which does not exist at the moment - so that consumer protection can be made compatible with protecting the interests of producers, which are also legitimate."
"The idea that consumers should have a clear conception of their rights as regards guarantees when they buy goods in countries other than their own is an important one."
"If the common market is to have real meaning, then one aspect of its benefits is that people should feel confident about such things as guarantees when they buy goods in other European countries."
"The question is to what extent the European Union should not only seek to ensure that consumers have a clear idea of their rights, but should also harmonize the law so that the same rights obtain everywhere."
"To my mind, an approach which involves this degree of harmonization is the wrong one."
"It ignores the principle of subsidiarity."
"It interferes to an unacceptable extent in national laws regarding the sale of goods."
"These are laws which, in the case of my own country, the United Kingdom, have been established and built up on case law over a long period."
"The directive proposed is a very blunt instrument indeed to try to incorporate the detailed provisions of the 1979 Sale of Goods Act."
"The directive itself has caused great alarm among the people who will be most involved in dealing with its consequences."
"This is because the Commission text would allow the consumer to ask the seller either to repair goods free of charge or to replace the goods, or to demand a price reduction or rescission of the contract."
"The right to repair would operate for two years from the date of purchase; the right to replacement would operate for one year following purchase."
"No wonder sellers of goods affected by the directive are worried."
"Mrs Kuhn's amendments further complicate this situation."
"They certainly do nothing to resolve it."
"In drawing up the directive the Commission has loaded the dice in favour of the consumer."
"It is surely unlikely that a consumer who complains about what is described as a 'lack of conformity' existing in the goods he has bought will accept repair if replacement is on offer?"
"As one of my Swindon constituents asks: ' The scope for argument about what is a 'minor lack of conformity' is limitless and unscrupulous consumers might be encouraged to exploit the uncertainty created by these proposals, resulting in the courts having to cope with an influx of cases."
"Who will foot the bill for these legal costs?'"
"The answer to that question is, ultimately, other consumers."
"That is the foolishness of this proposal, a folly we see repeated again and again in the half-baked proposals produced by the consumer directorate in the Commission."
"Consumers will pay in two ways: firstly, because the price of goods will rise to take account of such extra costs."
"Secondly, because this kind of legislation acts as a disincentive to smaller retailers to stock products which might give rise to expensive legislation - or it adds that last straw which breaks the camel's back and brings the shutters down on the business once and for all."
"So what kind of legislation would help in this situation?"
"I believe it is probably the kind of legislation which the European Commission is least likely to provide."
"The Commission believes in big legislation - major directives and regulations which entail big changes across the commercial community."
"What is needed here is light-touch legislation."
"What is needed is an arrangement which ensures that when a consumer, coming from one Member State, buys goods in another, he or she is then informed about the consumer's rights under guarantee pertaining in that country where the purchase is carried out."
"It might also be desirable, if it is relevant, to inform the consumer of the agent of the company producing the goods in the country of the consumer's residence so that there is an information channel about the consumer's rights under guarantee in the country of purchase."
"That is a far cry from trying to draw up completely new EU-level laws regarding consumer guarantees and imposing these on the very different legal structures of the Member States."
"It would be a real help to consumers and it would be legislation that shows that the Commission is living in the real world."
"The Commissioner's feeble reply to the Parliament debate on Monday night shows that this is, in fact, very far from the case."
"I and my fellow British Conservatives oppose this directive and the Kuhn report."
"I am delighted that a European directive is devoted to improving consumer protection in Europe regarding the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees."
"The draft directive, amended by Parliament, is devoted to finding the best balance between the interest of the consumer and the responsibilities of the vendors and producers, without going as far as the wastage which could arise from a systematic exchange of all goods which have a fault, however minor, and which could in any case be repaired under the conditions of product quality maintenance."
"If it is worth having more guarantees for the buyer and more transparency for the secondhand market, we should question the basis of enacting rules which belong to the ""first hand' market in this case."
"I fear that this assimilation would in fact be difficult to implement."
"Furthermore, I would prefer a specific directive for secondhand goods to take account of the complexity of this area, whilst offering effective consumer protection."
"I have abstained on Amendment No 24, because in view of Austrian national law, which provides for a guarantee period of just six months, I am opposed to a quadrupling of the period to two years."
"Extending the period in this way would not only hit business, but also, above all, consumers themselves."
"They would be faced with price increases because of the higher risk factor that businesses would have to build in. Furthermore, legal proceedings become more onerous and costly the longer the time since the product was purchased."
"Lastly, it is totally contrary to the principle of good faith if the vendor has to assume liability for lack of conformity although the purchaser may have recognized the defect in both abstract and specific terms."
"It would be difficult not to agree with the aims of the draft directive on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees: to strengthen consumer protection and promote the quality of products."
"Unfortunately most of the means proposed by the text under examination, far from responding in an appropriate way to the declared objectives, on the contrary seem excessive, inappropriate and dangerous."
"By inciting the consumer to get involved in dangerous procedures in a whole range of areas, we may contribute to the fortunes of lawyers, but we will not protect consumers any better. Above all, we will overwhelm with even more obligations those small industries in the production and distribution sectors for whom the constraints of exploitation are already very great."
"This will increase the legal insecurity of manufacturers and business people, so the initial good intentions will actually have a negative effect on the economy and employment in the end."
"So we will vote against a whole series of dangerous clauses which risk opening up endless disputes and creating a general climate of legal insecurity which would be negative for everybody."
"We are opposed to the inclusion of secondhand goods within the scope of this directive."
"The concept of a legal guarantee does not seem to us to apply to a secondhand product such as a vehicle, whose characteristics vary depending on its usage, its age, its maintenance and so on."
"Under these conditions, how could a secondhand product be replaced by a comparable product?"
"Quite simply this does not make any sense."
"We are also against extending the guarantee period to two years."
"This is excessive, particularly given the increased level of consumer protection which the directive is targeting."
"A period of one year would seem reasonable and balanced, and therefore completely sufficient."
"The transfer to the producer and vendor of the burden of proof for lack of conformity also seems unacceptable to us, and contrary to the general principles of law."
"Article 3, paragraph 3, creates a presumption of imperfection at the time of delivery of the product if the fault is discovered within the six months following the actual delivery."
"We will vote against this clause, which we think is exaggerated and dangerous."
"The very notion of lack of conformity is defined in a very subjective way in the draft directive."
"The amendment by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection only aggravates things by introducing the term ""of consumer expectation' , which is even vaguer and therefore more likely to lead to many disputes."
"As regards the possibility of offering the buyer a replacement of the product when there is a fault of conformity, this opens up dangerous leeway, especially in high technology sectors such as the car industry or sailing."
"We think it is up to the vendor whether to offer repair or replacement, and failing that, the buyer can demand a reduction in price or termination of the contract."
"The other area showing dangerous leeway is the one being opened up by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection by proposing that the consumer can act directly against the manufacturer when the latter is not party to the sale contract."
"We would reject this proposal absolutely."
"Setting up a ""service to the client' network in all European countries for cases of direct purchase of a product in another Member State also raises problems and must be reexamined."
"If it is legitimate to seek to protect consumers adequately, this must not be at the expense of SMEs, by imposing unbearable constraints on them which would risk upsetting their permanently fragile financial balance."
"In France these small companies, which number 800 000, are currently the best job creators."
"In the period 1988-1995, they created 1.75 million jobs throughout the European Union."
"So we should be particularly careful not to endanger their equilibrium by imposing unreasonable constraints on them: this should be a priority for us."
"The proposal for a directive on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees has presented us with fundamental problems because there is not enough information about relevant law in the Member States."
"I have requested the European Commission more than once that alongside its proposals, it should carry out a comparative study of the law as regards the specific situation in the various Member States."
"Similarly, the Commission should provide Parliament with the key documents upon which its proposal is based."
"Of course, this support documentation only needs to be placed in the library, or made available in the form of some technical medium that can be copied easily."
"The second difficulty lies in the very varied interpretations which have been made of the proposal's content."
"The proposal fails to differentiate between two of the basic agents: the vendor and the producer."
"This has led to a regrettable state of confusion."
"Nor is any distinction made between perishable and non-perishable goods, which is an essential aspect when defining guarantees."
"The different responsibilities of the manufacturer and the vendor are not made clear either."
"The vendor can only take responsibility for those contract requirements which differ from the manufacturer's responsibilities."
"Furthermore, the fact that the proposal fails to describe the basic principles which regulate these matters in the national legislations has led to a veritable diaspora of amendments."
"The proposed text and the amendments which have been presented are unlikely to provide a clear result in favour of the consumer without hindering commercial relations."
"I am voting for this report on the condition that what is in the explanatory statement is correct."
"This explanatory statement clearly states that it is a question of a mini-harmonization of the Member States' national legislation."
"It is clear that the mini-harmonization to be carried out shall be subject to the respective national parliaments. That means it is up to each national parliament to decide at what level it wishes to adopt."
"So the mini-harmonization is a recommendation."
"My condition is therefore that Swedish consumer protection is in no way weakened through this harmonization."
"Directive on ornamental plants (C4-0044/98)"
"This matter is highly sensitive."
"To just vote for a Council Directive without debate is wrong because the Members have so few opportunities to acquaint themselves with what the Directive is about."
"Seed growers who sell vegetable varieties not registered by the EU are threatened with prosecution if they do not stop the sales."
"Only plants which are included on the EU's common varieties list are allowed to be sold."
"For a variety to get onto the list it needs to have an owner."
"Ownership costs SEK 20 000 per variety."
"In view of the above, especially the limited opportunities to get acquainted with this directive, we are choosing to abstain from the vote."
"Kellett-Bowman report (A4-0035/98)"
"Madam President, first of all I would like to thank you for humouring two of the passions of the honourable Member now speaking; namely, the greed which makes us want to go for lunch, and the laziness which prevents him from writing his explanation of vote."
"I would like to say one thing about the Kellett-Bowman report."
"I did not vote for this report for one simple reason. The report intelligently organizes the discharge and the conditions under which discharge is granted for a certain number of specialized agencies."
"Insofar as it concerns agencies which do not have financial autonomy, the system set out in the proposal is satisfactory."
"However, when it comes to agencies which have independent income, the system set out by Mr Kellett-Bowman, which was approved unanimously except for one vote by the Committee on Budgets and broadly by this Parliament, is highly unsatisfactory, because it actually ends up giving the power of discharge to the administrative council of the agencies concerned, which would be justified, but only gives firstly a simple power of opinion to this Parliament."
"I think it is a serious matter if we are going down this road and turning this Parliament into a sort of consultative body, subject to the superior arbitration of a technical body created by laws and regulations which we vote on here in this House."
"What we should have done was either to give up all participation by Parliament, or reverse the procedures and give Parliament the last word."
"I just wanted that point to be made."
"Graenitz report (A4-0009/98)"
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted for the report on general principles for the European Union's food legislation."
"It is very positive that the Commission's Green Paper recognizes that an extension of the product safety directive could improve overall consumer protection."
"The Danish Social Democrats are of the opinion that the acts in question should be revised in order to ensure they are based on the principle of caution and the principle of regard for consumer health and safety."
"The premise of food legislation in Europe should be environmental protection, and the aim should be sustainable food production."
"These proposals are all part of the same report, to which we give our support."
"With the new Treaty of Amsterdam, the EU seeks to secure minimum requirements in consumer policy, including giving appropriate consideration to consumer health and safety when legislating in the area of food."
"However, this will not affect the ability of Member States to retain or introduce regulations that provide better protection than the joint regulations."
"The Danish Social Democrats regard the European Parliament's report on food legislation as a step in that direction."
"There is no doubt that the present Green Paper on the current food law situation is very timely, in view of the crisis in food safety and consumer protection caused by the BSE scandal."
"Articles 129 and 129A of the Treaty of Amsterdam extend the legal base for more effective protection and precautions in policies directed at the consumer, which means that Community food law must be clarified and rationalized, together with its application and monitoring."
"We must not forget that many chronic diseases have their origin in food, and food products are not just another commodity like any other."
"So, as Mrs Graenitz rightly requests, the responsibility aspect has to be established with complete transparency, so that damaged consumer confidence can be strengthened."
"Finally, product labelling is very important for the consumer because it is the main source of information - indeed, almost the only source. It is therefore essential that such labelling should be complete, clear and truthful."
"In the aftermath of BSE, I believe information should also be provided (depending on the product) about the pesticides or animal feedstuffs used in its production and manufacture."
"Food is an issue of vital importance for the health and safety of consumers and for the quality of life of our citizens."
"However, it is a complex issue which requires the coordination of parallel policies and actions in order to safeguard and upgrade it."
"BSE has once again opened up the debate on the safety of foodstuffs and the health of consumers, which are problems resulting from an inadequate legislative framework and a lack of control over its implementation by the relevant bodies. The latter serve specific interests and are indifferent to the criminal repercussions on the health of our citizens."
"The events themselves, the fatal incidences of these serious ""unprecedented' diseases, should have forced us to confront the crucial questions about the quality of our foodstuffs and the enormous risks to consumer safety."
"The elaboration of clear, lucid regulations and directives is of course necessary in order to determine quality standards and to ensure the monitoring of foodstuffs."
"However, before any legislative intervention we must get to the root cause of the downgrading, distortion and alteration not only of our foodstuffs but of the whole of the food chain."
"It is not just the absence of up-to-date guidelines which places the burden of responsibility for this lamentable state of affairs on the foodstuffs sector. Those that already exist are also contravened in the most blatant manner."
"When the concept of food is commercialized and its administration handed over to the law of profit, and when the market determines the quality of foodstuffs on the basis of the cost-profit relationship, there will never be effective safeguards for the health of consumers."
"It would be naive to claim that liability for the disturbance of the food chain rests exclusively with the farmer or the cattlebreeder. Nor would this allow the problem to be confronted at source."
"On the contrary, liability must be sought in the intensification of production and in the pressures that producers face from traders, mass producers and large food multinationals to squeeze costs and increase the volume of production. This imposes on them the lavish use of fertilizers, pesticides and animal feeds, the composition and consequences of which they are for the most part unaware of, or have been misinformed about."
"Even more important, however, are the liabilities of those industries which process and mass-produce primary products before they are put on the market, using substances which not only downgrade the quality of the foodstuffs but also damage the health of consumers, who are used as guinea pigs."
"The policy relating to foodstuffs, and the safeguarding of their quality and of consumer health, require the reorientation of the policies implemented in the primary production sectors - agriculture, cattle breeding and fishing - and the effective monitoring of the manufacture and use of chemicals and other substances in food production, preservation and processing. They also require constant monitoring of the results of research carried out into the production of such substances, and the institution of measures and regulations, especially in the context of trade agreements formulated within the framework of the WTO and the Codex Alimentarius , which would prevent the unaccountable activity of multinational food companies."
"It is good that the rapporteur has adopted a consumer-friendly position."
"I would just like to stress three important areas which are urgent, and which the rapporteur has not emphasized sufficiently."
"Firstly, there is the question of antibiotics."
"It is important that we reduce the use of antibiotics in animal feed, especially since the derogation which Sweden has from the EU's weaker legislation is almost certainly going to expire."
"The EU must recognize the danger of using antibiotics."
"I therefore support Amendment No 28."
"Secondly, the rules on food labelling must be improved substantially so that consumers know what they are eating."
"In Sweden, the EU's rules have led to big problems for people with allergies, amongst others, because now they cannot get information about what products contain."
"The rules Sweden had before were better and clearer than the current EU rules."
"Thirdly, I also have objections to the legal framework being proposed."
"I would like the EU to lay down minimum rules rather than harmonizing rules."
"Minimum rules are better because you then give individual Member States an opportunity to introduce tougher rules than those set out by the EU."
"With the EU's harmonizing rules the levels are fixed and the development of better, tougher rules is prevented."
"This is bad, to say the least, and inhibits the development of environmentally-friendly rules."
"Future food legislation must be based on producer liability - grower and supplier liability."
"The main aim should be the protection of the health and safety of consumers."
"Product labelling should be obligatory and apply to all the ingredients in a product."
"Every country should have the right to allow considerations for the environment, health and safety to take precedence over the free movement of goods."
"EU rules on food and other consumer protection should be minimum rules; that is, a Member State should have the right to apply its own tougher rules."
"In international organizations, Member States should have an unrestricted right to promote food and consumer requirements which go further than those of the EU."
"With its Green Paper, the Commission has taken an important step towards much-needed rationalization of Community food legislation."
"This implies that existing EU legislation in this area must be reviewed with an eye to simplification."
"I give this my full support."
"However, it is also clear that future food legislation must guarantee consumer protection, while the internal market must be able to function without barriers."
"In its report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has added to those important aims by requiring responsibility on the part of the producer and the authorities, to provide safe and healthy foods as well as thorough consumer information."
"In my opinion, this is well-justified."
"I therefore give this report my full support, and I look forward to the concrete initiatives that the Commission will be taking based on the Green Paper."
"Our group has tabled six amendments which target three main objectives."
"The first stipulates the need to label foodstuffs sold in bulk clearly and legibly, so that consumers have clear information on their denomination, price and, if necessary, their origin."
"In fact the text proposed by the rapporteur discriminates severely between products sold in ""consumer units' and products sold in bulk."
"Regardless of the type of packaging, it is essential that the consumer has clear information."
"Our second group of amendments specifies the role of the Community scientific committees."
"These committees exist and should therefore serve as a point of scientific reference for drawing up regulations, directives and recommendations."
"Thirdly, our group rejects the principle that farmers and growers have the ultimate responsibility for the ""scientific' proof of the sanitary quality of their products."
"In fact, it is the operators in the farm produce and supply network who must produce this scientific proof."
"We must not forget that agricultural products can undergo intrinsic changes in their sanitary quality as a result of the technological processes used for their transformation, particularly with the use of biotechnology."
"Furthermore, farmers cannot have an in-depth knowledge of the sanitary quality of all the elements used in the production of their goods."
"I am thinking in particular of the cattle fodder they use and of the sanitary and environmental quality of slurry which they are likely to spread on their fields."
"Our group calls for respect for the principle of a specific vertical regulation on labelling."
"In fact, a number of agricultural products are subjected to specific transformation processes - I am referring particularly to the wine growing sector - or are sold directly in their original state to consumers (the fruit and vegetable sector) and should therefore come under a more restrictive vertical regulation than the horizontal directives which apply to the labelling of all food products."
"As regards genetically modified organisms, our group recalls that it is necessary to inform the consumer clearly on the possible use of GMOs in the composition of food products."
"The Commission has still not published the methods of application for this special labelling, and consumers are presently consuming food products with a GMO basis without being aware of it."
"That is unacceptable."
"The lesson of mad cow disease has been learned by the consumer."
"A recent survey in France by Sofres shows that 69 % of French people are against transgenic cultivation."
"So it is up to us to allow the European consumer to exercise clearly and easily his or her free choice between products with GMOs and products without GMOs at the same price."
"Clearly in this case is important that the GMOs are traceable from the field to the table."
"The principle of labelling has been retained."
"It must be applied to all ingredients whose DNA has been manipulated, not just to some of them, including both imported products and products from within the Community."
"I would remind the House of the scale of imports: for the farm produce industry in France alone, this amounts to 5 000 tonnes of soya and 8 000 tonnes of lecithin annually, mainly from the United States."
"However, the conditions of harvesting, storage and transport result in mixtures such that we cannot identify the presence or absence of GMOs in these imports."
"And it is this fundamental question we must tackle, because the European consumer who does not want to consume GMOs should not have to pay a surcharge for the privilege of exercising free choice because specifically non-GMO channels have to be set up for products which are difficult to find and identify, and which are therefore more expensive."
"This surcharge should be payable by those who change the rules of the game and who would like to impose a new mode of consumption."
"We should ensure that they can propose but not impose it."
"The idea of a supplement payable by the end consumer in order to avoid the ingestion of genetically manipulated foodstuffs is absolutely unacceptable."
"We consider this to be the food safety priority which the Community legislator must tackle if he wishes to do a useful job."
"Turning now to SMEs and farmers, the Commission must evaluate their capacity to integrate all the Community standards."
"We must remember that a regulation is only relevant if it can be applied by all operators."
"Finally, our group is opposed to multiplying structures, and therefore to the creation of a European agency for food safety, because it would mirror the work of the Community scientific committees and the monitoring bodies in the Member States, which have a key role to play."
"Some would like the Commission to be present as such in the Codex Alimentarius , a scientific body recognized by the WTO."
"Our group considers this to be a bad move, because the 15 voices of the Member States will always be heard more loudly than a single European Community voice."
"As we have seen during the international fishing conferences, when the Commission takes the place of the Member States, it weakens their positions instead of strengthening them."
"Food safety is an extremely important issue."
"I think there are some things missing in this otherwise excellent report."
"For example, it is unacceptable that we currently find that consignments of meat imported into Sweden with certificates of health turn out to be contaminated with salmonella."
"Similarly, measures should be taken to ensure that the routine addition of antibiotics to animal feeds ceases."
"In paragraph 36 of the draft report the Commission is urged to bring an action against the Council because it has not observed the deadline set for 1 January 1995 for a decision on measures required to combat salmonella in laying hens."
"It is, of course, a serious matter that the Council has not observed the deadline, but it is not appropriate to involve the European Court of Justice in this matter."
"Arroni report (A4-0061/98)"
"On the whole, Mr Arroni's report on the practical aspects of introducing the euro is satisfactory."
"He correctly stresses the need to inform consumers and prepare them for the arrival of the single currency."
"He does not omit to highlight the difficulty which this monetary revolution could represent for vulnerable population groups such as older or disabled people."
"As the need for information on the euro has now been largely acknowledged, it would be wise for this to be implemented effectively and quickly as our rapporteur rightly stresses."
"It would also be advisable to pay particular attention to SMEs, as they represent an important source of employment."
"I am in favour of Mr Arroni's idea of asking Member States to attach particular importance to the impact on companies of introducing a single currency, so that they will be able to benefit from all its advantages. This would mean that the impact on employment would be as favourable as possible."
"However, I would like to make two points, the first concerning dual pricing."
"If this is necessary, particularly in the phase when the euro and national currencies are circulating in parallel, it does not seem wise to me to make it mandatory, as the rapporteur proposes."
"The imposition of dual pricing would entail costs and inflexibility which would no doubt damage the proper functioning of the single market."
"However, it would be beneficial to install a code of good practice, at least for retail trade."
"My second point concerns the handling of the conversion of national currencies into euros."
"As the rapporteur says, it is desirable to call on the banking and financial sector to set up a code of good practice here too, to respect the principle that compulsory conversion should be free."
"In this respect, the proposals by the Socialists and the Greens to make this mandatory by means of a regulation do not seem wise to me."
"Healthy and honest competition between all those involved in exchange operations seems to me to be sufficient to deal with this."
"The fate of these proposals will determine how I vote on the report."
"Economic and monetary union is a centralist, high-risk project with a weak democratic basis."
"It prioritizes price stability and low inflation."
"There is a high risk that our already high unemployment will increase further."
"The regional differences between growth regions and depopulated areas could be increased."
"EMU leads to a strong centralization of monetary and currency policy which ultimately could also include fiscal and financial policy."
"EMU is a political project which increases the federal aspect of the EU and strengthens the trend towards the formation of a common state."
"To try to increase popular support for the EMU project, the Commission is now proposing information campaigns targeted at the general public and companies."
"Among other things, an invented cartoon character - ' Captain Euro' - is going to get people to change their views on EMU and the euro."
"This is unacceptable and a provocative use of taxpayers' money."
"It only risks further increasing the gap between the EU and the general public."
"Against the background of the above we have voted against the report."
"The Commission's report outlines the basis of a number of initiatives designed to facilitate preparations for the introduction of the euro both in the private sector and in public sector administration."
"In ten months' time, the euro will be an economic reality, and in three short years, the greatest monetary changeover in the history of the world will take place."
"Even so, the nations of Europe do not as yet have anything resembling a full picture of the tremendous impact the introduction of the euro will have - even in countries not immediately participating in the common currency - on all aspects of finance."
"It is therefore most gratifying that the committee's Policy Document acknowledges the obvious need for users of the new currency to be well-prepared and well-informed."
"Another crucial initiative, featuring prominently in the committee's Policy Document, is a code of conduct between financial institutions to pave the way for the smooth introduction of the euro. To this I give my full support."
"The introduction of the euro will undoubtedly give rise to very serious issues, only some of which seem to concern the Commission."
"The central element which is absent, in my view, from the deliberations of the Commission and from whatever preparations are under way at the level of the European Union and its Member States, is who will bear the brunt directly or indirectly."
"In other words, who will be called upon to pay the cost of conversion? We think that under the conditions of a free market and deregulation, this will be the end user - that is, ordinary working people."
"It is not by chance, as the Commission itself points out in its communication, that this threat is being brandished by large corporations in order to gain tax advantages and exemptions. Furthermore, they hope to gain new privileges in order to prevent the institution of what was initially widely supported as the essential element in the transitional period of conversion to the new currency: namely, mandatory dual pricing."
"We regard mandatory dual pricing, at least in the retail and distribution sectors, as the basic and minimum means to limit the profit-making tendencies which are characteristic of any changeover from one currency to another."
"With regard to the rapporteur's reference to the need for flexibility in the market and to the optional nature of dual pricing, we stress that, left to their own devices, markets have never led to 'better solutions' and there is no guarantee whatsoever that inflationary tendencies will be avoided."
"In parallel, there must be a strengthening of efforts to wipe out cases of profiteering, by means of direct governmental and criminal sanctions. Provision must also be made for the institution of the right for consumer organizations to sue for the protection of collective statutory interests."
"We are particularly concerned about the special problems faced by SMEs. Under the pressure of competition from large multinationals and also in the context of the conclusion of subcontracting agreements, they will be forced, from the very start of the transitional period, to undertake the necessary technical convergence (public accounting, infrastructure, etc.) which may prove fatal for many of them."
"In such cases we could agree on certain special measures of positive discrimination in favour of SMEs, particularly for the smallest ones employing fewer than ten people, to enable them to cope with the increased costs of conversion to the euro."
"These measures might relate to public accounting (e.g. speedier redemption of existing debt) or might take the form of special finance programmes or easier access to credit."
"We are categorically opposed to any attempt to turn the technical preparations for the introduction of the euro into a pretext for large corporations to increase their profits through tax deductions on the costs of investments and of restructuring brought about by the establishment of the euro, ' as well as the profits which arise from the abolition of the dangers of exchange rate fluctuations' ! However, these solutions are being examined."
"We would like to take this opportunity to repeat our request that the Commission issue a report on the effects of the euro on countries which will not be taking part, and also on the removal of the uncertainty surrounding the relations and exchanges between the 'Ins' and the 'Outs' . More generally however, we request information on the Community costs of the euro, which the members of the Commission officially accept as a fact, but which they assiduously avoid specifying, as do the other defenders of EMU."
"We wish to point out the disgraceful discrepancy between the policy of tough financial restrictions and sanctions in the event of infringement, and the waste of budget resources on ""information' campaigns and campaigns which manipulate working people into accepting a policy from which they have nothing to gain, as is shown by the tragic circumstances they are experiencing today and by their future prospects."
"Torres Marques report (A4-0078/98)"
"It could be said of Mrs Torres Marques' report on the euro and tourism that the proponents of the euro are scraping the bottom of the barrel."
"I do not know precisely what significance should be given to this, but I am sure they would have done better to leave this text where it was."
"It is based on a complete misinterpretation."
"According to the rapporteur, tourists will be happy to have their lives simplified by economic and monetary union and at the same time save on exchange charges."
"Throughout the report, it does not hesitate to make even more extravagant affirmations."
"For example, it states that the euro would represent for tourists - and I quote - a huge advantage if one considers that currently up to two-thirds of the value of their currency must be lost in exchange transactions before they even spend anything."
"Here we have evidence of old reading which has been badly digested, really very badly digested."
"In any case, it is highly likely that a tourist regards changing his or her national currency to that of the country visited as part of the charm of travelling and does not regard it at all negatively."
"Applying the same principle of unification, the rapporteur calls for complete abolition of border controls, doubtless so that tourists no longer even notice that they are going from one country to another."
"And tomorrow are we not going to be asked to use Esperanto in order to make tourists' lives easier?"
"It is not far off."
"Have we not already invented the virtual European monument which has no particular national characteristic and which will embellish future euro notes?"
"All in all, the Torres Marques report completely bypasses the subject."
"Tourists come to a country to appreciate its identity so if, by facilitating things for tourists we assassinate identity, it is really a very short-sighted policy."
"Furthermore, since I see that Mr Corbett is still in the Chamber, I will take this opportunity to thank our British friends for refusing to subscribe to the euro because, as a tourist, I would be really disappointed if the Queen's face no longer appeared on your bank notes."
"Since Sweden will not take part in the introduction of the euro in 1999-2002, we have chosen to abstain from the vote on this report."
"This is a question for those Member States which will be included in the euro zone."
"However, the report does contain some rather optimistic calculations with regard to growth in tourism thanks to a common currency area."
"In this context, we should remember that a big tourist industry in Europe is founded on a high level of general prosperity and has very little to do with a common currency."
"In spite of everything, conversion costs are marginal in this context."
"This prosperity could well be jeopardized through the creation of a common currency area in a region which is not optimal."
"Tourism is an important sector which is going to be greatly affected by the introduction of the euro."
"However, I am sceptical about the wording of this report, in particular the wording of paragraphs 17 and 20, which seek to interfere with issues of national importance where the EU does not have the right to act."
"This concerns national taxation and, as paragraph 20 states, that measures should be taken to harmonize taxation, especially VAT."
"This shows that the introduction of EMU is the first step in the building of a federal EU in which tax rules will also be harmonized and decided by the EU instead of being managed by the national parliaments."
"I cannot go along with that and I am therefore going to vote against the report."
"Nor do I think the Commission should introduce information campaigns before the introduction of the euro."
"But if that should happen, which could be justified for certain groups within society, then I think the national consumer organizations should be responsible for them."
"There would then be a significantly greater chance of the campaigns being informative rather than propaganda."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the Torres Marques report on the euro and tourism."
"In the report, the rapporteur proposes a number of measures to facilitate the tourism industry's transition to the new currency. She urges action to harmonize taxes and duties applicable to the tourism sector, specifically value added tax."
"The rapporteur focuses strongly on settling and harmonizing national levies."
"It is not clear whether it is a question of harmonization within the euro zone or throughout the entire Union."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament oppose in principle any harmonization of duties and taxes, since this would undermine the financial basis of the Danish Welfare State."
"The delegation has, therefore, chosen to vote against the report."
"We agree with the rapporteur on the strategic nature of tourism in general: as a sector for the creation of thousands of jobs; as the sector par excellence for the development of SMEs; as a means of economic development and recovery; and as a means of communication between different peoples."
"However, we would like to express our concern about the significant reduction over the last few years in the share of the European tourist industry in the international market. We are also concerned by the fact that, from the viewpoint of industrial relations, we are witnessing redundancies in their thousands, the widespread use of part-time employment, and the misery of limited contracts of employment and social dumping."
"More generally, and in contrast to the euphoria with which the rapporteur describes the situation in the sector, we are seeing the generalized use of flexible work patterns and the de facto promotion of 'elastic' labour relations."
"As for the hundreds of thousands of small SMEs, mainly family run, they are simply scraping along in an attempt to cope with increasing competition from large organized chains."
"No consideration has been given to these facts. The report simply proposes the establishment of a common policy on tourism with the insertion of the relevant chapter into the Treaty on European Union."
"It appears that the supporters of this proposal are inspired by those areas of Community responsibility such as the hundreds of thousands of devastated households in the agricultural sector, or by deregulation, redundancies and doubt as to the possibility of national intervention - for example in air transportation and telecommunications."
"In such circumstances the anticipated introduction of the euro will lead to the widespread restructuring of the sector."
"This is because the problem in the tourist sector is broader, given its international nature and its many complexities, compared with other sectors where participation or not in the common currency will initially concern a limited range of people in relation to transborder transactions (chiefly relations between traders and a limited number of consumer agreements)."
"Even in relation to this sector the Commission provides not the slightest information as to how the countries outside the euro will evolve, nor what the inevitable repercussions will be."
"Indeed, the existence of a unified currency could contribute to the simplification of certain procedures and to the saving of certain resources through the abolition of foreign currency transactions."
"However, under no circumstances should we delude ourselves about the results. Neither increased competition nor reduced indirect costs will lead to a substantial reduction in prices, as is demonstrated by the experience of liberalization and the granting of tax and other, financial, advantages."
"In parallel, increased competition leads to the consolidation of capital, to the reduction of employment, to the intensification of exploitation and to the failure of small businesses."
"Nor will they be able to cope with the cost of converting to the euro and with competition. This is even more true when they have very little access to information and to the capital market and when, as early as 1 January 1999, the application of the principle of ""no obligation, no prohibition' is being pushed forward in relation to the circulation of the euro as electronic money."
"Under these circumstances, we regard it as essential that special support be given to the smallest of the SMEs, either by making it easier for them to gain access to credit and to participate in finance programmes, or by means of preferential tax treatment."
"We believe that the deciding factor for the development of tourism is the financial position and standard of living of working people, since tourism, as the 'elastic' expenditure par excellence, is the first victim of political austerity."
"Moreover, the 'gradual reduction in working time and the corresponding increase in leisure time' will simply result in the search for additional employment, if it is accompanied by a reduction in already low incomes."
"With the policies imposed by Maastricht and EMU and with the ever intensifying worries about the effects of the introduction of the euro, we find it impossible to understand the rapporteur's vision of an 'expected improvement in the standard of living of consumers' ."
"If the EU really does desire the expansion of tourism it must formulate its policies with working people and the amelioration of their standard of living in mind and abandon its tough monetaristic stances which, as has been demonstrated, can only lead to dead ends."
"Wolf report (A4-0070/98)"
"Madam President, my group is very concerned about the impact of the introduction of the euro on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Up until now this issue has been treated very lightly, as if it were only a question of supply."
"But that is not the case."
"The equilibrium of SMEs could be seriously destabilized by the introduction of the euro, and clearly that is very worrying since this category of enterprises provides about two-thirds of the jobs in our countries."
"The advantages and costs of monetary unification, if it finally takes place, will be very unequally spread between enterprises."
"The advantages will be felt first by the big companies and larger SMEs which work at a European level."
"But the costs will affect everyone, and they will be all the more difficult to bear because the enterprises will not have access to adequate computer and accounting services, they will not be very well organized, and they will not have reserves available to finance transition costs. In fact, these are all the properties which characterize SMEs."
"Under these conditions, small and medium-sized enterprises risk suffering a serious loss of competitiveness compared with large enterprises."
"And this effect will be all the more pronounced if the euro does not produce all the benefits expected."
"If, as my group believes, the stimulating effects of suppressing both the costs of conversion and the internal uncertainties about change are cancelled out by the recessive effect of the new monetary inflexibility and transition costs, the fall-off in growth will strike the most fragile enterprises first, and again these are SMEs."
"All in all, the new euro zone will be soft on large enterprises but hard on the small ones."
"How can we redress the balance?"
"Those responsible for the transition are still discussing increasing awareness and better information for the public."
"That is very inadequate, but how can they do better?"
"The Member States will obviously not be able to subsidize everyone."
"That would be disastrous."
"In reality, what we have here is a practical inconvenience which follows from the very concept of the system, that is, the universal and mandatory changeover to the euro."
"If we had chosen the path of a common currency with a progressive and optional development, all these problems would not exist."
"Since Sweden will not take part in the introduction of the euro in 1999-2002, we have chosen to abstain from the vote on this report."
"This is a question for those Member States which will be included in the euro zone."
"We can only point out that we consider it a mistake in Sweden's case that the Swedish Central Bank is now independent of political influence."
"We do not think it should be."
"The report by Mr Wolf on legal convergence in the Member States in terms of the euro indirectly poses the question of the role of the European Central Bank and its independence."
"I regret that the report does not sufficiently demonstrate the need to form a European economic government which should act as a counterbalance to the ECB to prevent purely monetary logic dominating in certain arbitration, when support for growth and employment should be guaranteed."
"Although the creation of a Eurocouncil allows an exchange on economic and monetary policies in a positive attempt at coordination, it does not have any powers."
"I would have liked the proposals which aim to strengthen the role of the Eurocouncil to be included in the report."
"While the report mentions the democratic duty of the ECB to report at Community level, it would have been a good idea to clarify and reinforce the role and power of the European Parliament in dialogue with the ECB."
"If the explanatory statements - which are meant to be the basis of the draft resolutions - were put to the vote, then we would happily vote for the text of Part B of this report."
"The explanatory statement compares three levels for convergence between the legal provisions of Member States."
"The first level, which still exists, relates to Member States themselves and their legislations. The second relates to what is already enshrined in treaties entered into between countries which keep pace with, promote or facilitate 'European construction' , while the third derives from the position of the European Monetary Institute, as discussed in the report covered by this explanatory statement and draft resolution of the European Parliament."
"It is clear that the EMI could apparently resolve the thorny task of making compatible and articulating the different national and supranational levels without difficulty, engaging in tasks of drafting and enforcement which far exceed its powers in a democratic context."
"It even goes so far as to acknowledge that specific national features may continue to exist , provided that, as stipulated in the Treaty, each Member States must ensures that, at the latest, by the date of the establishment of the ESCB, its national legislation including the statutes of its national central bank is compatible with this Treaty and the statute of the ESCB."
"Indeed, Portugal has already done this ahead of time with its constitutional review, which transfers responsibility for defining the competences of its central bank to commitments entered into in international organizations."
"In his report, particularly in the explanatory statement, Mr Wolf draws attention to this difficulty and denounces the expeditious manner in which the EMI resolves it."
"In doing so, he raises a number of issues which are fundamental in a democratic process."
"We could quote many of his views, but we will concentrate on the question: ""What exactly is meant therefore by the requirement of central bank independence?'"
"Inevitably, the draft resolution is less specific."
"It was the only way in which it could escape the steamroller process which countenances no doubts, questions or alternatives."
"Although it is drafted less clearly, and despite a significant number of votes against, it was nonetheless passed at the committee stage."
"And it has our vote in the House, although our support is really for the explanatory statement."
"Arroni, Torres Marques and Wolf reports"
"The three reports on different aspects of the impending monetary union did not get my approval."
"The resolution on the practical aspects of the introduction of the euro is the one I object to least. However, it is extremely undesirable to let public information programmes about the euro deteriorate into advertising for the euro, as suggested in paragraphs 10 and 17."
"Nor can I agree with the position obliging retailers to use dual pricing during the transition to the euro."
"The Torres Marques report looks very much like a blown-up balloon."
"The enormous advantages for tourists are highlighted with a great deal of verve."
"But these apply primarily to the tourist who travels through various countries in the European Union, and not so much to holiday-makers visiting a single country."
"And those who use electronic methods of payment will hardly notice the euro."
"Furthermore, various costs relating to the changeover will lead to higher prices."
"The 'enormous' advantage will thus be largely undone."
"I am therefore unable to see the usefulness of this report, all the more so because tourism policy is a national affair."
"Mr Wolf's report - which is supposed to deal with legal convergence in the Member States - shows that the European Parliament lacks the right perception of monetary policy."
"The target of price stability is judged one-sidedly in this report, as well as elsewhere."
"Conversely, the European Parliament appears to be so preoccupied with welfare growth and job creation that it believes this can be realized through monetary policy."
"My first objection is that establishing price stability as the only target will have a negative effect on economic development."
"My second objection concerns short-sightedness: the economic development pursued will have to be sustainable in an ecological sense if it is to be of use to the next generation."
"If these objections are not taken into consideration, a democratic responsibility owed by the ECB to the European Parliament will not do much for the European citizen."
"Madam President, Mr Falconer is absolutely right that there is no obligation for a Member to take part in a vote."
"There is no obligation to vote for or against a particular text, nor even to express a view on a text."
"However, if a Member wishes to indicate that they are present in the room, despite not wishing to take a view, then they have the option - not the obligation - to press their abstention button which shows that they were there, even though they did not wish to take a position on that particular text or amendment."
"You say that there are different types of abstention."
"Maybe an abstention can mean a different thing."
"That is precisely the objective of explanations of vote, that we have just sat through now."
"If you want to indicate that you voted for or against, or abstained for a particular reason, this is the opportunity afforded by the Rules of Procedure to explain that nuance."
"But what we do not need is two separate and different ways of not expressing a position for or against a particular text."
"I would submit to you, and through you, to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, that only one way is necessary."
"That would simplify our votes greatly."
"Indeed there might be further ways of simplifying them when we are not having an electronic or roll-call vote."
"It might be sufficient for the President to say who is in favour, who is against."
"We do not, in those circumstances, need to know who is abstaining when a simple majority is required."
"But that is another matter."
"I would finish by returning to a remark by Mr Falconer who implied that this was an institutional question and not a political question, or something along those lines."
"I wonder whether those who have been making repeated remarks in successive votes in successive plenary part-sessions on this issue do not have a political motive behind them."
"Mr Corbett and Mr Falconer, you have asked to speak."
"I would point out that it is 1.29 p.m."
"We cannot impose on the interpreters."
"I will permit you to speak for just one minute."
"And if you wish you can then continue this conversation over a glass of brandy or a glass of water, whichever you prefer."
"Madam President, I agree with you."
"I do not wish to take up the interpreters' time."
"The interpreters should have left long ago."
"It is Mr Corbett who is taking up the interpreters' time."
"As he is challenging something I have done, I have the right to reply."
"I will reserve and protect that right."
"Any Member who sits in this House and represents the Presidency should also protect that right to reply."
"Mr Corbett says you have the option to abstain, which is a form of participation."
"The question of not participating in the vote means that you do not wish to participate in the vote, so that is not an option."
"This House decided to deal with explanations of vote a long time ago."
"That is the way the matter would be best served at the present time."
"I would like to see them returned to the way they were previously, but we dealt with them a long time ago and this House voted on them."
"Lastly, I say to Mr Corbett: yes, I have got a political point of interest in this matter."
"I refuse to be treated as a child."
"I refuse to be treated in the same way as people who do not come here Mondays and Fridays."
"I normally come here Monday through to Friday and am a diligent person, as are 99 % of this House."
"I refuse to be treated as a child for the minority's sake."
"Therefore the quicker the Bureau reviews these rules - as I understand they are doing - the better."
"I would urge you to disregard Mr Corbett's request to refer this to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"The Bureau has already handled this matter."
"That is where the matter should rest until the Bureau reviews the silliness that it has put us in at the present time."
"Your words will be recorded carefully in the Minutes."
"I would thank the interpreters for their patience."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.) ."
"Promoting road safety in the EU (continuation)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0065/98) by Mr Cornelissen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission ""Promoting road safety in the EU - the programme for 1997-2001' (COM(97)0131 - C4-0180/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, any discussion of safety on Europe's roads inevitably involves talking about ignorance, repression, dangerous negligence and criminal complacency."
"And that goes for politicians just as much as drivers!"
"Any debate about improving safety is bound to turn around the facts that we have already heard several times today: 45 000 dead and 1.6 million injured every year, or 123 deaths every day on Europe's roads."
"The deaths alone are equivalent to virtually wiping out a medium-sized European town every single year."
"So it is good that the Commissioner and the Commission have brought forward a programme to promote road safety."
"Pam Cornelissen deserves enormous respect for his very comprehensive report and the details it includes on the causes of accidents."
"Indeed, I would not have expected anything else from him."
"Improving road safety implies a whole range of measures - life-long road safety training for young and old, all kinds of technical measures both on the roads and in vehicle safety - airbags, safety belts and lights are just the headline issues - and special protection is needed for the most vulnerable road users: children, the elderly, pedestrians and cyclists."
"However, in my view there are two things that are absolutely central, two issues on which our fellow citizens need to be more aware and politicians need to have more courage. Alcohol and speed."
"The following rule of thumb seems to apply: the more you have drunken and the faster you drive, the more people are killed and injured."
"The opposite also applies of course."
"That is why we need a radical approach to alcohol limits and pan-European speed restrictions."
"However, I find the Commission's call for speed limits too vague and too open to interpretation."
"Back in 1990 Parliament voted clearly for the following speed limits for cars in EU Member States that at present have no limit: 120 kmph on motorways, 100 kmph on ordinary roads, and 30 or 50 kmph in residential or built-up areas respectively."
"If individual Member States decide to introduce even lower speed limits, that is something we should applaud and support."
"Anyone who says comprehensive limits will not work should look at the limits for lorries, that has been a success story for Europe."
"If we can have a speed limit for heavy goods vehicles, why not have one for cars too?"
"We should leave no stone unturned to achieve the Community target of reducing deaths on the roads to 25 000 by 2010."
"Every victim of a traffic accident on the roads is a victim too many, and I therefore urge you to support my amendment."
"Mr President, firstly I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Cornelissen, for his magnificent work in drafting this report."
"I hope his work will serve to raise the awareness of all the players concerned: institutions, vehicle designers and manufacturers, users, safety experts, traffic agents, transport companies, insurance companies, vehicle maintenance and repair workshops, driving schools, and so on."
"We are very sensitive to disasters of all kinds - as we should be - but for some incomprehensible reason we find it exasperatingly easy to resign ourselves to accepting that enormous disaster which takes place week after week on the roads of the European Union, resulting each year in nearly 50 000 deaths and more than 1.65 million injuries. The report quotes the figure of half a million hospital admissions, of which 25 % end in disability."
"So, Mr President, a greater effort needs to be made in this area, both by the Community and by each of the Member States, which are obliged to promote technological development in safety matters and to make imaginative efforts when it comes to producing road safety plans. The standard excuse of not having enough resources should not be accepted any longer."
"The economic and social costs of these accidents are extremely high - not to mention the human cost, which is immeasurable. Indeed, the cost is possibly greater than the expense it would take to avoid such accidents, if the political will existed."
"For all those reasons, Mr President, I welcome the Commission communication and Mr Cornelissen's magnificent report."
"Mr President, as 45 000 people die each year in traffic accidents in the EU area, we might be tempted to view traffic as one colossal catastrophe."
"We do not take this view, however, seeing that contemporary society could not survive without it, and given that accidents do not all happen at the same time and in the same place."
"In a way, traffic safety is comparable to the protection of the environment."
"Everyone says they think it is important, but only a few want to do anything about it in practical terms."
"Because it is undeniable that the cause of a very large number of accidents is speeding, apart from tightening up the law we should look at the reasons why motorists drive too fast."
"One certain factor in this is car and motorcycle advertising that focuses on high speeds and other features which are just not viable for the normal motorist."
"The success of a given make of car in competitions, rallies or circuit racing, is very often used to advertise a vehicle intended for everyday use."
"This must be one of the reasons why car manufacturers invest very large sums in competitions."
"In this way, people are lured into a driving culture that only befits the race track, and not always that either."
"We must support a system of specific and uniform speed limits for the whole of the EU area."
"In that way dangerous drivers would no longer be so able to use ignorance of traffic regulations as an excuse, still less a justification."
"Even today there is still opposition to speed limits, in the name of civil liberties."
"But it is a question of people's right to use the road network as safely as possible."
"The right to endanger life cannot be a part of the civil liberties lobby."
"On the same principle, we should have common European legislation to enforce the use of driving lights even during daylight hours."
"The idea is that a driver can see oncoming vehicles and vehicles behind in sufficient time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, road safety is a complex, interdisciplinary business, encompassing a wide variety of technical and above all human factors."
"My main reaction to Mr Cornelissen's excellent report is a very positive one, but I do have some concerns."
"I am pleased at the number of important and fundamental suggestions and practical proposals for improving road safety."
"I personally feel that an improvement is urgently needed not just because it can be shown that the annual economic cost of road accidents is over 100 billion ECU, not to mention the unquantifiable and immeasurable human suffering involved, but because like anyone else I would like to feel safe on the roads of neighbouring countries."
"This also applies when help is needed after an accident."
"I have had very good first-hand experience, in a state that fortunately no longer exists, of doing a first aid course as part of learning to drive."
"I am concerned to see signs that the proposed action programme may lead to powers not provided for under the EC Treaty, with legally binding decisions being taken at European level."
"Surely voluntary agreements would do the job just as well without a flood of red tape and regulations."
"I would only recommend voting for the report if six of the seven amendments to be voted on tomorrow are rejected, and only if I am sure that Paragraphs 7b and 7e, which can be summed up as 'rigid maximum speed limits' and 'introduction of a panEuropean penalty system' , do not get through."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming the report and certainly the intention behind the Commission's concern to see action in this matter."
"I cannot add much to what has been said already, except to highlight perhaps two areas of concern."
"One is the relationship between alcohol and accidents."
"Fewer than 5 % of motorists drive over the legal limit but they alone cause 20 % of the fatal accidents."
"I strongly agree with the proposal to limit the level of alcohol to 0.5 mg/ml, along with proposals to ban the sale of alcohol in service stations and the standardization of the apparatus of breathalysers."
"My other point is this: now is the time to consider the harmonization of penalties and their application throughout the whole Community, so that drivers penalized, say, in England, Wales or France are not still able to drive in Germany or Belgium."
"I would hope to see such legislation coming forward from the Commission."
"I wish the Commission every success in its endeavours to make our roads safer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the Commission's initiative to launch an action programme to promote road safety in the EU."
"The high death toll on Europe's roads is appalling, and something must be done about it."
"We should all be interested in cutting the number of accidents."
"Drunken driving is one of the most common causes of accidents."
"That is why there should be a maximum blood alcohol limit of 0.5 mg/ml for drivers."
"Austria has already introduced such a limit."
"However, it is not just alcohol that impairs people's fitness to drive, medicines and drugs can also affect it."
"This should be reflected in legislation and we must adopt measures to tackle this problem."
"Strict and consistent controls on road-users are essential."
"Monitoring of speed restrictions is a priority here."
"With regard to the disqualification of drivers and Europe-wide recognition of this disqualification, we need to remember that there has been no pan-European harmonization of legal systems, which is an essential requirement for this."
"Unless administrative and legal provisions are harmonized across Europe, there can be no question of reciprocal recognition of disqualification, as the conditions for disqualification vary so widely from one Member State to another."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that it is sensible for us to make an effort to handle this matter at the European level."
"I want to express my thanks to Mr Cornelissen, to the Commissioner and to all who have contributed to making this a European issue."
"The number of people being killed on the roads has been mentioned several times today."
"A ferry disaster always creates a sensation."
"May I point out that 45 000 people die on the roads each year, the equivalent of the Estonia disaster 45 times over."
"What we must look at jointly is the construction of cars, crossborder traffic and the increasing amount of traffic on our roads, so there is plenty to be getting on with. I agree with my colleagues, but I would just like to point out that there are different traffic cultures, so we would be doing ourselves a service to allow development from below and not so much from above, if we want to create joint regulations."
"My recommendations are no different from those of my colleagues."
"I would simply like to point out that when alcohol and medication are mentioned, then fatigue - that is, driving and rest periods - should also be mentioned."
"So in order to achieve the objective, the action plan must come from the Member States and not just from the Commission, even though I support the Commission - and Parliament - in taking the lead."
"Traffic safety is something that affects us all."
"Let me say something about speed."
"It is important for us to agree on frameworks for speed limits and not have speed limits that are too different."
"Some accidents are caused simply by driving from a country with high speed limits into a different country with lower speed limits."
"I would also like to mention an issue that the Red Cross is not alone in having raised."
"Professional assistance is not the only thing needed on the roads when an accident happens."
"We should also do something about providing first aid on the spot."
"Whether it should be part of qualifying for a driving licence I am not sure, but in any case it is something worth considering. In closing, I would like to underline the importance of having secure frameworks for traffic, the safety of citizens, and so on."
"Finally, I would like to say that we are all very concerned about not being killed by a serving of British beef. If we could be equally aware of what is going on in the area of traffic, we would come a long way in a Europe whose future is based on cohesion and mobility."
"Mr President, I should first like to apologize to the House and in particular to Mr Cornelissen for the fact that I was slightly late getting here today."
"As Mr Cornelissen will know, this was entirely due to the fact that I was held up by a horrific multiple car crash on the French motorway system."
"This, tragically and graphically, underlined the great significance of the subject we have under consideration today, namely Mr Cornelissen's report on the Commission communication on road safety in the Union in the coming years."
"I congratulate Mr Cornelissen on the thoroughness of the report which he and his colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism have produced."
"I am pleased but not surprised that there is strong concurrence between the opinions of Parliament and the Commission on the matters under consideration, not only the desirability of enhanced standards of performance in terms of road safety but also the general strategy to be adopted at Union level in order to achieve that improvement."
"I am glad to note in particular that there is agreement on some of the new elements we have introduced in the most recent communication, such as the development of an integrated European Union information system on road safety which will assist with the identification of particular problems and be available to Member States to encourage further efforts by them for road safety strategies."
"There is agreement on the need to improve enforcement of road safety laws, no matter what other changes we make."
"The need for stringent enforcement will be universal and will continue."
"The need for strengthening road safety education has been commented on in the report and in this debate."
"We would endorse that fully."
"The need to achieve better and wider use of safety belts, not only in the front of vehicles but in the rear seats of cars where appalling casualties still take place, even in the countries with the highest level of conformity with the seat belt laws."
"The need to moderate speed has been emphasized by several speakers in this debate."
"There is no question but that speed is a killer in all road conditions and weather circumstances and that is worth emphasizing."
"The need to combat drink-driving is evident and I welcome the support given by Parliament yet again to the Commission proposal, which is now nine years old, for the universal introduction of a lower tolerated level of blood alcohol content."
"There is increasing awareness of the need to develop technical and legal means to combat more effectively driving while under the influence of drugs."
"So far as the harmonization of penalties is concerned, as an individual I would most certainly endorse those sentiments expressed by Members that would favour the harmonization and universal enforcement of penalties across the European Union."
"However, as Parliament will understand, this is a question that arises under the so-called third pillar and largely remains an intergovernmental issue."
"Unfortunately the Commission is not yet in a position to take an initiative on this matter."
"I am sure the day will arrive, through sheer practicality and out of common interest, when a change will be made."
"There is broad agreement too on the efforts being made to develop safety rating systems in order to provide consumers with accurate information on the safety standards of their vehicles in any particular category of cars, and broad agreement on the need to take full account of the very high economic and financial cost of road accidents and to use a cost/benefit approach on road safety measures."
"On this issue there will be a specific communication from the Commission in the very near future."
"It is inevitable that a report which is as thorough and comprehensive as Mr Cornelissen's will diverge in some respects from the approach taken by the Commission."
"I should like briefly to respond to those points of often quite mild divergence."
"Firstly there is the question of whether it is appropriate to establish at European Union level a numerical target for the reduction of the annual number of road deaths from the current awful level of 45 000 a year to a maximum of 25 000 by the year 2010."
"I do not agree with such a target for three reasons."
"Firstly, Member States vary to a considerable degree in their practices and their views on the establishment of targets."
"Some already set targets which they would be reluctant to review."
"Others do not favour targets at all."
"It is therefore not really credible for the Commission or Parliament to set targets when we have no legal means of compelling Member States to attain those targets."
"Despite these considerations, we could set indicative targets with all the best intentions in the world of achieving them."
"Then, when circumstances beyond our control prevent the targets from being met, all that would be recalled is our over-optimism."
"The criticism that would come from that does not concern me at all."
"The distraction from the serious efforts that had been made to reduce deaths and injuries would be a real matter of concern."
"Given the predilection in some parts of the European press, including the British press, to trivialize even the issue of road deaths and appalling injuries, I prefer to avoid the problems that would attend target setting and concentrate instead on the main basic issues."
"Taking all of these considerations into account, I do not think it would be realistic to set a precise target at European Union level."
"I would, however, remind the House of the Commission's conviction that if the measures proposed in our communication were followed and implemented, the Community could reasonably look forward to the number of deaths being reduced by 7 000 by the year 2000 and by around 27 000 by the year 2010."
"Those figures and the reasoning behind them will I hope spur greater efforts in Member States and among drivers to make changes in provision and behaviour, changes that can save many lives."
"That approach does not carry with it the problems that might arise from target setting."
"A second point of divergence from Mr Cornelissen relates to the budget allocated to road safety by this Parliament and operated by the Community."
"Like Mr Cornelissen, I deplore the 50 % cut in the budget line B-2702 and I agree that serious consideration should be given to the utilization of money from the B-2704 line in 1998."
"However, line 2704 covers other important priorities for our transport policy which are shared by this House and following the suggestion made in the report would mean robbing Peter to pay Paul."
"I am sure that on reflection no one in this House or in the Committee on Transport and Tourism would want that."
"The budget reduction will inevitably cause delays for some of the measures we had hoped to support this year."
"That is highly regrettable but realistic since our future actions will have to be based on the money available to us."
"I hope those responsible for calculating and setting the budget will in future heed the fact that there are few issues more important to the general citizenry of the European Union than trying to advance safety on our roads."
"The budget should reflect that priority."
"Thirdly, and finally, I agree with Mr Cornelissen's view about the need to establish a clear list of priorities and to rank measures according to their casualty reduction value."
"However, in addition to that criterion, other important factors should be taken into account, such as the cost/benefit ratio of the measures, their added value arising from the European dimension or the state of progress already made at Community or Member State level."
"As far as the remainder of the report is concerned, I can confirm that we stand foursquare with the views expressed."
"We will continue to work as effectively as we can to make every possible reduction in those terrible figures of 45 000 fatalities and 1.6 million injuries each year, and, of course, the human misery and economic cost which those casualty figures generate."
"In these efforts, we are clearly strengthened by the active support and interest of this House and by Members like Mr Cornelissen and his colleagues who have shown and continue to show consistent dedication to improving road safety as they have for many years."
"Mr President, whereas this is an own-initiative report, could the Commissioner please comment on the fact that where we have a directive on the European driving licence, I made a proposal that we include some education on first aid in difficult circumstances like he was in this morning; that is, to give first aid and include it in the driving licence education."
"I can certainly see the virtues of such a system."
"However, I offer a caution to Mr Wijsenbeek that while there are people who are very proficient in giving first aid and can contribute towards saving life and saving pain and further injury, that is not universal."
"We have to be very careful, therefore, about putting any form of education or instruction in driving licences or other documents that might encourage people who, with the best intentions, would try to give first aid without the necessary expertise."
"Appalling additional injuries can be caused by people who have goodwill but are inexpert."
"So we would want to examine that very closely."
"Mr President, we differ in opinion about whether a concrete political target should be set."
"We will have to discuss it further."
"I would merely like to point out that those countries which have had the courage to set numerical targets achieve better results than others, and I believe this to be an extremely important argument."
"Secondly, Mr President, the budget."
"The Commissioner knows that it is not unusual for the Commission to come up with an additional budget during the course of the year, and my concrete question on behalf of our committee is, if this happens this year, if it proves to be necessary - and we have indications that it will be necessary - will the Commissioner take the opportunity to obtain enough money for the necessary research?"
"Mr President, it is not enough merely to say how important road safety is. It will have to be reflected in the budget."
"Noblesse oblige ."
"Thirdly, Mr President, did I understand correctly that the Commissioner is coming up with further details on his package of measures."
"We think it is very important to know which measures will be proposed by the Commission, so that we can keep a finger on the pulse."
"I would be grateful for a specific answer from the Commissioner to these three points either now or later."
"Mr President, there is a check list in our communication and we are happy to receive questions, demands, correspondence and contacts of various kinds in order to try to ensure, virtually on a week-byweek basis that we can provide reports on the progress being made in the implementation of the 65 or so different measures that are at the back of the communication."
"Not only do we readily respond to those questions, we actually welcome them simply because they are a way of keeping up the pressure and drawing public and political attention to the need to make progress on that."
"So far as the budget is concerned it is not so much a matter of noblesse oblige as of vitesse oblige ."
"We are capable any time of the year of finding really good use, highly productive use, without a penny being wasted for any supplementary budget resources."
"I would simply urge those who are already arguing for additional resources for the safety budget line to keep up their work, knowing that if additional resources become available to the Commission - which has very limited influence and power over these matters - then anything directed to our safety programme will effectively be used."
"The first part of the question related to targets and I certainly applaud those Member States that employ a target-setting system."
"The difference between them and us working at Community level is, of course, that they have direct sovereignty and charge of enforcement systems and an assortment of other means of trying to ensure that their targets are actually fulfilled."
"Those means are denied to us for all the obvious reasons and that is why there is a difference between trying to set a target at Community level covering some 350 million citizens affecting 45 000 road deaths and setting targets at the national or indeed the local level which are more capable of being attained simply because of the reinforcement action that can be taken."
"The difference of dimension makes a difference in strategy and I hope that honourable Members will acknowledge that reality."
"Mr President, I am most disappointed that the Commissioner simply ignored the very simple question that I put."
"Does the Commissioner not share my concern that whereas people who persistently drive with two or three times over the legal limit and who cause death and injury are allowed to continue to drive after quite a short prison sentence, innocent diabetic, insulin-dependent drivers are being prevented from driving now in the UK?"
"Would it not be better for the Commission to concentrate on enforcing existing rules before applying new ones?"
"Mr President, I just wish to point out one or two things."
"First of all, I did not ignore the point made by Miss McIntosh."
"If the normal rules of order are applied, she was quite out of order in introducing the subject into a debate on a report on road safety."
"Secondly, however, far from ignoring her, I already took over ten minutes when I had been allocated five, and I could not get every response in. Thirdly, far from ignoring her, I know I have written her a very long letter explaining exactly the meaning and the letter of the law and what it implies in the United Kingdom."
"Fourthly, she inadvertently misled the House in her original contribution this morning, because it is not true to say that the rules concerning insulin-dependent diabetic drivers are only being applied in the United Kingdom."
"They are being stringently applied elsewhere."
"We can each of us have our own opinion about the significance, the relevance, the effectiveness and the proportionality of that particular law."
"As I pointed out in my letter to her and to many other honourable Members and others who have communicated with me on the subject of diabetic drivers, the basic power to interpret and apply the law rests with Member States, not with the Commission."
"The Member States are acting on the basis of the most informed medical expert advice."
"Their judgement is that the law should be applied in the way in which it is being applied."
"It is not for the Commission to make an interpretation."
"We do not have the power to undertake the enforcement of this law."
"I would be obliged if honourable Members, before accusing me of ignoring their questions, were to take into account what I have provided them with at length on previous occasions, as well as the time I have available for answering questions."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Registration of ships' passengers"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0068/98), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships operating to or from ports of the Member States of the Community (Rapporteur: Mr Watts) (C4-0620/97-96/0281(SYN))."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate my colleague on his very serious attempt to achieve the necessary convergence of opinion between Parliament and the Council on the institution of directives which aim in good faith to ensure ferry safety."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to put forward my own personal view of the way in which the Council is attempting to strengthen the conditions that are essential to ensure ferry safety."
"After the tragic accidents at sea over the last few years, and especially following the shipwreck of the Estonia , the Council, and to a large extent the Commission, were reduced to a state of near panic and, with a succession of proposals, directives, or recommendations, set about restoring some feeling of safety in the minds of the citizens of the EU, who were justifiably anxious about the level of ferry safety."
"But whatever and however many measures are taken under the pressure of such events, I am afraid that they are spasmodic, occasional, piecemeal and consequently ineffectual."
"I would like to believe that neither the Council nor the Commission, nor indeed Parliament, wishes to take measures simply to satisfy public opinion while essentially having very little to offer to improve the level of ferry safety."
"The proposed directive on passenger registration will, I feel, remain a measure purely on record. Beyond the total number of passengers, which is easy enough to ascertain and to announce before the ship sets sail, the detailed registration of the remaining particulars will simply establish an extremely bureaucratic procedure which, a few months after the measure comes into force, will either fall into disuse and be forgotten, or will be by-passed and become a sham."
"Those obliged to enforce the directive, under pressure of time caused by disembarkation and embarkation of passengers, will end up giving inaccurate details. Measures should be taken, but they should be taken calmly and coolly and should tackle the problem as a whole."
"We must, however, enforce the observance of already existing safety regulations and guidelines which, thank goodness, are extremely numerous but which are being systematically violated in more than 60 % of cases. That can be achieved through the setting up of a system of strict controls by registers and port authorities."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Watts, for the ambitious work he has done throughout the discussion of this report, a piece of work which means that we will now have passenger lists for ferry traffic throughout the EU."
"I also think it is appropriate to say thank you to Commissioner Kinnock for the commitment he always shows when it comes to proposing measures to increase safety."
"Around Europe there have been several very big ferry disasters in recent decades."
"After these disasters an attitude has emerged that people should do everything in their power to prevent this from ever happening again."
"Parliament has made demands for extensive measures, and in various contexts the Commission has put forward proposals to improve safety."
"With one voice, the EU is more clearly promoting the work on improving safety within the United Nations maritime body, the International Maritime Organization."
"The decision we are going to take today is another step in this direction."
"Just as it has always been a matter of course in the area of flying, it is now becoming so for ferry traffic."
"Every single person who travels on an aircraft on a regular service receives a boarding pass and is put on a list of passengers on that plane, regardless of how long the flight is."
"There have been international rules about this for a long time. Anything else would presumably be totally unacceptable."
"Now we are getting the same rules for ferry traffic."
"There should be a list which clearly shows who is on board and how many passengers there are."
"There has been a debate between Parliament, the Council and the Commission about exactly where these lists should be submitted."
"The Council's common position says that the information should be collected before departure, but not necessarily communicated to the registrar until 30 minutes after the ferry has sailed."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism says that this information should be submitted before the ferry leaves port."
"I believe that is a necessity."
"Nor should there be any great problem getting it to work that way."
"With the help of computer technology an immediate registration will go to the registrar."
"That does not, as far as I am concerned, remove the need for this amendment."
"I would be grateful for a comment from the Commissioner on this point."
"With the proposal which has been put forward there is in fact only one limitation: the length of the journey."
"It is limited to 20 nautical miles between two ports, below which passenger lists are not considered necessary."
"In this regard too, the Committee on Transport and Tourism is making a minor addition."
"I would like to stress that even though this is a minor change, it is still necessary."
"I think it is very positive that a consistent framework for the EU's policy with regard to safety at sea is now emerging."
"The European Parliament has been demanding this for a long time."
"It would be gratifying if we could continue this work to achieve a level of safety which is acceptable to passengers."
"Madam President, the directive on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships will impose serious constraints on the Calais-Dover sea crossing, given that it does not apply to rail transport through the Channel tunnel."
"The fact that these two different modes of transport are being treated differently is unfair from the point of view of security, equal competition conditions, economic and social cohesion and regional equilibrium."
"That is why I support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and our British colleague, Mark Watts, in which he proposes to reestablish equal treatment for ferries and trains despite the initial refusal of the Commission to do so."
"The Commission feels that to increase security, new embarkation procedures for passengers are required."
"It considers there to be greater risks in navigating the Channel than in using the Channel tunnel."
"However, this argument is contradicted by two factors."
"The account of the intervention of fire-fighting teams during the fire in the Channel tunnel on 18 November 1996 indicates that rescue operations were hindered by the lack of precise information on the number of passengers travelling on the train."
"So the tunnel has its risks too."
"Moreover, studies on the average height of waves in the Channel which have been carried out by the French and British meteorological institutes have produced results which do not justify special treatment, even according to the Commission's own criteria."
"So the hypothesis which states that the waters of the Channel are difficult cannot be accepted as a means to justify more stringent controls."
"There are three possible solutions which would guarantee the safety of these two modes of transport and reestablish balanced conditions for competition in those areas where the opening of the Tunnel seriously weakened the position of the ferries."
"Firstly, the Commission and the Council should accept the amendments which, I hope, Parliament will adopt and which impose the same obligation on both modes of transport."
"Secondly, if stipulated by legal requirements, the Commission should propose a new directive specifically devoted to hazardous rail transport."
"Pending this new text, the application of the text on cross-Channel sea links currently under discussion ought to be postponed until the second directive is adopted."
"The third and most pragmatic solution would be to exempt cross-Channel sea links from the arrangements set out in this document."
"Bearing in mind the fact that 57 % of passengers on the Calais-Dover ferry complete their return journey within one day, it is easy to understand how the introduction of new arrangements, such as those we have seen today, would mean that this mode of transport would be penalized, thus upsetting the equilibrium of entire regions."
"Mr President, the background to this report is clearly the two devastating accidents involving first the Herald of Free Enterprise and more recently the Estonia and the international obligations which Member States undertook in the SOLAS regulation agreed in 1995."
"Ferry companies in the UK already register the number of passengers."
"The main problem with the proposal in its present form is that it will pose practical problems for ferry operations, particularly crossChannel operations, to process the details of names, addresses and special needs in the event of accident, in what is already a very competitive market."
"The Commission has made a very strong case that the background to this proposal is to increase safety."
"Mr Watts has highlighted the fact that if this is to increase safety, this precaution must also be extended to passengers travelling by Eurotunnel."
"In the event of fire it is just as important to record the details of passengers travelling by Eurotunnel to ensure their safe evacuation in the event of a fire."
"I remind the House that there has already been one serious fire that could have led, sadly, to an even bigger disaster."
"Even more necessary is the requirement of names, addresses and passenger details in the event of death so that the next of kin can be informed in the event of such a Eurotunnel disaster."
"My message to the Commission is very simple: the minimum must be a level, competitive playing field ensuring maximum safety for passengers, regardless of whether they are travelling by ferry or by Eurotunnel."
"A situation in which passengers travelling by Eurotunnel were placed at a disadvantage would be totally unacceptable."
"Mr President, there is always one person who is on the other side of the argument and today it seems as if it is going to be me."
"I personally always have difficulty when it comes to restricting the rights of the individual."
"The measure that is being proposed today - the recording of names, sex, age, children, and so on - is in fact a stab in the back for the free movement of people within the European Community."
"I recognize the need for safety."
"Safety is of course a high requirement."
"Everybody wants it."
"But I believe that any legislation that is brought forward for safety should be simple, practical and easily implemented."
"This measure is going to add - as far as the UK is concerned - a cost of 2.5 million a year."
"For checking-in, whether it be at the Tunnel or at a ferry, it is going to add, perhaps, at least another hour to that journey and it is going to make any surface or undersea travel less competitive as against air travel."
"So what are we trying to do in what we are proposing?"
"I am concerned about the sheer bureaucracy; I am concerned to see that because we need greater safety at sea we are actually including other forms of transport as well."
"That is not good legislation."
"I believe it is bad legislation."
"The Road Transport Association has said in a statement that registration of passengers on ferries on the Dover-Calais route in particular will cause considerable inconvenience."
"It could harm our trade when people are trying to meet deadlines."
"This, lumped on top of the loss of duty-free, will put the ferries out of business and will have a seriously damaging effect on freight to and from Britain."
"This is not necessary."
"A head count is all that is required so that people know the numbers that are on the ferry and not necessarily who is on the ferry."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I am very grateful to Mr Watts for his characteristically thorough work and for his recommendation to approve the common position on this measure."
"I am also naturally pleased that the House continues to support the harmonization of passenger registration throughout the Community, both for the sake of safety and in order to deal effectively with the aftermath of any accident."
"I also wish to say that, whilst I agree entirely with Mr Klironomos on his view that proper enforcement of all rules is essential, I fundamentally disagree with his description of the way in which this issue has been approached."
"The Council and the Commission were accused, in his word, of 'panic' ."
"It is ten years last week since the appalling disaster of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise at Zeebrugge, and it is three-and-a-half years since the Estonia went down with a loss of over 950 lives."
"Nothing we have done could be described as being panic-stricken or panic-driven."
"What we have is a comprehensive set of rules which we are adding to, in order to ensure that the security of passengers and crew travelling on ferries is as high as the sea will ever allow it to be, and we will persist with that."
"Since most of the amendments reiterate suggestions made in the first reading debate, I feel obliged to clarify the reasons for the Commission's support for the Council's common position and also to reassure the House that the specific concerns addressed in the original report were properly taken into account."
"Amendments Nos 1 to 3 in Mr Watts's report refer to limited progress in advancing the safety of maritime transport."
"I totally understand the feelings which underlie that view: they are the feelings of a zealous and committed Member of the European Parliament, and we are all impatient for further improvement."
"But, in fairness, we should not lose sight of the achievements at International Maritime Organization level and at Community level, which are now in their implementation phase, and which will, I hope - indeed, I am sure - produce progress."
"Meanwhile, I agree that it is essential that internationally agreed principles should apply to all roll-on/roll-off ferries sailing to European ports."
"I agree that should include the necessary stability rules, where appropriate, and I agree that all of this should be properly checked."
"To achieve this and to reassure the public that roll-on/roll-off ferry services in Europe are provided with the best possible safety standards and to sustain public confidence in ferry services, I am glad to report that last month the Commission adopted a new proposal relating to the operation of regular roll-on/roll-off ferry and high-speed passenger craft services in the Community."
"I sincerely hope that this proposal will encourage the House and, more important, further reinforce maritime safety."
"I have to say to Mr Provan that I totally understand his resistance to any unnecessary bureaucracy or unrealistic limitations on the freedom of movement."
"In this case, none of those problems arise and neither of his concerns will be justified when the system is in operation."
"Naturally, the concerns he expressed, which have been expressed by others, will continue to be borne in mind."
"Articles 8 and 9 of the common position will ensure that information on passengers will always be available when needed, while allowing for the proper handling of journeys of less than two hours and, at the same time, providing the necessary flexibility for those who have to set up registration systems."
"Consequently, I cannot support Amendments Nos 6 and 8."
"Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 7 address the issue of the shuttle and safety in the Channel Tunnel."
"As I promised in May of last year, I asked my services to examine the merits of a Community measure to apply passenger registration principles to vehicles using undersea railway tunnels. Our conclusions are as follows."
"First, to introduce provisions that currently govern the operation of train services in the proposed legislation on ferries would risk delaying its implementation because it would involve trying to achieve a mixture of two distinctly different sets of provisions."
"Secondly, there are no convincing arguments for introducing rules for rail tunnels which differ according to whether they go under the sea or under the land."
"Thirdly, there are serious doubts as to whether a passenger-registration scheme of the type proposed for ferry operations would add sufficient value to the detailed safety regime developed specifically for the Channel Tunnel by French and British authorities and currently in operation."
"On these grounds, I cannot accept the amendments relating to the Channel Tunnel."
"I would say to Mr Watts and to Mrs Berès that safety in the Channel Tunnel is an issue which is specific to that location and, quite properly, a matter for France and for Britain to consider on a bilateral basis."
"I really believe that the issue is best pursued with the two Member State governments that are directly and uniquely involved, and Community action on this would not be appropriate."
"Some Members, Miss McIntosh among them, have raised the question of a possible distortion of competition between transport modes arising out of the implementation of this directive."
"Naturally, the Commission seeks to achieve equitable conditions of competition between transport modes by a variety of means, but for very practical reasons, that cannot mean legislating for one sector simply because another mode has become subject to a law which imposes new obligations."
"As the House will recall, the need for passenger registration on ships arises from the tragic experience of ferry disasters, such as the sinking of the Estonia and the Herald of Free Enterprise and from obligations under the IMO Safety of Life at Sea Convention."
"Neither these experiences, nor such international rules, apply to Channel Tunnel operations."
"One final element I wish to add relates to the capacity of ferry operators to cope with this legislation."
"The European dataprocessing industry has the technical means to implement these requirements and the proposed date for implementation deliberately gives adequate time for preparation."
"The Commission is convinced, therefore, that Channel operators, who are committed to high levels of safety and service, will be able to apply workable solutions based on these technologies while, at the same time, safeguarding their competitive position."
"While the Commission is not able to support the amendments proposed in Mr Watts's recommendations today, I know that he and the Committee on Transport and Tourism continue to give their full support to the specific measure relating to passenger lists for ferries."
"I welcome that, of course."
"I am also confident that the true commitment of Mr Watts and other honourable Members to advances in safety legislation will ensure that support will continue when we debate the new proposal on ferry and fast-passenger-craft licensing, which I mentioned a few moments ago."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his statement."
"The differences between us should not obscure the general agreement that exists on the principle of this measure applying throughout European Union waters."
"I want to emphasize that."
"I welcome his measure on licensing, which I am sure we all look forward to debating."
"However, I have to warn him that, unfortunately, I am sure we will be returning to the issue of Le Shuttle."
"I am afraid we must agree to disagree on his analysis of that problem."
"I am sure he respects us for that and that we will be hearing more from each other on that and other issues."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11: 30 a.m."
"Multilateral agreement on investments (MAI)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0073/98) by Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, containing Parliament's recommendations to the Commission on negotiations in the framework of the OECD on a multilateral agreement on investments (MAI)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to be reporting to you today on the views of the Committee on External Economic Relations concerning the negotiations on the multilateral agreement on investments, usually known as the MAI. It is a particular honour because this is the first time any parliament has officially considered, in depth, what is undoubtedly the most important multilateral agreement since the GATT round was completed."
"We are doing this with the clear intention of providing a set of guiding principles for the Commission, as one of the most important parties to the remaining negotiations in Paris, which are expected to finish by the end of April."
"The MAI has got an interesting history."
"In March 1995, UNICE, the Federation of EC employers' organizations, issued a paper in which it proposed an MAI and mapped out its broad scope."
"The various existing bilateral agreements on investments were to be replaced by a multilateral agreement based on the principles of most-favoured nation treatment and national treatment, which would significantly liberalize investment and provide broadly-based protection for it."
"All the main measures called for by UNICE have been incorporated in the OECD draft now before us."
"In May 1995, the OECD ministerial meeting gave the go-ahead for negotiations on the MAI."
"Since then, negotiations have been taking place behind closed doors in Paris, out of sight of both the public and parliaments, but with trade associations taking part."
"What is envisaged is a 'free standing agreement' also open to non-OECD member states, but without their having any input on the wording of the treaty."
"That is why the REX Committee's own-initiative report is exceptionally important."
"We are exercising our right to be consulted on a continuing process."
"We are also specifically working on the assumption that when the agreement in concluded, the MAI will be submitted to the European Court of Justice for an opinion, and that we will be consulted by the Commission and the Council under the assent procedure."
"I would be delighted if you could unequivocally confirm this in your reply today, Commissioner."
"We do not want the MAI to be the exclusive preserve of big industry, because we cannot surrender our responsibility for political regulation of economic policy to the captains of industry."
"On the contrary, if we want an MAI at all, it should be one that halts the 'race to the bottom' in competing for the lowest social and environmental standards."
"Turning to the agreement itself, the 'first commandment' of the agreement planned is a wide-ranging ban on discrimination against foreign investors."
"However, we must not throw the baby out with the bath water in removing obstacles to investment!"
"It cannot be acceptable for multilateral environmental agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol to lose out."
"This fear is even expressed in a working paper from such an authoritative source as the OECD itself."
"Just paying lip service to preserving environmental and social standards in the preamble is not enough."
"The OECD Code of Conduct for multinationals must be incorporated into the agreement in such a way that it is binding and enforceable."
"The Committee has serious reservations about the provisions on expropriation and compensation."
"An investor should not be able to sue for loss of profit just because environmental and social laws in Member States have progressed or because a socioecological tax reform has been introduced."
"A region must retain the right to decide, on the basis of democratic control, whether it wishes to attract major projects or whether it would rather promote locally-oriented small and medium-sized companies based on local consumption."
"The long list of requests for derogations now lodged with the OECD secretariat does not just give cause for concern about the legitimacy of the overarching principle of equal treatment."
"The standstill and rollback provisions are also unacceptable to us as they stand at present."
"The Committee also opposes the proposed arbitration procedure, which puts investors on an equal footing with Member States."
"We consider that the national and international procedures that already exist are adequate."
"So we should give ourselves time carefully to examine the goals and effects of the MAI, because the social aspects, long-term ecological feasibility and democratic accountability of the MAI should not be subordinated to onerous restrictions - our guiding principle should be just the opposite."
"I would also like to express my heartfelt thanks to the other committees asked for an opinion, and to the committee secretariat for their commitment, and I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote for this report."
"Marking out the playing field on which our economic policy is to develop is a vital task for us."
"Mr President, first I want to congratulate the Committee on External Economic Relations for having taken the initiative in concerning itself with this report."
"I also congratulate the Committee on its choice of rapporteur. I totally agree with what he said."
"I should also like, Mr President, to underline one of the ideas emphasized by the rapporteur: that this agreement is being negotiated in a secretive manner."
"I do not want to go into what has been said by the representatives of national parliaments."
"The Commission just needs to know that this Parliament is not happy with the level of information about and participation in these negotiations, towards an agreement which has been termed the economic constitution of the world, and the most important document we will be discussing in the near future."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has drafted an opinion and come up with several observations, some of which are my own, while others were added in committee. I will defend them all with the same enthusiasm."
"Firstly, we stress the need for this binding agreement to apply to ""lower' governments with competence in investment matters: in other words, subfederal or subcentral governments."
"Secondly, non-OECD countries which may wish to accede to this agreement in the future must be kept informed of how the negotiations are progressing, and that their right to formulate reservations is being respected."
"Our third point is obvious: for the sake of coherence, the multilateral agreement on investments should respect the Treaty on European Union and the decisions of the Uruguay Round and other international treaties."
"Fourthly, and this may be the most important clause of all, this Parliament requests the inclusion of the so-called regional economic integration organization clause, to provide that countries who are members of such organizations - and I am specifically thinking of the countries of the European Union - will not be obliged to extend to non-member countries the favourable treatment reserved for members."
"If a clause of this type were not included, the whole process of commercial integration which we Europeans have implemented would be cast to the winds."
"Fifthly, we ask that the multilateral agreement should include a clause to forbid any of the signatories from applying measures which have extra-territorial effects."
"It is no secret that I am thinking of the Helms-Burton Act."
"Finally - and I am just finishing - we ask that labour and environmental standards should under no circumstances be lowered within the framework of this agreement."
"Mr President, I also congratulate the REX Committee and the rapporteur on bringing this to the attention of the European Parliament."
"The investment under the terms of the MAI is extremely extensive and far-reaching, indeed so far-reaching that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights could consider it as deconstructing the acquis communautaire ."
"We must be very wary of this. It could force Member States to treat foreign investors as favourably as EU companies, and this could mean that environmental protection, employment protection and other Community laws could be considered illegal and therefore deconstructed."
"The role of the European Parliament is very important in this."
"It has an obligation to influence the contents of a treaty as important as the MAI, which runs the risk of being negotiated and concluded without any democratic participation."
"Secondly, it has to safeguard its powers and those of the Union in general, which might be curtailed by the conclusion of such an international convention."
"In its conclusions the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights calls on the European Parliament to state that it cannot agree to endorse any agreement which would have the effect of rolling back EU legislation and insists, therefore, on the use of exception clauses and on the insertion of a regional economic integration organization clause."
"It cannot agree to endorse any agreement which would have the effect of preventing further harmonization of EU legislation, and insists therefore on the insertion of a separate regional economic integration organization clause permitting new harmonized measures, such as environmental legislation adopted within the framework of such an organization and replacing measures previously applied by these states."
"It demands that the proposals should be compatible with international conventions already ratified by the EU, and draws attention to the serious problems of consistency and legal security that may be engendered by including intellectual property within the scope of the multilateral agreement on investments, given the complexity of the subject which falls within the remit of the WIPO and, more recently, the World Trade Organization."
"Finally, it would call on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to submit, pursuant to the procedure provided for in Article 228, the whole of the definitive draft of the MAI to the Court of Justice for full examination before it is ratified."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for his excellent report on this extremely complex subject."
"It is not just security of employment and the environment that are at stake, it is our European identity."
"While there may still be justified reservations about this draft agreement and assent cannot therefore be signalled for the time being, this does not mean that the need to establish transparency and legal certainty for international investment in all areas is being denied."
"However, a number of other issues remain to be resolved: vital social, ecological and cultural issues."
"As a member of the Committee on Culture, I would like to speak about the possible threat the agreement poses to EU culture and media policy."
"A derogation for the audiovisual industry and for the protection of intellectual property is essential."
"Cultural creativity is not a purely economic investment."
"For example, if the national treatment principle was applied in the cultural world, US media companies would qualify for EU funds created specifically to support the European cultural industry."
"The Television without Frontiers Directive and the Media II programme would then just be fit for the shredder."
"If the EU does not protect its cultural policy by seeking derogations from the MAI, it will be defeating its own policy of safeguarding quality and the promoting diversity in European audiovisual production, which in turn maintain Europe's identity."
"I therefore urge the plenary to follow the recommendations of the Committee on External Economic Relations and the Committee on Culture when we vote, and exclude audiovisual policy and intellectual property from this agreement."
"Mr President, one of the most alarming aspects of the MAI is the lack of public debate and this runs counter to the principles of democracy, transparency and public participation."
"The MAI could have very profound consequences for the fisheries sector both from the social and environmental perspectives."
"Although the Common Fisheries Policy has not been terribly successful, at least it has the merit that the EU bears responsibility for the policies and for the current mess."
"The Fisheries Committee was concerned that the MAI could force the EU to alter its approach to fisheries management so as to conform to the wishes of some other countries or indeed even companies."
"For instance, if, as a conservation measure, the Community decided to reduce fishing in order to allow the recovery of fish stocks, would other countries or indeed big business be able to claim that this was unfair and so overrule the Community?"
"Would the EU lose control of its own resources?"
"The Committee was adamant that the EU must maintain its ability to establish and implement policies for the conservation of fish stocks and the management of Community fisheries."
"The Commission assured the Committee that these concerns were groundless, that the appropriate reservations would be lodged to ensure that the EU maintained its independence."
"But how foolproof will these reservations be?"
"The world is rapidly changing; one wonders if it is possible to foresee all the implications of the MAI and to lodge reservations which will ensure that the management of EU fisheries will remain a European matter."
"Let us not forget that the effects of this agreement will last a minimum of twenty years and that there will doubtless be much pressure to phase out reservations."
"Although the opinion of the Fisheries Committee considers only fisheries it is easy to imagine that the situation would be similar in other resources: for example, in the extraction industry, forestry, agriculture, mining, and so on."
"Finally, the opinion by the Fisheries Committee was adopted unanimously, it is very complex and it is important that the conclusions of this opinion be included entirely and not simply summarised in a short, almost meaningless amendment."
"Mr President, firstly I would very much like to thank the rapporteur, both personally and on behalf of my group."
"He has done excellent work, and the report was also his initiative. Had it not been for him, if we - by which I also mean the Committee - had not acted promptly, this report would probably not only have bypassed the European Parliament, it would also not have given the appropriate signals to national parliaments."
"My group has tabled an amendment, and I hope that all the groups have given it their attention."
"We are calling on national governments and thus parliaments to withhold their consent to the completion of the negotiations and the conclusion of this agreement in May."
"Sir Leon Brittan is with us today, and I hope that he will convey this signal to the Commission."
"We think it is important to give a signal now so that governments, national parliaments and the public are alerted to this, and so that it is made crystal clear to them what the agreement is all about, and that it is vital to carry on negotiating to achieve a satisfactory package."
"It is quite possible that it would then no longer be meaningful to continue these negotiations in an OECD framework, and that it would then be advisable to pursue the negotiations through the WTO instead."
"I know, Sir Leon, that you will probably not be very happy about this, because you think is perfectly appropriate to have a package for OECD member states which provides certainty for investment, and above all for investors."
"We do not have any quarrel with this, but would it not be wiser to pursue it via the WTO?"
"We share a healthy scepticism about a number of points with most of the parties to the negotiations."
"One point I would briefly like to mention is the definition of investment."
"The investments protected include direct investment, portfolio investment, and everything which can be categorized as intangible investment, including intellectual property."
"The third category in particular goes way beyond the results of WTO negotiations and I have grave doubts about that."
"The second point is that in the context of continuing liberalization, an arbitration procedure would be introduced giving investors the right to take legal action against Member States. However, the reverse would not apply, so Member States would not have the right to take action against investors."
"This is another crucial point."
"I have a whole string of other points of criticism that I will unfortunately not get to now."
"I would be very pleased if you could take these on board in your negotiations, and I know that the Commission is already aware of this. Once more, I urge you not to conclude the negotiations this May."
"Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, on his excellent report."
"There is no doubt that the conclusion and signing of the multilateral agreement on investments will provide the signatories with the first multilateral framework to broadly regulate the conditions and treatment of international investments. This broad concept covers direct investments, loans, intellectual property, licences, authorizations and the whole wide area of rights and obligations in the world of commerce."
"Considering how important foreign investments are to today's economy, and given the globalization which increasingly affects us, we can think of the framework agreement on investments as representing in the investment area what GATT meant in its day for trade. In other words, it creates a stable, global frame of reference, to replace more than 1 800 existing bilateral agreements."
"In fact, to coin a phrase, the multilateral agreement on investments will change the world."
"It will become one of the great achievements of the OECD and, in the future, of the WTO."
"This agreement offers guarantees to companies and states, and its rules are expected to be applied globally."
"We must bear in mind that in recent years world investments have risen to over $10 billion - all direct international investments - and we are in a period of growth, with an annual increase of about $500 000-$600 000 million. Furthermore, that growth is very uneven, since there is hardly any investment in so-called ""black' Africa."
"I would like to make a plea that investments should not just be made in those places where we expect immediate returns."
"We must think about the solidarity aspect of investing throughout the world."
"Anyway, having experienced what an intense process it was to draft this report (because of the many amendments presented - more than 80 amendments in the Committee on External Economic Relations), and despite the fact that it in no way reflects the view of the Group of the European People's Party, we request a vote in favour of this report because we think it represents an unavoidable compromise."
"We hope that a vote of confidence from this Parliament will mean that this report is taken seriously by the European Commission in view of the forthcoming negotiations and the signing of the Agreement in April. As the rapporteur said, we will see if anybody takes any notice of this Parliament."
"We in Parliament often have the impression that we try to do our work, we try to produce agreements and reports, and in the end, the Commission ignores them. I think that is a view shared by a lot of people, in Parliament in general and, especially in this case, in the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"I am pleased that Sir Leon Brittan is here, so we can ask him to listen to us, take note of what we say, and bear it in mind."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we look favourably on the idea of a liberalization of investments stimulating competition and promoting the European economy."
"Naturally, an agreement to this effect will necessarily have to observe the principles and foundations on which Europe is built."
"The public should be informed of negotiations with clarity and transparency, particularly the national parliaments that play a decisive role when applying international agreements."
"The multilateral agreement on investments should, however, take EU legislation into account without preventing any further harmonization, and cannot radically change existing agreements and policies on development."
"The Council should be consulted on the conclusion of the MIA on behalf of the EU, according to Article 228 paragraph 3 section 2 of the Treaty, according to the assent procedure."
"However, I consider it fundamentally important for the national governments and parliaments to be vigilant at the time of presenting the project."
"This vigilance is absolutely vital to the cultural sector as a whole; the cultural policy needs space for itself, special provisions which cannot be provided by purely economic mechanisms."
"Such spicial provisions will be hard to guarantee within the multilateral agreement on investments, at least at the current stage of negotiations, and it would therefore be advisable for the cultural sector to be excluded from the MAI."
"However, this should not be confused with a protectionist attitude: we should stop being afraid of the USA, for we will not save European culture by keeping it enclosed."
"We should undertake to identify and support those initiatives that stimulate and reinforce European competitiveness and creativity, and this can also be achieved by some form of liberalization that will have to be developed ad hoc, made-to-measure to safeguard the principles of support for the diversity and peculiarity that strengthen and shape the wealth and identity of European culture."
"Our group is therefore in favour of the report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentleman, Mr Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party thinks it is extremely important the MAI should come to pass."
"International investments represent thousands of billions of dollars a year."
"World trade increases at a rate of 7 % to 8 % a year, but investments increase twice as fast."
"International investments are becoming more important than international trade."
"Trade is regulated by various WTO treaties."
"However, there are no neat, uniform rules for direct investments."
"At the moment there are more than 1 800 bilateral treaties."
"The MAI is a successful initiative for multilateral agreements on investments, initially between the OECD countries, but with the ability to extend the treaty to include other countries."
"Although in the course of the negotiation process many serious political dossiers were brought within the scope of the MAI, agreement has been reached on most points."
"Yet the US is stepping on the brakes. They claim they need more time."
"Is this out-and-out free-trade nation losing faith?"
"My last point, ladies and gentlemen, concerns the powers of the European Union in entering into international treaties."
"Article 113 offers the Commission no explicit authority to sign the MAI on behalf of the Member States."
"Yet the European Communities do take part in the negotiations as partners on behalf of the Member States."
"I request the honourable Members to support our group's Amendment No 11, so that unfair competition within the Union and unfair treatment with regard to investments will be ruled out."
"This amendment aims at full EC membership of the MAI."
"We are therefore asking the Member States not to approve the final text as long as the European Communities are not guaranteed full membership of the MAI."
"I ask Sir Leon Brittan: did he check this with the Member States in the Council?"
"What in fact is the exact procedure which must be followed?"
"I would welcome Sir Leon's response to this."
"Madam President, the resolution the European Parliament is preparing to vote on, contained in Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's excellent report, is of great importance, for reasons of method and substance."
"It is, in fact, a question of providing guidelines on these negotiations of enormous consequence that have been taking place in a semi-clandestine manner for almost three years."
"The agreement was to be concluded, in fact, without either public opinion or the parliaments being in a position to be fully aware of its implications."
"It is quite true that, once it was concluded, the agreement would have been submitted for examination by the parliaments, but too late, only at the time of ratification, when it is only possible to say ""yes' or ""no' , when it is no longer possible to affect its direction."
"I think one great merit of our Parliament is that of having realized for some time the scope of the current negotiations within the OECD and of having taken the initiative to vote, pursuant to Rule 90(5) of the Rules of Procedure, on a resolution with the ability to affect negotiations while they are still open, to offer the thoughts of a representative democratic institution. This Parliament was the first to do so, and so far the only one."
"This timing is all the more important in the case of the negotiations in question, given the enormous implications of this MAI. It does not ask us for an opinion on the advisability or otherwise of foreign investments, but on the rights and powers of states to regulate direct foreign investments and, therefore, to direct them according to their own priorities, to subject their operations to specific procedures, and to regulate their ability and the use of any profits made."
"The MAI could give rise to a substantial erosion of the sovereignty of states, which would be transferred to businesses able to challenge any choice of country in which they are investing, denouncing it as discriminatory, as a form of a priori expropriation of a potential future profit."
"Any regulation aimed at protecting the health of its own citizens, at protecting the environment, at protecting the social standards guaranteed for workers by laws and collective agreements or (a very important aspect of the problem) at safeguarding its own identity and culture could be considered discriminatory."
"Not to mention another dramatic consequence: the prohibition of establishing any incentive designed to reduce regional imbalances or direct resources towards certain aims."
"It is paradoxical that after decades of laborious Community construction and harmonization of regulations within the EU, and after our efforts to make the east European applicant countries assume the acquis communautaire , we are preparing to dilute everything. This calls into question the very notion of regional economic integration organizations, although they are respected within the framework of the WTO, under the ""REIO' clause, which, in the draft MAI, seems to be extremely lacking in efficacy."
"Finally, another worrying question: why was the OECD chosen for these negotiations?"
"The suspicion that the choice was made because only the 29 richest countries belong to the OECD is sufficiently strong and widespread to seriously risk the very credibility of the institutions seeking legitimation as regulators of globalization, starting with the WTO itself."
"The mobilization generated by the ""discovery' of the MAI in European civilian society, particularly in the world of culture, and in the USA, where the NGOs have begun a real campaign of denouncement, has already had the effect of postponing the conclusion of the agreement."
"The unanimous vote, apart from one abstention, in the Committee on External Economic Relations and the committees called upon to give an opinion, whose amendments have been included in full, will I hope serve as advice for the European negotiators in their measures designed, if not to reject the agreement itself (as not just our group but also many others in this Parliament would like) at least to drastically review the wording of the draft under discussion."
"Madam President, the exponential world increase in foreign investments surely justifies setting up a global regulatory framework, not to place the emphasis on liberalization, but to direct the initiatives of transnational associations towards socially and ecologically durable development."
"The current draft does not tackle this issue at all for three reasons."
"The draft under discussion, in which the Commission is actively involved, aims to provide maximum security for investors and only takes into account the interests of the populations concerned as a secondary issue."
"Secondly, all the basic principles and conditions proposed result in political institutions being deprived of the normal prerogatives they would have in a democratic regime, and also result in legally subjecting democratic institutions and governments to the strategies and interests of transnational companies by the specific creation of arbitration bodies in which these very companies could have the countries condemned."
"Thirdly, as Mrs Castellina has just said, the discussions currently underway in the OECD obviously belong to the wealthy club; the most vulnerable countries - developing countries - are excluded, when in fact they are the ones most at the mercy of the multinationals' strategies."
"This is a draft which cannot be corrected superficially or content itself with exemptions, but whose very principles must be fundamentally reviewed."
"I would like to illustrate my point with three examples."
"Firstly, one of the basic clauses, the prohibition of performance requirements, completely contradicts the idea of a specific targeted policy against severe unemployment in the relevant regions."
"In granting permission to an investor, the condition could not be made that regional staff must be employed, or that there must be preferential contracts with regional companies, or anything of that kind."
"In the end, it is in fact European structural policy which will be called into question."
"My second example concerns expropriation and the subsequent compensation."
"The adoption of new legislation on fiscal, environmental and social issues could be seen to have the same effect as expropriation, which UNICE calls rampant expropriation, in that it would cause a gradual erosion of the conditions on which the decision to invest was taken and would automatically bring with it a right to financial compensation."
"My third example concerns the principle of non-discrimination, or national treatment."
"What would happen in the former countries of eastern Europe or in a country like Brazil if, in the process of land redistribution by privatization of collective farms or to meet the requirements of the indigenous peoples or landless peasant farmers, the same priority was given to multinationals as to the populations concerned?"
"The answer is self-evident: it would be unacceptable to us."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's report is an excellent one because it puts its finger on these very issues, and I think Parliament would promote its own cause by voting in favour of it by a very large majority."
"Madam President, doubtless there were a thousand good reasons why the representatives of the OECD devised this multilateral agreement without the slightest degree of transparency. But some of these reasons, and certainly not the least of them, oblige us to reject this new economic order which they want to impose upon us."
"Of course we can easily understand the advantages of such an agreement for the multinationals, all the more so since this draft, which could be summarized by the principle ""the countries fulfil their obligations and the investors reap the benefits' , offers them definite guarantees."
"It is doubtless a good thing to remove obstacles to investment, but even so the principle of non-discrimination, or this broad conception of investment, must not have harmful effects on any country. For by creating a real threat to national sovereignty this agreement risks eventually calling into question the rights of peoples and their social and environmental demands."
"The developing countries, which are excluded from the negotiations, will have clauses imposed on them which often oppose their own real interests."
"We all know that if economic interests gain ascendancy over political ones, democracy will suffer."
"The only proof I need is the way in which this agreement has been negotiated."
"So it is critical that, as Members of the European Parliament, we reject this agreement since it would represent a grave blow to the European structure at a time when enlargement is in fact on the agenda."
"What would become of our common agricultural policy, our European social model, or even our cultural identities, if the MAI were to be applied tomorrow?"
"So we must welcome the initiative taken by the Committee on External Economic Relations and thank Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for his excellent work."
"Furthermore, our group will not hesitate to vote for his report, but it would also be good if the Council took a stand."
"In the same way, Commissioner, we expect the Commission, which is participating in the negotiations, to continue in its efforts, but always using reason and wisdom, for it is our European Community at stake and it is critical that we defend our cultural exception."
"This exception was gained thanks to the mobilization of cultural professionals, who again recently raised awareness about the risks of the MAI."
"This cultural exception, acquired at a high price during the GATT negotiations, must be extended to the MAI."
"Also, the agreements which govern intellectual property rights must be maintained because, ladies and gentlemen, it is high time we realized that the world is not a huge game of Monopoly and that our cultural fate should not be determined by the throw of a dice."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"Faced with the secrecy surrounding these negotiations, which are already at an advanced stage, the Committee felt it was essential publicly to make known the opinions of those who realize what is at stake in the process of drawing up a multilateral agreement on investments."
"So, three years after negotiations started, we in the European Parliament are today having the first debate on the MAI to be held in a parliamentary setting."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, who kept the text coherent despite attacks by large groups for which the taste for compromise at any price and the weakening of any proposition have become second nature."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler shows clearly that what is at issue with the MAI is not just the defence of a sector of activity as important as culture: it is a method, a logic, the division into hierarchies of the players on the international scene."
"Organizing protection for investors is essentially a national responsibility and should remain so, even if close coordination between the Fifteen ought to allow the pursuit of a number of common goals."
"Here I would mention in particular: the condemnation of legislation which has an impact beyond a country's own borders; the banning of any form of competition which aims to attract investment by lowering social standards or rules for environmental protection; and the inability of an investment arbitration body to dismantle the clauses of a common policy, such as policies on agriculture or fishing, to attack cultural exception, or to challenge the decision of an internal or community jurisdiction which has the strength of having had judgement passed on it."
"It is critical that the legitimate right of the investor to have his investment protected is not transformed into an absolute right to invest without any restriction applying in terms of legislation and regulation, to the detriment of responsibilities and countries."
"Within the current logic of the MAI, countries would be limited to guaranteeing investors the full use of their investments, while national and Community legislation which aims to preserve the environment and social conditions would be considered a priori as potential obstacles to investment."
"This is the logic on which the current MAI negotiations and its framework are based, with developing countries being excluded. We feel duty bound to challenge it rather than sticking to a tactic of exception and reserve, which would only serve to designate the scene of tomorrow's negotiations."
"The GATT and WTO processes should be a lesson to us."
"In that sense, this report is sounding the alarm bells and that is why we will support it."
"Madam President, we too welcome the debate on this report."
"With a few exceptions we also find it a very interesting and highly intelligent piece of work."
"Of course it would be good if the environmental, social and structural conditions prevailing in Europe and the West applied to the rest of the world, so that investors had to respect them worldwide."
"Unfortunately it is somewhat arrogant of the West smugly to ignore the needs and living conditions of the third world and dream up obstacles to investment that ultimately prevent economic conditions from improving elsewhere on our planet."
"There is no denying that modernization of infrastructure and communications systems throughout the world has created enormous competition for inward investment."
"Investors acting on behalf of their shareholders will always pick those locations which promise the most profit."
"Trying to protest or legislate against this process would be the modern equivalent of smashing up machines during the industrial revolution."
"The question that the report does not resolve is how Europe can play its part in securing an economic upturn in the third world without laying down the law to how this upturn is to be achieved."
"The restrictions that would apply in the area of culture are a problem."
"I can only refer to the Dutch government's report, which says 'Don't get yourself a suit of armour, stiffen your backbone instead' ."
"The measures for regulating foreign investment called for in the report must not, however, be allowed to generate a situation in which open competition is possible in every area of culture."
"The same people who were critical of American companies getting their hands on EU money would certainly have nothing against American companies putting money into European films."
"I particularly welcome the part of the report on the threat to copyright."
"We have a lot of catching up to do in this area, and this needs detailed examination."
"Madam President. It is a pleasure to be speaking in the Chamber and not noting my presence."
"I and my group support Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's report."
"We support in particular paragraphs 5, 14, 23 and paragraph 15 on OECD guidelines."
"May I say at this point, irrespective of where future discussions on investment procedures are held, whether it be at the OECD, the WTO, or UNCTAD, we would appreciate it if those who are in charge of our affairs would be a bit more transparent in their handling of them."
"We parliamentarians should be at the forefront of the discussions, not at the tail-end."
"Parliament has to be congratulated on producing this report."
"The main support comes for the voluntary code."
"It comes from the OECD countries."
"We apparently cannot agree to change the voluntary code of guidelines into a compulsory one."
"A statement from Mr Charles Bridge of the DTI, on the voluntary status of the OECD guidelines, says that the emergent majority view is that the voluntary status should be unchanged."
"But he goes on to say that the OECD countries have, since 1991, been under a binding obligation to set up national contact points for undertaking promotional activities, handling enquiries and discussing with parties concerned on all matters related to the guidelines."
"We may want to consider exactly what these national contact points have achieved."
"According to the trade union advisory committee from the OECD, the results of their studies suggest that with a few notable exceptions the national contact points are reactive rather than proactive and do little to fulfil their terms of reference."
"Some national trade union centres which did not respond to the survey stated that there was little to report due to the fact that the national contact points in their country had fallen into abeyance."
"It was also reported that requests for information on the guidelines were often ignored and this has led to a high degree of apathy amongst many TUC affiliates towards the NCPs, that is, the national contact points."
"The report goes on to ask: ' has the national contact point in your country consulted the trade unions on its terms of reference?' ."
"The Swedish national contact point is the only one to consult trade unions proactively."
"The Belgian national contact point does so reactively and all other affiliates replied negatively."
"So perhaps the Commission could advise us of what steps it can take, if it is going to pursue the voluntary code, to actually beef up the national contact points to make sure they become relevant to those people who are meant to be served by the multilateral agreement on investments."
"Can I also ask the Commission to look at the question of portfolio investment, because whilst we are talking about foreign direct investment many of these companies have their results as a result of the portfolio investment of shareholders?"
"Can the Commission advise us if it is going to consider at these negotiations, and encourage the Member States to take up, assurances that the trustees of many of the pension and occupational funds and insurance funds are actually consulted prior to any investment taking place in any of the companies operating under the multilateral agreement on investment in many of the countries which, at present, are not being served very well by the voluntary guidelines?"
"This would be a step towards democracy and the Commission should embrace it."
"Madam President, the marked annual increase of 11 % in direct foreign investment is impressive, and far in excess of that of the other basic economic variables, standing at twice the growth of trade and four times the growth of products over the past decade."
"It is, therefore, surprising that no multilateral code of conduct exists in this connection."
"Since the free movement of capital is one element in making maximum use of resources, the growth of trade has not been hampered by the free movement of products and services, as might have been feared and would be undesirable."
"Furthermore, in terms of space, having channelled investment towards the more disadvantaged areas, it has served as an equilibrating factor by anchoring labour that would otherwise have been obliged to emigrate, with heavy human and social costs. In this regard, the multinationals' strategy of locating subcontracting units in different countries and regions has been important."
"Despite all these characteristics, stringent codes of conduct must be established to prevent direct foreign investment from being used as an unacceptable form of exploitation and infringing the rules of competition."
"In particular, as correctly emphasized by the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler - whom I congratulate - social and environmental rules must be respected to the letter."
"Otherwise our workers and businessmen will have cause for complaint, if investment is relocated elsewhere."
"As we have repeatedly emphasized, this is a requirement which simultaneously renders service to workers and to citizens of the most backward countries, by ensuring that they are not exploited and that their quality of life does not deteriorate."
"Finally, we regret that advances in monitoring subsidies have not gone hand-in-hand with progress on the tax front. Competitiveness is being boosted by reducing taxes on capital, which ultimately exacerbates the existing imbalance whereby the tax burden on labour is excessive."
"On only one point do we diverge from the rapporteur and some Members who have spoken before me: we fear that the exceptions proposed in the cultural sphere might lead us towards protectionism."
"In that connection, I agree entirely with the Dutch point of view."
"Madam President, I would like to say that I too share the concern that has been expressed over the multilateral agreement on investments."
"This concern is felt in the parliamentary committees of the European Parliament and in artistic and academic circles alike."
"Reports in the European press are equally justified in sounding the alarm concerning the likely and indeed hasty signing of this agreement."
"In the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, of which I am a member, we have fought long and hard against attempts to downgrade and to harm the cultural industry of Europe and to change our varied cultural identity, which this agreement threatens to do."
"European cultural policy was threatened during the GATT negotiations, when we achieved, in part, cultural exception. This exception must not only remain intact but it must be enforced."
"I remind you that there are other national representatives who are seeking their own exceptions, such as the Americans for certain sectors for which they have special regulations which are favourable to its citizens within the framework of the OECD."
"We must ward off any attempt to fragment European policies and European structure as a whole in areas of cultural products and services, including new technologies, intellectual ownership, and all the other rights of our artists and creators. But we must not forget that other areas are also at issue, as has already been mentioned, such as transport, fishing and agriculture."
"European solidarity must remain unshakable, despite being under intense pressure and attack. At this point I would like to stress that unfortunately there are Member States whose representatives wish to proceed more quickly to the signing of this agreement, without examining the problems this will create."
"We do not deny that the negotiations need to come to an end, but certainly not before crucial matters concerning Europe are settled satisfactorily."
"Mr President, I welcome this agreement very much in that it works for non-discrimination as far as investment is concerned, for application of the rule of law in terms of signatory Member States, and it is there to increase international investments and thereby also international trade."
"All of those things are exceptionally good and I welcome them."
"What concerns me is that when one starts to look through this agreement - I have tried to read it on several occasions, although it is far from finalized at present - it raises a large number of questions."
"Clearly, because international investment is an area that is extremely competitive, one of the things that will happen is that, although it is an OECD agreement, there will be severe pressure on other nations looking for international investment to become signatories as well."
"Again, in principle, I welcome that."
"I am concerned about the level of involvement of developing countries in particular within the decision-making process, even though it is primarily an OECD document at present."
"Along with Mr Falconer, I also would point to the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises."
"Although the OECD makes a lot of its own publicity material, I would like to have seen it have greater prominence in the context of this agreement."
"Again, if you read through the agreement, it raises more questions than it perhaps answers about how well the area of environmental standards will be dealt with in the final version."
"My other comment, which I make somewhat wryly, is to ask whether there will still be discrimination against home companies in terms of incentives for investment made by some countries which tend to discriminate in favour of foreign investment."
"Finally, I wish to ask when the agreement will now be signed - it was supposed to be in May, and it looks as though it is being delayed - and whether it will go through the assent procedure in the European Parliament?"
"Madam President, the MAI treaty is a real weapon of war against peoples, countries and states."
"The interests of foreign investors have been favoured to an excessive extent, their rights extend into all domains since they can by law pursue governments to gain damages and compensation interest for any measure they consider to have a negative effect on their profits."
"So, social rights, environmental protection, national and regional development, the preservation of natural resources, concern for the collective interest, and freedom of unions are all subjects which could justify sanctions, as would community preference."
"In the current process of globalization, the interests of the people are being trampled underfoot; with the MAI, the governments themselves are held up to ridicule and they have nothing more than obligations towards the multinationals."
"This sort of approach is totally unacceptable, and has been widely refused."
"Whereas since 1995 negotiations have been held in the utmost secrecy, the reality of the MAI has now burst upon us, triggering a huge protest movement in the United States, Canada, India and Europe."
"Even in France, artists and creators are finding that our culture has everything to lose through this concept of merchandizing and they are up in arms about it."
"Through the Prime Minister, the French Government has indicated that an agreement of this kind cannot in any way challenge the freedom of governments to implement their choices."
"Apparently, France is calling for restrictive clauses, prohibiting competition between countries in order to attract investments by lowering social standards and weakening environmental rules."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's report sets out a number of justified criticisms and rightly calls for a public debate and transparency in the OECD negotiations."
"However, he does not go as far as he could, and finishes with the simple recommendation, and I quote, not to sign the MAI until an in-depth analysis has been held."
"It is my opinion that the European Parliament - the first elected body to debate the MAI, thanks in particular to its REX committee - should call on the governments of the Member States not to sign the MAI, to adjourn negotiations and to allow for a preliminary broad public debate involving national parliaments."
"The same demand could be made regarding the transatlantic single market project, known as the ""Brittan project' which takes its inspiration from precisely the same ultraliberal principles as the MAI."
"As French elected members, we intend to support the development of the social movement which aims to thwart these projects which threaten jobs and freedom, and bring to bear an approach based on cooperation and lasting development, which is what civilization really needs as we enter the third millennium."
"Madam President, I would like to say a warm thank you to my colleague Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for really giving us something to think about - not only us, but also the national parliaments - so that our eyes have really been opened to this."
"People say this will be the basis of the global economy."
"But they also say that it is not just economic interests which are at stake here, but also environmental interests, social interests, national rights to self-determination, and so on."
"I would like to ask the Commission why we in the European Parliament have not been informed that this has been discussed?"
"Where is the dialogue with the citizens and the democratically elected parliament?"
"I am extremely disappointed with the Swedish Trade Minister who has sat in on these negotiations since 1995 without giving the slightest sign that they had taken place."
"He is also a member of the Social Democrats, who said before the last election that they would 'bridle market forces' ."
"Now we can see what happens with such promises."
"So we want more democracy."
"And as the previous speaker said: ' Stop the agreement until we have had a proper dialogue' ."
"Madam President, it seems to me that it is time for those like us endowed with political responsibility as a result of universal suffrage to put an end to the technocratic drift of certain international institutions."
"One particular question needs to be asked and I will ask it clearly: who is the OECD working for?"
"Is it to support the economic, cultural and social development of countries and their peoples, or is it working on behalf of the powerful multinationals?"
"The multilateral agreement on investments provides the answer."
"How can we allow certain countries to carry on secret negotiations behind our backs in the corridors of the castle of silence, headquarters of the OECD in Paris, on agreements which will apply to countries which are less well-off than they are?"
"These agreements are drawn up without any democratic control, by officials who have but one aim - to eliminate all cultural, social and environmental defences."
"The MAI is a real lesson to us."
"It is no chance mishap; an entire ultraliberal concept is rearing its ugly head and intends to ride roughshod over all social and democratic progress, frequently obtained by a hard-fought struggle."
"Saying no to the MAI is basically saying no to the current notions of the OECD, but perhaps it is also an opportunity to set the ball rolling on the question of whether to retain an institution of this kind. At the very least, it may be a chance to redefine its mission."
"Would it not be much wiser and more efficient to strengthen the role of the World Trade Organization, which will be called upon to deal with the subjects currently being debated in the OECD?"
"In any case, the question this raises more than ever is the issue of the democratic control of international institutions, if we wish to avoid harmful consequences for the people."
"Madam President, there are currently approximately 1 800 bilateral agreements on direct foreign investments."
"This leads to a lack of transparency and contradictions between agreements."
"A multilateral agreement on investments in an OECD context makes sense, therefore."
"The OECD nations are responsible for most of the direct foreign investments, and agreement is reached much more quickly and efficiently within the OECD context than within the WTO context."
"Like Mr Kreissl-Dörfler I have some questions."
"Is there not a risk that an international umbrella agreement of this kind places the interest of multinational enterprises over the general interest?"
"Do developing countries have any room to negotiate when they join the agreement, or are they presented with a fait accompli ?"
"The rapporteur quite rightly devotes a lot of attention to this in his valuable report."
"This agreement will limit sovereign powers considerably, and this is something which worries me."
"On important policy areas such as the environment, and in the social and cultural sphere, it could have a negative effect."
"It would not be the first time - we have hit our heads against this brick wall during the GATT negotiations."
"We have to steer clear of Scylla, an agreement which is too liberal, and Charybdis, over-regulation and protectionism."
"In the Netherlands the codes of conduct on the environment, human rights and social provision, drawn up by businesses themselves, appear to be working better than government regulation."
"The report puts a little too much emphasis on 'overprotection' , for instance in relation to culture."
"The Commission has had many suggestions, but was it really necessary to include everything in the report?"
"You can have too much of a good thing."
"This position will be reflected in the way I vote."
"Despite a few minor flaws, I would like to give my full support to this report, and I offer the rapporteur my sincerest congratulations."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement has very serious implications for the future of the European Union and our people."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's report clearly shows all the risks and conditions which must be met to make an investment organization more transparent and simpler, but also to ensure that it works for the people."
"All the same, our group tabled an amendment which would finally make the message from this Parliament clearer."
"We do not want our governments to ratify this agreement as it has been debated and with its underlying logic. Parliament should say that loud and clear."
"This agreement would in fact remove from our countries and the Union - indeed from the Community institutions - the ability to act efficiently, to set social and environmental standards or to operate policies favouring local development and employment."
"I will give you some examples to demonstrate this."
"Without doubt, the most scandalous point is the clause stating that countries can be censured if they take any measures liable to reduce or hinder the potential profits of a multinational enterprise."
"This implies that the profit of a multinational is more important than the interest of the people."
"Now why is the United States Congress slightly reticent?"
"It is because this clause exists in NAFTA and it has led to an American association in Canada called ""Ethyl' demanding to be reimbursed by the Canadian Government because the latter set a standard prohibiting a product which damages an organism indispensable in fighting pollution."
"So Canada was going to be censured because it was combatting pollution and was depriving a company of its profits."
"The Americans can see the danger, or at least some members of Congress can see it."
"Let us not ignore the danger; it is great, not only in the environmental but also in the social context."
"I would like to conclude by saying that of course we need to set up a global organization which is more transparent and more rational about investments, but several conditions must be met in order to do this."
"Firstly, the framework of this organization must not only include rich countries, but the WTO or even the UN."
"Secondly, social and environmental clauses must be possible, and even enacted at a global level."
"Thirdly, countries - and the European Union itself - must retain sovereignty and the possibility of taking action, because even if security is necessary for investors, it is much more indispensable for people."
"Madam President, the prime role of the economy is to serve the people."
"That is why I think it so important that we are debating the Multilateral Agreement on Investments today."
"Nevertheless, the Kreissl-Dörfler report contains several statements reminiscent of the campaign being run by various interest groups for some time now to use the MAI to stir up people's fears about globalization."
"I am being quite open about this criticism, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, because you know that I rate your work very highly and want to carry on being honest with you."
"Of course as a parliament we find it hard to accept that the negotiations have to a very great extent been kept secret from the public and from parliaments, as the report notes."
"However, this criticism should be levelled at the Council, not the OECD, as there is a meeting of the Council's ad hoc working party on this very subject today."
"Your report includes a call for a socially and ecologically balanced economic policy, and the other side of the House - I see Mrs Castellina is here as well - takes this to mean that the MAI would circumvent existing environmental and social standards."
"The Austrian Ministry of Economic Affairs said in its opinion that the MAI does not impinge on a country's right to have its own environmental and employment protection standards, as long as foreign investors are not subject to stricter requirements than domestic companies."
"It envisages outlawing social and environmental dumping, which means a ban on lowering environmental and employment standards as a means of attracting foreign investment."
"Nor will the MAI lead to any limitation of EU law."
"A proviso to this effect is included. The arrangements for intellectual property are such that the MAI cannot affect TRIPS."
"Furthermore, the OECD agreement is already subject to a democratic ratification process."
"If we really want people to benefit from the economy, we cannot cram an investment agreement with conditions that only an army of lawyers can make sense of."
"After all, it would also hit small and medium-sized enterprises, which do not have huge internal organizations."
"Of course we also want the Council to keep the Parliament promptly informed about the progress of negotiations."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Kreissl-Dörfler on his excellent report. It shows that even if liberalization of investments is an essential objective, the text as it stands is dangerous and on some points unacceptable."
"It is dangerous because it is unbalanced; the investors have all the rights and the countries have all the obligations."
"It could happen that countries would even have to answer to an international pseudo-jurisdiction regarding the motivation behind taking certain measures, for example on social or environmental issues."
"The text is also unacceptable in terms of intellectual property rights and the cultural sector, especially the audiovisual sector."
"In this Parliament we have fought to help establish a strong and dynamic cultural industry, notably by the 'television without frontiers' directive."
"And now the text of the treaty risks wasting all these efforts."
"However, I would add a new problem, Madam President."
"Today I have learned that the Commission is going to negotiate with the United States within the framework of a transatlantic single market or New Transatlantic Market Place. We have never been informed about this, and it too could target intellectual and artistic copyright."
"It is taking on a lot."
"And these negotiations are shrouded in complete secrecy."
"It is high time the Commission provided us with clear information about the MAI and NTM treaties. It is also high time for the Commission to renegotiate several points in the MAI treaty, to exclude the entire audiovisual sector and royalties from the field of international treaties, and for our Parliament, like its national counterparts, to finally accept its responsibilities with respect to these texts."
"Mr President, it is at this point that I should congratulate the rapporteur, but I shall put off doing so for lack of time."
"The rapporteur, however, considers it a good thing that it was the European Commission that negotiated the MAI treaty and not the Member States."
"That means a shift of power to a federal stronghold."
"It gives the Commission power over my country's social security system, environment, labour laws, health policy and psychology, which, according to this report, we should not be prepared to yield up to a supranational entity."
"From a small nation's viewpoint, the Commission can also seem like such an entity."
"The MAI treaty deals with ridding capitalism of all hindrances to exploitation, in the new regions and in the spiritual sphere too, including those countries that have not been invited to participate in OECD negotiations."
"The MAI imposes global standards on state activity, but not on that of individual companies."
"The MAI is thus one-sided."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has prepared an excellent report, although he has too much faith in the power of the EU and its benign nature."
"The EU is capitalism's answer to Europe."
"But what will evolve from the MAI treaty will be a new form of capitalism for the world."
"Mr President, I must point out to my colleague, Mr Seppänen, that my government and his were independent negotiators in the treaty."
"But let us press on. We are in the presence of something of a scandal."
"The Commission has negotiated a treaty that truly frustrates the cohesive strengths and ideas of a very large part of the EU."
"Many forms of grants and aid are called into question because of recommendations for certain concerns at the expense of others, and it is hard to imagine that exceptions could in any way be long-term."
"I am certain that in the end everything will be cast in the same mould and it is not worth hoping in vain for problems to be solved by exception."
"That is a temporary solution at best."
"We need strongly binding provisos for legislation and the protection of the environment."
"Commissioner, I do not baulk from saying that if the European Parliament were able to dismiss individual Commissioners, then that might well be the situation here, and your future would be hanging in the balance."
"Madam President, the objective of reaching multilateral international agreements favouring the spread of investment is of great importance."
"Providing a framework of certainty for investors may certainly be one of the fundamental conditions for enabling them to pay greater attention to non-traditional recipients as well - in other words, countries considered less reliable than others by the international investors themselves."
"However, this should take place under conditions which are fully acceptable to all the countries concerned and consistent with the objectives of a balanced development that can be maintained by those countries and their populations."
"Hence our criticisms of the method and contents of the agreement which has been under negotiation for more than two years within the OECD."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's report confirms those criticisms in a strong and convincing way, which is why we are in favour of it."
"We would like to raise three issues."
"Firstly, there is the problem of democracy and transparency."
"Negotiations have taken place and are taking place in great secrecy, without any parliament in the world being minimally informed and, so far, with most governments having little knowledge of the scope of the agreement."
"This is unacceptable, as the outcome of an agreement of this type are intended to have profound, long-term effects in every country of the world."
"Secondly, we dispute the view that the OECD is the appropriate place for an agreement intended to be extended to almost every country in the world."
"In this way, the requirements and problems of the developing nations in particular will once again not be given the slightest consideration, despite the fact that the poorest countries will suffer the most serious consequences."
"Finally, the contents of the agreement seem to be totally unacceptable, as they would actually rule out any possibility of individual states and regional associations such as the EU being able to develop policies on social and environmental quality, public services, or protection and optimization of cultural differences."
"They would also be a serious threat to the active policies of planning development."
"It is for these reasons that we are asking for the MAI not to be signed, at least not before its contents and nature have been profoundly amended."
"Madam President, I note with pleasure that organizations have had more success than the negotiators in trying to create debate about this agreement, which the negotiators have also tried to do."
"But what has been said on some points about the consequences of the agreement is very exaggerated."
"I think that first and foremost we should establish that a set of rules is needed when globalization in fact happens, and the EU and Parliament have an important role to play."
"Also, I hope the Commission supports the Member States who have strongly demanded that the agreement should forbid a relaxation of environmental and social standards in order to attract investment."
"How do things stand with this, Mr Commissioner?"
"The MAI could actually lead to an increase in standards rather than a decrease, as is maintained."
"I also hope it puts an end to the 'shopping' for subsidies which can be observed in many places."
"It could also lead to smaller companies daring to invest abroad."
"What is unclear is how the arbitration procedure will work."
"Will it be public or closed?"
"What are the rules on evidence?"
"I think this is something we must draw attention to."
"On this point the agreement is not ready to be signed."
"In addition we must think about the position of the OECD Council."
"I also think this agreement is necessary in the long term, so that developing countries can join voluntarily if they meet the standards required."
"Madam President, I am pleased that Sir Leon Brittan is present at this debate, because many things have been said about the MAI agreements, and the only part I will reiterate is the necessity to remain vigilant beyond the problems of culture."
"Yes, there is a risk of a serious attack on royalties, but beyond this, who can touch agriculture, the environment and social rights which have been spoken about at length."
"And anyway, what does the notion of culture include for us?"
"We in this establishment and in the Commission know very well that culture is shrinking constantly, to the point of only including the less strategic sectors and leaving behind the audiovisual sector, publishing and anything involving information highways."
"I am glad to be able to speak to you today, Sir Leon, because you have devised a project which is to be adopted tomorrow. I think the MAI will let you put to the test the fact that people and parliamentary members and a good number of the groups here do not want any more secret negotiations."
"They do not want any more of these attacks of neo-liberalism in our institutions and in Europe, which are often inspired by the United States. I think the New Transatlantic Market Place project should be reviewed, given the welcome accorded to the MAI by us today."
"But that is not all."
"Mr Bangemann should be here today, because the Green Paper on convergence also poses this type of problem."
"It is a real manifesto for neo-liberalism. My group will propose an amendment calling for postponement, to ensure that a real public debate is held with all due respect for public opinion, which increasingly influences international policies."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by saying that this agreement should not have been negotiated only in the OECD."
"It is far too important for that."
"What I wish to comment on is that workers' rights have been relegated to the preamble of the MAI agreement."
"It is a matter for concern that in the OECD's draft multilateral agreement on investments there is a large discrepancy between the rights and obligations of the investors."
"It is important for investors to be bound to keep certain commitments in the countries in which they operate."
"I would like to emphasize that it must be a cause for concern that the MAI has chosen to refer to workers' rights and environmental considerations in the introductory text."
"This implies that the references to workers' rights are not legally binding, but are more in the nature of a statement of intent."
"In my opinion, it is reasonable to add to the text the stipulation that countries must have ratified the International Labour Organization's seven conventions on the basic rights of workers."
"Countries must recognize the ILO's regulations on working conditions and the protection of the right to form unions, the prohibition of child labour and so on, so that such matters cannot become a competitive consideration used by states to try to attract investors. It is important to avoid either the state or the investors speculating in social dumping."
"It is important to bear in mind that the relaxation of provisions relating to direct foreign investments should not just be to the advantage of the investors and the country of origin."
"It should also contribute to securing sustainable economic development in the host country."
"This Parliament is the only parliament - as far as I know - to have discussed the MAI."
"It is important to initiate debate in the Member States and the national parliaments about this agreement."
"Madam President, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Renato Ruggiero, has called this agreement 'a constitution for a single global economy' ."
"That gives an idea of the unprecedented consequences the MAI could have."
"Who has the right to draft global constitutions?"
"Of course, it is obviously the 29 richest industrialized countries in the world."
"The other countries are in practice excluded, as is the intention, because when similar agreements were discussed in the WTO there was far too much opposition from other countries in the world."
"The only reasonable thing, of course, would be to discuss this agreement in the UN, or possibly in the WTO, instead of in the OECD."
"In the OECD countries negotiations have taken place in secret with the minimum possible parliamentary supervision."
"However, the agreement is unacceptable not only because of the way it is being negotiated, but also because of its content."
"The agreement gives rights to transnational companies at the expense of states."
"It is totally unreasonable for companies to be given the ability through the courts to overturn democratically made decisions concerning important areas such as the environment, the management of natural resources and social conditions."
"I do not like everything in this report. For example, I do not like paragraphs 7 and 8."
"However, the report does contain a lot of important criticism, not least in paragraphs 5, 14 and 23, which is sufficient for me to vote for it."
"Madam President, all praise is certainly due to Mr Kreissl-Dörfler who had the initiative to write this excellent report."
"The fact that the negotiations currently under way have given rise to such intense debate and opposing views demonstrates that a global economic issue of such vital importance needs plenty of time for exhaustive dialogue under conditions of transparency and continuous parliamentary supervision."
"When the Director-General of the World Trade Organization characterizes the MAI as the constitution for a global economy, this naturally provokes justifiable concern and unease as to the likely restrictions that will be imposed on the rights of Member States in relation to national policies and, more especially, in the areas of industrial, social, environmental and cultural policy, and in the domain of intellectual ownership."
"Of course, no-one can be opposed to the laying down of regulations to stimulate and safeguard foreign investments in order to prevent conditions which would distort international competition."
"Nevertheless, we have every right to be puzzled by the study and by the urgent character which the issue has taken on."
"We do not discern such study in relation to other serious issues which also stem from the globalization of the economy, such as labour rights, child labour, the tax position of multinationals, the protection of the environment, the promotion of viable and regionally balanced economic growth, and the preservation of cultural diversity."
"Fortunately, multinational companies and international groups of enterprises already have enormous power and it is not permissible to give them any priority over national enterprises, such as the automatic right of recourse to international arbitration or the right to bypass legislation aimed at ensuring equal treatment."
"Finally, I believe that the European Parliament must defend and protect its own rights and powers and those of the European Union from all attempts at curtailment through this agreement on investments."
"Madam President, very simply, the European Parliament must demand the immediate rejection of the multilateral agreement on investments."
"This agreement was drawn up in secrecy by large financial interests without including the national parliaments and the European Parliament and even without including the governments themselves."
"It is a multi-faceted ideological assault by large multinational corporations and, as has already been said, the first step in the formation of a global government of multinationals."
"Its implementation will have tragic repercussions for the peoples and economies of less developed countries."
"This new manifesto of global capitalism will lead to the complete overturning of the social freedoms and labour rights of working people. Together with EMU, it will lead to a totally deregulated market where the margins for exercising national policy and the national sovereignty of Member States will shrink dramatically in favour of multinational groups, international banks and international capitalist organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the OECD."
"I repeat, the European Parliament makes only one demand - the rejection of the agreement. Furthermore, the amendments that have been tabled must be voted on by our Parliament."
"Mr President, the compatibility of the MAI with environmental protection has not yet been sufficiently addressed by the negotiating parties."
"It is of great concern."
"As we move into more and more multilateral environment agreements I feel there is an increased chance of running into difficulties should the MAI, as presently formulated, come into being."
"A paper from the OECD secretariat on the legal aspects has noted that: ' The absence of any evident legal incompatibility does not necessarily dispose of all concerns about the potential inter-relation between the MAI and MEAs' ."
"In particular there is some concern that the transfer of clean technology agreements contained in the Kyoto Protocol to combat climate change could be at risk."
"The clean development mechanism is essential to that protocol's success and has the potential to run directly contrary to the MAI."
"A binding environment clause should be included which will offer at least similar safeguards to GATT Article 20 and not prove to be an inadequate voluntary clause, such as Article 114 in the NAFTA agreement."
"Furthermore, there needs to be provision for environmental reviews of all foreign investors."
"Without these safeguards for sustainable development, we must have great cause for concern about the agreement at this stage."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the draft multilateral agreement on investments, or MAI, has been negotiated in the utmost secrecy; it is a recognized symbol of the absolute triumph of unbridled liberalism; and it aims to ensure the domination of multinational financial groups over nations and to support the supremacy of rich industrial countries over developing nations. Clearly this agreement is completely unacceptable as it stands today."
"Consequently, without fundamentally prejudicing my final opinion, I fully agree with the call by the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, and I would like to congratulate him on his work."
"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of the rapporteur's request to the Member States of the European Union not to sign the MAI without a broad public debate, for that is the only way to ensure the total transparency essential in this case."
"Otherwise, without going into detail, I broadly agree with the questions asked and the remarks made by the rapporteur, which again prove the need for a detailed study and absolute transparency."
"If by some unfortunate event the MAI were to be signed as it stands, we would no longer have any means to halt globalization in its most negative form, that is, the law of the most powerful."
"I hope and believe that all the governments of the European Union will realize this."
"I have one last word to say on the issue of European culture and audiovisual production."
"Although I agree with the rapporteur's fresh demand for a special exception, I would insist that it is not solely within the framework of the MAI, but has reference to GATT."
"This issue is much too serious for us to give any sort of an impression of backing down, no matter how small."
"Finally, I repeat once again that on this issue the European Parliament should display its avant-garde role."
"I think we are in the process of doing that this evening."
"Madam President, I would like to raise a few concerns I have about developing countries in relation to the MAI, particularly, as others have pointed out, that they have been excluded from the negotiations even though those negotiations have a very significant impact on them."
"They also need to raise the issue of the effect of the liberalization on the ability of developing countries to adopt the poverty focused programmes which are essential to their progress."
"It is also the case, as others have said, that employment, environment and labour rights need to be an integral part of the process, not bolted on as some kind of afterthought."
"I am also concerned about the increased powers which MAI will give to multinationals in developing countries, where they will be given almost nation-state status within developing countries."
"There is far too much emphasis on their rights rather than on their duties and responsibilities."
"They contain no binding enforceable obligations for corporate conduct and the level of liberalization required would be inappropriate for developing countries."
"The rules on investment should be about more than economic liberalization and should include a very clear commitment to sustainable development and to long-term quality investments."
"I would like to see a substantial revision of the current proposals and a delay pending a much more inclusive process."
"I would like to see a legitimate international forum where developing countries can be included and where international institutions like UNCTAD can be involved."
"Only then will we be satisfied that we have a fair process in place on multilateral investments."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I firstly thank the Committee on External Economic Relations and its rapporteur Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for an excellent report on the negotiations on the MAI."
"I would also like to thank the other committees and their rapporteurs for their efforts in preparing the present report."
"This is a timely debate."
"The negotiations are not completed."
"The European Parliament's decision to hold this debate has the importance that Mrs Castellina ascribed to it."
"I share that view and I can also assure Mrs Schörling that we have had a real debate and that this will play an active part in the course of the negotiations."
"The European Community is the biggest outward investor in the world, sending half of our investment to the OECD and half to non-OECD countries."
"At the same time we are the most open to inward investors in the world."
"The Community therefore has a big interest in the establishment of transparent, non-discriminatory and enforceable rules for foreign direct investment at the plurilateral as well as at the multilateral level."
"That is why I very much agree with Mr Valdivielso de Cué, Mrs Baldi, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel and Mr Teverson, all of whom stressed the importance and potential benefit of this negotiation."
"There has to be a balance between the opportunities provided for investment and also the necessity for there to be national possibilities to regulate and control certain matters."
"That is what the negotiation has been about and this debate has contributed to that balance."
"I can assure Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel that this will be a negotiation in which at the end of it the EC will be a member."
"In the Commission communication on a level playing field for direct investment worldwide, we made the case for starting negotiations in the OECD and launching discussions in the WTO."
"Let me remind you that the Council and the European Parliament, in its resolution of December 1995, supported this approach."
"I still consider that the successful conclusion of the MAI negotiations is the best possible starting point for multilateral rule-making in the WTO in order to achieve a worldwide level playing field for FDI."
"Let us not forget that it is the view of the vast majority of developing countries that it is in their interest that foreign direct investment should be encouraged and not discouraged."
"Therefore a proper agreement will help them as much as it will help the investing countries."
"The relation between what we are doing in the MAI negotiations and what we want to do in the WTO is the key, as Mrs Mann has rightly stated."
"That relationship was something very relevant to the remarks of Mr Lannoye, Mrs Leperre-Verrier and Mrs Kinnock."
"We have been very conscious of the importance of the interlocking relationship."
"The MAI negotiation is one between essentially developed countries."
"It is a negotiation which nobody need participate in and nobody need join and the results of which nobody need accept who is not a party to that negotiation, although it is open to them."
"It is because of that and because of my view, which I very strongly hold, that to have an agreement that adequately reflects the interests of the developing countries as well as the developed ones, there should be discussions in the WTO leading to a negotiation in the WTO which will take account of the MAI negotiation but which need not be the same."
"That is the best way of ensuring that the MAI does not exert unreasonable pressure on developing countries to adhere to it."
"However, we have some barriers to deal with there."
"So far we have only reached agreement on discussion in the WTO and the obstacle to going beyond that to a negotiation in the WTO is the fact that some developing countries have resisted that."
"I hope very much therefore that those - and there are many in this House - who have an influence on the developing countries will encourage them to move to a position in which they will welcome a negotiation in the WTO as well as a negotiation in the OECD, precisely in order that the agreement which will eventually come into effect in which they can participate will be one that fully reflects their interests and that they will not simply be faced with the alternative of signing up to the MAI negotiation or not signing up to anything at all."
"As it happens, I do not believe that the MAI negotiation need result in a conclusion that is inimical to the interests of developing countries."
"However, I can understand their feeling that they have not been parties to that negotiation."
"The best thing for them to do is to supplement the negotiation in the OECD with a negotiation in WTO as soon as possible."
"The failure of the OECD negotiation will not help them because that will be used to oppose the beginning of negotiations in the WTO by people who are bound to say: ' if the developed countries cannot even reach an agreement on this, how can you expect there to be a world agreement?'"
"If there is no world agreement on this, then the balance which attracts investment to developing countries, that they desperately need on the right terms, will not take place and it will be counterproductive on the part of those who seek to defend their interests to have opposed the OECD negotiation."
"It is with these considerations in mind that in May 1995 negotiations in the OECD context were launched, and in December 1996 at the Singapore Ministerial Conference we achieved the setting up of a WTO Investment Working Group."
"The deadline set for negotiations in the OECD to come to a conclusion is the end of April 1998."
"Anybody who has ever been involved in negotiations of this kind will know that a month and a half at the end of a negotiation is a very important and crucial time in which much can be done."
"I cannot tell you whether we will reach a conclusion. If we do, it will be much informed by what has been said today."
"But I can tell you that we will only reach a conclusion if we are able to accommodate the legitimate interests of the European Union."
"I agree with most, if not all, of the recommendations made in the draft resolution which is the subject of discussion today."
"We agree on the need to safeguard in the MAI the right of contracting parties to take action to protect the environment, not only now but in the future."
"Therefore, I have no difficulty at all with what has been said by Mrs Pollack."
"In the field of labour, we think it is very important that the respect of labour standards should be protected in this negotiation."
"So I agree with Mr Kreissl-Dörfler and, indeed, with Mr Habsburg-Lothringen on that."
"We also insist on a provision to cover present and future policies related to European integration."
"That is why I welcome the words of Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, Mrs Ahern and Mrs Castellina about the importance of a regional economic integration clause which allows both for further harmonization among existing Members of the European Union and a progressive alignment on EU policy of the laws and practices of our Europe agreement partners."
"I would say to Mr Falconer that this agreement - if it goes through - will reinforce the status of national contact points, and that the guidelines he referred to as being inadequate are due for review."
"The draft resolution also deals extensively with the aspects of culture and intellectual property rights under the MAI, and rightly so."
"I wish to say a word about that."
"The objective of preserving European cultural identity through specific policy measures and actions, in particular in the audiovisual sector, is fully shared by the Commission."
"I share the concerns expressed by many, especially Mr Elchlepp and Mrs Daskalaki."
"Among negotiators there is now a consensus that the MAI should not undermine the GATT acquis , excluding audiovisual services, that is to say, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round."
"It is only a question of exactly how that should be done."
"Our view is that a general exception, which seems superficially attractive, is not the best solution."
"A Europe-specific detailed reservation actually gives greater legal security for present and future policies than a one-sentence general caveat."
"There is one thing I want to assure this House of beyond a doubt: I had the privilege and the honour of conducting the Uruguay Round negotiations on the part of the European Union."
"On the last day of those negotiations, when the whole of the world was standing by and wanting a conclusion to those negotiations, we were under intense pressure from the United States to agree to provisions relating to audiovisual and cultural matters which would have weakened and put at risk our own audiovisual and cultural policy."
"I had absolutely no hesitation in resisting that pressure and in saying that we would not agree to the whole Uruguay Round agreement if we were forced to succumb to such pressure to reach such an agreement."
"And we succeeded."
"It was the United States which blinked."
"I can assure this House that, faced with a situation of that kind, if the European Union, through its negotiator, the Commission, was prepared to resist that pressure, do not think we are going to be so naive as to give away in the MAI negotiations what we resisted successfully in the Uruguay Round negotiations."
"There is absolutely no question of that happening and any disagreement can only be about the way in which we are most effectively protected."
"On IPR let me say we are still looking for a solution which would respect European and WIPO rules in the area while, on the other hand, providing value added mainly in the field of dispute settlement."
"I can assure Mrs McKenna that the reservations on fisheries will be effective, but all of these issues are still under negotiation."
"With political will, taking account of the points rightly raised in this House, we can reach a conclusion which will be in the interests of the European Union as a major investor outside the European Union, in the interests of the developing countries and in the interests of all the policies that we hold dear."
"We shall only sign up to an agreement if we reach that."
"I do not myself think that there is any necessity or value in obtaining the opinion of the European Court of Justice."
"We negotiate habitually on matters of great importance, we have our legal advisers, and if every time there was a negotiation we ran to the European Court of Justice that would undermine the institutional balance."
"Of course I can happily confirm, as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler invited me to do, that the Commission will recommend to the Council that if there is an agreement that the Member States and the Commission support, we will request the assent of the European Parliament before its enactment."
"In presenting the MAI to the Council I can assure Mr García-Margallo y Marfil that the Commission will analyse the compatibility of this agreement with the important international agreements to which we are a party, including multilateral, environmental and social agreements, and with our own legislation and policies in areas such as fisheries, transport and development, as well as with the European Community Treaty itself."
"But at this stage I do not see any incompatibilities and in the continuation of the negotiations we will ensure that this remains the case."
"At the present stage the negotiations are in a difficult phase."
"Our American partners have indicated that given the need for continued negotiations on a number of crucial issues they think that the April deadline cannot be met."
"They tell us that they are not in a position to suggest an alternative date for conclusion of the MAI."
"That sends a bad signal concerning our determination to hold the OECD countries to their current economic policy course despite the recent crises in, notably, Asia, and to respond to the challenges of globalization by enhancing the present open system for trade and investment."
"We cannot accept the American announcement as a fait accompli ."
"In the period ahead important progress can be made if the political will is there."
"It will then be for ministers to decide on the fate of the MAI reflecting the wishes of democratically elected governments."
"It is now up to us to test in the weeks to come if the political will is there."
"We are determined to do everything we can to achieve a successful conclusion of the negotiations, but an agreement at any price is not what we are looking for."
"It is also important to stress the need to find a suitable arrangement with the United States inside and outside the MAI, to deal with the problem of extraterritorial legislation which Mr Souchet referred to in general and the Helms-Burton Act and ILSA in particular."
"The OECD ministerial meeting to be held at the end of April has to set out the course."
"We will seek to make substantial progress between now and that date."
"In the meantime the Community and its Member States have a clear interest in having an MAI that protects our interests, protects the interests of developing countries and secures our ability to continue with the policies which we hold dear."
"We shall seek to achieve that; we shall not yield to any seeking to destroy our interests."
"If we proceed boldly but coolly, ready to defend our interests but also recognizing that the right kind of MAI on the right conditions is in the interests of the European Union, then we shall be doing something that reflects the will of the peoples of Europe."
"I asked a very specific question."
"I asked Sir Leon Brittan to shed some light on the procedure because there might be a conflict of interest between the European Communities and the Member States that want to become partners."
"I would like to know about a decision procedure."
"Will there be unanimity in the Council on this before signing, or is it possible that there is..."
"(The President cut off the speaker )"
"I thought I had answered the question."
"There has to be unanimous support of the Member States and there has to be assent given by this Parliament, as I said in my speech."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are now going to begin questions to the Commission, 35 minutes later than stated in the agenda."
"Please excuse this delay, which is not my fault."
"I have spoken about it with the President, and I hope that in future we will be able to take appropriate measures in order to keep to the timetables set by our agendas."
"Mr McMahon requests the floor on a point of order."
"I raised a question this morning about my own question which I submitted about the NUTS nomenclature and eligibility for a designation under the various funds."
"As you well know, I take Question Time very seriously."
"I saw that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies was down to answer regional and structural fund questions this week, so I decided to table this question."
"Unfortunately it appears to have been tabled at the end, under 'other Questions' ."
"It should be in its rightful place."
"The then President undertook to find out from the service what had happened."
"Could you give me an answer, please?"
"Mr McMahon, I was present myself this morning when you raised that question, and in accordance with Parliament's services, we contacted the Commission."
"I should remind you that the Commission is responsible for deciding which Commissioner replies to a given question. The Commission explained to us that your Question No 102 is a matter for Mr de Silguy, since it concerns Eurostat figures."
"So it does not fall into Mrs Wulf-Mathies' remit."
"The next item is questions to the Commission (B4-0260/98)."
"The 1993 structural funds reform incorporated equal opportunities for men and women on the labour market as a policy goal, and equal opportunities in the Social Fund is defined in Art. 1 (1)(d) as a specific priority."
"Member States have chosen to implement this priority of the present ESF regulation with a dual approach."
"The majority have adopted specific equal opportunities programmes whereas the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom are using a mainstreaming approach."
"Even though approaches differ the measures undertaken are very similar: promotion of greater participation of women in fields where they are under-represented, training and vocational training of unemployed women and women returners and the promotion of female entrepreneurship and other related measures."
"In the preparation of the new draft general structural fund regulations one of the goals is to reduce existing disparities and to promote equal participation of women and men in economic and social activity through a mainstreaming approach."
"The intention is to have the mainstreaming strategy permeate the whole implementation process from the programming phase right through to reporting."
"At all phases and levels of decision-making the aim is to have a) balanced participation of women and men and b) a partnership which includes representatives of competent authorities and bodies in the field of equality between women and men."
"It is foreseen that the European Social Fund activity will be based on five policy fields: active labour market policy, promotion of social inclusion, lifelong learning, anticipation and facilitating economic and social change and equal opportunities for men and women."
"In addition to the specific equal opportunities priority in the social fund regulation it is intended to implement the mainstreaming approach through all policy fields and to build on actual experience in the regional and local development context including local employment initiatives and territorial employment pacts."
"I hope that a clear message in favour of positive action will be given in the new regulation."
"Finally, I should remind the honourable Member that the employment guidelines which were adopted at the special job summit in Luxembourg last November are constructed around four pillars and one of these is strengthening the policies for equal opportunities."
"In this connection Member States are required to take measures which will reduce the gender gap in unemployment as well as in occupational segregation, to raise the levels of care services which very often represent a key barrier for women who would like to return to work and to facilitate the return process."
"The Commission expects that particular attention will be paid to these guidelines in the action plans which are being prepared by the Member States just now and which will be presented at the Cardiff European Council in June."
"Commissioner, my precise reason for asking this question is my wish to see women become the subject and the main object of the new employment policies. So thank you for your magnificent reply, which was so thorough and encouraging."
"I would just like to ask if you really believe these benefits are going to reach all Europe's women, even in Granada. Also, financially speaking, what is the exact amount involved?"
"I should also like to know if these benefits are going to reach the places where women most need them."
"Lastly, are efforts going to be made to ensure that there are more programmes, and that they are better funded in those places where there is most male chauvinism?"
"Thank you for your question, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, and for keeping to time."
"Mr Flynn has the floor to answer the supplementary question which, as you will have realized, mentioned the women of Granada."
"I do not know whether you are familiar with Granada, Mr Flynn, but if not I recommend that you visit that magnificent city."
"I take up your invitation Mr President and I should look forward to the visit very much."
"I have been there on a few occasions privately but perhaps I can go on an official visit and I am grateful for your interest."
"I should like to say to the honourable Member that I am not just full of hope but I am full of expectation as well, and of course you will appreciate that all these changes will depend on the programmes that are submitted from the Member States when they look for assistance insofar as the promotion of equal opportunities are concerned."
"Bear one thing in mind: it is a Treaty obligation, and since the job summit all the Prime Ministers and the Presidents of the 15 Member States have signed a personal commitment to advance equal opportunities and to provide specific activities to deal with this."
"I will be particularly interested in what the social fund does because I foresee a framework there that will provide employment aids and aids for the self-employed."
"It will develop new sources of employment and will give assistance in the provision of services for beneficiaries."
"Here I am talking about care services which I think you will agree with me are very often a fundamental matter in accommodating women returning to work."
"I look forward with quite a lot of expectation following the commitments of the job summit."
"Commissioner, the autonomous region of Valencia has Objective 1 status but it has still not been decided if it will retain that status, because it is a few points above or below the figure of 75 % of Community income."
"Of course, unemployment certainly is above average, and not just the Community average but the Spanish average too."
"That, in its turn, is twice the European figure, or three times in the case of women."
"Given that employment is a priority objective in all the European regions, and that training and new jobs are both absolutely essential, especially for the women who make up 30 % of the unemployed in the Valencian Community, does the Commission think that region should retain its Objective 1 status?"
"Very briefly I should just say to the honourable Member that Valencia does have certain particular problems."
"A decision has not yet been taken concerning the particular areas that will qualify for Objective 1 under the new tranche from the year 2000-2006."
"That will all have to be negotiated between now and some time early next year."
"I would like to point out that the regulations that will apply to the structural funds will be up for approval before the Commission on 18 March and after that we will see how things progress."
"Thank you, Mr Flynn, for your presence here today, for your answers, and for having accepted the suggestions that you visit the two lovely Spanish cities of Granada and Valencia - for different reasons, but both very interesting."
"Question No 42 by John McCartin (H-0176/98)"
"Subject: Beef market"
"The five main supermarkets in Britain have monopoly control over the sale of meat; they have over 80 % of the total market."
"Can the Commission prevent these retailers using their market domination in an anti-competitive manner by excluding Irish beef from their outlets?"
"The retail market for meat in Britain contains a number of supermarkets with significant market shares but the Commission has no information to the effect that they are collectively or individually in a position to dominate the market."
"Currently we do not have sufficient concrete information to make an assessment of the situation on the market."
"Commission services are currently trying to verify reports that Irish beef has been excluded from supermarkets and find out, if it is the case, whether the exclusion is due to restrictive practices or for other reasons. If the Member or anybody else has relevant information the Commission would be interested in receiving it."
"I understand there is plenty of information that some supermarket chains in the UK have publicly declared that they have excluded Irish beef from their shelves for the moment."
"In those circumstances, I understand, considering that this is a market which has traditionally been supplied with Irish beef, that this is a deliberate discriminatory act which has been declared and confessed by the people concerned."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner - assuming that he can verify that - if he has the power to prosecute the people in question for this declared and confessed discrimination."
"We will have to look into the facts."
"Much will depend on whether the exclusion is due to restrictive practice or whether it is a unilateral exclusion."
"So I cannot really say whether anything can be done, and whether anything should be done, until further information is obtained and analysed."
"Question No 43 by Simon Murphy (H-0192/98)"
"Subject: Sport and Alcohol Sponsorship"
"Following recent speculation in the British press, will the Commission confirm whether the Green Paper on commercial communications in the internal market will result in an imminent decision on sport and alcohol sponsorship within the EU?"
"What are the Commission's plans regarding the future of drinks advertising in the EU, especially in view of the French which limits alcohol sponsorship and has resulted in the effective banning in France of the retransmission of televised sporting events benefiting from alcohol advertising/sponsorship in other countries?"
"The honourable Member refers to recent press articles which have speculated that the Green Paper on commercial communications in the internal market will result in an imminent decision on sports sponsorship by the alcohol industry in the EU."
"That is not the case: the Green Paper, whose proposals were adopted on 4 March, sets out a methodology to assess whether the effects of restrictions on crossborder commercial communications are proportional to the public-interest objectives that such measures are intended to achieve."
"The communication has also established an expert group of Member State representatives to examine the differences in national regulations with a view to exploring the scope for agreement on mutual recognition in this field."
"The communication sets up a framework where the issue that the honourable Member has raised could be discussed openly in order to resolve internal-market problems that may arise."
"The press are confusing this consultative exercise with an infringement case that the honourable parliamentarian has referred to against a provision of the French loi Evin ."
"This provision bans TV transmissions by French broadcasters of certain sports events held outside France, but mainly of interest to the French public, which are sponsored by alcoholic beverage producers."
"This restriction on retransmissions has led to sports bodies in other Member States breaking their sponsorship contracts with alcohol beverage producers, for fear of having their events not transmitted in France, and therefore losing their TV rights."
"The Commission sent out a reasoned opinion in 1996 underlining its doubts as to the proportionality of this restriction, and is currently discussing the issue with the French authorities."
"I would stress that, in this case, the Commission is not contesting the loi Evin as such, but the consequences of the application of the law on televised events held outside France."
"The Commission seeks to ensure the highest level of public health protection and to that end is taking the utmost care in assessing the proportionality of this restriction."
"With regard to our willingness to take harmonizing measures in this field, that will depend on the outcome of the investigations."
"It would be in our power to propose such measures but, at this point, we have no intention of doing so."
"I have no further question, other than to thank the Commissioner for that very clear and straightforward answer."
"We look forward to developments in the future."
"I want to ask you whether you do not agree with me that what we have here in relation to the loi Evin in France is in Europe what we are protesting against over the laws which are blocking trade with Cuba."
"In other words, this is an international intervention which has no justification whatsoever, and we would weaken our position if we really carried this out within Europe."
"We could no longer be fighting against the American legislation on international trade."
"I certainly agree that in considering what we are saying about what other people outside the European Union do we should be very careful to ensure that we are consistent in not objecting to what happens outside the European Union and not at the same time objecting to anything similar within the European Union."
"I have already mentioned that the Commission sent out a reasoned opinion in 1996 underlining its doubts as to the proportionality of the restriction in the loi Evin and to go further than that would go as far as I am tempted to go but further than I would be wise to go."
"Like the speaker, Sir Leon, I am pleased with the statement published last week on commercial communication."
"In view of the fact that the many recent complaints, particularly on the loi Evin , have not been dealt with seriously, my question is whether it was President Santer's office or the President himself who considered it necessary to wait until the statement came out. Also, will the expert group which is soon to be set up investigate the complaints thoroughly?"
"Could you give this Parliament and me some more information about the various positions within the Commission on the treatment of the complaints we have before us?"
"It would not be normal to give details of every kind of discussion that takes place within the Commission, apart from the fact that I am not aware of them all."
"But the normal position is this: you send out a reasoned opinion expressing doubts as to the legality of what has been done and you then engage in discussions with the French authorities if they are prepared to do so, which they are, and that is currently the stage that we have got to."
"I am not able to go beyond that."
"Question No 44 by Graham Watson (H-0257/98)"
"Subject: Ticket allocation for the 1998 Football World Cup"
"Following the request made to the French World Cup organizing authorities by the European Commission to recast its ticket allocation for World Cup football matches, will the Commission make a statement on the steps taken by the CFO?"
"Does the Commission believe these steps bring the ticket allocation system into compliance with Community competition law?"
"The Commission wrote to the World Cup Organizing Committee on 20 February outlining its objections to the current ticketing policy and asking the committee, within two weeks of its receipt of the letter, to inform the Commission of the steps which it proposed to take to ensure that its system of ticket distribution did not discriminate against football supporters resident outside France."
"This request followed a preliminary assessment of the current ticketing arrangements, which led the Commission to believe that the organizing committee might be abusing a dominant position on the World Cup ticketing market, contrary to Article 86 of the EC Treaty."
"The Commission met the organizing committee on Thursday, 5 March to discuss its concerns over the current ticketing arrangements, and, in particular, the CFO rule which requires all those wishing to purchase tickets directly from the CFO to provide an address in France to which the tickets can be sent."
"Does this mean that the Commission will take no action to forbid the issue of tickets which have already been sold, even though many of these tickets have not yet been issued but merely applied for?"
"Can the Commissioner guarantee that if the Treaties have been infringed, then formal infringement procedures will be initiated?"
"Or is the Commission seeking merely a sop to football fans stitched up with the CFO in a cosy compact in the changing rooms?"
"I do not envisage anything cosy of the kind that the honourable Member describes."
"If there has been a breach of the law then action will be taken unless that breach is put right in a very specific way."
"That will be the position of the Commission."
"As I have said, there were discussions as recently as last Thursday."
"I cannot give a specific answer to the point the honourable Member has made because, in fact, the outcome of those discussions is being considered and my colleague will be making a statement in a debate on Thursday at which I have little doubt he will convey the outcome of the meeting, the conclusions the Commission has drawn and the action that has been taken."
"With the situation as the Commissioner has described and the restrictions it places on the distribution of tickets, there will undoubtedly be people who will look for a way round it."
"Has the Commission had any communications with the French authorities to look at the potential for problems when it comes to the resale of tickets?"
"There will always be legitimate travel companies who, one way or another, get hold of tickets and start offering alternative packages but there will also be ticket touts who will get hold of tickets and be reselling them at inflated prices."
"This could create massive problems from the point of view of policing, from balance and the whole potential for crowd problems."
"It could throw the whole scheme into disarray."
"It might create a very free market, which I am sure the Commissioner would support, but it will be one that could lead to problems."
"Has there been any contact with the French authorities regarding this?"
"I am sorry that I cannot give a definitive answer as to exactly what is happening."
"I can assure the honourable Member that as a result of the discussions that took place last Thursday, the whole issue is being looked at."
"The Commission will certainly not agree to any solution which permits very obvious abuses and can be got round in a very easy way."
"Those considering these matters have adequate knowledge of what people might get up to not to be fobbed off by a solution which has obvious holes."
"Question No 45 by Gary Titley (H-0229/98)"
"Subject: Anti-dumping duties"
"In view of the repeated anti-dumping complaints by Eurocoton, does the Commission intend to revise its procedures so that serial complaints will no longer be possible?"
"The current Eurocoton complaint followed the rejection by the Council of the Commission's proposal for definitive anti-dumping duties on unbleached cotton fabrics in May 1997."
"This complaint also concerned unbleached cotton fabrics but, unlike the old proceeding, it was based on evidence of dumping and injury in a different time period."
"Following receipt of the new complaint the Commission examined whether it was lodged by a sufficiently representative proportion of Community producers and whether it contained prima facie evidence of dumping and resulting injury."
"Since these requirements were met the Commission decided to open a new investigation on 11 July 1997 as it was obliged to do under EU anti-dumping legislation which is in conformity with WTO rules."
"Consecutive anti-dumping complaints are extremely rare."
"Grey cotton fabrics is the only case in the history of the EU anti-dumping regulation where a second complaint was lodged after the rejection of a Commission proposal by the Council."
"In these circumstances the Commission has not yet formed a view as to whether a legislative change that would prevent consecutive complaints is warranted."
"In order to investigate anti-dumping complaints, the Commission has to come to a view on whether there is injury to the European Community cause."
"Is it not the case that serial anti-dumping complaints are themselves damaging to the Community interest given the cost of dealing with the investigations, given the uncertainties which companies are then placed under, which makes it very difficult to engage in any sort of forward planning?"
"Does the Commission accept that serial complaints are themselves injurious to the Community interest?"
"Does he have a view as to whether serial complaints are fundamentally undermining the EU's commitments to the World Trade Organisation, given that they can be seen to represent trade harassment of importing countries?"
"I certainly accept that any complaint that is made imposes a burden on the interested parties but I do not accept that the receipt of a second or a third complaint is contrary to the rules of the WTO."
"I am a bit reluctant to regard the lodging of a complaint as something that itself should be looked at in the context of Community interests."
"But I assure the honourable Member that in the case of this complaint the whole question of Community interests and the balancing of any Community interests - in an opposite sense compared to the damage done to the producers who have made the complaint - is something that will be looked into and has been very fully looked into."
"I tabled a question on this and it did not come up in today's session."
"I would like to follow up on Mr Titley's question."
"In the light of tomorrow's debate on the competitiveness of the EU industries generally and Commissioner Bangemann's action plan on the competitiveness of the European textile industry, would you not agree that Eurocoton's complaint belongs to the past for our industries?"
"Does the Commissioner not accept that the Community interest is not served, nor is the competitiveness of the EU textile industry served, by the imposition of such duties?"
"Indeed we already have evidence that this will lead to job losses not only in the finishing sector but also in increased imports of finished goods at the end of the day."
"Therefore, I ask you, Commissioner, what proposals will you make to the Council of Ministers and to the expert group for enhancing and strengthening Community interest in this area?"
"Will you be making a strong case for Community interests?"
"Are you prepared to put forward proposals in this area in future?"
"In terms of representation, 30 companies producing cotton are not representative of the whole of the EU textile industry."
"There is really no mystery about this."
"We have looked to see if there has been dumping or injury - and we all know to whom injury is alleged to have been done."
"Against that we have balanced all the points made by another section of European industry that says that injury would be suffered if there were anti-dumping measures taken."
"Indeed, it has said that the net effect of the measures would be beneficial to the European economy as a whole."
"That is a legitimate argument."
"There is a procedure for considering it."
"It is important that the question of Community interest should be considered properly."
"We have done so in this case."
"I am not in a position to announce a final outcome yet but I can assure the honourable Member that all the points she has raised have been taken very fully into consideration."
"I have received complaints against the anti-dumping measures."
"They have been from small companies who feel they are going to be very severely disadvantaged if they are no longer able to import the cotton."
"I would like to ask: are not both developing countries and some small companies who depend on imported cotton being disadvantaged very considerably?"
"When you are looking at the balance of interest, you take on board those issues as well."
"In the answers you have already given, you have given some indication of that."
"I am very grateful for what the honourable Member has said about my initial response."
"It is very difficult."
"There is no doubt at all that there are people within the European Union who complain that they are suffering from dumping and there are others who complain that they would suffer even more if anti-dumping measures were taken."
"So, leaving aside anybody outside the European Union, we have to balance those interests."
"That is why this has proved to be one of the most difficult and controversial cases we have had to deal with."
"I am sorry I cannot say just at the moment where it is all going to end but I can say that I have been personally involved in a serious examination of the arguments that everybody has put forward - the producers outside the European Union and those represented by the honourable lady."
"It is impossible to please everybody."
"Therefore, the only thing to do is to try to be fair and that is what we shall try to do."
"Question No 46 by Inger Schörling (H-0007/98)"
"Subject: Salmonella"
"Salmonella-infected products may be sent back to the country of shipment provided prior authorization is obtained from the competent authorities of that country."
"It seems peculiar that the competent authorities in the country of shipment must grant authorization for the contaminated meat to be returned when it should be the supplier's responsibility to take back such consignments while the relevant authorities are informed."
"The background to my question is that inspections of meat imported into Sweden have revealed far too many cases of salmonella, despite all the certification from the country of shipment being present and correct."
"This gives rise to complications, not only for people who consume the contaminated meat but also for importers and retailers who, apart from the financial implications, are also embroiled in bureaucracy."
"A question of interpretation has also arisen as to who should be considered to have handled the product first?"
"Is it the importer, the distributor or another party?"
"Is it possible for the competent authorities in the country of shipment not to authorize the return of contaminated meat?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Schörling's questions relate to Article 7 of Council Directive 98/662 of 11 December 1989 on Arrangements for veterinary checks on intra-Community trade with regard to the single market, with particular reference to the checks to be carried out at the relevant destination."
"It is necessary to distinguish between two different scenarios in this context: in more serious cases the consignment delivered must be safely disposed of or treated in accordance with the relevant Community rules to eliminate any further risk."
"In other, less serious cases, the appropriate authorities in the country of destination can give the shipper or the shipper's authorized agent two options, depending on the animal health and sanitary conditions. The first is to safely dispose of the goods and the second is to use the goods in some other way, including the option of sending the goods back, subject to permission from the appropriate authorities in the country where the production unit of origin is located."
"This permission from the authorities in the country of dispatch was regarded as essential for these authorities to confirm the whereabouts of the contaminated consignment and ultimately prevent its being placed on the market."
"If the check is carried out at a later stage in the marketing chain, and the result is unfavourable, the relevant national regulations apply."
"For products originating from another Member State, the same regulations apply as for products originating in the Member State concerned."
"When Sweden became a Member of the EU we were given a unique derogation because we do not have any salmonella in Sweden."
"The derogation was that all meat imports from other EU countries should be accompanied by a certificate to say that the consignment of meat was free of salmonella."
"It now appears that this was much more complicated than our authorities ever thought because, among other things, it appears that many of the certificates are false or incorrect."
"No less than 25 % of all beef, pig-meat and poultry consignments have incomplete certificates, and 20 % of the meat consignments which have the correct certificates prove to be contaminated with salmonella."
"No less than 85 % of the tests on poultry from France showed that the meat was contaminated."
"So you will understand that this is not a question of having to deal with a few small consignments."
"Another problem is that people do not know and cannot figure out who is responsible."
"I think the Commission is responsible for ensuring that the derogation Sweden has received works ."
"I do not think Commissioner Fischler's answer really explained things, although I am certainly grateful for it."
"I would therefore like to hear a bit more about how the Commissioner thought this would work."
"Mr President, Mrs Schörling, first of all I can confirm that Sweden was indeed granted derogations as part of its accession to the European Community."
"In accordance with these derogations - and this also applies to Finland by the way - Sweden can apply special guarantees to various products, namely fresh meat, eggs and poultry meat, as the Commission authorized operational programmes for combatting salmonella submitted by Sweden."
"The Commission approved these programmes in its 1995 decision."
"We will be coming back to the subject of checking in the next question, but the essential point is that a procedure certainly exists under which countries of dispatch are responsible, as the Commission cannot check every consignment shipped from every Member State on the spot."
"The Commission can only ensure that appropriate rules exist."
"The Member State concerned is of course then required to ensure that these rules are observed."
"Commissioner, today the Commission has been presented with questions on contamination, meat hygiene, BSE, brown rot, and so on."
"I want to point out to the Commissioner that the FAO has called on the European Union to increase and strengthen its prevention and monitoring systems for the transformation and transmission of diseases in the area of agricultural health."
"Also, there are eleven central and eastern European countries at our door, and as things stand, their safeguards in that area are dubious, to say the least."
"In order to guarantee the health of consumers and of our agricultural producers in the face of this worrying situation, I want to ask the Commissioner what measures the Commission is taking to ensure that Member States comply with this legislation - since there is plenty of legislation - in matters of both veterinary and phytosanitary health. Also, are the same measures going to be demanded of third countries and other countries?"
"Mr President, I am pleased to answer this question because it leads on to the Commission's general policy in this area."
"As you will probably know, we have started to review the whole area of meat hygiene and all legislation in this field. Our goal in doing so is as follows: on the one hand, we want to establish clear Community rules governing checks necessary from the beginning of the production chain for a foodstuff right to the consumer's table."
"But in doing so, we want to break new ground with the HACCP system."
"Under this system, private processing companies are involved in the actual checking work, while they in turn are subject to checks by the appropriate authorities, so that the checking work stipulated is also monitored."
"This is the approach on which the FAO has agreed. It is an approach supported by the World Health Organization and I think that we are definitely on the right track here."
"Of course we must ensure that the requirements we are imposing on our own farms and factories also apply to third countries, so that exactly the same criteria are applicable to imports."
"For example, exactly the same system will be required for imports under the bilateral agreement currently being discussed with the USA."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler what advice he has to give to a Member State if the certificates continue to be inaccurate in future, and if in future meat contaminated with salmonella also enters the country, in this case Sweden."
"Is it not the case that it should be every country's natural right to be able to protect itself against products which are harmful to health?"
"What advice does the Commissioner therefore have to offer to Sweden if these inaccurate certificates and contaminated products continue to enter the country?"
"As I have already explained, special arrangements are in place to prevent shipments of meat which do not conform with the special standards applying to Sweden and Finland."
"If shortcomings are discovered when these arrangements are implemented in practice, that is if checks reveal that the consignments being shipped do not comply with the requirements of the directives, it is then open to the country of destination to destroy the consignment in serious cases, or in other cases to decide on an appropriate course of action after contacting the country of origin. The outcome may once again be destruction, or alternatively sending the consignment back."
"With regard to shortcomings which have actually been discovered, especially in shipments of poultry from one Member State in particular, consultation involving that Member State and the Swedish government is currently in progress, and it is hoped that this consultation will yield agreement on how such shortcomings can be avoided in future."
"The parties concerned are expected to reach final agreement on this in the near future."
"Question No 47 by Sören Wibe (H-0210/98)"
"Subject: Salmonella inspections"
"Since joining the EU, Sweden has discovered on several occasions that meat imported from other EU countries has been contaminated with salmonella despite the existence of a certificate from the exporting country stating that the consignment in question was salmonella-free."
"In reply to a written question by myself (P-3933/97) the Commission stated (19 January 1998) that this may be due, among other things, to cases of manipulation or incompatibility between different inspection techniques."
"Is the Commission here seeking to indicate that there are shortcomings in Sweden's inspection arrangements or is it confident that the Swedish tests are entirely accurate?"
"Furthermore, has it analysed this question (i.e. the problems of salmonella infection in meat imported into Sweden) and reached any result?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Wibe has asked for more detail in my reply about certain aspects of Written Question No 3933."
"These issues, like the question just asked by Mrs Schörling, relate to the broader subject of compliance with the additional guarantees given for salmonella in meat during Sweden's and Finland's accession."
"I would first like to describe the checking regime established by the Swedish authorities for imported meat."
"According to our information, meat imported into Sweden from another Member State is checked by the recipient under a self-checking regime."
"Any irregularities in certification are reported to the appropriate authorities."
"The consignments concerned are then officially tested by a laboratory authorized to test for salmonella."
"These tests are quite separate from the routine tests which producers and the appropriate local authorities themselves carry out."
"The sampling method used in all these tests is that prescribed by EU regulations."
"The Swedish authorities have used their own analysis method, known as the Nordic method, whereas the other Member States use the ISO method for checks in the country of origin, as stipulated in the EU regulations."
"Furthermore, the Swedish authorities carried out special monitoring on a trial basis between 1 March and 1 September 1997, in order to check that the supplementary guarantee regime was being correctly applied."
"In all, 569 consignments were tested and salmonellae were found in twelve."
"In addition, according to our information the problems, that is the detection of salmonellae, were mainly with poultry meat, to be specific poultry meat from a particular Member State."
"In such cases Article 8 of the 1989 directive applies. This stipulates that as a first step bilateral discussions such as I have already described must take place between the Member States involved, and these discussions are currently under way."
"As also stipulated in the directive, the Commission is awaiting the outcome of these discussions before taking any further steps."
"With regard to analysis methods, the Council committees responsible are now considering whether the 'Nordic method' can be recognized alongside the ISO method as a reference method, with the objective of allowing the Nordic method to be used throughout the European Union as a second routine method."
"We have just discussed this in the previous question, so perhaps not so many comments are needed."
"It is clear, Mr Commissioner, that in this area we have two different methods."
"In the same consignment using the Swedish method we find salmonella bacteria, while using the other method we do not find any salmonella bacteria."
"Now there are a hundred different ways to make a mistake and not find bacteria where there are bacteria, but there is no way to find bacteria where there are no bacteria."
"In this case these results must clearly point to the fact that of these two methods the Nordic method is superior, because when it is used people clearly find bacteria when the other method fails."
"I interpret the end of your reply to mean that you will also use the Nordic method as a routine measure and that it will at least be given equal status with the current method used under the relevant EU directive."
"Is that a correct understanding of your reply?"
"Let me just explain again exactly what we have in mind and what is now happening in the Council committee responsible. Firstly, under the present system the reference method for the European Union is the ISO method."
"Secondly, the Nordic method has up to now been used in Sweden, and Sweden wants this system to be recognized as a reference method as well."
"There are no doubt certain differences between these two methods, and the aim is to take account of this so that the Nordic method will also be a valid reference method in future."
"That is the objective."
"However, as that is a Council requirement, or rather as it is stipulated in the regime adopted by Council, the Council must consider whether to accept this."
"Until it has done so, should there be any disagreement, that is if a genuine legal dispute should arise, the present directive will apply, and the ISO reference method will prevail."
"Question No 48 by Mark Watts (H-0032/98)"
"Subject: Reform of the common agricultural policy and farm animal welfare"
"Is the Commission in favour of including the need to ensure high standards of health and welfare for farm animals among the principal objectives of a reformed common agricultural policy?"
"Is it also in favour of reforms to encourage mixed farming which will lead to more animals being kept outdoors or, because straw is available from the crops, in good straw-based indoor housing, and reforms to the beef and dairy regimes to discourage over-production of cattle, thereby allowing the European Union to abandon schemes designed to dispose of surplus animals, such as the calf processing aid scheme and export refunds on the export of live cattle to third countries, schemes which are both expensive and cause widespread animal suffering, and reforms to the dairy regime which discourage the pursuit of ever higher yields per cow which lead to serious animal welfare problems?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to emphasise that the Commission intends to take the Protocol on protection and welfare of animals annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam very seriously."
"According to this protocol, and I quote, ' in formulating and implementing the Community's agriculture, transport, internal market and research policies, the Community and the Member States shall pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals' ."
"Of course this protocol also has implications for the future development of the common agricultural policy."
"The most important agricultural policy objectives are, first, to ensure that agricultural production reflects the wishes and requirements of consumers, and, second, to increase the competitiveness of European producers on international markets as well."
"The approach set out in Agenda 2000 in July last year specified that the Commission wishes to improve the competitiveness of European agriculture both within the internal market and on the international market, whilst preventing the formation of new surpluses like the butter or grain mountains of the past."
"Not only does the Commission propose a reorientation of the CAP with less focus on price support and more on direct income support, it also anticipates that production will in future be geared more to consumer demand, both quantitatively and qualitatively."
"This should prevent new surpluses from accumulating and it should therefore also eliminate the need to export surplus beef."
"But market orientation is not just about price."
"It is equally important for consumers that food should be wholesome and of good quality, and that its origin should be clear."
"Animal health and welfare naturally have a part to play here."
"We therefore proposed in Agenda 2000, as part of a new policy for rural areas, that there should be more funds for agroenvironmental measures as a second arm of agricultural policy, and also more funds for animal welfare."
"We hope that this policy too will have a positive effect."
"However, please bear in mind that the Community has already adopted a panoply of animal protection and animal welfare measures, and that the European Union is undeniably doing a good job in this area by international standards."
"These rules are subject to constant monitoring and will be developed further if necessary."
"Regarding transport, measures in this area are concentrated more on improving transport conditions and less on a complete ban on transportation, as transport will always be necessary, whatever happens."
"With a view to improving animal protection for cattle exports, the Council recently approved a proposal which will make the payment of export refunds conditional on compliance with EU animal protection and transport rules."
"The Management Committee on Trade Mechanisms recently approved the corresponding implementing Regulation, so we can now adopt that Regulation."
"I wish to begin by welcoming the Commissioner's clear commitment to taking the protocol very seriously."
"I genuinely thank him for that."
"Secondly, by way of example, perhaps he could comment on whether he would be willing to contemplate schemes to help intensive pig or poultry producers to switch from current intensive methods to extensive methods in the future."
"Would he envisage such a scheme under his reform proposals for the CAP?"
"Finally, whilst I understand what he says about high standards of animal welfare already being regulated by EU legislation, this is not always enforced, as he is aware."
"I give you one example: on 7 April this year we fear that in the Eid-El-Kabir in France the French authorities will not be enforcing the animal welfare regulations he quite rightly points to."
"It is all very well having these regulations but we must surely all work together to ensure they are complied with."
"As Mr Watts said himself, there are two parts to his question."
"Firstly, under the new rural development policy package, investment aid for agricultural holdings will be linked to certain conditions."
"In the two instances you mentioned it will in any case be necessary to observe the relevant minimum animal welfare standards when building new poultry or pig housing or converting old housing."
"Secondly, farmers prepared to convert their existing livestock housing or build new housing in such a way as to appreciably improve animal welfare, will receive more investment support than others."
"Turning to the question of poultry housing in general, a proposal will be presented to the Commission tomorrow in which we report on experience to date with poultry cages and provide for a whole series of measures for improving poultry housing. However, these measures will also have to apply to third countries, because we cannot accept a situation in which we honourably stick to worthy rules and create good conditions, only to find our producers competing with importers producing under quite different and far worse conditions."
"Commissioner, in relation to your answer on animal welfare, which you yourself consider to be closely linked to animal health, I would like to ask whether the Commission does not think it would be a good thing - and necessary - to also extend the measures to protect animal welfare (and therefore animal health) to the process by which animals arrive at the slaughterhouse, when it is necessary to observe appropriate hygiene."
"That would contribute greatly to improving animal health and improving the quality of the hides and therefore, I would say, is the first link in that chain you mentioned in your reply to Mrs Redondo Jiménez."
"The hide is the first link and, at the same time, its quality is essential to the tanners."
"Thank you, Mrs Ferrer."
"Allow me to congratulate you on the skilful way you expressed your question."
"You have the floor, Mr Fischler, to reply to Mrs Ferrer's clever supplementary question."
"Mrs Ferrer, this issue not only relates to your actual question, it also goes somewhat further."
"Firstly, I would like to comment that the developments we are aiming at, and in particular our proposals for reform, should mean that the repeated accusations that we subsidize exports of live cattle to foreign abattoirs will certainly not be true."
"The transport subsidy element has already been eliminated, and there is already a lower subsidy per animal for livestock than for meat export, so that only 10 % of total exports are now in the form of livestock."
"This will apply even more so in the future, and the reduction in price guarantees in particular will enable us virtually to eliminate export subsidies for livestock."
"However, to return to your more specific question about the condition of animals when they arrive at abattoirs, it is certainly not true that all animals reach abattoirs in poor condition."
"Above all, it would not be in the interest of those doing the marketing, as you are quite right in saying that quality suffers when animals arrive in a poor state."
"What interest could marketers possibly have in paying a higher price for poorer quality when animals are delivered?"
"On the other hand, it is true that a number of cases of disease transfer were reported recently in circumstances suggesting that inadequate hygiene was to blame."
"In order to tackle this problem, the Commission - having taken advice from the relevant scientific committees - has decided to amend Directive 433 so as to minimize the risk of contamination of animals on arrival at abattoirs."
"A proposal to this effect is currently being considered at Commission level."
"Since we have now used up the time assigned to Mr Fischler's block of questions, Questions Nos 49 to 61 will be dealt with in writing."
"Mr President, Miss McIntosh, in Agenda 2000, the Commission suggested cutting the number of objectives for Community initiatives and concentrating measures on transnational areas of Community interest, with the aim of preserving or enhancing their innovative character, the value added by the Community, and the role of partnerships."
"Three fields were chosen: cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation; rural development; and human resources, paying special attention to equal opportunities."
"The fact that the Commission has not proposed any new initiative in favour of areas particularly affected by the decline of the armaments industry and the pruning of military bases does not mean that these areas are not to receive support as a matter of principle."
"In fact there is continued scope for assistance under Objective 1, Objective 2 and Objective 3, as well as under the proposed new Community initiatives I have just mentioned."
"Outside the targeted areas, measures for adapting and modernizing education, training and employment systems with a view to improving competitiveness and cushioning socio-economic change are also eligible under the new Objective III."
"While I thank the Commissioner for that response, I have to say I am deeply disappointed."
"In areas like Essex, Suffolk, Yorkshire and Cumbria, substantial job losses through the peace dividend have been suffered in defencerelated industries."
"In particular, if you were to take two towns - Witham and Chelmsford - where the companies of Marconi and EEV operate, the substantial reduction to the workforce is quite worrying."
"What assurance can the Commissioner give me tonight that areas like these, where they have benefited substantially from a programme tailor-made to defence-industry job cuts and training schemes to help those people who have lost their jobs through the peace dividend, will continue to benefit to the same extent as at the moment?"
"That is the question."
"They are going to be competing for a smaller pot of money under three broad objectives with no direct funds for defence cuts."
"I am not in a position to give any answer at all to questions about a specific region and its future level of support, because we have not even agreed the proposals for the new Structural Fund Regulations within the Commission yet, and even then the support system will be far more partnership-oriented, and thus based on both European and national criteria."
"I cannot tell you now what proposals the British government will choose to implement."
"I am afraid I therefore have to disappoint you."
"My constituency has benefited considerably from the KONVER programme."
"The London Boroughs of Hounslow, Ealing and Richmond have all benefited at some time and I am very pleased about that."
"But a problem has arisen which I wonder whether the Commissioner would agree to take on board, in whatever changes and variations are to be made in the future, and it is this: in areas like mine where the population is extremely mobile, it has been very difficult under the rules of KONVER to direct the assistance precisely to the people who have lost their jobs, because many of them have whizzed off to other parts of the country or even abroad to find other employment."
"Local authorities have tried to put forward proposals to reinvigorate the area using KONVER funds to generate more employment, but they have run into difficulties with the existing programme rules."
"I wonder whether we could, in the future, whatever changes are to happen, take on board this difficulty?"
"Yes, I think the Commission's proposals might well solve your problem, because our experience has been that isolated programmes are a lot less successful in structural policy terms than programmes related to regions in a somewhat broader context. That is why we are also planning to have larger regions for Objective 2 areas in future; the programmes would be designed to ensure, as far as possible, that there is a tailor-made option on the spot for people who lose their jobs, with infrastructure and investment dovetailing with training measures for the unemployed."
"Anyway, I am pleased to take your point on board."
"I notice the Commissioner smiling, but it is not the first time we have debated these issues and I will not ask her about any particular region."
"However, I will ask her this about the future of the KONVER programme: if the answer from the Commission is that the areas are going to be eligible under the new Objective 2, we have yet to really understand what the mechanism is going to be which enables them to qualify."
"It seems that the Commission is not minded to have a special arrangement such as it intends to have over Objective 6."
"If I am wrong about that, please tell me."
"If that is not the intention, I still do not understand why there are not going to be transitional phasing-out arrangements for KONVER areas and other Community initiative areas, as there are going to be for Objective 2 areas that fall out of the net."
"If the same need for structural change based on unemployment and low growth exists for Objective 2 areas, why not for the KONVER areas?"
"Finally, 50 % of KONVER areas Europe-wide are not Objective 2 - or other regional fund - eligible areas at the moment."
"Does the Commissioner not agree that there is a special case here for her to study carefully?"
"I know that the European Union cannot clear up all the problems in the Community with Structural Funds money."
"I am also all too well aware that a few changes in the regions can also lead to problems."
"But I hope you will understand that in proposing generous measures for Objective 1, 2 and 5b areas for phasing out regions that will in future no longer be eligible, we really want to do what is necessary to consolidate existing successes."
"Again, I want to make it quite clear that KONVER areas, like all other initiatives, will continue to qualify for Objective 3 funds, that is for the training of the unemployed and people faced with unemployment."
"I assume that in future this could be of real help in precisely this area."
"One last comment. Community initiatives as a whole, as you can see from the utilization rates, have not been as successful as we hoped, which is another reason for integrating such measures."
"The defence industry is also 'industry' , of course."
"As long as the relevant criteria are met, Objective 2 support is also available."
"If these criteria are not satisfied, there is still horizontal Objective 3."
"Question No 63 by Ian White (H-0172/98)"
"Subject: Urban II"
"What are the Commission's rules for the establishment of programme Monitoring Committees, and where are such rules published?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the general provisions on monitoring committees for Structural Fund applications are in Article 25 of amended Council Regulation No 4253/88."
"Implementing rules governing the use of monitoring committees to keep track of programmes carried out under the URBAN initiative are drawn up by the Commission in conjunction with the Member States concerned."
"They are to be found in the Commission decisions granting approval to the individual URBAN programmes."
"I should have listened to the original answer rather than the interpretation but I did not understand where the documentary sources for the rules governing the URBAN programme can be found."
"I will tell you why I am concerned about it."
"It seems to me from reports I have received from interested organizations that there is a degree of anarchy amongst those who wish to apply for URBAN funding."
"Naturally I assumed that there would be rules and regulations governing this."
"What the Commissioner has just said does not appear to give me a source on which I can rely."
"I would like to go to a booklet, to a regulation itself, so that I can decide for my own purposes whether the Member State concerned and the Commission and the United Kingdom are operating on the same basis of an agreed rule book that I can check for myself."
"Is there such a rule book?"
"Is there such a regulation, apart from 25(2) to which you have already referred?"
"The Commission decisions granting approval to individual URBAN programmes also contain the rules for those programmes."
"I will also briefly mention them by name, because I think it is better to talk about specifics than regulation numbers."
"URBAN has Objective 1 and Objective 2 monitoring committees, which are the general monitoring committees for Objective 1 and Objective 2."
"Outside the assisted regions, and this is where Bristol comes in, I understand that there is an independent monitoring committee."
"I have to agree with you that the process is somewhat complicated, as this monitoring committee is advised by the URBAN management committee, which is a sub-committee for monitoring the management of non-Objective areas, and there is also an URBAN partnership group, which brings together local partners and non-governmental organizations."
"I noted that the Commissioner said in her earlier reply that the Community initiatives had not had the success that was hoped."
"But I hope she recognizes that URBAN has provided an ideal opportunity to develop the sort of bottom-up Community initiatives that the Commission has promoted in its economic development plans and has provided a very good vehicle for promoting the Community with the citizens because of its very local, neighbourhood-level focus."
"I hope that in URBAN II that local element will not be lost and will, indeed, be recognized in the monitoring committees, however they are constituted."
"I hope she can reassure us on that point."
"I have to agree with you."
"Even if the utilization rates are not always very encouraging, URBAN is one of the more successful Community initiatives, because it is particularly close to local people and above all because it involves citizens from various local groups and has thus been a strong motivating force."
"There have been no changes in the management process compared with URBAN 1, but it can be taken as read that the positive aspects of URBAN 1 have been incorporated into URBAN 2."
"Because URBAN has been such a success, we want to incorporate assistance for sociallydeprived inner-city areas, the most deprived areas, into mainstream assistance, that is into the new Objective 2."
"This demonstrates that URBAN has paved the way to providing Community assistance for inner-city problems on a larger scale."
"Question No 64 by José Apolinário (H-0173/98)"
"Subject: Application of Interreg II C"
"Can the Commission say what aid was granted via the Community funds to the regions in the Azores, the Algarve and Alentejo which were affected by storms at the end of 1997?"
"How does it account for the proposal to grant financial support via Interreg II C to certain Member States but to withhold it from Portugal?"
"Mr President, Mr Apolinário, the Commission is of course distressed about the storm damage in Portugal, particularly in the Azores, the Algarve and the Alentejo region."
"It therefore declared its willingness to make a transfer of appropriations straight after these catastrophic events."
"When the interim assessment of the Community support framework for Portugal was completed in February, the regions affected were granted further appropriations not as yet committed together with appropriations from the annual indexing, which were prioritized for environmental improvement measures."
"The Commission successfully sought a higher level of appropriations for the reinforcement of the programmes claimed by these three regions than originally proposed by the Portuguese authorities, so that these regions are to receive an additional 73 million ECU instead of the 44 million originally proposed by Portugal."
"It will be recalled that part of the funding available under the Community's INTERREG 2C initiative is intended for regional development measures to prevent floods and combat droughts."
"No Community financing for the prevention of floods was granted to Portugal in 1997/98, because the Portuguese government did not submit an application to that effect."
"On the other hand, a programme to combat drought in Portugal was approved by the Commission on 29 September 1997."
"This programme has an indirect bearing on structural measures to prevent flooding, given that it contributes to improvements in water management and hydrological research, and assists with prospecting for water resources and with improvements in ecological balance."
"The Commission is willing to consider an application by the Portuguese authorities for an INTERREG 2C programme on flooding, within the general guidelines and within the budgetary appropriations already allocated to Portugal."
"Mr President, may I begin by thanking the Commissioner for her answer."
"I agree with her that the priority of the environment and national development planning should be protected."
"I would, however, emphasize that the part of her answer relating to the Portuguese Government is erroneous, in that the Interreg II C allocation of funding clearly states that Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy can apply only in connection with drought, while Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands could make applications in connection with floods."
"This is the point I cannot understand because I feel that the services for which the Commissioner holds political responsibility have adopted an excessively technical approach."
"However, my question relates to the ultra-peripheral regions, and specifically the Azores."
"I would like to know how the Commission intends to act in situations that have unfortunately reoccurred, given that in the future the REGIS initiative will cease to exist, particularly since while the Commission increased its technical justifications, the United States army, for instance, offered cooperation in carrying out the technical restoration of the Ribeiro Quente area."
"It is merely a difference of approach."
"Firstly, as an ultraperipheral region, the Azores will continue to be part of the most heavily assisted group of regions."
"Secondly, I assume that the other regions you mentioned will also continue to receive financial assistance from the European Union."
"The problem with the Structural Funds is that they are not an emergency aid mechanism and that the European Union has abolished emergency aid within Europe."
"So we have no means of offering specific emergency aid."
"However, what we can do in the case of an emergency, and have in fact done in Portugal, is to divert money available under the Community Support Frameworks and to use it for economic regeneration and to mitigate the environmental damage caused by such disasters."
"That is what we have done in this case."
"We certainly need to discuss how INTERREG 2C can be used more in the southern Member States in future to combat flooding."
"I would ask you to remember how long we discussed how to combat droughts effectively, and that despite that neither the Commission nor perhaps the Portuguese government were farsighted enough to incorporate appropriate preventive measures in their plans for INTERREG 2C and Portugal."
"I hope, however, that this will not be needed in the future, and if it is, we should be flexible enough to reconsider our programmes."
"I do believe, however, that the funds we are making available are really an enormous extra help to these regions in coping with the aftermath of the emergencies."
"The Commissioner is quite correct in saying that drought and floods in Portugal and Spain are connected."
"It is well known that the sources of all Portugal's major rivers lie in Spain, and half Portugal's water comes from Spain."
"As the Commissioner knows, all the hydraulic works in progress in Portugal and Spain are being carried out with Community funding."
"And as the Commissioner is also aware, there has been a disagreement, a conflict, between Portugal and Spain in connection with the Spanish hydrological plan."
"I think this could be overcome with common sense, while the intervention of Brussels and the Commission is essential in view of the fact that the funding of hydraulic works in Portugal and Spain comes primarily from Brussels."
"Now that negotiations are resuming, what role do the Commission and the Commissioner intend to play?"
"The Commission normally has no right of say in bilateral negotiations, not only because of subsidiarity, but also because in the interests of sovereignty Member States do not normally welcome Commission poking its nose into things that Member States can sort out better themselves."
"However, we have not been mere bystanders here."
"For example, we financed a joint Spanish/Portuguese study to get the facts on their common water resources."
"Furthermore, when authorization for the dam was being sought, we took the opportunity to ensure that joint water management was proposed as part of the plans to ensure that sufficient water of acceptable quality reached the dam."
"I assume that the authorization and the precautions taken were helpful in this respect."
"Vessels carrying dangerous goods"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0069/98), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a Council Directive amending Directive 93/75/EEC concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods (Rapporteur: Mr Novo Belenguer) (C4-0621/97-96/0231(SYN)."
"Madam President, the report we are going to debate this evening is the second reading under the cooperation procedure and refers to the proposal to amend the directive on the minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods."
"To briefly review the process described in the report, I should first mention that in April 1997 this Parliament approved eleven amendments in first reading. These could be divided into three main groups."
"The first group reinforced the requirements for information to be provided by the operators of vessels transporting radioactive goods."
"The second group concerned measures designed to extend the requirements of this Directive (93/75/EEC) to ships in transit through Community waters."
"Finally, the third group involved amendments to the directive's annexes."
"The Commission and the Council accepted the amendments allowing the inclusion within the directive of future amendments to the international code on irradiated nuclear fuel, and concerning the obligation on vessel operators to supply a list of crew members to the port authority in advance, in case of any possible accident."
"The report we are currently debating and will vote on tomorrow proposes three things: firstly, to bring Directive 93/75/EEC up to date, by requesting the inclusion of certain maritime transport safety requirements, especially with respect to irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-level radioactive waste; secondly, to increase the amount of information to be supplied when transporting these types of goods; and lastly, to facilitate future amendment of the directive's annexes, by simple recourse to the committee procedure, in order to bring national regulations into line with established international regulations on maritime safety."
"In this respect, the present report proposes four amendments, which were all approved almost unanimously by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"We propose a change in the wording of the Council text. The new text is wider and more general - at least that is how we interpret it - and expresses our concern about the advisory committee being able to make significant or substantial changes to the directive."
"Amendment No 4, which refers to paragraph 2 of Article 1, is directly related to the one I have just mentioned, and aims to prevent subsequent modifications to the directive weakening the existing provisions for safety and the protection of the marine environment."
"In other words, we are introducing a minimum to prevent the guarantees which the directive itself recognizes from being weakened in any way."
"Our second amendment refers to Article 1. In it we propose that the INF Code defined in the directive should be the updated version, as in force on 1 January 1998 rather than 1996."
"Our reason is that apart from being much more recent and up-to-date, in November 1997 the International Maritime Organization adopted some amendments to strengthen the Code, and not to include them by that date would provide the advisory committee with a motive for amending the directive."
"The third amendment repeats a proposal we made at the report's first reading."
"Specifically, we request that when vessels of the type referred to in the report are in transit through a Member State's waters, it should be compulsory to notify the authorities of that state of the contents of Annex 1."
"Furthermore, Madam President, as regards the content of this report, I think this proposal is appropriate and advisable, although we hope the provisions can also be applied to vessels in transit."
"We must bear in mind that in effect this system is covered by the 1993 EUROREP proposal, but it has made hardly any progress."
"So in view of the difficulty of changing this directive's approach, we suggest that the Commission, if it sees fit, should withdraw that original EUROREP proposal and present a new one, to include the legislative changes which have been made and approved by the International Maritime Organization."
"I am just finishing, Madam President, and I hope the honourable Members will bear these amendments in mind when it comes to the vote on my report tomorrow. What we are requesting is the implementation of a series of Community regulations, to try - among other things - to improve maritime safety and protect the marine environment for future generations."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at second reading we are concerned today with the minimum requirements for ships which are using the Community's ports and carrying dangerous or environmentally harmful goods."
"I think we are dealing here with an extremely important subject, which causes people to react once something has happened."
"The aim of our legislation is to ensure that there will never be a catastrophic accident, or if an accident should occur, that possible damage is kept to a minimum, so that the people are not preoccupied with this subject."
"I think there has rarely been a better starting point for European legislation."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur explicitly for dealing so seriously with this subject, both at first reading and now at second reading."
"The Group of the European People's Party shares the rapporteur's view."
"We support all the amendments tabled, especially the request that appropriate information is also made available about ships which transport dangerous goods, do not use EU ports, but which do sail through the territorial waters of the European Union."
"It is not just a question of accidents associated with the entering or leaving of ports but of the broadest possible measures to avert risks, even if it is only territorial waters which are affected, because experiences in recent years show that there really can be problems on European soil without a ship having initially entered a European port."
"I would therefore strongly urge the Commission to take up this matter of concern."
"We are unfortunately only at the cooperation stage."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam is not yet in force, otherwise we would be more deeply involved in the legislative process."
"I therefore request that you really do take up this matter, so that we can find a solution to the benefit of all the people in Europe."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for dealing with a sensitive and difficult issue."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for continuing to resist the pressures of the Council and the Commission, which may have endorsed some amendments, ladies and gentlemen, but which endorsed the insignificant amendments."
"The essential amendments which you had proposed and which we had voted on during the first reading were not endorsed."
"I am also very pleased that the matter has been raised again. We will support these amendments since it is clear that the Council and the Commission have forgotten (or rather, do not wish to remember) that nuclear waste is not simply a question of protecting the environment, it is a question of laundering black money."
"It is also, under certain conditions, a question of certain nuclear waste, after it has been enriched with plutonium, being used for other purposes, Mr Commissioner, for military purposes. So the Commission and the Council should not only have accepted the rapporteur's original amendments, which imposed strict conditions for the control and safety of such loads, but the Council should have proposed even stricter conditions."
"You all know very well what is happening with the trade in nuclear waste."
"I am talking about the trade in nuclear waste by countries of the former Soviet Union. And you all know very well that this nuclear waste goes to certain countries which, as we discovered, are a danger to their neighbours, and in which we decided to intervene either in the guise of NATO or in I do not know what other guise."
"It is our opinion that we supplied them with this nuclear waste because we had not imposed conditions of control and safety."
"Madam President, I would first like to remind people that the Green Group in the European Parliament considers it highly positive that this directive has been proposed to amend the earlier Directive 93/75/EEC, to incorporate into the scope of the old directive the conditions for the transportation of nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-level radioactive waste on board ships."
"This is certainly a positive fact, just as we believe the rest of the directive to be positive."
"However, we believe Parliament's proposals are serious and credible, which is why we do not agree with the Council amendments which fail to include them."
"For these reasons, we believe all the amendments proposed by the rapporteur should be firmly maintained, particularly Amendment No 3 because we believe it is of vital importance that ships in transit through our waters should inform us of the presence of toxic or radioactive substances on board even if they are not stopping in a Community port."
"This is very important for the future of our seas and for the ecology and health of our peoples."
"Commissioner, this recommendation we are debating, which is attempting to fix minimum requirements for vessels carrying dangerous goods and entering port within the European Union, is experiencing a situation which is all too common. That is, on the one hand the Commission makes efforts to ensure that Community legislation is obeyed - in this case concerning maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment - but on the other hand, some Member States do their own thing completely."
"In view of this situation, Commissioner, we support the Commission."
"As has been said, this really is an extremely important matter."
"For example, passenger transport should be incompatible with the transport of dangerous goods, or it should be compulsory to present a passenger safety certificate."
"Let us not forget, ladies and gentlemen, that we are talking about highly dangerous substances, such as irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium or high-level radioactive waste, which persist in many cases - and I am not exaggerating - for more than 30 000 years, which is really saying something."
"So there is an enormous responsibility to the future."
"And if due attention is being paid to the risks of transporting these substances by road - another terrestrial mode of transport - the same should be done with maritime transport."
"For all those reasons, we are going to support the amendments presented by Mr Novo Belenguer, the rapporteur, and we congratulate him on them."
"Madam President, I would simply like to say that I agree with the rapporteur's amendments but I would like to underline another aspect of the problem. The Council publishes directives and regulations which are not implemented by the Member States."
"A classic case of this is the report that we are debating today."
"I have to say that Directive 93/75/EEC, amended by the new Commission proposal, has not yet been incorporated into the body of law of four Member States, including Great Britain, which currently holds the presidency of the European Council and the Council of Ministers."
"At international level, the IMO decisions have not been incorporated into internal law by a large majority of Member States."
"We must, however, protest against this state of affairs, at least within the European Union. In this debate and tomorrow's vote, when the rapporteur's amendments are voted on, we must show that the Council and the Member States themselves cannot endorse and publish directives and then, at a national level, fail to incorporate them."
"It is not about the safety of maritime transport per se ; rather, it is about the safety of the population of our planet. For that reason, we all need to show sensitivity to each other at all times."
"Madam President, the House is certainly considering an important piece of legislation here on the maritime transport of dangerous goods."
"I wish to begin by saying that I am naturally very pleased that, in its common position, the Council endorsed those amendments of Parliament which were accepted by the Commission at the first reading debate."
"I must also say that the Commission shares the concerns underlying the second reading amendments that have been adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Amendment No 2, for instance, proposes reference to the version of the INF Code that has been in force since 1 January this year, instead of that in force on 1 January 1996."
"The Commission welcomes this useful proposal, which embraces the amendments to the Code adopted by the IMO Assembly last November."
"The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4, which states that changes to the annexes adopted through the committee procedure shall not weaken safety of maritime protection provisions."
"I can reassure Members of this House that the Commission, which has the right of initiative under the committee procedure, would not submit any proposal which weakens its own initial legislation."
"The Commission can understand, in principle, the concern behind Amendment No 1, which aims to clarify the scope of the committee procedure, notably in the light of Amendment No 4."
"However, the Commission cannot accept this amendment for two reasons."
"Firstly, it repudiates the express provision which reaffirms that ships in transit cannot be brought within the scope of this directive."
"The text was added by the Council in its common position, and in the light of the pending proposal on EUROREP, accepted by the Commission."
"Secondly, this amendment is, in any case, unnecessary because the existing common position text already states that amendments adopted through the committee procedure shall not alter the requirements of the directive."
"This applies equally to any weakening or broadening of the scope of the directive."
"Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 3, which introduces notification requirements for vessels in transit off the coast of Member States."
"As I said at the first reading, the provisions of the proposed EUROREP directive makes the amendment redundant and, for reasons of consistency and coherence, therefore, the Commission maintains its position."
"I know that the rapporteur fully understands this position, since he set it out in his own report."
"I would ask him, therefore, to consider again withdrawing his support for the amendment since I can assure him that the Commission shares his views."
"We are consequently examining the options in order to ensure that discussions resume in Council, if necessary, on the basis of a modified version of the EUROREP proposal."
"This is a view shared by Mr Ferber and Mr Kaklamanis."
"We share the view expressed by them on this particular point."
"To sum up: the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 and 4 but cannot accept Nos 1 and 3."
"I wish to thank the House, in particular Mr Novo Belenguer and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for their consistent support for the proposal."
"I would like to say to Mr Camisón Asensio and Mr Sarlis that there have been some significant delays in the transposition of this particular original directive but infringement proceedings are proceeding: there are four proceedings at present for nonconformity of national measures, and we look forward to an early solution, in the legal sense, dealing with these matters."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Statistical returns on carriage of goods by road"
"The next item is the report (A4-0072/98) by Mr Bazin, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the draft Council Regulation on statistical returns in respect of carriage of goods by road (COM(97)0443 - C4-0514/97-97/0233(CNS))."
"Madam President, I trust you will excuse Mr Bazin's absence owing to the regional elections in France, and that you will appreciate that Mr Bazin has been granted the opportunity refused to Mr de Silguy to stand as a candidate for the beautiful region of Brittany."
"We would all like to wish him the greatest success."
"Statistics are essential for transport."
"Therefore we have not only to collect the statistics but, more especially, we have to deal with them in a way that is consistent throughout the Community."
"To be more exact, the Commission made a proposal whereby the statistics on road transport are brought more into line in the different Member States."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism submitted two amendments."
"Or rather, Mr Bazin did so with our full support."
"Therefore it is not too difficult for me to stand in for him here tonight."
"Mr Bazin's report is not just a technical report."
"Because we are moving in the European Union towards a durable mobility we have to know exactly what our transporters are doing and where they go to and from in the Community."
"This is going to be a more difficult task with the rivalry of the free internal market and, more specifically, this year with the arrival of free cabotage."
"When we look at the statistics of road transport it will be more difficult to tell whether lorries with foreign licence plates - from countries other than the country to where they transport goods - are engaged in local transport or international transport."
"Inevitably short-haul transport will, for the main part, take place by road."
"Nowadays, more than three-quarters of Community transport is carried by road."
"Transport is growing by about 7 % to 10 % per year."
"That means that if we want to move to other modes of transport - as Members from all groups want - such as rail, inland waterway or short sea transport, we will still have to reckon with the fact that short-haul transport is being carried out by road."
"Therefore, if we want to move from one modality of transport to another, we have to know exactly which transportation is intermodal and which is solely road transport."
"We need a more precise system."
"Commissioner, you know better than anyone else, since you deal with the social side of transport as well, that the reports we get from the Commission on the driving and rest hours are worse than we expected them to be."
"We have just received the reports from 1993/94 which show that several Member States do not even have those statistics."
"That is a great failing."
"One of the Member States that did not supply its statistics is one of the founding members of the European Community."
"Fifty years should be enough to bring them into line."
"We count on the Commission to do its utmost to put these things in order."
"In the meantime, realizing that most of the work is going to be done by the national statistical offices, thanks to the Committee on Budgets we have tabled an amendment which slightly lowers the amount of money available."
"Madam President, let me begin by thanking Mr Bazin, who is himself absent, for the work he has put into this report."
"The intention of the proposal is to round off the annual harmonized statistical data for the carriage of goods by road to ensure the availability of information for the monitoring and evaluation of the common policy."
"The regions of origin and destination will be recorded in the same way for journeys between Member States as for those within them."
"The legislation will also cover cabotage which will now be possible within the Union."
"For this there will be a codification of regions of origin and destination and of the distance travelled."
"Of course, there always have to be statistics to some extent."
"Nevertheless, I think that each time this kind of proposal and this kind of issue comes up there is reason to question whether it is really necessary, since it involves new information having to be submitted, and therefore additional bureaucracy."
"It is always companies, often small companies, which have to submit this information."
"Far too much of this is already an unnecessary burden being placed on companies around the Union, which has resulted in the difficult situation in which enterprise currently finds itself."
"However, there are two positive things in this context."
"One is that no special European bureau of statistics is to be set up just for this business. Responsibility for this extra work will fall to the statistical services of the Member States."
"The other is that the regulation expressly exempts small vehicles."
"That means that vehicles with payloads of up to 3.5 tonnes or maximum permissible laden weights of up to 6 tonnes are excluded."
"The reason for this is that these kinds of journeys are often local journeys for own-account transport."
"Both these exceptions are positive."
"Still, there is reason to question what would actually have happened if we had not got a regulation like this."
"A constant criticism is increasingly being made of the EU, a criticism about bureaucracy and excessive information being required of companies."
"I think we need to understand that every time a new proposal like the one we are to decide on here is put forward, however worthy the intention, it increases bureaucracy and paperwork in a Europe whose companies already have far too much of it."
"Madam President, as the House will know, the relevant 1978 and 1989 directives enabled the Community to develop a set of basic statistics on the carriage of goods by road and they have proved very useful in framing and developing the common transport policy."
"Several developments have taken place in Community policies, however, making it necessary for us to improve our system of compiling statistics on road transport."
"That is particularly true of the changes relating to the liberalization of cabotage from 1 July 1998 to the development of the trans-European networks and to advances in environmental policy."
"Against that background, as the House will be aware, this new regulation will establish a more up-to-date statistical system which is based on a list of variables geared to existing information needs, particularly in regional policy and environmental policy, on the collection and transmission to Eurostat of data on individual vehicles and journeys."
"This will allow much more detailed analysis than in the past and it will facilitate the essential monitoring, fine-tuning and understanding of relationships between different policy outcomes."
"The new regulation could obviously impose additional statistical reporting obligations on some transport businesses."
"I would stress that Eurostat has made every effort to minimize any extra burdens by making provisions for the statistics to be compiled by sample surveys on a small proportion of road vehicles and for modern computerized techniques to be used for transmitting data wherever that reduces the administrative burden."
"The similarity of the approach taken by Mr Bazin, the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Commission happily means that I can readily accept both the amendments."
"I therefore thank Mr Bazin and his colleagues for their support and for their great help in these efforts to develop changes which will make for greater transparency and more efficient operation of the statistical system."
"I can readily accept Mr Wijsenbeek's point that statistics are essential for transport and should be consistent."
"Madam President, unfortunately the Commissioner, who is not responsible for transport as such but who is responsible for the social side of transport, has not made any helpful comment on my request that all those Member States who did not hand in their statistics on driving and resting hours - which I would say are the complement to the statistics on road transport as such, or which are part and parcel of it - will be improved, especially by those Member States who do not hand them in at all."
"Madam President, to respond very briefly to the honourable Member, this particular point is not relevant to the Eurostat situation, it is a matter for a DG VII question."
"Perhaps the matter can be taken up there and hopefully he will get a suitable response."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Injury prevention - rare diseases - pollution-related diseases - health protection - Alzheimer's"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports and oral questions:"
"Report (A4-0067/98) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action from 1999 to 2003 on injury prevention in the context of the framework for action in the field of public health (COM(97)0178 - C4-0229/97-97/0132(COD)); -Report (A4-0074/98) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action 1999-2003 on rare diseases in the context of the framework for action in the field of public health (COM(97)0225 - C40236/97-97/0146(COD)); -Report (A4-0075/98) by Mr Cabrol, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action 1999-2003 on pollution-related diseases in the context of the framework for action in the field of public health (COM(97)0266 - C4-0276/97-97/0153(COD)); -Report (A4-0022/98) by Mrs Flemming, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the second report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the integration of health protection requirements in Community policies (COM(96)0407 - C4-0663/96); -Oral question by Mr Poggiolini, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to the Commission (B4-0170/98 - O-0018/98) on the Community programme to combat Alzheimer's disease and related syndromes; -Oral question by the following Members: Gutiérrez Díaz, González Álvarez, Papayannakis and Ojala, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United Left - Nordic Green Left, to the Commission (B4-0171/98 - O-0027/98) on the Community programme of research into and prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease; -Oral question by Mr Kouchner and Mrs Lalumière, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, to the Commission (B4-0172/98 - O-0040/98) on combating Alzheimer's disease; -Oral question by Mr Cabrol, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, to the Commission (B4-0173/98 - O-0050/98) on Alzheimer's disease; -Oral question by the following Members: McKenna, Lannoye, Breyer and Tamino, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, to the Commission (B4-0266/98 - O-0066/98) on Alzheimer's disease."
"Madam President, most of us have often been in danger of being injured or have actually been injured during our day-to-day activities or in our free time."
"We therefore have a lot of experience to go on."
"Unfortunately, such injuries happen all too frequently."
"Indeed, together with suicides and self-inflicted injuries, they contribute significantly to our annual death rate."
"This proposal is therefore very timely, and the programme for the prevention of and reduction in the number of deaths must be adopted."
"Today in the European Union the injuries covered by the present programme are one of the most basic causes of death, damage to health and disablement."
"They are mainly due to accidents in the home or during leisure time."
"The most vulnerable are those between 1 and 34 years of age, and people over 75."
"The need to address the problem initially led the Community to create a scheme of research and information, the EHLASS scheme."
"Recent statistics provided by the scheme point to an annual death rate from accidents of 83 000 with approximately 22 million people injured each year, 20 million of whom require medical assistance, and 2 million of whom need hospital treatment."
"We must also point out that approximately 300 000 of those who are injured will be disadvantaged for the rest of their lives or will have health problems at some point."
"The second category of injuries results from suicides, which must not be overlooked, since they account for the deaths of 43 000 people and for injuries to around 700 000 people each year."
"The direct financial cost of treatment is ECU 7.7 billion, while the total cost of injuries amounts to ECU 23 billion, which does not include the cost resulting from deaths."
"The need for a programme of prevention and epidemiological monitoring of injuries at a European Union level is all too evident."
"It remains for us to examine whether the programme, as it has been formulated, is effective."
"The Commission identified particular areas as spheres of action, such as accidents to children at school and suicides, with intentional self-inflicted injuries as a sub-category."
"However, there is no reason to exclude other age groups, such as for example adults who injure themselves in the home or during their free time."
"It would also be a good idea to include injuries caused by the actions of a third person and those arising from cases of people who attempt to injure themselves."
"For this reason, it is proposed that a distinction be made between a) intentional and unintentional injuries, with special reference to vulnerable categories, and b) suicides and self-inflicted injuries."
"Moreover, we must include in the vulnerable categories those women who, with their children, receive injuries as a result of violence."
"In parallel, there must be action on behalf of those injured as a result of violence during sports events."
"With an epidemiological study, injuries and suicides could be recorded and analysed statistically, over time, and according to age group and category. As a result, the causes will become clear and subsequent actions will be based upon the findings of the analyses."
"The programme consequently focuses on the possibility of collating and processing all the relevant data."
"Such a scheme, the EHLASS scheme, already exists and has yielded results, on the one hand pinpointing certain products which are implicated in accidents and, on the other, undertaking information and awareness campaigns."
"Unfortunately the Commission did not incorporate this scheme into its proposal, although it would be very useful in achieving the goals of the programme."
"For this reason I regard it as imperative that the EHLASS scheme be incorporated into the programme and that it form the basis for the development of actions with regard to both intentional and unintentional injuries. Moreover, the scheme should be expanded and coordinated with other networks that may ensue."
"With regard to suicides and self-inflicted injuries, a different system of collating and processing information is needed, and intervention actions require a different approach."
"The reason is that the causes of suicides and the necessary preventive measures are completely different from those of accidental injuries."
"The only common features are the injuries, the deaths, the treatments and the financial burden."
"The programme being created must address itself to the challenge posed by the problem."
"The Commission is proposing only ECU 1.3 million for 1999 and I regard this as totally inadequate in relation to the aims of the programme."
"For this reason it is proposed that the financial framework for 1999-2003 should comprise ECU 14 million."
"We believe that this programme, as changed by our amendments, will play a fundamental role in protecting the health of the citizens of Europe, by significantly reducing the number of deaths and the financial losses caused by the injuries to which it refers."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the action programme on rare diseases which we are here to debate is part of the Community action in the public health sector. This is a sector in which it is the EU's duty to adopt preventative and protective measures in the interests of all its citizens, not only when fighting great scourges but also in cases of very small numbers of people affected by uncommon, or even rare, disease conditions."
"In fact, it is in a context such as rare diseases that Community action becomes more necessary than ever."
"In most Member States there are usually too few cases of rare diseases for them to be considered a priority from the health point of view, and they are often neglected."
"The concept of ""rare diseases' covers more than 5 000 different diseases or conditions that do not have a common definition."
"The problems of classification raise difficulties with regard to the recognition, identification, treatment and prevention of such diseases."
"The five-year programme planned for 1999-2003 provides for a series of actions in three key sectors: information on rare diseases, favouring the establishment of a European database; promotion and reinforcement of patient support groups; and progress in the creation of response groups for clusters of rare diseases."
"The financial allocation proposed by the Commission amounts to ECU 1.3 million for 1999, while funding for the four subsequent years will be determined later, based on the financial prospects."
"I would like to draw your attention to this point before continuing with the presentation of this programme."
"There is doubt as to whether the Commission has any intention of adopting an effective action programme on rare diseases."
"But how can we think of proposing actions and implementing projects if the minimum financial resources are not available?"
"So it is better to devote ourselves to other initiatives and make better use of the resources available."
"Although we need to do something specific to try to help a section of the EU population that is suffering and whose quality of life is compromised (both patients and their families), we need to start from serious premises."
"The proposed budget is meaningless."
"By way of information, I recall that in the last three years the USA has allocated a good $ 3.2 million to the operation of the rare diseases database and France alone has spent 3 million francs in the first year of operation of its database on orphan drugs."
"For all these reasons, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection voted in favour of a financial allocation of ECU 14 million to implement the rare diseases programme, to be spread over five years, to enable the programme not to be purely symbolic."
"In making a more thorough assessment of the action programme in question, one aspect of prime importance which must be taken into account is international cooperation: the coordination of Community activities with those of the competent national and international organizations allows the work to be rationalized, useless duplication to be avoided, and the time required to achieve the pre-established objectives to be reduced."
"One further essential point of the programme relates to information."
"The establishment of a Community database listing diseases, symptoms, causes and available treatments is fundamental."
"One further aspect to which I would like to draw your attention is that of the definition of clusters, as indicated by the Committee in its proposal."
"The definition is certainly not unambiguous. For the sake of greater clarity, I would specify that a so-called cluster can be defined as any irregular increase in the incidence of a rare disease and that, as such, it requires rapid control measures."
"For that purpose, it is therefore advisable to promote the creation of a system of monitoring and controlling rare diseases, permitting a fast and effective reaction and enabling rare diseases to be identified, assessed and treated."
"I would also like to add a couple of words about committee procedure."
"Considering the peculiarity of the case, the consultative committee may have two representatives from each Member State, provided one of them belongs to a patient support group."
"Finally, allow me to make one last comment on the need to coordinate and rationalize the arguments at Community level."
"The Commission must undertake to coordinate the work on rare diseases currently being conducted by three Directorates-General: DG V, DG III and DG XII."
"The action programme on rare diseases, regulations on orphan drugs and the research programme on rare diseases are closely linked and require a consistent overall approach."
"The adoption of this programme is a step forward towards a better knowledge and understanding of rare diseases and enables sufferers to escape from the marginalization and isolation they find themselves in, offering them therapeutic, moral and psychological support."
"Moreover, the commitment to research into rare diseases could also lead to specific discoveries to help with the treatment of some of the far more common diseases which have not yet been eradicated and affect large sections of the population."
"In this case, the benefit to the whole of society would certainly not be questioned."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very important document from the Commission."
"It is well written, serious, clear and concise and highlights the priorities which we also stressed in Amendments Nos 1 and 2."
"Unfortunately however its impact is limited because it only deals with the issue of respiratory illnesses linked to air pollution."
"We fully understand the criteria which have led the Commission to choose diseases indisputably linked to obvious individual pollutants - those pollutants with the worst noxious effects and which are most easily prevented, and pollution where Community action is likely to complement insufficient action by Member States."
"We have three main comments arising from this communication."
"Firstly, we believe it is important to broaden the communication's sphere of activity, and here I would refer you to our Amendments Nos 4, 11 and 12."
"As regards air pollution, and without wishing to detract from the role of traffic-related pollutants, the noxious effects of tobacco must be emphasized both to the smoker and to his or her companions - in other words the passive smoking effect. A large part of the population does not fully appreciate the dangers involved."
"In addition, water pollution passes on infections and poisons; food pollution causes infections and poisoning, as noted in Amendment No 16; homes are polluted thanks to asbestos or paints and especially lead - which can be highly poisonous, as can the smell of certain paints and glues. We will not harp on about pollution of the upper layers of the atmosphere destroying the protective ozone layer and resulting in an increased risk of skin cancer, as observed in Australians of northern European origin."
"My second comment concerns the type of action which the Commission aims to implement in order to reduce the extent of pollution-related diseases."
"Naturally the Commission does not seek to combat pollutant emission directly since this phenomenon has been the subject of other directives on air, water and soil pollution, amongst others. In the present case, the Commission intends to act in a very different way, in four main areas: persuading the Member States to find out about the nature of the pollutants (and we would highlight our Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 13 in this context); compiling a register of pollutants; identifying them and evaluating their often serious consequences on health (both disease and allergies); and collecting relevant and comparable data so as to avoid confusion between the different terms which may be used by the Member States to refer to the same product or the same illness - this is the line we take in Amendment No 3."
"Finally, the Commission would like every Member State to inform its citizens about the dangers of pollution, to ensure that people are clear about it."
"We cover this in Amendments Nos 9 and 10. It must be made clear to people that zero risk is not possible, that the dangers are not always those presented complacently by the media, but that certain personal habits - and I stress tobacco again - can be much more dangerous."
"The Commission envisages the evaluation and monitoring of the recommended actions."
"We fully support this proposal and would highlight Amendment No 6 in this respect."
"Our third and last comment concerns the budgetary basis for these measures."
"The current communication only allows for a budget of ECU 1.3 million for 1999 and does not provide any details of subsequent funding, although the Commission has been heard to promise ECU 1.3 million for the programme for the next five years, in other words a total of ECU 6.5 million."
"We therefore oppose the amendments which would limit the duration of the programme, as we cannot imagine the Commission would allocate the same sum for three years as it would for five."
"In any case, we consider this amount insufficient which is why we are emphasizing Amendment No 5 which provides for a larger sum."
"It goes without saying that a much larger budget will be needed if we really wish to combat pollution-related diseases, even in terms of the actions presented by the Commission in this communication."
"So, Madam President, we would ask all the Members of the European Parliament to vote in favour of these amendments which were approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
". (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there has already been in this House a report on the health protection requirements and a quite outstanding opinion was delivered by Parliament on the subject."
"The Commission's second report also appears to me to be excellent, so that as a result I found the task I was given to be very difficult."
"In addition, there is the fact that in the area of health, in particular, the matter of breach of the subsidiarity principle constantly hovers over one's head."
"Permit me, despite these short remarks, to make a few critical points on this report by the Commission."
"That agriculture makes a quite decisive contribution to the health of the population is undisputed."
"Nevertheless, the Commission's statements here remain general and, in my opinion, incomplete."
"Related to this, of course, is nutrition."
"The Commission's statements on this do not correspond at all with the significance of this area in current health policy."
"I should like to cordially request that in the next report, which will be available very soon, the Commission pays particular attention to this area."
"Likewise I expect a statement from the Commission on the situation regarding vitamins and mineral products within the EU, before legislative measures are proposed here."
"As long as we express ourselves in such a general way in terms of health, we can always expect everybody to be of one mind."
"But as soon as we are specific, then the harmony rapidly disappears."
"Let me illustrate this with point 10 of my report on the subject of tobacco."
"We all know that tobacco is harmful to people's health; lung cancer, circulatory and heart diseases, cancer of the larynx, cancer of the tongue, cancer of the stomach and of the intestine are very frequently the scientifically proven consequence."
"We all know that the nicotine from tobacco is addictive and we all want to protect young people from becoming involved with this drug."
"Each of us has his own ideas as to how this can best be achieved."
"It is only on how to reach this common goal that we are not at all in agreement."
"Many believe that simply banning the advertising of tobacco will solve the problem."
"Well, I share the opinion of those who believe that if a product is so dangerous that it should not be advertised, it would be much better not to produce it in the first place, nor buy it, nor sell it."
