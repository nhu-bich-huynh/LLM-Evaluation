"There are two distinct categories of contract agents."
"One category of contract agent was created to perform tasks which are non-core and which do not necessarily need to be performed by an official."
"Such contract agents can be offered permanent contracts so their tasks can be considered as permanent in nature."
"The spirit of Directive 1999/70/EC is followed for such staff as they are generally offered a first contract for a fixed term, an extension for a fixed term and a third contract for an indefinite period."
"In some cases a permanent contract can be offered directly upon recruitment."
"There are currently around 2 300 such contract agents working for the Commission around the world, mainly in delegations, representations and administrative offices."
"A second category of contract agents exists to cover temporary or specialist needs not covered by existing posts, and to substitute staff temporarily absent, among others on maternity or parental leave."
"By limiting to three years the maximum total duration of successive, fixed-term employment contracts in any one institution, the staff regulations give de facto effect to clause 5(1)(b)."
"Such contract agents represent approximately 15% of the total staff."
"It is clear that permanent officials are the mainstay of the Commission staff."
"Contract agents provide valuable support on a temporary basis to the work of Commission officials."
"There are currently around 3 200 such contract agents working for the Commission in its different sites."
"(EL) Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"May I also ask him whether in the case of contract agents, or auxiliary staff as they were once known, the previous years of employment will count as years of service?"
"If this is so, do their previous years of service count for more in a competition for a job than the qualifications of other applicants who have succeeded in the competition but as yet remain unappointed?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Of course, the contract agents' relationship with the employer is based on the contract which, at the same time, must be in accordance with laws and the labour market in these places, so there is no seniority system as we have in the case of permanent officials."
"Therefore, this is a contract which is based on the conditions on the labour market and we have successfully recruited a lot of good contract agents."
"(DE) Commissioner, I am sure you understand that the way the staffing of the European Union develops in future is a great challenge for us."
"Therefore it is very important to Parliament that we are told not only the number of employees and recruitment offices - for I believe you have described these employees as full-time equivalents - but also the exact amounts that are planned for each of the categories and how they are distributed between the countries."
"Could you provide us with those statistics?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Pension rights and the pension system are, of course, one of the most complicated things in all Europe."
"First of all, it should be mentioned that the 2007 budget provides for 23 198 posts for the Commission."
"This question contains two sub-questions: on the action taken by the Commission in terms of recruitment in order to limit the implications of the growing number of EU officials on the budget and on the impact of the growing number of EU officials on pension costs."
"For the first sub-question, it must be recalled that the reform of the Staff Regulations was put in place in 2004, inter alia, in order to curtail budgetary costs linked to the increase in institution staff."
"The new career and promotion structure and the new staff category of contractual agents were introduced with a view to having a positive impact on the budget."
"On the other hand, the honourable Member might be aware that, during the 2007 budgetary procedure, the European Parliament asked the Commission to carry out a substantive screening exercise providing a mid-term evaluation of its staff needs and a detailed report on the Commission's staffing for support and coordination functions."
"The European Parliament also wanted to be informed about the Commission's intentions concerning staff redeployment to address the priorities of the new Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and, more particularly, those policies supported by Parliament during the negotiations."
"As a result of the screening of the Commission's human resources carried out at the request of the European Parliament, the Commission confirms the need identified in 2002 and 2005 for additional staff exclusively in relation to enlargement-related tasks: 890 new staff for 2008, broken down as 640 new staff for EU-10 enlargement and 250 posts for EU-2 enlargement."
"For 2009, there is a confirmed need for a last wave of 250 posts for EU-2 enlargement."
"The Commission endorses the decision to maintain stable staffing once all enlargement-related personnel are integrated, with no requests for new posts for the period 2009-2013."
"The Commission commits to meet new staffing needs in key policy areas exclusively through redeployment within and between departments."
"The Commission is committed to delivering the highest standards of value for money to the citizens it serves, delivering high quality service through increased efficiency."
"The Commission has already shown its commitment to these goals in practice."
"Over the period 2000-2007, figures show that the increase of establishment plan posts within the Commission is lower than in the other institutions."
"For the second sub-question, it should be noted that the recruitment for the period 2004-2008 due to enlargement will only have an effect on the pension costs in 30 years, meaning that, in the near future, enlargement will have no impact on pension costs."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is extremely attentive to the growth of pension costs in the coming years."
"In the budget pension costs were expected to increase by 10% in 2008."
"This is due to exceptional circumstances."
"The higher-than-average increase in 2008 is a normal rebound after the lower-than-average increases for both 2006 and 2007."
"There will be the first round of departures of contract agents, whose contribution will have to be transferred to another scheme, and 3% annual expected increase of salaries and pensions."
"Even with this exception, we estimate that the growth rate of pensions for the 2007-2013 period is compatible with an 8.5% average increase in expenditure taken into account for the 2007-2013 financial framework."
"Concerning the long-term financial effects of the current wave of recruitments, the impact was analysed when preparing the reform of the Staff Regulations."
"Measures have been taken to reduce the pension costs and the Staff Regulations require that the pension contribution rate paid by the employees, currently 10.25%, is updated yearly so that it corresponds to one-third of the total contribution required to guarantee the long-term equilibrium of the Community pension schemes."
"(NL) Madam President, I am a municipal councillor in a Belgian municipality with 13 000 inhabitants."
"The supervisory authority does not approve the budget of this small municipality unless a staffing requirement schedule is supplied, complete with detailed budget."
"A 16% increase in the number of officials for some years, as in the EU, would never be authorised; nor would an increase in pension costs of more than 10% in one year."
"The Commissioner has pointed to enlargement, but despite that enlargement the number of MEPs has been reduced."
"My question is: does the Commissioner not think that it is high time to also consider a freeze on the number of staff, in spite of possible further enlargement?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Yes, but as I said there will be a staff freeze after the enlargement, so this comparison with a municipality is not a similar situation."
"We have a big political project - the enlargement of the European Union - and we have taken on new officials."
"This has been the same model as during all previous enlargements."
"We have been quite successful in recruiting people from new Member States, and this will be frozen."
"After that, the overall number will be frozen."
"Commissioner, they say in Brussels that if you pass all those tests and exams and you are admitted to the European Commission as an official, then you will in any case have a quiet life until your pension."
"So I would like to ask about the quality of those who are working in the European Institutions."
"Perhaps the Commission has some plans to make the lives of those who are not very industrious more difficult, to have some attestations and to make a clear difference between those who are doing their best and those who have too quiet and easy a life."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I can with pleasure provide you with all the details of our career development system, which is one of the most complicated systems in the world, I must say, and which is a matter for constant debate."
"There is a yearly evaluation of every single official."
"There is a promotion system which takes account of this evaluation and offers a certain number of points, which, consequently, form the basis for promotion."
"This system is quite detailed and developed."
"You are right also in asking about the quality of the staff."
"Concerning the average open competition or 'concours', there are approximately 42 serious applicants - not to mention other applicants - to each published post."
"This is the case during the year, so we have always had a large influx of very good and experienced people, and the recruitment tests are very difficult."
"I must say that it is not such an easy life inside the Commission and not so calm and quiet until pensionable age."
"However, you are also right to state that most officials will really work a very long time in the Commission, and this can also be considered an advantage for the Commission."
"(DE) You have mentioned the staff screening exercise several times today."
"One of the results of the staff screening was that the task of 32% of the Commission's staff is to administer the administration, that is, to provide administrative support and coordination."
"That is 11 000 people!"
"Question: when are you going to draw some conclusions from these numbers?"
"When are you going to produce an action plan for reducing staff numbers?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I am sorry that I cannot answer in Finnish immediately, but we can have further discussions in Finnish."
"I am a little afraid of not using the right terminology, which must be so exact in the European Union."
"Like the Council, the Commission has concluded an agreement with its staff trade unions, putting a certain amount of human resources at their disposal."
"In the case of the Commission, on the basis of the resources agreement of 2001 and annual resources protocols, 12 so-called secondment posts are granted to the trade unions on a permanent basis out of a total of more than 23 000 posts at the Commission."
"Such secondments to trade unions, on the basis of their representativity, have been allowed since 1989."
"Furthermore, a very limited number of posts are granted on a flexible basis, in particular in order to account for changing majorities after elections."
"The staff thus put at the disposal of the trade unions continue to be paid a salary from the EU budget as Commission staff."
"In addition, the trade unions receive a budget which allows them to recruit up to nine contractual agents from Function Group II (secretaries)."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, as far as I recall you were a trade union leader in your country and trade union activity must surely be of interest to you on account of your background."
"I did not receive a precise answer to my question of how many of these trade union employees presently work for the Commission in total in all the trade unions represented?"
"I have an additional question relating to this matter."
"There is a rumour going around that the Commission would pay its employees a salary during a strike."
"Have the unions succeeded in negotiating a solution where if they go on strike they will get paid while it is on?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FI) I can, in fact, answer the question from my own knowledge of the situation."
"There are 12 seconded experts in the Commission's trade union."
"In addition, there are 19 positions on the staff committees, which are of course separate bodies."
"They may employ a total of nine secretaries."
"What you said about strikes is partly true."
"It is true that the Commission has agreed a negotiated solution that during a strike officials may be paid some of their salary, but normally not all of it."
"For me it is something of a delicate matter that people who are on strike get paid half their salary."
"(DE) Commissioner, I would be interested to know how much these functionaries are costing."
"What does it cost per year?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - The budget for the trade unions is approximately EUR 500 000 per year, which is given from the Community budget."
"Can I again remind those Members who have joined us in the interim, we are trying an experiment today and I would ask you to come to the front of the Chamber."
"Please do not feel shy, come and fill the front seats rather than sitting right at the back, so that it makes it a closer encounter."
"Subject: Total proceeds from fines imposed on businesses under competition rules"
"Can the Commission indicate the sum total of the fines it has imposed on businesses under European competition rules since the beginning of its current term in office and whether any measures have been taken or whether there have been any consultations within the Commission with a view to reserving this money - less the relevant amounts budgeted - for additional EU activities rather than transferring the extra revenue to the Member States?"
"Member of the Commission. - Since the beginning of its current term and up to the end of September 2007, the Commission has adopted 21 decisions imposing fines on companies that have infringed the anti-trust rules."
"The total fines imposed during that period amount to just over EUR 5.2 billion, 95% of which has been imposed on cartel participants."
"However, it should be borne in mind that such fines become part of the European budget only once they are final: that is, if no appeal has been lodged by the undertaking on which a fine has been imposed or when all possible appeals have been rejected by the European courts."
"As companies frequently challenge the validity of the Commission decisions imposing fines, a large part of the amount mentioned above is not final, so to speak."
"The possible use of the proceeds of fines for additional activities, as suggested by the honourable Member, is prevented by legal constraints."
"Such use would run counter to the budgetary principle of universality as set out in Articles 17 to 20 of the current Financial Regulation."
"According to that principle, total revenue covers total expenditure without any specific link between a given item of revenue and a given item of expenditure."
"The basic objective of anti-trust fines as laid out in the preamble to the 2006 guidelines on the method of setting fines is to ensure deterrence, in other words to discourage companies from behaving illegally."
"In time it is to be hoped that the levels of abuse, and hence the number and volume of fines imposed, will decrease as complying levels increase and we are still doing our job properly."
"(NL) Thank you for that very interesting information, Commissioner."
"I should like to know whether I have understood properly: in view of the Financial Regulation, the majority of that money actually returns to the Member States eventually - is that right?"
"Secondly, you tell me that - only when it is final - the money also belongs to the EU budget."
"Can you tell us how much, approximately, of that large sum of EUR 5 billion can actually be termed 'final'?"
"Member of the Commission. - (NL) The answer to the first part of the question is a resounding 'yes': it returns to the Member States."
"It means that a Member State's contribution to the European budget is assessed as being lower."
"Your next question was when is what part final, and that is very hard to say."
"It depends in any given year on the circumstances, whether the party concerned was sensible and refrained from appealing, or decided on a rather longer path and tried to get a bit knocked off."
"(DE) Commissioner, you mentioned the amounts imposed as fines."
"These fines are intended to change the behaviour of the companies upon which they are imposed."
"What are your observations in this respect?"
"In view of the occasion, I remember that when you commenced your role as Commissioner you gave us in the Committee on Regional Development the opportunity to discuss the de minimis rule with you."
"You responded very quickly then, for which we are very grateful."
"Are companies responding as quickly as you did then?"
"Member of the Commission. - We hope that is a fact, but I am not 100% sure, and certainly not sure enough to be open and honest with you."
"We should take into account that it is not only the level of the fine, but also reputation, that is hopefully making a difference in the attitude of companies."
"I find it interesting that now quite a number of CEOs of organisations who contact me mention that they are aware that this is real politics from the Commission, and that those who are not behaving and are abusing the rules and regulations are being confronted with a huge fine."
"As you are aware, with our new fine level, that is indeed not sweet money anymore."
"Having said that, they are taking the initiative within their own organisations to confront their own people, and saying that it should absolutely not be done any more in their companies."
"They are confronting them, if they are not taking the right measures, and saying that if something is rotten then they should mention it to the top, and that the fact is that later on they would be fired without any form of package."
"They also mention that damage to reputation, in combination with the fines, is a very important part of their attitude and their struggle to clean up the companies."
"A couple of them recently mentioned that they loved to be on the front page of the Financial Times but not because of our fines."
"That is indeed quite a good step forward."
"(LT) This summer Germany announced its plans to increase food prices."
"At the same time Lithuanian producers have made it clear that they intend to increase food prices in the autumn, without giving any objective reasons."
"Are you able to envisage cartel agreements involving international food producers?"
"Food prices are increasing simultaneously in all countries without there being any increase in raw material prices."
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission approved the merger of Gaz de France (GDF) and the Suez Group in November 2006, subject to commitments by the parties, which allowed the Commission to conclude that the merger would not significantly impede competition."
"The commitments entered into by the merging parties include, most notably, the divesture of Suez shares in Distrigas, the Belgian gas incumbent, which has, as you are aware, also entered the French market, the divesture of GDF shares in the alternative Belgian gas and electricity provider SPE and the abandonment of any control, by law or de facto, Suez has over the Belgian gas transmission network operator Fluxys."
"While GDF Suez is allowed to remain a shareholder of Fluxys, specific arrangements will guarantee that the latter is managed in an independent way, and this outcome is entirely consistent with the policy objectives pursued by the Commission regarding the liberalisation of the energy markets in Europe, in particular the package of proposals of September 2007."
"The Commission decision on the merger provides that the parties must proceed with the divesture of their ownership, including a partial divesture of participation in Fluxys, and with the other commitments, including those relating to Fluxys governance, within a certain divesture period."
"The parties have to fully comply with the commitments in order to legally implement the merger."
"In the mean time, the parties have to respect certain obligations, which the Commission will oversee with the assistance of the monitoring trustees."
"(NL) Madam President, fortunately I can speak in Dutch."
"The Commissioner is aware of Parliament's interest in national champions: the 'level playing field'."
"I have two brief supplementary questions."
"Is it the case that cross-subsidisation between the production company and the network company is now a thing of the past?"
"Secondly, did I hear you say that the current proposals also fully accord with the new package you and Commissioner Piebalgs have presented?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission will analyse the planned subsidy to Volvo Cars in Ghent directly on the basis of the EC Treaty, since the matter exceeds the EUR 1 million ceiling laid down in the specific block exemption regulation on training aid."
"Article 87 of the Treaty provides that aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, and which does not unduly distort competition, may be considered compatible with the common market."
"Training aid can be permitted when it creates incentives for activities which will increase the pool of skilled workers in the European Union and which would not otherwise be undertaken."
"That is the case where the training goes beyond what is normally done in the sector concerned; for instance, because more workers are trained or because the training is more extensive."
"That was the situation, for instance, in the recent Fiat case."
"On the other hand, aid cannot be authorised for training that is an accessory for the good operation of the firm concerned and that would therefore be carried out even without aid."
"For instance, when a car assembly plant wants to produce a new model, workers have to be trained on the new techniques and new working methods to be adopted."
"Subsidising this type of training simply relieves the company from a cost it would normally bear."
"Accordingly, the Commission has in the recent past partially prohibited aid in favour of several assembly plants and you are certainly aware of General Motors in Belgium and Ford Genk."
"The proposed eight measures for Volvo Cars Ghent relate to the introduction of a new production platform."
"The Commission cannot, at this stage, exclude that the training concerned would take place in any case and therefore would not contribute to increasing the pool of skilled workers in the EU."
"Therefore, the Commission has decided to open a formal investigation that is without prejudice to the final decision in the case."
"We need more time to find out what it is all about."
"The Belgian authorities, the beneficiary, as well as third parties, will have the opportunity to comment and to submit information before a final decision is taken."
"(NL) Thank you for your answer, Commissioner."
"Also, incidentally, congratulations on your victory against Microsoft."
"Moving on to what I wanted to say, as I understand it, then, the matter is still being dealt with."
"Am I right in thinking that the new interpretation of the rules on State aid for training will also contain sufficient scope for social relevance in training courses ensuring that, if training gives workers more opportunities in the global labour market, this training aid will not be regarded as a major interference in competition?"
"Member of the Commission. - Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time; it hardly needs restating here."
"It is not a trade issue first and foremost, but there are areas where trade can help."
"That is why the Commission wants the Doha Round to deliver liberalisation of environmental goods and services and also sees scope for the new generation of free trade agreements to help facilitate sustainable trade."
"The Commission is aiming to negotiate an ambitious and comprehensive post-2012 climate framework."
"If we succeed in including all major players, we will have gone some way, the furthest we could, to obtaining a level playing field for EU industry."
"That also means that the carbon leakage - the displacement of pollution from one place to another - that might otherwise flow from a failure to reach agreement will be avoided."
"Our aim is to include all major polluters in a proportionate way and not to frighten away partners from the negotiating table in Bali, and later on, by preparing trade measures for imports at this stage."
"We should rather address the free rider issue when, and only if, it actually arises."
"A well-designed trade policy can help the world deal with climate change by generating the wealth needed to pay for the mitigation and adaptation measures required."
"Investment in trade, in both low-carbon goods and services, can carry skills and climate-friendly technology throughout the global economy, helping to address climate change at global level and in the most cost-efficient manner."
"Throwing that away would be doing a disservice to climate change policy."
"It should not be forgotten that our approach to climate change policy has helped put European industry at the forefront when it comes to environmental low-carbon technology."
"The EU has a considerable first-mover advantage as a result."
"The Stern report made clear that combating climate change makes economic sense, in addition to the numerous societal benefits, because the costs involved are lower than the costs of inaction."
"Trade policy can support climate change objectives by minimising those costs and generating part of the finance required and by fostering regulatory frameworks that support investment and trade in low-carbon goods, services and technology."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner Mandelson certainly seems to respect the time limit for questions."
"He hardly confines himself to formalistic replies."
"Today, Commissioner, we adopted the new framework for placing plant protection products on the market."
"The entry into force of this framework will have consequences on the primary production of agricultural products and by extension on the European food industry."
"Can you confirm to us that imported products are subject to effective checks to see whether they comply with the strict specifications imposed on domestic production?"
"Member of the Commission. - We are indeed looking at all these aspects."
"But I would just reinforce the point I originally made: we want to secure the best, most far-reaching, most inclusive agreement for the post-2012 period that we possibly can."
"That requires a great deal of persuasion of our trading partners, the emerging economies, who we need to persuade to buy into and sign up to the post-2012 agreement that we all agree is greatly needed and which needs to have the maximum geographical coverage."
"The question we have to ask ourselves is with what tactics we can, or are most likely to, persuade emerging economies to sign up to the agreement that we want to promote."
"In our view, it would not only be premature, but it would be counterproductive, to start using a stick or threats or create a scenario in which those who might be inclined to hold back would be somehow punished by some trade measure or other because they fell into the category of free riders."
"If the time comes to reflect on such measures, then we would only approach that after considerable reflection and consultation, and, of course, any measure that we were even to contemplate would - and I have to stress this - need to be assessed for its WTO compatibility."
"There is no question of the European Union promoting or adopting a measure that is not clearly and firmly WTO-compliant."
"(DE) Commissioner, I would like to ask another question."
"My colleague Mr Papastamkos is absolutely right when he says that we must think about preventing European companies being disadvantaged if other countries do not participate in whatever follows the Kyoto system."
"There are three possibilities: firstly, the European Union could be the only one to commit to continuing."
"That would, of course, put companies under financial strain and disadvantage us."
"The second potential scenario is that if other countries do not participate, we will not participate either, although we would then be unable to meet the climate goals we have set ourselves."
"The third possibility, if the others do not join this 'Kyoto plus' or post-Kyoto system, would be for us to pass appropriate sanctions."
"What exactly might these sanctions look like?"
"Can you imagine specific sanctions?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission appreciates the interest shown by Parliament in a review of the trade defence instruments (TDIs) and reiterates the importance it attaches to the views of Parliament in the context of the current review."
"It looks forward to the report by the Committee on International Trade, which it hopes will be completed soon."
"On its side, the Commission is finalising its response to the consultation process."
"Indeed, the Commission held a preliminary discussion, an orientation debate, before its meeting today on this subject."
"Proposals to the Council could be made in the next weeks."
"The Commission intends to keep Parliament closely involved and informed on this."
"The Commission has, of course, carefully examined all reactions to the Green Paper, of which there are many hundreds."
"The intention now is to inform Member States and Parliament of the main reactions and suggestions received, and these will also be published."
"They will be discussed by the Commission again before proposals are tabled to the Council, hopefully in the last half of November."
"Most stakeholders consulted and submitting their views share the Commission's opinion that TDIs remain essential in a globalising world economy where multilaterally-agreed competition rules are lacking."
"Also, the majority of stakeholders do not see the need for a major overhaul of the TDI system."
"Neither does the Commission."
"However, there is also a wish for the rules to be made clearer, as well as for increased transparency and for there to be more efficient application of the instruments."
"The claim that the Commission has changed its approach towards the assessment of Community interest in some recent cases is simply not true."
"Each case has been examined on the basis of its own technical merits."
"Some cases have raised atypical issues, but they have been resolved in line with Community legislation and within the small discretion allowed by that legislation, after thorough discussion with Member States."
"Lastly, it is correct that no new anti-dumping investigations were initiated in the first half of 2007."
"However, it should be pointed out that anti-dumping investigations are industry-driven and are not initiated by us."
"In other words, they are initiated on the basis of complaints from Community industry."
"In the first six months of 2007, no complaints meeting the requirements of the law were lodged."
"It is not unusual that the number of initiations varies from one year to another, depending on factors such as the business cycle, over-capacity in third countries and diversion of trade as a result of trade defence measures in other world markets."
"The number of initiations has also fluctuated in past years."
"In 2003, for example, the Commission initiated in total only eight new investigations, the first of which was initiated at the end of May in that year."
"Also, the first semester of 2007 followed a period of exceptionally high activity at the end of 2006."
"Finally, I would draw your attention to the fact that in September 2007 two new anti-dumping investigations were initiated against imports from China: one for citric acid and another for monosodium glutamate."
"(DE) Commissioner, thank you very much for your comments."
"Transparency plays an important role in this process."
"When are we going to receive the evaluation of the Green Paper survey?"
"Either there is no evaluation yet, in which case you would have released your paper without an evaluation, or there is an evaluation - I assume that there is - in which case it is high time that it was presented to the public and to Parliament."
"Secondly, I am interested to know whether you believe it is really tenable to determine essential matters without amending the basic regulation on the basis of new principles."
"Thirdly, why is it that you want to treat 'market' and 'non-market' economies equally?"
"Fourthly, still talking about Community production, where do you see the percentage threshold for production outside the EU?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission has undertaken a preliminary assessment of the responses to the Green Paper, and that provided the basis for our orientation discussion on the subject today."
"That paves the way for an even more rigorous assessment, which will accompany the Commission's consideration and agreement on the proposals that it wishes to submit to Member States on the basis of the review."
"I can assure the honourable Member that information about the responses is - already, I believe - posted on the website of DG TRADE, but we shall also publish what is, I hope, an easily accessible version or presentation of the responses we have had to the Green Paper in order to allow good time for reflection on those responses to take place ahead of the submission by the Commission of our proposals."
"The honourable Member seems to have alighted already on certain aspects of the Commission's proposals which have not yet been submitted to or agreed to by the Commission, so I suggest, with respect, that he is slightly jumping ahead of himself in some of the assumptions that he appears to be making."
"(LT) The question I would like to ask is, obviously, based on my meetings and discussions with the industrialists of the country I represent - Lithuania."
"In fact, I can reiterate what my colleague has said: there is a lot of concern about the liberalisation of the trade policy, and also a lot of criticism."
"My question is: if the position remains the same, what will be the Commission's reaction?"
"What measures can the Commission be expected to take?"
"Would you be inclined to listen to what business representatives have to say, or would you consider other arguments to be more important?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am not quite sure what the honourable Member means by the 'liberalisation of our trade policy'."
"By definition, trade can only take place when markets are opened and trade flows are, in effect, being liberalised."
"Trade does not take place behind closed borders or where economies are being converted into fortresses, so of course the Commission seeks to promote the liberalisation of trade."
"The Global Europe trade policy review and strategy that was presented and agreed by the Commission and the Member States a year ago sets out very clearly the interests of the European Union, which are to maintain open markets at home, to promote and use multilateral and bilateral negotiations, to open markets abroad and to use effective trade defence measures to tackle unfair trade or unfair competition."
"Those are the three legs of our strategy; each is equally important."
"The review of the third leg of that tripod is taking place after quite dramatic changes have taken place in the world economy, and indeed in the European economy, since the last review of our trade defence measures took place, which was over 10 years ago."
"We have a responsibility to make sure that our measures are operating as well as they could be and that they command consensus and support and solidarity amongst our Member States."
"When that weakens, the trade defence measures become less easy or possible to use."
"It is in an effort to rebuild and restore that consensus, support and solidarity amongst our Member States that we are undertaking this review."
"Commissioner, in order to get to one further question, I am going to take the next two supplementary questions together and ask you to deal with them both together."
"(EL) Madam President, in addition to the questions put by my colleague Mr Caspary, let me add my own question about when we will have access to the assessment of the questionnaire on the Green Paper."
"Commissioner, European anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures represent less than 0.45% of the value of total imports into the EU."
"How, then, is the Commission's haste for unilateral revision of trade defence policy justified?"
"In which direction is the Commission leaning?"
"Is it towards politicising the procedure or preventing people from seeking redress against unfair practices?"
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to ask a question related to the answers you have been giving."
"Parliament does not acknowledge the need to review the trade defence instruments; the public consultation reached the same conclusion."
"The Commissioner has not explained to Parliament the point of his proposal and, especially, to what extent his proposals and convictions have changed on the basis of the opinion of the public hearing and the opinion of Parliament."
"This is the heart of the issue, because we do not understand the point of persisting with a review of instruments that everyone thinks are useful and are working well."
"This, then, is what we need to understand."
"Member of the Commission. - I do not quite know what the change of direction is that the honourable Member is referring to; there is no change of direction and, as I have made clear, neither the stakeholders responding to the review nor the Commission takes the view that a fundamental overhaul or fundamental reform is needed."
"So, I am not quite sure what she means by a change of direction."
"If there was no need for a review, then I think that the Green Paper that we issued would have received far fewer than the 500 responses that came in."
"It would seem to indicate that a Green Paper that has over 500 responses indicates interest in a review which has taken place."
"In answer to the first question, I can't submit an assessment to this Parliament until it has been undertaken."
"The Commission has not yet made its assessment; it has not yet decided on its response."
"It had a plenary discussion today and will make its views known when it submits its proposals to the Member States and, at the same time, they will be made known to Parliament, and that will be some time in the second half of November which is not very far away."
"As for politicisation - politicisation of these issues is almost inevitable."
"When you have European industry now representing different views and competing interests and, frankly, making very different rival submissions as to whether they want trade defence measures adopted, that is bound to be reflected in the positions of our Member States."
"If the Member States chose instead simply to take at face value the objective and rigorous analysis of the Commission's services and to adopt the conclusions and the measures we propose; if they were prepared simply to do that, then the politicisation wouldn't arise."
"However, the Member States are subject to the same lobbying and different competing interests, amongst producers, retailers, distributors, importers and consumers, as we are."
"When people have different views, those views have to be debated very broadly in a political way, through a political process, and that is what happens."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (See Annex)."
"I am sorry for those who have waited."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.35 and resumed at 21.00)"
"The rise in foodstuff prices, consumer protection (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"an oral question - B6-0321/2007) concerning the rise in foodstuff prices and consumer protection by Joseph Daul, Lutz Goepel and Neil Parish, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to the Commission,"
"an oral question - B6-0377/2007) concerning the rise in foodstuff prices and consumer protection by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the PSE Group to the Commission, and"
"an oral question - B6-0378/2007) concerning the rise in foodstuff prices and consumer protection by Sergio Berlato, Janusz Wojciechowski, Gintaras Didžiokas and Liam Aylward, on behalf of the UEN Group to the Commission."
"author. - Mr President, it is with great pleasure that I stand up and talk tonight because we are in a situation now where food security has become a real issue."
"For 25 years we have been in a situation where there has been plenty of food in Europe."
"In fact, we have been taking many decisions in agriculture, in the common agricultural policy, to restrict production in order to maintain prices and reduce the use of export subsidies and to export products on to the world markets."
"Now we are facing a situation that is completely different: cereal prices have risen threefold this year; the livestock sector is having a huge problem, having seen its feed costs going up by perhaps 50% or 60%, and we are extremely concerned about this."
"Mr Daul, Mr Goepel and I have tabled this oral question - and we are delighted that Commissioner Fischer Boel is here tonight - because we feel we now have to look at every opportunity for getting extra feed into the European Union."
"We will have to face up to the reality that there are some feeds that are derived from GM maize and GM soya which cannot come into the European Union at the moment because they are not licensed."
"I think we have to make sure that we look at this and that we have a system by which we can license these products."
"Provided they are safe, they should come in to be fed to our poultry, and to our pigs in particular, as well as to our cattle, both beef and dairy, because we need to keep a very competitive industry."
"We also have to look at the situation regarding supermarkets, because - do not forget - not only are we concerned at the price that the farmer receives for his or her products, but we are also interested in what the consumer has to pay."
"There is no doubt that we are seeing, for instance, that only 10% of a loaf of bread is actually made from the raw material of wheat and yet there are huge increases in the price of the loaf because the supermarkets say they are having to pay so much more for wheat."
"So we need to put pressure on the supermarkets to make sure that consumers are paying the right price."
"It is great that it puts European agriculture in a very strong position to face up to the brave new world, because we will need food production, we will need farmers and we need the countryside, and all these things work very well."
"But, as I say, we now have to get the balance right between the cereal and livestock sectors, and that is why we have tabled this question."
"We shall be delighted to hear what Commissioner Fischer Boel has to say about it."
"author. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, it is a pleasure to see you again here in Parliament."
"As you know, we were surprised a few months ago by a change in the situation in the market for some agricultural products, which not long ago we believed to be unthinkable; an enormous pressure on supply, with the consequences that we have been seeing."
"This in turn caused a major disturbance in the livestock production sector, foreseeable consequences in the rise of consumer prices and not forgetting the FAO's warning about the consequences for foodstuffs in many areas of the world that could result from this situation."
"Let us not forget that while in Europe we spend 10-20% of household incomes on food, there are societies where this item accounts for 90% of income or more, and it is easy to imagine what a price rise would mean to these vast populations that are already so deprived."
"Therefore we need to act, and act immediately; and I am very pleased that the Commission has acted swiftly - and well - by taking some palliative measures, reducing the set-aside for 2008 to zero."
"It is a shame we did not go further."
"There are other measures that could perhaps be adopted without additional cost to the Community budget, such as advance authorisation of payments to certain livestock farmers of the aid they are entitled to, who are of course doubly affected not only by rising prices, but also by having to deal with livestock diseases, such as 'bluetongue', and so I think we could go a little further just now."
"However, most of all we must go further in assessing and studying the situation so that we can quickly identify the measures that, in the short term, can be adopted in the immediate future."
"We naturally place our trust in the sensitivity of the Commissioner and the Commission in following up this concern of ours."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, throughout Europe we are seeing across-the-board increases in the price of foodstuffs."
"Market surveys carried out show how European consumers are radically changing their eating habits, being forced to change the quality and type of products that they buy as a result of the exorbitant prices."
"These increases can be blamed on the one hand on the excessive number of intermediate phases that products must go through from the producer to the consumer, and on the other on the disproportionate increases applied by major supermarket chains."
"One thing is certain however: the blame for these increases cannot and must not be placed on our farmers, who are the main victims of this worrying situation."
"Mr President and Commissioner, we believe that today more than ever, the European agricultural model must be protected in order to shield national agricultural markets from international price fluctuations and give substance to the defence of models of production and use of the territory which are so characteristic of European agriculture."
"We welcome the Council's recent decision to ratify the proposal for zero set-aside for 2008."
"However, this does not do enough to reassure us about the worrying situation in terms of cereal stocks and the rising price of cereals on the world market."
"We also need to work with the various CMOs and make good use of these mechanisms for rebalancing the market, which would help ease food prices, at least in the internal market."
"We asked the Commission, in a recent question, to propose an immediate increase in milk quotas of at least 2-3% to help stabilise the price of this staple product."
"In a difficult economic climate such as this one, the European Union and the Member States have a responsibility to help consumers maintain their food purchasing power while at the same time protecting our farmers' right to an income."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I recall what I think is an old Japanese curse: 'May you live in interesting times', and I think this is exactly what we are doing now."
"We have seen, over the last six to eight months, prices for raw materials within the agricultural sector rocketing, as mentioned already by the speakers, but I have to say that this is happening from an historically low level."
"I think this is an important reminder to all of us."
"These increases in prices will be reflected on consumer prices but to a lower extent."
"If I may use the example of bread, a basic commodity - and I will use a German example - if you take the price of bread in a supermarket or in a store in Germany, only 4% of the price relates to the price of the cost of the wheat."
"For the dairy sector, as has been mentioned already, a number of different measures have already been foreseen."
"Milk quotas were increased on 1 April 2006 and 1 April 2007 by 0.5% in 11 Member States."
"On 1 April 2006, eight new Member States received this restructuring reserve varying from between 2% and 5% of their national quota level."
"On 1 April 2008 - next year - another 0.5% will be added to the increase in the quota allocated to 11 Member States."
"In addition, all market support aids have been massively reduced and, at the moment, there are no export refunds and no disposal aid at all - zero for both of them."
"The market outlook report in the dairy sector will be adopted by the Commission later this year and it will provide us with the basis for a further discussion on whether we need to increase again the quota."
"Moreover, I have already had the chance here to signal clearly the expiry of the milk quota system by 31 March 2015, and indicated as well that we needed, for the period from now until 2015, a soft landing for the abolition of the quota system."
"Among the possibilities mentioned is to increase the quota system over the period and we will have the possibility to discuss this during the health check next year."
"In the cereals sector there are various different reasons for the increase in prices."
"I shall just say, just to be sure that there are no misunderstandings, it is not biofuels that are causing the steep increase in prices."
"We use, today, less than 2% of cereal production for ethanol in Europe, but the reasons are different: adverse weather conditions in Australia, drought in southern Europe, floods in the northern part of Europe, increasing demand from India and China, and restricted exports out of Russia and Ukraine."
"Then, of course, there is the snowball effect from the very strong focus on ethanol in the United States and, therefore, a certain influence on the increase of prices in corn."
"The Commission has, as mentioned already, reacted: set-aside is put to zero for the coming production year, for the sowing to take place this autumn and next spring."
"Then whether to continue a zero set-aside will be a discussion to be held during the health check."
"We expect that the zero set-aside could contribute to somewhere between 10 and 12-15 million tonnes, depending on the climatic conditions."
"Moreover, I will submit to the College of Commissioners a proposal to the Council to suspend cereal import duties only for the current market year."
"I think that those initiatives will help us to ease the pressure on the livestock farming and the consumer prices."
"There are different problems for the pigmeat sector."
"The pipelines are filled with meat, so there is an imbalance on the input and output in the sector and therefore the management committee decided last Thursday to introduce a private storage that I hope will help the problems in the pigmeat sector."
"There are other possibilities, but I think we should try to find the right balance because, if it is only a question of prolonging the pain, then we gain absolutely nothing."
"So, I think that we have reacted and I have had the possibility to thank Parliament for its quick reaction so that we could send clear signals as soon as possible to the farming sector on the zero set-aside."
"I would like to come back to the GMO question in my final remarks, as I can see that my time has expired."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would have been happy to share my time with the Commissioner, because I am interested to hear her views on GMOs, but I will be here for the entire debate."
"I think it is true, because it is not the first time we have said it in this Chamber, that the unpalatable truth is that the era of relatively cheap food is over and that what has happened was not predicted either within the Commission or, indeed, globally."
"The Commissioner has gone through some of the reasons why we now have this imbalance in supply and demand and I agree with her: weather, climate change, the demand from the developing countries and, yes, biofuels are impacting globally - the Commissioner has acknowledged that."
"However, it is important to remember - and there were others in this House prior to my time - what your predecessor Mr Fischler said when reforming the CAP in 2003."
"He promised farmers better market prices."
"Perhaps we are seeing the impact of those reforms now, and we are beginning to question those impacts because of the impact on consumer prices."
"We have had positive developments on milk and cereals, but we do not have the same on the livestock sector in terms of the beef and lamb producers, chicken and pigmeat that the Commissioner has discussed."
"We are asking the questions now about the volatility and whether we are happy with that volatility in demand and supply."
"A major food company said to me recently that the supermarket buyers have no knowledge or interest in the economics of food production, but they are beginning to take note, and that is positive."
"However, we need to monitor the power of the supermarkets and to look at whether they are passing on the price increases they are charging to the producers of food."
"That is something I would urge the Commission - perhaps the Commissioner for Competition - to take a close look at."
"They have refused to do it in the past."
"Concerning GMOs, this is a big issue."
"There is a problem in relation to the differences of approval methods between the European Union and the US and we need to look at that."
"So I wait for the Commissioner's comments on GMOs before making my points in particular."
"Lastly, we cannot ignore the impact on the developing world of insecurity, particularly with the grain market, where countries that cannot afford to pay more for food are seeing a massive increase in their food bill."
"We must acknowledge it in this House and we need to take it into account in our policies going forward."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during World Food Day on Tuesday 16 October, the FAO wanted to raise public awareness of malnutrition, which currently affects 854 million people throughout the world."
"On this occasion, the rising price of agricultural raw materials was highlighted, particularly its impact on consumers in the developing countries - my fellow Members have spoken about this at length - but also on the populations of poor countries, which import cereals."
"While in the developed countries, we spend 10 to 20% of our household budget on food, in the least developed countries, this figure is 60 to 80% of the budget, and a 20% increase in the price of cereals is drastic."
"This situation is made worse by the fact that some countries depend heavily on imports, and are affected by currency fluctuations, climate variations and increases in transport costs."
"Commissioner, you have responded partially, but I hope there will be other measures."
"What measures do you intend to take in the short and medium term, for the CAP health check, to put right this difficult situation for consumers in the North, and this even more difficult situation for those in the South, and to contribute to a global food equilibrium?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, it is important that there is now a focus on the very interesting situation that we are currently witnessing in connection with the very marked price increases for a number of agricultural raw materials."
"At the same time, we know that in the areas where they have not yet taken effect, namely the pig sector, these price increases will lead to a very expensive winter in terms of food prices."
"We are aware of the underlying causes: poor autumn yields, empty corn stores, etc. - I will not go into any more detail about this."
"I feel that the situation we are currently experiencing should provide an opportunity for more discussion."
"First and foremost, we should not be alarmed at the current price rises."
"For far too long a litre of milk has cost less than a litre of cola and less than a litre of water."
"It is completely unreasonable of us not to accept that food should cost what it actually ought to cost, because there is a long production time and many working hours behind the products, particularly in the milk sector."
"It is also clear that there is now an opportunity to increase the production of foodstuffs in Europe."
"The market is in fact demanding this of us."
"The Commission has shown good initiative by removing set-aside and of course we still have the opportunity to increase production very quickly, especially in the milk sector."
"We should continue the reform of the common agricultural policy from 2003 by reducing support, and we should seriously discuss further transfers of agricultural support to rural development policy."
"We now have the opportunity to kick-start dynamic agricultural production in the EU, and this means that we can give farmers more freedom than they have at present to exploit the current strong demand."
"Naturally, as is the tradition, we will also take care of farmers in mountainous areas and less fertile regions - that is all that is needed!"
"However, we must not be afraid of price rises, but instead understand and make offensive use of the situation in which we find ourselves."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, this discussion has gone crazy."
"We have been talking about falling prices, lowest possible prices and all-time lows for years."
"All the speakers who are now bemoaning the fact that prices are rising - finally heading upwards for once - and are calling for measures to hold back the price rises."
"We should be happy that the market is functioning, with your help."
"With the help of your predecessors, but also of demands made by the European Parliament, the billions of euros that were going into intervention and price stabilisation - the price pressure that ruined market prices on the world market and have caused the countries of the third world to get into difficulty - have been done away with."
"Finally this circumstance has been eliminated and we are getting closer to the market, entering a situation that is being exacerbated by the use of corn to produce fuels."
"There are many other reasons why such great demand exists on the market at present."
"The market reacts, the price goes up and now we, here in the European Parliament, as representatives of the farmers, are asking for prices to be brought down again."
"I have never been involved in anything so ridiculous in all my 20 to 25 years in Parliament!"
"That is why I applauded Mr Busk."
"We should be delighted with this situation."
"Of course we have to be watchful on behalf of those who cannot afford to buy food at normal prices."
"We have to hold unjust wage rates and misguided social policies in any country accountable, but we cannot take measures to put food in the mouths of the poor at the expense of farmers who, in recent years, have left farming in their hundreds of thousands."
"This is not the right way to be talking!"
"I am glad that we can even discuss the situation here today and that we have a market in which prices are finally increasing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important to initiate this discussion, although, partly because of what the Commissioner has told us, we are not seeing the full scale of the problem yet."
"I would like to remind the Commissioner that a few months ago, we asked for a moratorium on the discussion of amendments to the CMO in fruit and vegetables in order to pause and reflect on what was happening - and what is happening now in wine - based on a few points, which I would now like to raise."
"Firstly: we are talking about harvests that have failed due to climatic events, but there is no mention of the fact that we will be dealing with this problem for years, because climate change is happening in Europe and around the world."
"Fact one!"
"Secondly: compared to 1950, when there were 2.5 billion of us and everyone on the planet had 0.5 hectares each, by 2020 the world's population will have grown to 7.5 billion (according to UN data) with around 0.2 hectares per inhabitant available for cultivation."
"I understand where Mr Baringdorf is coming from when he says that this is a fundamental problem, but I do not think that the increases we are seeing at this time are to the advantage of producers."
"If we look at the difference between the cost of the product and what consumers are charged, we can see that consumers and producers are paying for a very long supply chain."
"However, this is partly due to policies created here in the European Parliament, so I think the Commissioner should look carefully at the actions we are going to be setting out."
"Of course, it has been important to return fallow land to production, although today what we need most of all is in-depth discussion."
"When the European Community was created, action was taken to meet the food requirements of the European people."
"Today, we should adopt the same policy."
"We can no longer allow land to be set aside under a decoupling policy, because this leads to a loss of production and renders our questions unproductive."
"Therefore, we must prepare for an in-depth discussion on whether the policies of the past few years have delivered a response to consumers and producers, or whether conversely they have created problems for both."
"Mr President, I want to focus on the position in the intensive sector."
"I will not take time to recount the dire straits in which many producers in that sector find themselves, rather I want to focus on what I believe the Commissioner should be doing to help."
"I have four or five points to make."
"First of all, I think the Commissioner should recognise that soft measures, like market promotion, are not going to be enough."
"Secondly, she should face up, more than has happened to date, to the long-term impact on grain availability and prices of the rampant switch in the United States to biofuel production."
"Their targets, which are very aggressive, are in truth drying up the imports that we need in that regard."
"Thirdly, with intervention grain stocks at an alarming low and the ratio with usage being totally out of kilter, there urgently needs to be action to address that balance."
"Fourthly, I suggest that the Commissioner needs to be more proactive in fighting for speedier approval of GM substitutes."
"With respect, Commissioner, you need, on behalf of agriculture, to match the vigour of Commissioners Kyprianou and Dimas as they resist GM approvals."
"Fifthly and finally, you need to put a floor in the market for our intensive sector, with export refunds extended immediately to meat and hams."
"On that point I am not sure that helping private storage will solve very much in the longer term."
"Mr President, let me be first of all assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that I am happy to see prices going up for our farmers at last, so long as it is farmers who benefit, and not supermarket chains."
"Up until now the small number of supermarket chains that dominate the retail sector in Europe have been profiteering at the expense of our farmers and producers."
"In my constituency in Scotland, dairy producers have for far too long been getting GBP 0.17 per litre for milk, which is below the cost of production, while it was selling on supermarket shelves at over GBP 0.50 per litre."
"That has driven many dairy farmers in my constituency out of business altogether."
"We have now seen the price farmers receive for wheat go up by only 10 %, while the shelf price in supermarkets of wheat-based products has gone up by 40 %."
"Once again, supermarkets are using fluctuations in price to pocket bigger profits for themselves."
"That is a disgrace, and I agree entirely with Mr Parish that we should ask the Commission to start an investigation into the pricing policy of supermarket chains in order to ensure that consumers and producers get a fair deal."
"(ES) Mr President, it is clear that the rise in prices that consumers are experiencing directly in their shopping baskets is due to multiple factors, but in my speech I am only going to discuss what Mr Stevenson said."
"I think that the role of intermediaries and large food retail chains is concerning."
"In many cases they respond to speculative movements, so the increases in the prices of final products are greater, as has been said, in percentage terms, than the increases in the prices of raw materials."
"The situation is also very concerning for producers who, in the face of the huge purchasing power of the large retail sector, are obliged to reduce their selling prices, without being able to pass on the increases in raw material or fuel prices."
"I therefore think, and I support the previous speaker, that it is important for the Commission - and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for being here - to act and take measures: that there should be investigations and the necessary means put in place to bring an end to these practices, which are unfair, and in many cases abusive."
"I think that the resolution is very timely, and that we are in time to be able to adopt measures."
"(PL) Mr President, many of those who have spoken before me have been pleased that there has been a rise in the price of foodstuffs, but we must ask ourselves whether this price is getting through to the farmer."
"I have very serious concerns about this."
"Many small farms are currently being closed down in line with the policy of the Commission and the European Union."
"We must, however, also ask ourselves what kind of foodstuffs farmers are receiving."
"They are getting beef from Brazil, sugar from South America, dodgy chickens from Asia, and thus cheap foods are pouring into our market, which is 'lowering' prices for us, but in fact restricting production in Europe."
"The question arises: are we going to have to keep on bowing down to the industrial lobby?"
"Why, at the end of the day, can we not start supporting European farmers once again, at a time when a niche has appeared for us to increase this production and raise quotas for milk and starches, for example, for which there is a constant demand in Poland and other Eastern European countries."
"(EL) Mr President, the problem of bread, milk, potatoes and other foods undergoing a price hike, which in some Member States is ten times the current rate of inflation, is very acute, particularly for those on low incomes, the main proportion of whose budget goes on food."
"This problem did not come out of the blue."
"We know that the food sector is controlled by a few undertakings which make significant profits at the expense of producers and consumers: consumer prices are many times higher than those paid to the producers because of the large number of middlemen and the market monopoly."
"For this reason there is now an increased global demand for food and animal feed; cereals and oil seed rape are being used in the production of biofuels, not for environmental reasons but as part of the profit-making plans of the oil multinationals."
"There has been a collapse in prices and EU intervention to help cereal production has diminished, and there has also been a mandatory set-aside because of the CAP."
"All these factors, together, of course, with dreadful weather conditions, have drastically reduced the EU's stocks and production."
"Nonetheless, trade and industry have exploited this at the expense of farmers and consumers."
"This is why food and animal feed prices have risen."
"These rises have worsened the position of workers, increased the number of undernourished people and bankrupted small and medium-sized livestock farmers."
"Greek livestock farmers are in despair; they are taking action to demand substantial aid to help them survive."
"The decision by the Council of Ministers on 26 September to remove the compulsory set-aside, suspend duties on imported cereals and take other measures, to which you have referred, Commissioner, will go some way towards easing the problem, but it does not solve it."
"The decision suggests half-measures, which are by their very nature insufficient."
"Substantial measures are required to boost and the stock of animal feed, control prices, and clamp down on cartels and speculation."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful that we can have this debate today with the Commissioner."
"As commodities prices increase, people are paying more attention to agriculture again."
"The situation is due, on the one hand - as already mentioned by the Commissioner and some of the previous speakers - to demand from third countries and on the other, to crop failures in traditional agricultural exporting countries such as Australia and New Zealand."
"Therefore it is essential that we mobilise all the resources that we have in Europe."
"I have now determined, for example during my visit to Romania, that at least a third of the total cultivatable land is lying idle, as it always has."
"We have considerable resources within our Member States."
"A first step would surely be to stop letting land lie fallow."
"As already stated, as a farmer, I believe wholeheartedly that the first priority should be to produce healthy food, the second priority to produce fodder and the third priority to produce energy materials."
"Ultimately, however, I believe that the slight price increase for our farmers does not in any way bring the price adjustment that would make up for the losses of recent decades."
"As many of those who have already spoken have pointed out, we are getting perhaps 10% more in primary materials prices, but retailers are marking that up by 40-50% in some instances."
"I am thinking of butter, for example, and this does not seem fair to me."
"One way for us farmers to respond would be to organise ourselves better into producer cooperatives with production contracts, in order to meet the food retailer monopolies head on."
"(HU) The present debate clearly demonstrates yet again how widely opinions vary in this House."
"I agree with Mr Stevenson, namely that this price rise means only a very small increase in income for farmers, compared with the trade sector, supermarket chains, and market speculators, who take the lion's share."
"Another problem is that cereal producers will benefit hugely from this, while livestock producers will lose a great deal."
"We have an untenable situation here: certain sectors are either favoured or neglected under the common agricultural policy, and this price rise is set to make the neglected sectors even worse off, while those that are prosperous will get even richer."
"I agree with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that the increase in prices is a good thing, but who is going to be affected by this price increase?"
"These contradictions are continually increasing, and unfortunately the distortions of the common agricultural policy deepen and exacerbate these distortions."
"We need to fundamentally rethink common agricultural policy, because piecemeal interventions are merely cosmetic."
"There can be no normal common agricultural policy as long as livestock production, wine, vegetables and fruit, pig-meat and poultry are neglected sectors. Thank you."
"(ES) Mr President, as I said last month during the debate we had in Parliament on the suspension of compulsory set-aside, which was also a night sitting, the increase in agricultural prices should provoke an in-depth discussion on the direction that the common agricultural policy is taking."
"We will soon have the Communication from the European Commission on the CAP 'health check' on the table, but I fear that in that communication the Community executive will not be bold enough to acknowledge that the liberalisation of the markets also has a price, and that European farmers and consumers are now starting to pay that price."
"Many Members of this House have always favoured a dismantling of the market management measures and have contributed to projecting the negative image that European consumers have built up regarding the CAP."
"As I said at the last plenary sitting, I would like to know how we are now going to explain to citizens that we scarcely have the instruments to control these rises in agricultural prices in the European Union."
"It would also be interesting to ask the European Commission to estimate what the cost is going to be for European citizens of this increase in food prices and to compare this cost with the cost for each citizen of the common agricultural policy."
"I would also really like to know whether or not citizens will ultimately benefit in the coming years from the liberalisation of the markets and the drastic cuts in direct aid that European farmers are suffering from."
"I am going to give you a statistic which I think is very significant: before the creation of the CAP, in 1961, the prices of raw materials for producing animal feed were twice as high as the prices paid by farmers 20 years later."
"The common agricultural policy guaranteed a supply of raw materials at an affordable price and at the same time European consumers also benefited from a fair price for an essential commodity."
"In a country such as mine, Spain, we are seeing rises in prices of foods as basic as milk."
"I think that the economics and finance ministers of the European governments should now also be more concerned about the repercussions that this increase will have on inflation in their countries."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, all of us who are here tonight are aware of all the causes of the rise in the prices of cereals and raw materials."
"Although you gave us some good reflections on what those causes are, there are, however, other issues that you tiptoed around."
"As you are going to present your proposals on the CAP 'health check' to us in November, I would prefer to tell you now what I think, and say that I hope that in this 'health check' you will analyse whether the CAP is in line with the new requirements of the global market, because one of the principal causes of the restriction of European production has, I am convinced, been the lack of foresight by Community experts."
"We need to review the current policy of extremely reduced stocks."
"The Community intervention stores should, as has been said here, be the safety net for guaranteeing supply at times like these, but there are no supplies and the Community stores are empty."
"I am very concerned, Commissioner, about the consequences that the rise in animal feed prices is having on European livestock farming, as it is having a very negative effect, especially on small and medium-sized farms."
"Mr President, this is a very timely debate."
"We all know that cereal prices have increased dramatically, and we know the reasons why."
"Commissioner, it is a fact that we depend on, and still need, grain imports and substitutes from outside the European Union, mostly from the United States."
"In this respect, I am concerned that it is taking so long to decide on the new strains of grain that are up for approval."
"I am well aware that this is not necessarily the Commission's fault."
"It is the fault of the national governments, because they could not agree."
"You are going to have to take the decision, and I hope you take it as soon as possible."
"I would urge speedier approval of the new strains of grain that are in the pipeline."
"As price inputs rise, the cost is inevitably passed on to the consumer."
"That is not something that anyone looks forward to, but it is where we must face up to the power of the supermarkets."
"I have known Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for nearly 19 years now - ever since I have been in this Parliament."
"I have to say that sometimes he gets it right and sometimes he gets it wrong; he is wrong on this occasion."
"I am not against prices going up, as long as the price comes through to the producer as well as to the processor and the consumer."
"We must address not only this issue, but also the use of GM grain."
"We are importing into the European Union food for our consumers to purchase in our stores when we have no idea how it was produced."
"There is no traceability of these imports."
"They could have been produced using any manner of means."
"That is something that we must confront."
"A large amount of the meat coming from Brazil, to name but one country we have discussed, is almost certainly produced using GM-grain."
"How can we tell the difference?"
"- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the authors of this resolution and give them my support."
"The soaring price of cereals and therefore of foodstuffs generally reflects Europe's current dependence on the volatility of world agricultural markets."
"Accepting this situation would mean accepting that consumers are becoming a variable for adjustment during the correction phases of these markets."
"Accepting this situation also means denying the influence of the large supermarkets, which for 40 years have contributed to the downward trend in prices for farmers, while food prices for consumers have stayed the same or have increased."
"This excessive margin capture could have, and should have, been used by the large supermarkets to absorb the rising cost of agricultural raw materials in the crisis we are currently experiencing."
"Clearly this is not happening."
"The large supermarkets are continuing to abuse their dominant position and the Commission must now discuss this question as a matter of urgency so as to prevent European consumers from being held hostage to an unfair and dangerous system."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will try to respond to some of the questions raised."
"First of all, I agree with those who say that it is nice and very satisfactory to see that the market is now working, that the reforms we have been making are working."
"That was the whole idea behind all the work done to reform our agricultural sector, so now the farmers can actually respond to the market, and that - from the farmer point of view - is what we really want to do."
"It is also important to realise that this increase in prices is not a European phenomenon, it is a global phenomenon - and that is the reason why it is very difficult for us to take certain measures."
"I would just like to respond to the idea of introducing export refunds."
"I think it could send the wrong signal to the sector to continue production and thereby prolong the pain to the point where we see an increase in prices - here I am talking specifically about the pigmeat sector."
"But there will be pressure on prices as long as we have overproduction compared to demand."
"We see that prices are going down on carcases; we know that it is part of the cycle and we know as well that in autumn there is always pressure on pigmeat prices."
"Let me just mention biofuels, which, under the mandatory targets that the Commission presented on 10 January 2007, will represent 10% of our fuel transport sector by 2020."
"We never intended that this would be exclusively European production: we will need imports."
"However, it is very important that we start on the first generation and thereby encourage our research institutions to try to find the golden solution for the second generation that will not be produced exclusively or mainly on cereals but on straw, woodchips and residues from slaughterhouses."
"We therefore have potential, and we estimate that, by 2020, between 20% and 30% will be coming from the second generation, and we might be able to do better if we push the research investments."
"Concerning GMOs, I can fully assure you that the Commission is aware of the problem posed by asynchronous authorisation."
"You can see the consequences in the Directorate General for Agriculture's recently published report - which you can find on the internet - where there are three different scenarios."
"The Commission is currently reflecting on the best way to address this situation without any compromise on our high level of risk assessment, with regard to both the environment and human health."
"Important improvements have already been made in reducing the procedure or the time line - the time necessary - for authorising GMOs."
"I would like to mention, just as an example, the recent commitment by the European Food Safety Authority to perform the completeness check within six weeks, compared with a much longer period previously."
"I also expect that stronger support from the Member States will help the Commission in further shortening the time line of the authorising process."
"Steps in this direction have been taken to increase Member States' support in the authorising process."
"I am strongly committed to workable implementation of our rules to ensure that trade in animal feed is not disrupted, with clearly negative consequences for our farmers."
"But I am also committed to ensuring the highest level of safety when it comes to placing new GM products on the market, and of course our trading partners know the specific rules that we have within the European Union."
"Just two days ago I came back from Argentina and Brazil."
"They told me clearly that they will be able to deliver non-GM products, soybean and maize mainly, and the types of GM products that have been authorised in Europe."
"But they said that we have to be aware that this is more costly."
"If we are prepared to pay the price they will deliver but we have to remember that they have other customers out there, and here they mentioned China as a big customer."
"So I am quite sure that we will come back to this issue."
"I feel certain that we will before too long."
"I have received six draft resolutions submitted under Rule 108(5)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 25 October 2007."
"Tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Green Paper 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level'."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that the European Union is again discussing tobacco consumption."
"In my country alone, 350 people die every day as a result of tobacco consumption so it is only right that we deal with this topic at European level."
"I am very glad that the committee decided to launch a European initiative to continue to promote a ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and pubs, and public buildings."
"I think this is the right approach."
"Whether there needs to be European legislation or national legislation that would then perhaps be established within the European framework is a matter for debate."
"Those who still believe that we do not need it should bear in mind that, in relation to the Air Quality Framework Directive that we passed here a few weeks ago, we argued about whether we would accept 20 or 25 ppm of fine particulate in the air."
"Commissioner, the figure in the average pub is 540 grams and after midnight at the 'Aviateur', a popular pub in this area, it is 1 730 grams, so you see how great the differences are and how necessary this is."
"Another very important point, which has concerned me for many years, is additives."
"Even now, 600 additives may be included in cigarettes, and 70-80 of these are on the 'red list'."
"These are highly toxic, carcinogenic substances which may damage our young people's fertility and trap them in addiction."
"These substances require very critical, intense scrutiny, the cost of which must, of course, be borne by the manufacturers."
"The thought of Commissioner Kyprianou having to spend his last penny on tests made necessary by that industry is deplorable."
"The question of costs must therefore be settled, by placing it firmly with the Commission."
"I believe that this will reveal many of the main pathogenic ingredients of cigarettes."
"Nevertheless, cigarettes are still dangerous."
"For me, a further important point is the question of whether, in the long term, we can get industry to pay some of the expenditure brought about by tobacco."
"As far as I can see, we have introduced producer liability in many areas: if you drive your car into a ditch and this was due to some defect in the car, the manufacturer of the car must pay."
"Commissioner, I would like to see you make every effort to initiate this redistribution of costs onto the manufacturers of tobacco products because, when you think about it, my country spends EUR 50 billion getting people back on their feet."
"Why should somebody who has never held a cigarette in their hand have to be involved in that?"
"That is very unfair, and I would be glad to see those on this side of the Chamber who have a social conscience working hard on this issue."
"The costs should be transferred to where they belong - those responsible for them, the producers."
"Of course, they will pass the cost on afterwards."
"I understand that; that is the way of things in a social market economy."
"Every year, thousands of people in Europe die because of smoking."
"We must therefore put proper, strict rules in place."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to begin by congratulating and thanking the rapporteur, Mr Florenz."
"I think he, and other colleagues here, remember from the very first day of my hearing in the European Parliament, which he chaired by the way, that I have made a very firm commitment: I would like to see Europe free of tobacco."
"I think that, slowly and gradually, we are getting there."
"I would like to thank Mr Florenz for the work and his dedication and the commitment he has to this cause."
"Also, on a personal note, Mr President, if you will allow me, I would like to wish Mr Florenz a happy birthday."
"I understand that yesterday was his birthday."
"I will not mention the age as I do not want to create an interinstitutional problem, but I would like to wish him many happy returns."
"I would like to say that we see a trend and significant improvement in the area of smoke-free environments in the European Union, as compared to a situation three years ago where we only had Ireland and, I think, Italy which had just introduced these bans."
"Now we have a much larger number of states that have adopted these more comprehensive bans, even some with a few exceptions: I shall come to that in a minute."
"But I believe that we need a joint effort to achieve this - the Commission, Member States and, most importantly, the European Parliament."
"I shall say that Parliament's contribution to the Tobacco Directive was of vital importance and I would like to interpret today's report as support for smoke-free environment policies."
"I am also very happy that the report takes a very positive constructive approach to the Commission's Green Paper, in particular on supporting the Commission's view that only a full smoking ban can adequately protect the health of citizens and workers."
"We have to be frank about that."
"First of all, a comprehensive smoking ban protects from passive smoking, it is a disincentive for people, especially young people, to begin smoking, it is an incentive for many people to quit."
"It creates, and this is an important factor, a level playing field among the various operators, especially in the entertainment industry, because the exceptions, in order to be effective, have to provide for separate rooms, sealed, negative pressure, separate ventilation systems - all this creates a certain cost that not all operators can meet."
"It does create a better level playing field and, also, it is easier to enforce when there are no exceptions."
"We have evidence from the European Union, but also from other jurisdictions which have introduced these bans before us, that there has been no negative effect on the hospitality sector."
"Actually, in many cases the revenues went up."
"Now, for me, what is important is a result."
"That is what we are trying to achieve."
"The procedure through which we achieve it is not very important for me, whether it is European legislation, national legislation or regional legislation in some cases, what we need to do is achieve the target."
"I am ready, and I would be willing to accept a step-by-step approach, provided that at the end the target, and not far away, should be an introduction of a comprehensive ban."
"Where are we today?"
"I would like to mention that."
"We already have total bans in Ireland and the United Kingdom - the whole of the United Kingdom."
"We have Sweden, Italy, Malta, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland which have already introduced quite thorough smoking bans even with exceptions on the special sealed-off rooms as I said earlier, with separate ventilation systems."
"France followed this two-step approach, so as of next year will have a similar situation."
"Then we have the same restrictions, but with more exceptions, when it comes to hospitality venues for countries like Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands."
"We have also proceeded in countries like Germany and Austria, where initiatives are under way already to strengthen existing smoke-free regulations."
"We have had a Green Paper as you know."
"We had a consultation, a debate in the Council and now with the contribution from the European Parliament I am planning to take all these and then decide what will be the next step at European level and what action should be taken."
"We also have commitments under the international obligation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control - all these will be brought together to decide what the next steps should be."
"I will go to another point which is included in the report, the Tobacco Products Directive, and I think that is a very important issue."
"We will produce a second report on the implementation of this Directive later this year and it will analyse the state of implementation of the directive and identify areas that warrant future amendments."
"It will discuss and will be inspired by the report."
"Several issues which feature in today's report will be included in ours, for example those on the regulation of tobacco ingredients, labelling requirements for tobacco products and products and manufacturers' liability."
"I would like to mention two points."
"One is the issue of the pictorial warnings."
"As you know, we have created a databank with different photographs and pictures that can be used as pictorial warnings, but I have to admit that it is very disappointing that very few Member States have actually taken advantage of that."
"I really regret that."
"To give you an example, I am just going through my notes, we have now only Belgium which has introduced them."
"Romania will do it from next year and then we have the United Kingdom also later next year."
"I have commitments from the Finnish and Latvian governments that they plan to introduce these in the near future and that was after many calls and urging Member States to introduce them."
"We have many countries outside the European Union, like Switzerland and New Zealand, which signed licence agreements with us so that they can use our pictures and our suggestions so, for me, the situation in the European Union is very disappointing and therefore we are very seriously contemplating actually amending the relevant directive and creating a mandatory obligation to use the pictorial warnings."
"I also find very interesting the Parliament proposal to have these on both sides of the package."
"This is something that we will study."
"Finally, the application of the implementation of the tobacco advertising ban is now everywhere."
"We had problems with certain Member States."
"We managed to sort them out, some through legal actions, others through persuasion, but now that applies equally everywhere."
"One specific aspect I would like to mention is the initiative we took recently to convince non-EU countries to stop allowing the sponsorship of Formula One events by the tobacco industry."
"As you know, we do not have the legal extraterritorial jurisdiction; on the other hand, as these events are broadcast back to Europe they are viewed by the European citizens, they affect young people in Europe, they undermine European legislation and European policies in this area, so I have contacted both those from the private sector involved in this and the respective countries which still allow - there are only three - tobacco sponsorship and host Formula One events."
"Hopefully soon we may have some positive results but I will pursue this issue."
"Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur, but also the Members of Parliament who are very committed in this effort."
"For me, and I have said that from the very first day, it is very frustrating that, in the European Union, with the highest levels of education and standards of living, people still die of preventable diseases."
"More than 600 000 people die of tobacco-related diseases."
"I believe that this is a lifestyle where we can encourage change."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, exactly 20 years ago, as a legal adviser in the office of the Belgian Secretary of State for Health, I had the opportunity to draw up regulations that led to the first national Decree banning smoking in public places in the then European Community."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the feeling that, with the resolution on which we are voting tomorrow, we are now playing a kind of pioneering role here, too, in this field."
"The initiative in the Green Paper and the excellent report by Mr Florenz have without doubt shown us the way."
"Anyone reading the resolution can come to only one conclusion: the European Parliament is opting henceforth for a zero-tolerance policy on smoking."
"An immediate ban on harmful additives is demanded, as is the effective application of product liability in respect of tobacco manufacturers - these are examples of sections that speak for themselves."
"An unrestricted smoking ban in public places, transport, enclosed workplaces - including catering and drinking establishments - is also called for here."
"In this regard, however, my group believes that account must be taken of the decisions taken recently in a number of Member States calling for a high level of investment - which has not yet been written off - in a number of sectors."
"Account has to be taken of these, but our ultimate objective in the longer term - to be pursued consciously and without hesitation - must be an unrestricted smoking ban, covering these places too."
"The wind is fully in our sails on this issue."
"If Eurobarometer and other surveys are to be believed, we have the full support of the people."
"To anyone who still doubts the need for intervention, I should like to point out that, since we arrived here in Strasbourg on Monday afternoon, statistically some 480 Europeans will have died from the effects of passive smoking."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have to take action against this."
"My group, too, intends to invest the maximum effort in this, and also to support all the supporting anti-smoking campaigns."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the International Agency for Research on Cancer recently examined all available evidence on second-hand smoke and cancer."
"This was an independent panel of international scientists from 12 countries convened by the World Health Organisation."
"They concluded that second-hand smoke is carcinogenic and that exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers by 25-30% - quite a staggering figure."
"There is no doubt that people in the workplace and in enclosed public places have the right to be protected from other people's smoke."
"Remember that the majority of the population are non-smokers."
"The best way to deal with this problem is by a comprehensive smoke-free regulation at Member State level, encompassing a ban in all enclosed public places and in workplaces."
"I do not, therefore, agree with Amendment 3 by Mr Florenz asking for limited exceptions."
"Any exceptions must be kept to a minimum."
"Nor do I agree with his Amendment 2, which deletes a proposal for amending the Framework Directive on workplace safety and health, requiring all employers to ensure a smoke-free workplace."
"Employers have a responsibility to protect workers' health."
"Further, I would resist any suggestion that exemptions should be granted to pubs or bars not serving food."
"Not only is this harmful to employees, but it would also lead to health inequalities."
"For example, in the UK, non-food pubs accounted for half of all pubs in deprived areas, compared with a quarter in more affluent areas."
"I also think that awareness-raising measures about the dangers of smoking are crucial."
"Bigger and bolder picture warnings are part of this awareness-raising and, therefore, I cannot support Amendment 6, which deletes paragraph 16, which refers to these pictures."
"I think we would all agree that we must act to help prevent young people from smoking."
"The younger people are when they start smoking, the more difficult it is to stop in later life."
"Therefore, I would urge support for paragraph 4 of the report, which is aimed at cutting the number of young smokers by 50% by 2025 and rejection of Amendment 1 by Mr Florenz calling for the deletion of this paragraph."
"Smoking causes enormous health problems within the population, both of smokers and non-smokers, and I know that some colleagues feel that the use of snus is a better alternative."
"However, I cannot support measures that may lead to the wider use of snus, because its use has its own health-related problems, including oral cancer."
"There is no value in trading one health hazard for another."
"Finally, if we are serious about improving the health of our citizens, then we must encourage all Member States to introduce the necessary measures to make a smoke-free Europe a reality."
"Can I just suggest that we could make a great start by enforcing the ban here in our own Parliament buildings?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the timing of the Commission Green Paper and the report by Mr Florenz is excellent."
"It is really high time the European Union returned to the issue of tobacco, as silence has surrounded the subject for too long."
"The Florenz report rightly focuses on smoking among young people and the harmful effects of passive smoking in workplaces, public buildings and catering and drinking establishments."
"On the subject of young people, research has shown that 90% of smokers start smoking as children, as under 18s."
"I am very pleased with the ambitious objectives of the Florenz report to significantly reduce smoking among this age group."
"After all, young people are susceptible to peer pressure and, in addition, the harmful effects on health are greater in this group."
"It is my hope, therefore, that the Member States - who think, of course, that they themselves can do everything best and that we must on no account become too involved - will respond to this House's appeal to commit themselves to halving the harmful effects of smoking among young people by 2025, so that they actually take action by agreeing with each other to do so."
"With regard to passive smoking and the general smoking ban, a sound liberal principle is that one's personal freedom ends where another's begins - and what clearer illustration of this principle can there be than unwilling passive smoking?"
"Passive smoking inflicts great harm on public health and entails costs for the European economy."
"Each year more than 79 000 adults die in the EU Member States as a result of passive smoking, and there is proof that passive smoking in the workplace accounted for 7 000 deaths in the European Union in 2002, whilst exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke at home was responsible for a further 72 000 deaths."
"Of course, ample experience of this kind of smoking ban has been gained already in countries such as Ireland, Scotland and Italy, and this experience is actually all positive."
"The comments from these countries - including from people who had been very sceptical about this kind of measure - are ultimately positive."
"Thus, it is tempting to issue a smoking ban at European level, too."
"Recently, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, this House decided against imposing a European smoking ban at this time, instead opting to leave such measures to Member States."
"I think this is the right decision, as such a controversial decision should be taken as closely as possible to the citizen for the time being - that is, at Member State or regional level."
"Therefore, the call on the part of those Member States who already have a smoking ban for the voluntary signing of a European charter in order to bring greater clarity for consumers strikes me as the most that can be achieved at present."
"What is extremely good - and in this respect I commend the Commissioner on his Green Paper - is the promotion of this discussion that has indisputably taken place."
"The issue is on the agenda in all Member States."
"Mr President, I should like to make some concluding remarks about the Directive on tobacco products."
"The Florenz report also looks towards the revision of this Directive."
"I support everything the report says about picture warnings on cigarette packets."
"It is tragic that so few Member States have made use of these, and personally I would be in favour of legislating in this regard."
"Moreover, it should be possible to use these warnings in other ways, too, for example on the kind of information leaflets on how to stop smoking that they have in Canada; the experience with this has been positive, and it also strikes me as an excellent idea."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to wish you a happy birthday, Mr Florenz, albeit belatedly."
"We know that smoking kills."
"Every year, it causes the deaths of 650 000 people, and a further 79 000 adults die as a result of passive smoking."
"We are delighted with the energy and commitment that the Commission has shown on this and are pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear, firm proposals."
"We also have the majority of citizens behind us."
"Almost 70% of them do not smoke, most smokers want to quit and Eurobarometer has clearly shown that 86% of those surveyed want a ban on smoking in the workplace, while 84% are for a ban on smoking indoors and 77% want no smoking at all in restaurants."
"We are therefore very concerned about the amendments introduced by the rapporteur, because Amendment 3 would signify a definite dilution of this strong report by our committee."
"It basically means a ban with exceptions, and we all know what happens with exceptions - they quickly become the rule."
"Take Germany, for example, where we have seen that progress has been made thanks to stipulations made by Brussels and the debate at European level."
"It would be fatal for the EU to cease championing this cause of behalf of consumers in the area of health protection and if we failed to see it through."
"Therefore, I hope that we reject Amendment 3 tomorrow and that we stand up for robust European health protection so that we can finally achieve a smoke-free zone throughout Europe."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Thank you. 650 000 people die each year from smoking and 80 000 people die each year from passive smoking in the EU alone."
"These gloomy statistics show us clearly that we must do everything we can to combat smoking."
"Karl-Heinz Florenz has put forward a number of good proposals for action, such as tightening up existing legislation, deterrent notices on cigarette packaging, measures to prevent young people from starting smoking, measures to help smokers who want to be free from their dependence and, in general, measures to support the Member States in combating smoking."
"That is a good thing."
"However, I am opposed to transferring more power to the EU in the field of public health, particularly when the Member States are already doing a good job."
"The smoking ban in pubs is a good example."
"At least ten EU countries now have some form of smoking ban in restaurants and pubs."
"It started with Ireland in 2004 and quickly spread to Sweden, Italy, Finland, Malta, Belgium and so forth. Many more are on the way."
"Should we now stop this process of setting good examples and wait for EU central legislation?"
"No, I don't think so, but let the good examples continue to be disseminated."
"I note that in his report Mr Florenz writes that he wants to call on all the Member States to introduce an unrestricted smoking ban."
"That is good, as I interpret it as meaning that we do not need to take a roundabout route via the European Commission and still run the risk that it will be thrown out by lobbyists from the tobacco industry."
"In conclusion, is there not a danger, after all, of giving with one hand and taking away with the other?"
"We are urging people to stop smoking while at the same time the EU continues to subsidise tobacco cultivation to the tune of more than EUR 1 billion every year. EUR 1 000 million every year."
"These subsidies obviously must be abolished. As soon as possible!"
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to repeat things - four minutes of speaking time are too precious - except to say that, like most speakers, I welcome the broad lines of this motion for a resolution."
"Information programmes and preventive measures to reduce the number of young smokers in the coming years are only to be welcomed."
"This goes for deaths caused by tobacco, and in other areas it also goes for road deaths and deaths caused by alcohol."
"Up to this point I join the consensus."
"At the same time, however, we must remain reasonable."
"Just as we do not stop traffic because of the fatal accidents or toxic exhaust emissions, or banish wine and beer to purgatory because of the cirrhosis of the liver suffered by some politicians, on tobacco, too, we must let common sense prevail, and avoid hypocrisy at all costs."
"I am thinking of the green health apostles in my country, for example, who inveigh against tobacco, but who legalised soft drugs a few years ago."
"These are a few marginal notes to this resolution, ladies and gentlemen."
"In principle, it must continue to apply that no supranational regulation is needed in this area."
"Europe should respect the principle of subsidiarity once and for all if it wants reconciliation with its citizens."
"To give an example, years ago, a European directive laid down that tobacco, too, had to be labelled - which is all well and good, but then bureaucracy suddenly reared its head."
"The label has to cover 30% of the packet; 35% if it is bilingual."
"The text must be in black lettering, with a black border of minimum 3 mm and maximum 4 mm thickness, the font must be Helvetica, and so on and so forth."
"Europe wants to dictate everything, and no one understands where the subsequent irritation of the general public comes from."
"Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, there is the hypocrisy of the subsidies for tobacco farmers, which even as recently as last year amounted to EUR 900 million a year."
"This has now been reduced to EUR 300 million, but is still many times greater than the sum channelled into information to induce young people to stop smoking."
"There is also a parallel with our nation-states: in Brussels a pack of cigarettes now costs EUR 4.30, of which EUR 3.30 goes as excise duty to the Belgian State, which spends a few million on anti-tobacco information programmes."
"Billions of euros a year in excise duties could serve to finance the health costs of combating lung cancer."
"Forgive my cynicism."
"What are we going to do, though?"
"Abolish the subsidies and disadvantage our European farmers by importing tobacco products from abroad?"
"These questions, too, must be answered if one is to lapse into grandiloquent lyricism; otherwise, one pulls the wool over citizens' eyes."
"Unfortunately, I can find no answer to these questions."
"Finally, let us also avoid overdoing it, ladies and gentlemen, as the didactic language used sometimes makes me feel rather queasy."
"In fact, it all makes me shudder."
"A smoke-free Europe."
"What fine words."
"What puritanism."
"Sinners are to be punished."
"Let us guard against excessive stigmatisation of the 30% of the population who smoke."
"Let us refrain from becoming anti-tobacco ayatollahs, as a Socialist Minister in France once implored me."
"Let us refrain from lapsing into American conditions."
"In California there are some who want to ban smoking in people's own homes, too, from 2009."
"Just imagine!"
"How are they going to do that?"
"With commandos and informers?"
"Compulsory tobacco detectors in every home?"
"Is this the example we wish to follow?"
"Are we going to follow in their footsteps?"
"Are we going to ban the reading of Simenon on grounds that Inspector Maigret with his pipe is a bad example to young people?"
"Let us remain reasonable."
"In many European countries - for example Italy, France, the Scandinavian countries and also my own country - smoking was banished from the shop floor and from restaurants long ago; and a good thing, too."
"They did not need Europe for this."
"Long live freedom, I say."
"Let us give those restaurant managers who want one a small room for customers who occasionally like to enjoy a good cigar after their coffee or pousse-café."
"Who knows, though - perhaps coffee will also be banned and banished in tomorrow's Europe, as caffeine, too, is addictive."
"Perhaps it would be best if the Commission put people on bread and water."
"(FI) Mr President, in addition to smokers who are at risk from the dangers of smoking there are the millions of Europeans on the sidelines."
"The creation of a Europe free from tobacco smoke and the prevention of passive smoking are two of the crucial tasks of the Union's environmental and public health policy."
"Member States have also committed themselves to this goal through international law, as, with the exception of Italy and the Czech Republic, all the Member States of the Union have recognised the protection of citizens from tobacco smoke in the WHO Framework Convention as a fundamental right."
"This right must be effectively protected."
"Of the choices presented by the Commission, adherence to the status quo is not a viable option."
"Voluntary arrangements have not succeeded in protecting people from tobacco smoke."
"I too would like to thank the rapporteur for advocating binding legal remedies as the most effective way of combating this problem."
"We have to protect two groups in particular: children and young people, and employees."
"We cannot, however, adopt just any rules."
"We have to stay within the limits of rationality, as befits the powers we have under the EU."
"Supporting a sales ban on tobacco products to under-18-year-olds applied within the entire EU area is quite a different matter from restricting smoking in private vehicles in the presence of minors."
"In such a case I would appeal rather to the parents' conscience and discretion."
"Do not force your child to breathe in deadly air."
"Legislators should be careful about aiming at compliance with laws which it is virtually impossible to monitor."
"There is also a need to highlight the importance of preventive work and various campaigns."
"To protect workers, though, it is absolutely essential that a comprehensive smoking ban be brought in in all Member States."
"I also wish to raise the matter of the manufacturer's responsibility."
"The Tobacco Products Directive should be amended to include the manufacturer's liability when healthcare costs are being financed as a result of tobacco consumption."
"Smoking is not just something that concerns smokers, because the hundreds of billions of euros in costs which are incurred by society as a result of tobacco consumption have to be paid by the majority who do not smoke."
"Making people feel guilty helps no one and is, moreover, a poor policy, but the facts have to be stated."
"Smoking costs too much; it costs lives."
"Mr President, as has already been mentioned, every year 65 000 people die in Europe from smoking-related illnesses."
"The number of victims of passive smoking is also tragically high - about 80 000 European citizens die every year owing to other people's bad habit."
"That is why a total ban on smoking in the workplace and other public places should be welcomed."
"Our long fight against smoking has not been unsuccessful."
"Ten or twenty years ago, it was natural for people to smoke almost everywhere: during meetings and even on buses in some countries."
"Now it is almost an aggression to light a cigarette at social events."
"The success of the anti-smoking campaign shows us that multinational companies, such as the tobacco companies, are not unbeatable."
"If we have clear goals for the environment and health and we can mobilise society, NGOs and politicians - not forgetting good lawyers - then we can reach our goals, step by step."
"This report is taking the right steps in the right direction."
"We should of course mention that it is smoking we are fighting, not smokers."
"Mr President, this motion for a resolution is balanced, precise and comprehensive, and the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, deserves our honest congratulations on his work."
"My only criticism of this resolution is that it has come too late."
"The supporting scientific evidence and the undisputed need for the policy options contained in this document have been clear for all to see for many years."
"It is sadly certain that the delay in making significant progress towards achieving a Europe free from tobacco smoke will have brought about the deaths from a preventable cause of hundreds of thousands of EU citizens."
"Who is to be blamed for this massive sacrifice of human life?"
"I will mention only two of the main guilty parties so as to shame them, even though not in a sufficiently drastic fashion."
"Firstly, the tobacco industry."
"It has spent millions of euros on campaigns of lies and misinformation."
"It has manipulated the media, politicians and even scientists in order to buy more time, and this it has done purely and simply for financial gain, knowing full well that thousands of lives were at stake."
"Secondly, the governments and some political parties of many EU Member States."
"They have bowed to the power and influence of the tobacco barons and have continued to hold back on taking effective measures to protect their citizens against the plague of smoking."
"Even straightforward measures, such as increasing tobacco taxation and making free treatment of tobacco addicts widely available, have been suppressed."
"I support an overwhelming vote for this resolution and I urge you not to forget the despicable behaviour of those who knowingly caused the tragic loss from tobacco-related diseases of so many lives."
"(SV) Karl-Heinz, congratulations on your 60th birthday."
"I am pleased to see that you are just as full of life as the young Karl-Heinz."
"The best present that the PPE-DE Group could give Karl-Heinz would be to let him withdraw the weaknesses in his own report that he has presented."
"I think it is important to mention additives in the report."
"We have been asking for legislation for a long time."
"Harmful additives must go, and it is a disgrace that the information is so poor."
"We therefore now expect a rapid proposal from the Commission to get rid of these terrible additives that make cigarettes even worse."
"We all have a natural right to avoid smoke in our workplaces, just as children have a natural right to avoid smoke in their playgrounds."
"Parliament is perfectly right to call on the Member States to address this problem."
"If you take children to our own stairwell outside the restaurant here, they smell of smoke for half an hour afterwards."
"I also want to mention one aspect that has come out of the debate."
"Any credible tobacco policy must include the phasing out of all subsidies, and we must ensure that our companies do not undermine the work through heavy marketing in developing countries. Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, as the statistics show, approximately 30% of the population continues to reach for a cigarette on a daily basis."
"I agree unconditionally that non-smokers should be protected from the harmful consequences of inhaling nicotine smoke."
"I cannot, however, agree with the Jacobinical methods proposed in the resolution."
"We cannot create a repressive policy for smokers that involves the restriction of their civil liberties."
"I believe we should place the emphasis on broad public education and regulate the sales price by raising taxes, as scientific studies have shown this to be an effective weapon in the fight against tobacco addiction."
"The point proposing a ban on smoking at work is incontrovertible."
"I do think, though, that it should be expanded by adding a rider guaranteeing that each entity must provide smokers with a place nearby where they may smoke without harming others."
"In the current climate this space must not be merely an artificial and pointless manifestation of health promotion; it must be an effective action."
"In the time available to me I would like to touch on another problem, which has its origins in the anti-nicotine policy pursued by a number of governments, namely the rise in smuggling of counterfeit tobacco products, their main attraction being that they are cheaper than the original product."
"This is currently one of the most lucrative sources of income for smugglers."
"Please bear in mind that these products are sold in our shops, to our citizens."
"Those who have taken up selling this product will not hesitate to sell to someone under age."
"When drawing up an anti-nicotine policy, therefore, we must examine the problem from a number of angles to ensure that the legal reality we establish provides effective help in solving the problems linked to the use of nicotine products."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations to our rapporteur."
"My primary concern is the protection of workers."
"I join with all Members who want the Member States to respond quickly, and that is what we are doing with this resolution."
"Results to date show that it has worked in some Member States but not in my own."
"When it comes to the protection of workers, the question is, 'what steps can the European Commission take to prevent the creation of first- and second-class citizens?'"
"How have the Member States reacted to this discussion so far?"
"Are they for pushing ahead with worker protection at European level and for taking actions and measures such as a ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars?"
"Most of us approach this topic based on our situation and we often forget that we should be thinking about the workers who have to work under these conditions."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only with regard to protecting non-smokers, but also in other matters, I believe we should not take the EU's powers to extremes."
"What are we really talking about here?"
"Surely the point is to initiate discussion about a potentially smoke-free Europe, not to wage a crusade against people who consume a product that is legal in Europe."
"However, some of the contributions to this discussion, and many of the amendments, sound more like a religious war than the debate that I feel would be appropriate."
"In the same way, the report stated that this policy should create an environment in which smoking was no longer seen as normal."
"I do not believe that it is the task of politicians to teach people how to behave or to dictate to people what they should think."
"We should keep things in perspective when it comes to the question of what the EU should regulate and what it should not."
"Regulations structuring the tax systems of individual Member States are not part of our competence, nor are wide-ranging bans on smoking."
"Put simply, the Member States have not given us that authority."
"Even though there is a trend towards non-smoking in Europe, to exploit this trend to adopt excessive rules and to ride the wave of public approval is bad form, in my opinion."
"We are talking here almost exclusively of bans."
"Bans usually only increase the attraction of whatever has been forbidden, especially for young people, the group that we are particularly concerned about."
"Instead, we should focus our energy and money on educating people about the harmful consequences of tobacco consumption, targeting each group as individually as possible."
"That is the only way to get people to make wise decisions in the long term."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the statistics on the consequences of smoking speak for themselves."
"Mr Florenz is right not to tire of pointing out that 650 000 deaths due to active smoking and 80 000 deaths due to passive smoking cost our health system EUR 50 million every year."
"There should be no need for us Parliamentarians to discuss effective protection for non-smokers."
"Therefore, the discussion is not about 'whether', but 'how' it can be effected."
"There are several different models of effective protection for non-smokers in Europe."
"Some countries, such as Sweden and Ireland, have imposed a strict ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and pubs, and in public buildings; others have provided for narrow exemptions."
"We should respect these different models."
"In principle, therefore, I think that protection of non-smokers is a matter for the Member States."
"The rapporteur proposes that Europe should intervene in the event that Member States fail to provide effective protection of non-smokers in the workplace."
"However, where these rules are infringed, I favour the EU keeping to the framework of EU powers regarding occupational safety and health."
"I also advocate recognition of the existing rules in the Member States."
"Functioning, existing national rules in the area of protection of non-smokers must be able to be retained."
"Member States that are well along the way should be rewarded; we need to recognise the effort they have made."
"We should take national differences and regional distinctiveness into account on a case by case basis, and accept them."
"However, this must still ensure sufficient special protection for children and young people, and for non-smokers."
"We do not want to water down the protection of non-smokers."
"This will achieve a high level of health protection while adhering to the principle of subsidiarity and respecting the interests and regional differences of Member States."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Florenz's report."
"I strongly support smoking bans in public places to protect public health and to avert the dangers of passive smoking."
"I was delighted when Scotland led the UK in introducing a smoking ban in March 2006, and I am pleased that bans are now in place in England, Wales and Northern Ireland."
"As a Scottish ban has now been in place for some time, we have evidence on what kind of health impact it has had."
"Recent figures from Scotland show that, since the smoking ban was introduced, there has been a 20% reduction in heart attack admissions to hospital."
"We also continue to raise awareness of the health risks associated with smoking."
"For this reason, on 14 November 2007, I am launching a written declaration in the European Parliament calling for more research and resources for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."
"COPD is a common and costly lung disease whose advanced stage is chronic respiratory failure."
"It is an under-recognised, under-diagnosed and under-treated disease, neglected by health care providers and the public."
"The rise of COPD makes it all the more important that the EU adopts comprehensive smoke-free policies and Mr Florenz's report."
"Thank you very much."
"I would like to begin by saying that I am essentially sceptical about the idea of the EU banning smoking in public places throughout the Union."
"Even those who are in favour of this kind of smoking ban must see the problem of us doing it at EU level."
"After all, decisions like this are controversial."
"If the citizens find out that they come from Brussels, that someone who is not directly concerned is introducing these decisions, I think that opposition will increase."
"However, there are things that we can do here in the EU to reduce the harm caused by tobacco smoke throughout Europe."
"For example, we can abolish the EU's incomprehensible ban on Swedish snuff."
"I am coming back with the obstinacy of a fool to take the opportunity to highlight the Swedish experience."
"We have the lowest proportion of smokers anywhere in Europe, we have the lowest proportion of all tobacco-related illnesses anywhere in Europe, but do you know what?"
"Despite this we have roughly the same tobacco consumption as the rest of Europe, but we use snuff rather than cigarettes."
"The fact is that if the rest of Europe replaced cigarettes with snuff to the same extent that we have done in Sweden, 200 000 Europeans would be spared lung cancer every year."
"I therefore think that it is immoral to keep our eyes closed."
"Unfortunately the Commission's reasoning seems to be precisely the opposite."
"Today the Commission ordered the Åland Islands to pay fines of almost SEK 20 million for failing to enforce sufficiently effective bans on snuff there."
"This is even though snuff on the Åland Islands is a traditional product, which there too has replaced cigarettes and saved lives."
"Moreover, the Commission does this and has the nerve to claim that it means well and refers to concern for the health of the Ålanders."
"But I have talked with the latter, and they politely reject this."
"It is therefore on the Commission's conscience if smoking increases on the Åland Islands."
"However, I know that there are still Members here who are sceptical and do not really believe that it can be that simple, that the statistics are not really as clear-cut as I say."
"I would ask you to meet me halfway, at least on one point, and to vote in favour of Jules Maaten's proposal to evaluate the health effects of snuff."
"Let us have the facts on the table as a scientific basis for further debate."
"I am convinced that it will be the first step towards lifting the EU's indefensible ban on snuff. Thank you, Mr President."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate."
"It was good to hear different views."
"I must say that I am very happy that the majority supports smoking bans and all the other measures that promote smoking prevention."
"First of all, we must not forget that the main target is to protect young people."
"Do not forget that that new ideas come up all the time."
"The new fashion now is to promote smoking among young girls as a weight-control measure."
"All means are being employed to promote smoking, so we have to be imaginative and comprehensive in our response."
"I understand that some Members are reluctant for the Commission or the Community to take measures."
"They say that we should wait for Member States to play their part."
"As I have said, we are now in the process of examining and studying what the next step should be at European level."
"However, I must say that, even though the trend is very encouraging - over the last few years there has been a tremendous increase in countries introducing very comprehensive restrictions - the longer we wait to take measures, the more people die."
"We must not forget that."
"It is a very important factor."
"There is the issue of subsidiarity, but subsidiarity does not mean doing."
"Nor does Article 152 mean that we should just sit back and watch people die."
"It means that we should complement, support, encourage and even legislate when it is necessary."
"We do have the legal basis - we have the opinion on that."
"So it is a matter of a policy decision, not a legal decision."
"That is something we will be working on."
"As I have said from the beginning, what is important for us is how we can best achieve results, not the legal instruments we employ to do so."
"Do not forget that the new Treaty, agreed just two or three days ago, specifically mentions the European Union's involvement in the tobacco issue."
"That should be borne in mind as well."
"The Commission's Green Paper refers mostly to a smoke-free environment, and the debate mainly focused on that area."
"However, that is just one measure."
"We have to take a series of measures to achieve our goal."
"We need a smoking ban, which I will come back to in a minute; advertising bans, which we already have; warnings and pictorial warnings, which we have covered; and also educational campaigns."
"It is true that this is a lifestyle choice, and that people will eventually make their choice."
"However, we have to help them take their decision based on the true facts and, in a way, counterbalance the aggressive marketing techniques of the tobacco industry, which is spending billions of euros."
"We have to be able to advise and explain the problems to people, and also give them incentives not to smoke or to give up smoking."
"That is a very important area."
"Concerning smoking ban exceptions, these are better than having no ban at all."
"I accept that."
"However, the fact is that this will not make things as effective as with a comprehensive smoking ban, with this being not only for the protection of passive smokers, as I have already said, but also an incentive for smokers to quit and a disincentive for non-smokers not to begin smoking."
"We should not undermine that."
"It is not strange that the majority of smokers also support the introduction of smoking bans, because they want to smoke when they decide to and not to have to breathe everybody else's smoke."
"This is not a theoretical discussion."
"I know there were concerns a few years ago and, because this is a new debate, concerns are still being expressed."
"However, we now have some experience and we know that it works, and we know that it does not lead to smoking somewhere else."
"There is now a reduction in the number of smokers and smoking-related problems and, at the same time, we have seen that it has not affected certain sectors of the economy where there was a worry."
"So we can draw on those experiences and explain to Member States - and even Members of this Parliament - who are reluctant what the benefits are and how effective they can be."
"Concerning the issue of ingredients and additives, we are working on this."
"We are taking very seriously into account Parliament's position."
"Mr Florenz has been nagging me on this for the past few years."
"We are proceeding with that, but it needs a lot of work because the directive, as originally adopted, was not functional."
"So now we are trying to streamline the provision of information, and we will proceed with the assessment of the risks involved."
"Concerning illegal and illicit trade, we are working within the context of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and are currently working a protocol to control that trade."
"The European Union is very active in this respect, and will remain so."
"I again want to emphasise that we are not acting against smokers, and agree with those who have made that point."
"On the contrary, all these measures will benefit smokers as well."
"I know the issue of 'snus' is a sensitive one for one Member State."
"However, I have to say, first of all, that the case of Holland is totally different because that Member State did not ask for a derogation, as Sweden did."
"However, at the same time - and I would be happy to have a more thorough discussion on this - snus is not a safe alternative."
"It is just as dangerous, as it causes different forms of cancer and different forms of illnesses."
"Very soon, at the beginning of next year, we will have all the evidence."
"I am actually quoting Swedish experts."
"So it is not a question of the rest of the European Union, which is not using it, showing prejudice."
"I am quoting Swedish experts who have shown me a huge pile of evidence in this respect."
"Snus might not cause lung cancer, because it is not inhaled, but it has effects and causes problems."
"At the same time, there is no evidence that it can be effective as a tobacco-control or smoking-control measure."
"I would therefore be very reluctant in this area, and really doubt there is any scientific evidence allowing this."
"However, I have to say that I can see a tremendous effort on the part of the tobacco industry, because it now feels threatened by smoke-free policies, to promote snus."
"We should be cautious in this respect, because it could cause other problems and it could be expanded and promoted in an aggressive commercial way."
"I would be very reluctant to change the status quo as it stands today in the European Union, and we have the judgment of the European Court of Justice to support us in this respect."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank all the Members again for this very interesting debate."
"I take note of those who support and those who are against the Commission's policies."
"It is very important for us to hear all your views."
"I shall be having a more thorough discussion with you in the near future - next year - with a specific proposal from the Commission based on the discussion today."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) Smoking is a major public health problem that claims several hundred thousand victims every year, including non-smokers."
"As this is a problem on a global scale, it calls for multifaceted action, commitment on the part of Member States, and effective legislation that is even tougher than hitherto."
"Protection of European citizens' health demands this."
"Clearly, the road to achieving the primary objective, a smoke-free Europe, will be a long one, requiring tremendous effort and commitment."
"For this reason, we have to take things one step at a time."
"Several Member States have set an example that we should follow, taking sound and effective action to avert the dangers of passive smoking."
"One of the next steps should be to introduce a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including the catering sector, all public buildings and all public transport within two years throughout the whole of the European Union."
"To combat smoking successfully, we need a sound basis, a comprehensive Community strategy based on relevant studies and the best empirical knowledge, aimed at controlling smoking and encouraging people to quit."
"Planning effective legislative measures, prevention and education all have a key role to play in such a strategy."
"in writing. - (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, every year cigarette smoking leads over 650 000 Europeans to a premature death."
"None of them decides to take up smoking in the desire to kill themselves."
"Smokers are addicts, slaves of persistent, decades-long propaganda."
"Only tough PR can explain the fact that whilst 86% of Europeans believe that the workplace should be smoke-free, only 61% think that the same should be true for bars and restaurants."
"Ladies and gentlemen, waiters and bar staff also have a right to life and to health protection!"
"Each year 80 000 people die from passive smoking."
"Regardless of their own wishes they have breathed in a mixture of 250 carcinogens and toxins."
"Waiters in establishments where smoking is allowed are 50% more likely to contract lung cancer than staff working in smoke-free establishments."
"None of this is news."
"Yet 30% of European Union citizens are smokers."
"The free market economy has not stopped an unhealthy habit which causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and costs taxpayers billions."
"It is clear that lawmakers must act."
"I agree with the report that only a 100% smoke-free environment is an environment which can meet today's health requirements."
"In addition to a ban, however, we also need measures which help smokers free themselves from their addiction."
"We need only look at the sums spent by the tobacco industry on advertising to understand the enormity of the challenge we face."
"Half-measures are no longer adequate."
"It is time to act in earnest."
"Protocol amending TRIPS (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation by Gianluca Susta, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement (08934/2006 - C6-0359/2006 -"
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretariat of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in Parliament for the support it has given me."
"I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, as well as Mr Van Hecke, who preceded me in covering this dossier, for the excellent work carried out and for managing to maintain the unity of our institution right through to the end."
"In my opinion, this has been Parliament's greatest strength in the campaign to promote access to medicines in the developing and less-developed countries where they are most needed."
"The right to health and access to health at affordable prices are fundamental rights and should be guaranteed for all citizens."
"Unfortunately we know only too well that this is not always the case: all too often the prices imposed by the pharmaceutical industry are too high, with the result that countries where they are most needed find themselves in difficulty."
"For this reason, as I have already said on several occasions, both in the Committee on International Trade and in plenary, Parliament could not blindly accept the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement as if it were a universal panacea, and then consider the matter resolved."
"Parliament wanted more to be done, at least within the European Union, because the European Union can and must do more."
"Even in the light of the regrettable events of this summer, such as the exchange of letters with Thailand, even if partially resolved, the European Parliament, which has always been a great advocate of using all the flexibilities offered by the TRIPS Agreement, could not give the go-ahead for the ratification of the protocol without obtaining real and effective guarantees from the Commission and the Council."
"I think it is fair to stress that during these months of close collaboration with the Commission and the Council, we have undoubtedly achieved an important goal for the European Union, by putting an essentially technical dossier at the top of the European political agenda."
"I believe that the end result can be qualified as a success, not only for this reason, but above all because we have succeeded in making progress in extremely sensitive areas, such as encouraging the use of the flexibilities provided for under the TRIPS Agreement so that we can promote access to essential medicines at affordable prices within the framework of national public health programmes."
"I particularly support the explicit reference contained in the Council Statement - presented on Monday - to Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement."
"For my group, this represents a guarantee and an assurance that Member States will be able to use this instrument without coming under pressure and that there will be easier access to medicines in countries where they are most needed."
"Secondly: I am also delighted at the results obtained in terms of TRIPS-plus, namely the more stringent provisions as regards those provided for under the TRIPS Agreement."
"Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed that there should be no negotiations in future bilateral or regional agreements with developing countries on provisions that might have negative consequences for health and access to medicines."
"Despite this, while recognising the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, I would like to ask whether the text of the statement can be further improved, particularly in the section referring to poor developing countries."
"This expression could create confusion, since it is now customary to refer only to developing countries and to the category of less-developed countries."
"To insert a new category would complicate the situation."
"Above all, it is important to stress that all developing countries, hence even countries such as Brazil, India, etc., must be able to use the current system without running the risk of pejorative provisions being introduced in future."
"Last but not least, it is vital to underline the efforts made to date in terms of the transfer of research and technological development to southern countries."
"The ALDE Group is ready to give its assent because it believes that a 'no' would send out a negative signal to the countries most in need, and would be irresponsible on the part of the European Union given that the reopening of the WTO negotiations is unrealistic."
"However, this does not change the fact that we continue to have reservations about the efficiency of the mechanism studied and approved by the WTO."
"For this reason, and I am almost at the end now, I would like to confirm that the EU will not stop here."
"Parliament will do everything it can to ensure that the guarantees that have been given over the past few months will be honoured in practice."
"Therefore we ask Commissioner Mandelson, who in his letter confirmed that he did not intend to negotiate TRIPS-plus provisions, to remove from the draft Economic Partnership Agreement with the Caribbean countries the request for adherence to and acceptance of the obligations of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Patent Law Treaty and the intellectual property provisions of Directive 2004/48/EC on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, which unequivocally resemble TRIPS-plus provisions."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased that we have been able to find a solution agreeable to all on the important issue of access to medicines for poor, developing countries."
"Our debate during the last months has been fruitful and I would like to thank Parliament for the intensity and the quality of our exchanges."
"The Commission has always been receptive to the concerns expressed by Parliament and, indeed, shares most of them."
"That is why the Commission was at the forefront of the debate on TRIPS and access to medicines in the WTO."
"I have seen in this debate an opportunity for the Commission to clarify its position on a number of issues."
"We all agree that the amendment of the TRIPS agreement is one part of the solution among many others to the problem of access to medicines."
"Obviously, other measures are needed, in particular to improve health care systems and the infrastructures, notably in poor, developing countries."
"Some Members fear that the mechanism will not work."
"This is certainly too early to assert."
"In our regulation implementing the waiver, and together with Parliament, we agreed to evaluate it three years after its entry into force, and we will do it."
"We also support the work of the intergovernmental working group with the WHO to explore other measures to further improve access to medicines."
"The Commission has been able to reaffirm its attachment to the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement on public health and its support for the flexibilities contained therein."
"Similarly, this debate allows me to dispel any misunderstanding about what the Commission is doing in the economic partnership agreements with ACP countries."
"Let me confirm that, in those agreements and in other future bilateral and regional agreements with poor developing countries, the Commission is not asking and will not ask for provisions which could affect access to medicines or undermine the TRIPS flexibilities contained in the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health."
"Thanks to this frank and direct debate Parliament is now in a position to give its assent to the Commission proposal."
"The European Community will then join the other WTO members which have already accepted the TRIPS agreement."
"This acceptance will enable the EC to continue to play a leading role in the WTO on the issue of access to medicines."
"To conclude, I would like to insist that access to medicines remains a priority for the Commission and I am willing to continue to work in a constructive spirit with Parliament on this matter in the future."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that the Council is not represented in our debate this evening because for once it is our main contact."
"The atmosphere here is euphoric, everyone is in agreement and tomorrow we are going to vote - by a crushing majority, I think - for the ratification of this amendment to the TRIPS agreement, which is supposed to provide and should provide better access to medicines for countries that are not sufficiently developed and do not have a pharmaceutical industry that allows them this access."
"What happened during the long debate we have had on this, is that Parliament was a little more doubtful than the Commission about the efficacy of this system."
"I believe - and I would like to thank the Council here for having listened to Parliament more than the Commission, for once - that this is what led to the statement distributed on Monday morning, thanks to which we have accepted that an agreement between us enables us to make this small step forward."
"It is an improvement, but it is an improvement the inadequacy of which we are aware of and regarding the effectiveness of which we have a few doubts."
"These few doubts need to be removed by the stringency with which the Member States and the Council apply the recommendations."
"I am delighted, however, by what has just been said by Mr Mandelson, who has himself announced a group of experts to find other measures, and an evaluation of these measures, and I think we will be discussing these matters again once we have seen whether the effectiveness meets our expectations."
"In any case, I am pleased about the positive conclusion to this necessary stage, even if it does not go far enough."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, as rapporteur of the European People's Party I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sousa, and my other fellow Members for the productive cooperation we have enjoyed, for it enabled us to overcome certain differences between political groups and to maintain a united position on this important issue."
"The European Parliament has not been limited to areas of responsibility as laid down by the Treaty; it has not been restricted merely to giving its assent."
"In the July resolution a political victory was achieved expressing a united will transcending party politics."
"Making commitments by the Commission and the Council was sought and achieved."
"They coincide to a great extent with the views of the European Parliament."
"It could be said to have been a rehearsal for institutional cooperation in light of the new role the European Parliament will play once the Reform Treaty has been adopted."
"The acceptance by the Union of the amendment is thus backed up by real commitments, which ensure the process works successfully."
"The commitments also go much further: they lay down guidelines for an integrated approach to the issue of the public health of developing countries."
"The acceptance by the Union of the amendment to the TRIPS Agreement sends a positive and hopeful message to developing countries."
"We hope that it will also involve the active cooperation of other members of the WTO."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during our last debate in July on access to medicines, I concluded my comments by calling on the Council and the Commission to make clear and formal commitments that would guarantee Europe's active involvement in finding new solutions and its desire to be a front runner in the fight for access to affordable medicines for everyone."
"We could not be content with a debate in which no precise commitments were made, and I note today that, after several months of exchanges between the three institutions, certain proposals we had made and that we really wanted are becoming a reality."
"First allow me to applaud the parliamentary work done, and done with a constant concern for accountability and openness."
"The three successive postponements of the vote in Parliament were motivated by a commitment to global public health."
"This showed us that the word 'solidarity' still had meaning in European policies."
"I would therefore like to thank first of all our rapporteur Mr Susta for his powers of persuasion and capacity for resistance, and all the shadow rapporteurs from the political groups, who throughout these months of collaboration, effort and Common conviction, have risen above party politics to show the quality of work that Parliament can produce."
"I therefore hope that the Council and the Commission will be able to demonstrate that the commitments made over the last few months during our various exchanges and in the written statement we have received will be respected."
"These commitments are: that the Member States are free to use all the clauses allowing them to produce generic medicines and export them to developing countries, and not only to poor developing countries; that these developing countries can use all the flexibilities in the Doha Declaration to provide their populations with the essential medicines they need; that the European Union will not negotiate public health-related provisions in negotiations on trade agreements - and I also note the statements by the Commissioner; and finally that the EU will finance projects to develop research and manufacturing capabilities in these countries."
"These are positive steps forward, and we want to make capital of them now, but I would like nevertheless to say that not all the issues raised by Parliament, or its legitimate concerns, have necessarily met with the desired responses from the other institutions."
"Our fight for access to medicines for everyone in the world goes on."
"That is why we will remain extremely vigilant regarding the application of the commitments made by the Council and the Commission today, and at the same time we will continue to demand that all our concerns receive a rapid, adequate response in the coming months."
"I recall that the first of the commitments made to Parliament was to complete the evaluation of the mechanism that we are to adopt tomorrow."
"Doubts persist over this, and they need to be addressed."
"Should that not be the case, in line with the commitments made to the developing countries concerned, the EU should draw the appropriate conclusions to come up with a truly viable, sustainable solution."
"I am therefore pleased about the commitments made by the Council and the Commission, and I will therefore call upon my group to vote in favour of ratification tomorrow, even though the long weeks of work we have just experienced lead me to think that, far from reaching an end, the collective agreement we have made is only just beginning."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) The WTO decision of 30 August 2003, which provided for a temporary derogation from the TRIPS Agreement, has now been transformed into a permanent derogation by a new decision of 6 December 2005."
"In his report, Mr Susta makes a number of very pertinent remarks on the practicability of compulsory licensing."
"I recognise very many elements from my 2005 report transforming the temporary derogation into a European regulation."
"I fully support the recommendations of the Council and the Commission, which Mr Susta links with the avis conforme."
"The mechanism created is indeed only a limited solution to the problem of inadequate access to medicines in poor countries."
"The EU must help developing countries find a long-term solution in terms of obtaining the most essential medicines at affordable price, and must stimulate investment in local production facilities."
"The transfer of technology, research and technical assistance are of course essential in this respect."
"In this regard, I would refer to recent reports stating that the market share of generic medicines is falling once again, and giving the cause as the cheap production by pharmaceutical companies themselves of medicines whose patent protection has expired."
"This must present opportunities for poor countries, where, in line with the WTO decision, compulsory licensing can offer a solution in respect of medicines still protected by patents."
"If we do not want to give vain hope to the millions of people still unable to benefit from the most essential medicines, more - much more - will be needed than a mechanism whose practicability is and remains highly dubious."
"Mr President, as it happens, 14 years ago I was involved in the issue of intellectual rights in the Polish Parliament, as chairman of a special subcommittee."
"Today I have the honour of doing the same in our European Parliament."
"Like those who have spoken before me, I would like to emphasise the significant progress that we have made over the last few months, and I would like to stress that, as we see it, the European Parliament has done a lot to put right what was proposed by the European Commission."
"I am thoroughly convinced that the compromise we are proposing will help to improve access to pharmaceutical products in Third World countries, as they are what mainly concern us."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, if I have understood correctly the Council will read the statement before the vote, otherwise there will be no binding commitment."
"I would then ask you to omit the word poor developing countries."
"It is completely irrelevant and meaningless in previous agreements."
"There are developing countries and there are the least developed countries, and Parliament wants both these groups of countries to be able to benefit from these mechanisms."
"It is clear that we are speaking the same language here."
"It is something I was wondering about in your speech, Mr Mandelson: you said that ACP countries had nothing to worry about, but then you also said poor developing countries, ACP countries."
"I hope that we are not restricting the discussion to them, and that your letter to Thailand does not set the limits for this, but that we are perfectly clear that developing countries which are not among the poorest also really need to be able to protect public health in order to be able to develop effectively, and that we must give them all the help and support we can."
"I hope that we agree on this."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has been called upon to express an opinion on whether the amendment to the WTO agreements on intellectual property - the 'TRIPS Agreements' - can be made permanent, as this would represent a swift solution to the problem of access to medicines by developing countries."
"Considering that up to now, this amendment has offered no proof of its real effectiveness, it is important for the European Parliament to seize the opportunity offered by the ratification of the TRIPS amendment to secure greater guarantees that EU policy on access to medicines will be comprehensive, coherent and effective."
"The TRIPS Agreement, as the Council has recognised, represents only part of the solution to the problem of access to medicines and public health; it is important therefore that the Council, as emphasised several times by Parliament, should declare its support for all those countries who intend to take advantage of the flexibilities offered by the TRIPS Agreements, to be able to provide essential medicines at affordable prices."
"The European Union must do more to stem the health crisis in the world's poorest countries, particularly by ensuring that these countries can meet their own needs, without burdening them with bilateral or regional agreements, the 'TRIPS-plus' Agreements, on provisions relating to pharmaceutical products that risk having a negative impact on access to public health and medicines."
"We also believe that it is the task of the Commission and the Council to support WTO initiatives to make TRIPS rules less complex, and specifically to maximise product availability."
"(PL) Mr President, halfway through it has transpired that among the millennium goals, we have done worst in combating TB, HIV and malaria."
"World Health Organisation statistics show that in 2005 more than one and a half million people died of TB, which had a high mortality rate in Europe before World War II."
"Each day 27 000 people die because of a lack of access to basic medicines."
"Health is an inseparable condition for wellbeing and economic development, and I believe it is our moral duty to help less well developed countries in this respect."
"One positive step is to provide support for the protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement in order to allow access to medicines."
"It is not a complete solution, but we cannot not take the risk if we are to protect the lives of millions of people."
"There is a risk."
"To begin with, obtaining a licence for the production of generics for export to countries in need is hedged round by numerous conditions that might put people off such an undertaking."
"Secondly, production of medicines of this type may create circumstances for abuse on the part of both the beneficiaries and the exporters themselves, and on top of that the infrastructure in poor countries is so weak that it is just not possible to undertake production there."
"For this reason some kind of extra, multi-level aid instruments are needed."
"It seems to me that the most important thing is financial aid intended for setting up local production centres, technology transfer, and investment in development and innovation."
"We are obliged to show social solidarity with these countries, but we are the ones who have to work out a way that will do most to increase the effectiveness of the aid provided while at the same time protecting our own market."
"Finally, Commissioner, I want to say that the Commission - and you, yourself, as head of a specific committee - have plenty of scope for new ideas to think about."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing tonight and will be voting on tomorrow will be a small but important building block in the cooperation between the institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"In this procedure, Parliament's only options are to agree with the proposal or reject it."
"The way that Mr Susta, the rapporteur, and all the shadow rapporteurs - and here I would like to thank particularly Kader Arif from my group - have handled it increased considerably the predefined scope for Parliament to take action."
"However, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for expressly pointing out that this accord, this Protocol, which we will vote on tomorrow and which Member States will then be able to ratify, is only a building block - an important one, but only a building block - and that there are many more steps to be taken to give developing countries with no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector a real opportunity, which they need, to provide their citizens with essential medicines."
"This step will help us in our cooperation and it will especially help us when Parliament gains further rights of consent in the many other policy areas, in the area of trade, for example."
"I extend sincere thanks to the Council and the Commission and all the Members who made it possible actually to achieve the flexibility that we now have."
"(PT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the ethical importance of this issue, the discussion that we are engaged in is of great political relevance."
"The dichotomy between protecting intellectual property and promoting the health and well-being of the populations of less-developed countries arises out of a conflict of interests that can be resolved only by a comparison of values."
"Simply put, this opposition is clear."
"On the one hand we have a certain debatable model of protecting intellectual property based on the argument of the incentive for innovation and the consequent expansion of scientific knowledge, while on the other are millions of poor human beings, living in countries with scarce resources who cannot be condemned to suffer and die for economic reasons at a time when we have the knowledge that can save their lives."
"This comparison makes it clear on which side the fundamental values lie."
"In this light, at various times and in various places certain steps have already been taken to make the intellectual property protection system more flexible so as to promote access to medicines for all."
"However, it turns out that progress so far is not sufficient."
"The mechanism now being considered is merely a means of easing such a distressing problem."
"We need to go further."
"Parliament has pointed in this direction, making a decisive contribution to encourage the EU to adopt a position in line with its underlying values."
"The solution now found reveals this concern and I would therefore like to commend the Presidency of the Council for its efforts to achieve, through statements and commitments, a position that shows Europe at its best: a political community always set on irrecusable humanist values."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Qualifications framework for lifelong learning (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mario Mantovani, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning - C6-0294/2006 -"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Mantovani and I would like to express the Commission's thanks to him and to the responsible committees for their proactive engagement and supportive stance throughout the negotiations on the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) for lifelong learning."
"This recommendation goes to the heart of what the EU is about: mobility, cooperation between countries, promoting prosperity and helping individual citizens."
"We propose the EQF because you, the European Parliament, and the Member States asked us to find ways of promoting mobility and lifelong learning, without which we cannot achieve the Lisbon goals."
"The EQF has been developed within the Education and Training 2010 work programme, the education dimension of the Lisbon Agenda."
"The EQF seeks to overcome the barriers that remain to European workers and learners when they wish to change jobs or move to another country for work or for study."
"Too often, Europeans have difficulty in using their qualifications in another European country."
"Even in their own country they find their educational pathways blocked by poor integration of the different parts of their national education system."
"The EQF will relate the countries' different national qualification systems to each other, acting as a translation device."
"It will thus make other countries' qualifications more readable and so enable individuals to move to another country if they wish to work or study."
"At the national level it will - indeed it is already doing this - stimulate the development of national qualifications frameworks."
"Qualifications frameworks promote lifelong learning by, for example, making it easier for people to move between different types of education and training institutions, for example from vocational training to higher education."
"I should acknowledge that the EQF is a technical, even complex instrument."
"It will be used mainly by experts and educational authorities, but it is for the benefit of the citizen."
"What we are debating today is the product of a collective endeavour between the Commission, countries, social partners, education and training associations and other stakeholders."
"The EQF has very much been built on a consensus and we have sought to carry stakeholders with us throughout the process."
"The EQF recommends that countries relate their qualification systems to the EQF by 2010 and ensure that individual national qualifications carry a reference to the appropriate EQF level by 2012."
"These dates were proposed by the Council and Parliament."
"We have also been happy to agree to the insertion of a new recommendation on quality assurance proposed by Parliament, which we feel reinforces the importance of these principles."
"We also agree to Parliament's proposal to include a reference to credit systems which recognises the rapid development and application of these components of qualifications frameworks."
"We believe that Parliament and the Council have indeed improved the text."
"The approach adopted in the negotiations by the Parliament, Council and Commission reflects the consensus behind the EQF across Europe."
"There is now a momentum behind the EQF; the great majority of countries recognise its potential for mobility and as a lifelong learning instrument."
"A large majority are now developing a national qualifications framework related to the EQF, so this proposal is already having a major impact on Europe's education and training systems."
"I hope you can agree to support this proposal at first reading so that it can formally be adopted by the Council in the coming weeks."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that tonight marks the beginning of a major project which Europe, the Member States and the regions and cities of the European Union have been waiting for for a long time, a goal that various stakeholders in the fields of education, employment, trade and the economy have been working towards for years, and something that society as a whole wants."
"Tomorrow, with the approval of the European Qualifications Framework, we will lay the foundations for a better tomorrow, giving future generations a common point of reference for their cultural, educational and vocational engagement, training and of course employment."
"In keeping with the Lisbon Strategy, the European Qualifications Framework represents a direct channel for improving links between schools, universities and the workplace, and between formal, informal and non-formal lifelong learning, ensuring transparency in the recognition of qualifications and certificates, both at national and sectoral level, and always within the European framework. Finally, it will strengthen cooperation between Member States in the sensitive area of comparing different systems."
"This is the recurring theme which, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, has led us to assume the proper responsibility, with a choice that I am certain will promote growth, development and competitiveness in a Europe obliged to recognise social cohesion as one of its objectives."
"It is a longstanding project, arising from the Bologna process as the system of accumulation and transfer of credits as an equivalent, before surfacing again at the Barcelona Summit system for vocational training."
"It was improved at Bergen in 2004, and again in the 2005 Council, which reiterated the need to adopt the current framework."
"An historic journey that clearly illustrates the ambition of European decision-makers to create a new instrument, considered by many as revolutionary, but necessary for the European integration process which we have been persuing for so many years."
"I am convinced, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that this framework will not only encourage cross-border mobility, but will act as the driving force for the EU's internal mobility - if we think of students, workers, researchers and volunteers in general, and all those who need to move freely through Europe without causing panic or undue concern."
"You must remember the story of the Polish plumber, which terrified France: it was one of the main reasons why the French voted against the European Constitution in the referendum."
"Well, the text we now have before us is the result of many months' work, of close collaboration with the Council representatives under the Portuguese Presidency, which immediately saw the importance of this ambitious project."
"The Commission, in the person of Commissioner Figeľ, has kept a close eye on this process throughout, and it is thanks to this spirit of partnership that we were able to improve the text, inserting key concepts close to the heart of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"For this, I am extremely grateful to my colleagues, to the shadow rapporteurs - I see Mrs Castex, Mr Kusstatscher, the liberals - as well as Mr Mann and Mr Kasoulides, and all those who contributed to this."
"Thanks to their generous involvement and commitment, we were able to include the following concepts: social integration; the requirements of the labour market; personal development along different training paths; non-discrimination with the inclusion of disadvantaged persons; equal opportunities; respect for the principle of subsidiarity and the creation of coordination points within the Member States."
"We also made sure that the recommendation was non-binding, even though it remains legislative in nature."
"Obviously this was not down to any weakness, but came more from a sense of responsibility and realism in order to encourage and promote the application of this instrument in those countries that need more time."
"In short, there is no doubt that it can be improved, but in this life everything can be improved."
"However, I am convinced that we have before us a text with a soul and a conscience."
"It is my belief that the job of the European Parliament is to legislate in the real interests of citizens. Well, this is what we have done here."
"The approval of the text at first reading is evidence of this, partly thanks to Mr Gaľa on the Committee on Culture and Education, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which all made a positive contribution."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, because he has really tackled a subject that goes much further than we might imagine."
"Really, in a globalised world, Europe and the various EU countries will be defined by the qualifications of their human resources."
"If we had to summarise in one pillar what it is that is going to enable Europe, and all the countries that make up Europe, to be competitive in this global world, it is the qualifications of the human resources, the citizens of Europe."
"With this in mind, it is absolutely essential that lifelong education and training should be adapted to the demands of the labour market and constantly respond to them."
"If this is not the case, it will be impossible to compete."
"We will also come up against the following paradox: people are getting older, but these older people are getting younger and potentially more active, yet they have insufficient resources to continue being productive and giving to society and finding fulfilment in the world of employment."
"With this in mind, the first aspect is that lifelong training, based essentially on a technological dimension, which is what gives added value, should be a fundamental concern."
"There is, however, a second aspect, which concerns the future of Europe, and this is integrating these human resources into a competitive internal market, for which qualifications are needed that are recognised by all Member States, which will enable citizens from different countries to compete with each other based on training that is recognised by all."
"Therefore, because it is necessary for individual development in such a competitive world and because it is necessary for the development of the internal market, this is a subject that has much greater importance than it is perhaps being given by being debated so late in the day."
"Thank you, Mrs del Castillo, the evening debates are always the most interesting though."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (SK) Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, for his work on the report on the European Qualifications Framework."
"We have been debating this subject in the European Parliament since spring 2006."
"As we know, a strong mandate for the European Qualifications Framework is an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It will serve as a translation device between different qualifications systems and their levels, and its implementation will result in greater transparency, comparability and portability of citizens' qualifications in individual Member States."
"In addition, the European Qualifications Framework will help international sectoral organisations to improve the links between their sectoral qualifications systems and national qualifications systems, thus helping to increase the mobility of workers and learners."
"In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, I express my support for the non-binding nature of the European Qualifications Framework in the Member States and for the creation of national qualifications systems in accordance with national legislation and practice."
"However, the European Qualifications Framework will become an effective instrument for recognition and comparability of qualifications at a European scale only if it is consistently implemented as a part of the lifelong learning systems in the EU Member States."
"Since the EQF is directly linked to the way in which citizens assert themselves on the labour market and affects the quality of vocational education and training, it can also be considered a relevant tool for boosting competitiveness."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the European Qualifications Framework is the starting signal for the emancipation of vocational training at EU level, as it will enable vocational qualifications to be recognised throughout Europe, just as academic qualifications are."
"This takes time and requires a willingness to cooperate, coordinate and change mindsets."
"People who defend only what they know, and shy away from new experiences, should not be surprised to find that they lack mobility."
"We need greater clarity."
"National training qualifications must be comparable, although this does not mean that they have to be standardised."
"I already called for this last year, in the EQF own-initiative report that I prepared for Parliament."
"A great deal has happened since then."
"Fears that Member States would lose powers have been allayed including in my country."
"Lifelong learning and the EQF were major milestones of the German Council Presidency, which was acknowledged as successful."
"Now it is full steam ahead with creating a national qualifications framework, which is not exactly easy, given Germany's federal structure and the autonomy of each Land."
"I would like to thank Mario Mantovani on behalf of the PPE-DE Group for his tenacity in dealing with the Commission and the Council and for keeping everyone in the Groups who followed the EQF informed."
"I do hope that the report will be adopted in the first reading tomorrow."
"From now on, there is a need for much discussion between trainers, teachers and training institutions, as we go into the details."
"I experienced this just yesterday in a meeting with vocational college teachers in Hesse."
"When ranking qualifications, for example, the German Master Craftsman or Tradesman Certificate belongs in at least the third or fourth of the eight levels."
"Others are not familiar with this qualification at all."
"The strength of the German dual system is not apparent to people unless they have experienced it for themselves."
"In our European teaching and learning workshop, which is based on the principle of subsidiarity, the employment and vocational policy dimensions will be considerably strengthened in education and training."
"Together we must and will achieve an ambitious goal: to incorporate a quality standard, the EQF, in certificates and diplomas by 2010."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, first I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent consultation on this recommendation on the European Qualifications Framework."
"I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for listening and being available to everyone."
"In the EQF we have a tool that serves the mobility of European citizens, whether as part of training pathways or as part of professional mobility."
"Free movement of persons, which is written into our Treaties, is still hindered by citizens' difficulties in having the qualifications obtained in their country of origin recognised throughout the EU."
"These qualifications, which are awarded by each Member States, according to its own procedures and systems, come under the sovereignty of each Member State and the EQF respects this."
"However, qualifications increasingly need to be used outside the country in which they were awarded, something we wish to encourage out of respect for the value that the diploma or other qualification gives to its holder."
"We therefore need a tool for comparing and especially for converting qualifications from one Member State to another."
"This is a particularly necessary and sensitive issue for professional qualifications."
"That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was keen to incorporate professional qualifications into the EQF."
"This has been done and we are glad."
"Employees and companies are increasingly mobile in the European job market."
"However, employees and employers therefore need guarantees, in all Member States, concerning those things that measure the competence and value of a worker, namely their professional qualifications, regardless of how they were acquired."
"Commissioner, I would, however, like to underline one other point."
"At the moment the EQF is a nice but empty shell."
"For it to exist properly, the diplomas, qualifications and certifications created in each Member State need to be calibrated and registered against references in the European Qualifications Framework."
"This will constitute a large amount of work for all the Member States, and will require a lot of energy and specialist expertise."
"The European Commission's support will be essential, as will that of the European agencies - I am thinking in particular of Cedefop."
"The participation of the social partners will also be essential, at all levels. They must be involved, as the recommendation states, by the Member States and the sectoral dialogue committees at Community level."
"Finally, for the EQF to be complete and effective, it will also be necessary for the economic partners, the professional branches, to understand and appropriate it for themselves."
"This is not only because they award the qualifications that should be included in the EQF, but because companies need benchmarks for classifying their jobs and for recruiting."
"The EQF rapidly needs to become their common reference framework and I dream of an appropriate deadline by which the EQF will be the reference framework everywhere, even in collective agreements."
"Mr President, establishing the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning is something that is of significance to the Europe of today and of the future."
"Whether a person will be fulfilled in their personal life and in society depends, after all, on that person's preparation for life and for work."
"Historical and contemporary determinants have given rise to a need to devote particular attention to people aged 50 and over and to young people from families experiencing economic difficulties, especially in the new Member States."
"Not all of them can, or should, go abroad in search of work."
"Conditions need to be created for people to develop in their own environment, in the place where they live."
"National qualification frameworks should mean an instrument serving to classify qualifications in line with criteria laid down for specific, attainable levels of study."
"The European Union should support the efforts of Member States both legally and economically."
"The Union should offer citizens not only the potential for free movement, but also recognition of their occupational qualifications."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all, thank you very much to Mario Mantovani, who followed the footsteps of his neighbour on the bench in this question."
"We have before us the result, which will require educational authorities in the Member States to use this shared framework as a translation device and a reference point."
"There is plenty of room for more pressure to be applied for greater transparency, better comparability and thus equality and recognition of different qualifications within the EU."
"I particularly welcome the fact that vocational training is specifically mentioned alongside general education, and given equal status, and that not only formal diplomas will be measured against the standard but also informal skills that people gain in the workplace or at home."
"Tricks are often used to make access to the labour market more difficult."
"Not infrequently, educational authorities, vocational boards and professional associations attempt to resist competition from outside by being reluctant to recognise tertiary and vocational education qualifications gained elsewhere, for reasons of form."
"In 2010 that will be a thing of the past."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, 'encouraging lifelong learning' sounds fine, does it not, with the EU working openly for the good of people and for employment?"
"Only this morning, Mr Barroso said that he did not like opt-outs, but was in favour of compromises to respect diversity."
"Those are fine words, but here we are with yet another attempt to bulldoze wonderful diversity into a common, harmonised, featureless landscape."
"Now it is the turn of education, broadly speaking."
"However, education is not within EU competence!"
"It is only covered by proposals under Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty."
"So this is also an attempt to smuggle in a competence by the back door."
"If the EU wishes to assume competence over education, let it do so honestly, go through the usual channels and employ the transparency we hear so much about."
"Following the model of the Bergen Framework, setting up the EUROPASS diploma and certificate supplements with the European credit transfer system will require a harmonised EQF level."
"By issuing qualifications at sectoral and regional level, as well as at national level, this EU proposal will ensure an almost complete grip on qualifications."
"By issuing grades and awarding qualifications it will ensure that the EU bypasses universities and national governments."
"The UK Government is in favour of harmonising qualifications."
"It is preparing for this by placing control of the universities under the Privy Council, ready to hand universities over to the EU."
"What universities think of this seems to be immaterial."
"HMG's true position is revealed by its only objection to this scheme."
"It does not want the EU logo on the qualification documents."
"That is because they do not want people to know that education has been handed over to the EU."
"Please tell me, why is it that my Government has taken that stance?"
"Why is it in favour of an EU project but wants to keep it from the people?"
"Are other national governments taking the same line?"
"I would not be surprised if they were, because they, too, may wish to keep it from their people that their universities are being used in this way."
"You may gather that I do not like this project, but it is not for reasons of national pride in Britain's universities and colleges. No."
"It is because, as a teacher, I value education and recognise that European countries have universities of which they are justly proud - great centres of learning whose alumni have contributed down the centuries to the arts, literature and science, enriching the lives of people everywhere."
"I recognise also that this impetus to civilisation came about because those seats of learning evolved separately and independently, with each developing its own particular flavour and identity."
"It is strange, is it not, in an age in which personal identity is being jealously guarded and identity theft is regarded as the crime it is, that some people thoughtlessly seek to destroy the unique identity of the institutions which made them what they are, denying others the education they acquired there?"
"(EL) Mr President, we should not have been able to debate the proposal to recommend a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) today had not our fellow Member, Mr Mantovani, made good use of the experience of former MEPs working on the subject or collaborated so well with the Commission and the Council."
"Today we can thus deal with setting up the eight qualification levels covering general education, adult education, vocational education and training, and the three levels of tertiary education qualifications."
"In answer to my fellow Member who spoke previously, we stress that Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty are the right legal basis for the proposed recommendation simply because they allow for lifelong learning."
"Under no circumstances do we accept that education should be an EU area of responsibility: it remains the preserve of national responsibility."
"Comparing qualifications within the EQF, however, ignores teaching methods and types of educational establishment."
"As a result, such a comparison refers only to knowledge, the capacity to understand, and the practical application of knowledge and skills."
"Greece and many other states are particularly keen on the optional nature of the EQF."
"The view has officially been expressed that promoting qualifications league tables has nothing to do with shaping the national educational system or recognising certification for studies."
"Besides, for non-formal and informal education, because of its diversity and the special circumstances under which it is acquired, automatic certification is not possible, but a mere reference."
"We must also bear in mind that the same person can have several qualifications at various levels."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning is a decisive document to enable the national and sectoral reference frameworks of qualifications to be compared at European level."
"The certification of qualifications obtained is essential to enable progress achieved outside formal education, especially in working life, to be integrated with advances achieved in the formal systems."
"It thus contributes to greater democratisation throughout the EU as regards the management of personal professional careers."
"This directive, as moreover one of the amendments proposed and approved in Parliament emphasises, promotes the validation of these qualifications in accordance with the Council conclusions on common European principles for the identification and validation of non-formal and informal learning."
"Mr President, this will enable us to advance towards a single European legal framework that aims to be coherent without diminishing the guarantees that in some cases exist already."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive that we are discussing will be a decisive tool for greater flexibility on the labour markets, offering a better defence of workers' interests and a better chance of providing quality services."
"At this point I can only welcome the Portuguese Presidency's efforts in the field of education to move surely and relatively quickly towards approval by Parliament at first reading."
"It is clear that in these circumstances we should also highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur Mr Mantovani and the shadow rapporteurs, notably Mrs Castex."
"In order to be more effective, to derive more benefits from professional and academic mobility in the European area we need to work even more effectively in implementing the European Qualifications Framework and in linking it to the European credit system, and this report promotes a significant advance in that direction."
"Thus, the proposal for a directive promotes equality of opportunity in the knowledge society we live in, with the aim of better integrating the labour markets of the various Member States, taking account of the rich diversity of the various national systems."
"It therefore deserves a positive response from us."
"(PL) Mr President, transparency and comparability of qualifications acquired in differing circumstances, systems and countries make it easier to evaluate the level of knowledge both of employees and of employers, thus increasing mobility in the labour market."
"This concerns both regulated professions - doctors, nurses and other medical professions, where qualifications are mutually recognised by EU countries - and other professions."
"The introduction of the Qualifications Frameworks will give rise to greater social cohesion."
"Different treatment should be accorded, however, to artistic educational institutions and professions, where talent and gifts should not be constrained by disciplines, or averaged out, and where the teacher is not objectivised, but continues to be master."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think this has been an extremely good debate which marks the launch of a very important project, which I think is timely, necessary and, as others have pointed out, is a platform for this and future generations."
"It is essential for the working of the single market, it is essential for Europe's social development, it is essential for the ability of Europe's citizens to cope with fast changing economic and labour market change."
"It is a passport to personal advancement as well as society's integration."
"It has been a very constructive and harmonious debate - apart, I suppose, from the intervention of one compatriot who allowed his mixture of gross exaggeration and overstatement, tinged with a fair amount of ideological prejudice, totally to misrepresent what is being envisaged and proposed."
"This is a recommendation, and is exactly that - it is voluntary."
"The EQF will not award qualifications: that remains up to countries, universities and other institutions, which remain autonomous."
"There will be an EQF reference level on qualifications, for example on level 4, but national level will also be on qualification."
"So I am glad to be able to welcome this consensus - notwithstanding one individual - in this Parliament and Council behind the EQF legislative proposal, that this is reflected at the national level, where we see a serious momentum in building national qualifications frameworks."
"The debate is closed."
"At the end of this debate, I would first of all like to thank the interpreters, who chose to stay even though they were not required to."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) The European reference framework will reduce the complexity of a system with 27 bilateral relations for the recognition of qualifications obtained from academic and professional education."
"The Bologna Process of creating, by 2010, a European Education Area is thus supplemented by an instrument of recognition of all qualifications that may be obtained in the Union's Member States."
"Although 9 out of 10 European Union citizens believe lifelong education is an important instrument for career development, the lack of financial resources leads to big deficiencies in the training required for the current economy."
"A recent eurobarometer shows that only 58% of the respondents are able to use a computer, and only one half of them declare that they are Internet users."
"Moreover, over 60% of the citizens cannot use a foreign language in their work."
"National budgets designated to lifelong education vary from 40% of the total amount used for education in Northern countries to under 10% in the new Member States."
"Thus, initiatives such as Grundtvig or Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs should be extended and doubled by funds that would supplement the insufficient national finances."
"Moreover, the European reference framework should be supplemented by programmes that would establish veritable European qualifications, recognized over the entire European Union territory."
"in writing. - (BG) It is necessary to point out that the informal educational sector is underdeveloped, rather unknown and often isolated from the formal one."
"The European Qualifications Framework is a key instrument in overcoming this discrepancy and also a tool to re-assess and re-organise the vocational orientation and information system."
"The development of the EQF will facilitate the mobility of manpower within the 31 participating countries and promote the involvement of sectoral and industrial organisations from the new EU Member States in the absorption of resources from the European Social Fund allocated for the acquisition of new qualifications or upgrading of the existing ones."
"The more recent EU Member States like Bulgaria find it important to have the opportunity to exchange good practices and to implement Community pilot programmes."
"The development and implementation of the European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) intended to facilitate the accumulation, transfer and recognition of educational results, regardless of where and how they have been scored, is of great importance with a view to the transition periods applied to Bulgaria and Romania."
"The credit system will foster the free movement and the expansion of the access to the labour market for most of the human resources in the Community, while ensuring reliable basis for comparisons."
"I believe that the EQF will give further impetus to the development of this process."
"in writing. - (HU) Recognition of citizens' knowledge, skills and competence is indispensable for the European Union's competitiveness and for social cohesion, as well as for individual citizens' mobility."
"Participation in lifelong learning and access to lifelong learning for all, including the disadvantaged, must be fostered and improved at both national and Community level."
"Young people, adults, immigrants and manual labourers throughout Europe who have informally acquired skills that have never been recognised must be encouraged to participate in lifelong learning programmes, thus avoiding social and labour-market exclusion of these groups."
"To do all this, an important role can be played by a common reference framework that serves as a translation device between different qualification systems and their levels, whether for general and higher education or for vocational education and training."
"This will increase the transparency, comparability and mobility of citizens' qualifications in different Member States."
"The task of the reference framework is to integrate and coordinate national qualifications systems, to ensure non-discrimination, to increase access and progression of qualifications in relation to civil society and the labour market."
"In the interests of ending the segregation that exists in education, I support the initiation of measures to provide information and engage in social dialogue."
"I also think it is important to recognise informal learning acquired by workers, in order to enable them to change jobs more easily."
"The European Union must become a knowledge-based society well prepared to meet the challenges of globalisation."
"In such a society, citizens of each Member State must adjust to meet the needs of a competitiveness-driven labour market."
"For this reason, learning will be a fundamental prerequisite for all age groups."
"in writing. - The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) for lifelong learning is a good example of the European Union doing what it should be doing in terms of promoting mobility across national borders."
"Over the years most of us will have made representations on behalf of nationals of our own Member States who find that when they take advantage of the freedom of movement available to them within the EU and actually move to another country they are discriminated against because their qualifications are not properly recognised in their new country of residence."
"The EQF, by acting as a translation tool for national authorities, will undoubtedly help our constituents to overcome this senseless discrimination."
"It should also work to the advantage of any Member State to which a person moves, as it will ensure that an accurate assessment may be made of that individual's qualifications."

"EU-Turkey relations (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on EU-Turkey relations."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency would firstly like to thank the European Parliament, and in particular Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for the motion for a resolution on EU-Turkey relations."
"The Presidency acknowledges and welcomes Parliament's active engagement with the enlargement process as a constructive contribution to the general debate on enlargement and Turkey's accession process in particular."
"There is no doubt that every debate offers a useful opportunity for creating awareness of Turkey's accession process, engaging the citizens of Member States and Turkey in this process and supporting the Turkish Government in its accession path."
"I can assure you that we pay particular attention to the views of the European Parliament."
"In a few days the Commission will present its regular progress report on Turkey's accession process."
"The Council will examine and assess this report very carefully."
"In the meantime, I would like to briefly mention a few points in this phase of Turkey's accession negotiations."
"We are of the opinion that the recent elections in Turkey demonstrated the wish of the Turkish people for democracy, stability - both political and economic - and progress."
"We also welcome how the elections were conducted, the high voter turnout and the improved representativeness of the new Turkish Parliament."
"The Presidency shares the views and concerns of this House regarding Turkey's reform process."
"We believe that the new Government enjoys increased legitimacy and a clear mandate that should enable decisive steps to be made in advancing and broadening the reform process in Turkey."
"It is imperative that the new Government gives fresh impetus to the reforms - and their implementation - by focusing on key areas."
"In this regard, the implementation of the Accession Partnership - in particular as regards its short-term priorities - is of great importance."
"I would remind you that the Accession Partnership must be reviewed in the coming months."
"In this context, I would also like to stress the need for broad consultation and national consensus on Turkey's new Constitution."
"We share your views on the importance of reforms in the crucial area of fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"Further tangible progress is essential, in particular as regards freedom of expression, religious freedom, cultural rights and women's rights, and also further strengthening of the fight against torture and ill-treatment."
"Most of these issues are covered in the Accession Partnership as short-term priorities that Turkey needs to meet."
"In particular, in the area of freedom of expression, we regret the lack of progress despite wide public debate on the issue and we are concerned about the increasing nationalism leading to self-censorship."
"We continue to firmly believe that Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, as well as other vaguely formulated articles, need to be abolished or substantially amended in order to guarantee freedom of expression."
"Progress in this area is of paramount importance for the general advancement of the accession negotiations."
"As for religious freedom, tangible progress is urgently needed, in particular following the tragic incidents earlier this year."
"The adoption of legislation which will comprehensively address all problems faced by non-Muslim communities - such as legal status, property registration and training of the clergy - in order to guarantee religious pluralism in line with European standards is long awaited."
"The Law on Foundations could be a positive first step in this regard and will be carefully assessed once adopted and implemented."
"The recent Supreme Court ruling on the Ecumenical Patriarchate is also an issue of concern."
"We share your views on civil-military relations."
"Recent developments - in particular before and during the election campaign - demonstrate the need for further steps in this area so that the Armed Forces cannot exercise political influence."
"Civilian democratic control over the military in line with practice in EU Member States is still to be ensured."
"Regarding the south-east, we strongly condemned the recent terrorist attack in the province of Sirnak."
"We have also condemned other acts of terror perpetrated in Turkey and will continue to do so."
"Terrorist activities can never be justified."
"We recall our solidarity with the people of Turkey in this regard."
"On the other hand, terrorism should not make us forget about the urgent need to promptly develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that will guarantee the economic, social and cultural development of the south-east."
"This is a complex area that we are closely monitoring as part of the ongoing reform process."
"Apart from compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkey's progress in preparing for accession will be measured against the requirements clearly set out in the Negotiating Framework."
"In this respect, as agreed by the Council in December last year, progress made on the issues covered by the Declaration of 21 September 2005, in particular full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement, will be monitored and reviewed."
"Regrettably, no progress has yet been made on this issue."
"I would also underline that recognition by all Member States is a necessary component of the accession process and that it is therefore vital that the European Union normalises relations between Turkey and all the Member States as soon as possible."
"The work required to ensure compliance with the Union's standards and membership obligations is difficult and demands continuous efforts and determination."
"We attach particular importance to Turkey's accession process and I can assure you that the Portuguese Presidency will also do its utmost in order to allow these negotiations to advance."
"Commitments made need to be met."
"Sustaining the reform process and meeting existing obligations will move Turkey's accession process forward to the benefit, first and foremost, of all Turkish citizens."
"Nevertheless, progress in the accession process depends fundamentally and primarily on Turkey's performance."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first congratulate Ms Oomen-Ruijten on her solid report and for proposing a draft that is both rigorous and fair."
"Turkey went through an extremely difficult period earlier this year with a severe constitutional crisis and high political tensions."
"Despite such challenges, it conducted parliamentary and presidential elections in full respect of democratic principles and with a very high level of citizen participation."
"The result was that democracy had the last word."
"The new Turkish Parliament is largely representative of Turkish political diversity and, as Mr Lobo Antunes said, the new Government can now work with the support of a stable majority and a broad popular mandate."
"Thus the way ahead has been cleared in this regard."
"Now the time has come to regenerate a new momentum in the reform process."
"Therefore the Commission shares the basic approach followed by the draft resolution, which is to identify challenges and to encourage Turkey to meet these policy challenges."
"This means to support the commitment of the new Turkish Government to strengthen the reform efforts and to encourage it to translate this commitment rapidly into action."
"This concerns both the reform process and the Ankara Protocol."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the Government has put the constitutional reforms at the top of its agenda, with a view to reinforcing democracy and expanding fundamental freedoms."
"However, this should not result in any postponement of reforms that are urgently needed today, such as the revision of the infamous Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code and other articles related to freedom of expression or the adoption of the Law on Foundations to ensure freedom of religion."
"Further efforts are also needed to ensure democratic supremacy of civil-military relations, to protect the rights of women, children and trade unions, to improve the judiciary system and to enhance the fight against corruption."
"Let me say some words on the recent events and the current situation, on which we coordinate very closely with the Presidency and Mr Solana and we have taken due note of Parliament's views."
"Turkey faces continual cross-border terrorist attacks from the PKK, which is on the EU list of terrorist organisations."
"The European Union condemns all terrorist attacks and understands Turkey's need to protect its citizens."
"The EU and Turkey are both committed to the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq."
"We continue to urge Turkey and Iraq to tackle this problem through cooperation between the relevant authorities and by respecting international law."
"The recent bilateral agreement between Turkey and Iraq on the fight against terrorism provides a basis for this."
"The Turkish authorities are understandably trying to engage the United States as well as the Iraqi and Iraqi-Kurdish authorities in their efforts, with some signs of progress recently."
"The resolution passed in Parliament last week should be seen as part of that overall political strategy."
"The European perspective for Turkey has proved to be a key incentive for reforms in the country."
"In line with our core principle of conditionality in enlargement policy, the implementation of the reforms on the ground determines progress in the accession negotiations."
"However, if we are to use this principle effectively to have serious political leverage to encourage reforms, the European Union itself must stick to its own commitments."
"We have to keep our word - pacta sunt servanda."
"All Member States continue to support accession negotiations with Turkey, and it is vital for the Union's credibility that the process continues in accordance with the Negotiating Framework of 3 October 2005 and the Council decision of 11 December 2006."
"These were unanimous decisions of all 27 Member States."
"We should therefore open further chapters once they are technically ready."
"At least two chapters - consumer and health protection and trans-European networks - could be opened in the coming weeks."
"We also encourage Turkey to work to meet the opening benchmarks already defined for 13 chapters."
"Last but not least, please rest assured that your contribution will be duly taken into account in our forthcoming progress report concerning Turkey, which the Commission will adopt on 6 November."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, thank you, both to the Council and to the Commission, for the kind words that have been expressed."
"The debate today and the resolution that we are about to adopt are indeed directed in the first instance at the Commission, because we intend to have some input into the progress report."
"However, they are also directed at the Council, which will meet again in December in response to the progress report."
"What are we doing in the resolution?"
"What are we doing in the text?"
"We describe the progress made and the agreements we have reached."
"We also describe what has come of the commitment that Turkey entered into."
"The resolution is, therefore, a compilation of what has been achieved, but it also contains all manner of things that have not been achieved."
"Mr President, what it also includes is what we expect from the Turkish Government, because there is an opportunity now to give a new impetus to the reform process."
"The third point I wish to make: we have tried to deepen and broaden the debate with Turkey."
"That means, therefore, that I am asking for attention to be given to social cohesion, logistics, transport and energy."
"Freedom of speech and religious freedom are rightly given a prominent place in our text."
"The constitution, the new constitution should not be any excuse to not pull out all the stops immediately to ensure that all necessary reforms, especially those connected with Article 301, are realised."
"Another point that I would like to make is about the relationship with neighbouring countries."
"Good relations with neighbours are an absolute necessity."
"When I look at Turkey and Armenia, that means that the borders must be opened."
"There must be an end to all economic blockades."
"Moreover - my final point - if a people does not acknowledge its past, it has no future."
"I am therefore also asking the Commission to support Turkey and Armenia on this issue."
"Mr President, I cannot say anything more about the PKK because the procedures in this House do not allow me enough time."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on this very good report and thank her very much for the excellent cooperation."
"There are a number of messages contained in this report, and when I visited Turkey with Martin Schulz, these were the messages I was able to convey to the Turkish authorities."
"Firstly, the reforms must not only be continued but stepped up."
"The Commissioner has already mentioned Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code and other reforms to guarantee full and genuine freedom of expression and plurality of opinion in Turkey."
"The same naturally applies to freedom of religion and many other issues which will be covered by other colleagues later in the debate."
"The reform process has to be moved up a gear."
"Secondly, the Kurdish issue: I would like to make my position here very clear."
"For many years now, indeed for decades, I have been trying to play my part to help resolve the Kurdish issue, but now the time has come when it is possible to have a political and parliamentary solution to the Kurdish issue and abandon violence."
"That is why I cannot understand why the PKK is continuing with terrorism."
"I can understand it because the PKK does not want a peaceful solution, and there may well be some people in the military who do not want a peaceful solution either."
"Nonetheless, we should send out a clear signal that we do want a peaceful solution, and so does Iraq."
"We had a meeting with President Talabani's representative in Ankara and he also made it very clear that what they want is not continued PKK terrorism but a political solution."
"I would hope that representatives of the Kurdish regional government will heed the message that the continuation of PKK terrorism damages not only Turkey but also Iraq."
"That is why I myself, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, can only endorse this appeal: Turkey and Iraq must come together to work on the basis of peaceful cooperation, which must include the Kurdish regional government, to put an end to terrorism."
"At the same time, Turkey must make offers to the Kurdish population of Turkey so that they feel comfortable there and can consider Turkey as their home as well."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur Ria Oomen-Ruijten, but also Jos Lagendijk and Hannes Swoboda, for the very good cooperation during the drafting of this resolution."
"I believe we have produced a good text with a surprisingly high level of consensus, and I think that is a very good thing."
"For my Group, I would like to highlight and underline the key points once again."
"First of all, this resolution is a positive and constructive signal to Turkey."
"We welcome the fact that the summer's constitutional crisis has been overcome, and we welcome the fact that the new Government has a strong and clear mandate for further reforms."
"However, we urge the Government unequivocally to use this mandate to genuinely drive forward the reforms."
"What is important in this context - as the resolution says - is that these reforms are extremely important for Turkey itself, for the Turkish people, for Turkish society and for the Turkish economy."
"Turkey must continue to improve steadily and of its own accord and I am glad to see that there is increasing consensus in Turkey on this issue, as expressed in the April programme."
"It is good that this is still the case."
"What is important for us is that the Copenhagen criteria will continue to be the key benchmark for the negotiations, just as the European Union's own absorption capacity continues to be an important and indispensable criterion."
"Reforms are urgently needed in the following areas in particular, some of which have already been mentioned."
"The Penal Code: Article 301 has already been mentioned, that is quite clear."
"To my mind, we should be starting to include Article 252 in the debate as well."
"This concerns insulting the memory of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and is problematical because this is also a restriction of freedom of speech."
"A second important point is improving the situation of women."
"The number of honour killings continues to be a matter of grave concern."
"The constitutional reform must continue."
"Fundamental human rights and personal freedoms must be protected."
"Let me add that, from our perspective, electoral law is also a problem."
"A 10% hurdle is unheard of elsewhere in the OSCE."
"Let me conclude by saying that we have to show some understanding for the difficult situation in Turkey, particularly in view of the dramatic events in the south-east on Turkey's border with Iraq."
"We unequivocally condemn the terrorist activities of the PKK in recent weeks and I would like to pass on my Group's condolences to the families of the soldiers who have been killed."
"We urge the Turkish Government to react cautiously to this situation."
"There has been no sign, to date, that this has not been the case."
"Nonetheless, the measures adopted to mitigate the threat to Turkish territory must comply with the following conditions."
"They must be appropriate, proportionate and limited over time."
"The European Union understands the difficult situation in Turkey."
"It is important for Turkey to retain this understanding."
"A peaceful solution is, of course, our highest objective."
"Today's resolution is a genuinely constructive signal for positive dialogue with Turkey."
"Turkey will continue to be a very important partner for the European Union and must now press ahead resolutely with reform in its own interests."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one year on from the last resolution adopted by this House on EU-Turkey relations, it is sad to see that certain fundamental issues remain tragically topical."
"Turkey does not recognise Cyprus, to all intents and purposes a Member State of the European Union; freedom of the press is still curtailed, since Article 301 of the Penal Code has not yet been amended and Turkey persists in not acknowledging the genocide of the Armenian population in 1915."
"The recent appalling terrorist attack by the PKK, the ensuing robust response from the Turkish army and the threat to intervene in the northern part of Iraq unless the PKK ends its terrorist activities once and for all: these factors compound the dangerous and delicate geopolitical position in which Turkey finds itself."
"Some progress has of course been made. I am thinking in particular of the increased representation of women in the newly elected Turkish Parliament, in economic circles and in the academic world, but we need to ask ourselves now more than ever whether the Europe of tomorrow wishes to be a large political entity or to have a strong cultural identity, because these uncertainties play into the hands of Turkey which does not wish to stop being itself."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is unfortunately overshadowed by the terrorist attacks in Turkey."
"I would much rather have spoken about the desirability of picking up the thread of the reforms again; unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that, despite many fine words, in practice up to now far too little has come of this."
"However, I think that the main question now is: what do we think Turkey should do?"
"Let us drop the hypocrisy from this debate, ladies and gentlemen."
"Every one of us knows, or should know, that there are no easy answers to this devilish dilemma."
"On the one hand we realise, we know, that any country where fifty people have been killed in the last month has to do something in response, while at the same time many of us realise - including, I think, many in the Turkish Government - that large-scale military operations are no solution."
"They do not root out the PKK, they cause immense diplomatic and political damage and - most importantly - they make a solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey much more difficult."
"Let us therefore hope that all the attempts now being made to find a diplomatic and political solution will be successful."
"The problem, ultimately, does not lie in the Iraqi mountains, the problem lies in Turkey, but the solution to the problem - the Kurdish problem - is not Turks against Kurds."
"In my view, the issue is one of those in Turkey, Turks and Kurds who know that the only solution to the problem is a political one - the AKP and the DTP - versus the radicals, on the Turkish side and on the Kurdish side, who are not interested in a political solution at all and who think that military violence can help: on the Turkish side the army and a section of the opposition and on the Kurdish side the PKK."
"Let us be very clear: the present attacks by the PKK are, of course, directed at the Turkish state, but they are also an attack on the Kurdish DTP party in the Turkish Parliament, which is seeking a political solution to the problem."
"That is why it is so important that this Parliament does indeed strongly condemn the PKK and its terrorist attacks, while at the same time expressing support for all those on the Kurdish side and on the Turkish side who are trying to find a peaceful political solution to this problem."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, with the prospect of Turkey's accession to the EU firmly in mind, the Commission, and hence the Union as a whole, is called upon to complete, in the next few days, the assessment of Turkey's progress, or lack of it, in the various sectors it is required to harmonise with the European acquis."
"We have declared that, provided it complies with all the Copenhagen criteria and the obligations it has accepted according to the Negotiating Framework and additional protocol, Turkey should be able to join the EU."
"We do not think that any compromise solutions will bring the results that either Turkey or the Union is hoping for."
"We should like to point out that Turkey has made some progress, but we repeat that if its accession is to proceed smoothly, it must do as previous accession countries have done: comply with its Convention obligations to the EU as a whole."
"Turkey must therefore fulfil its obligations towards Cyprus; it must open its sea and air ports to ships and aircraft from the Republic of Cyprus and lift the veto on participation by Cyprus in international organisations and multilateral treaties."
"As a Left-wing group, and especially as AKEL (the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus), we are confident that the prospect of Turkey's accession to the EU will ensure compliance with its obligations, especially as regards ending the occupation of Cyprus by Turkish troops."
"We also believe that by encouraging Turkey on its course towards Europe, assuming that Turkey simultaneously fulfils its obligations to the EU, we can exert pressure on it."
"Thus Turkey must fulfil the following obligations: to defend and respect the human rights of all who live there, including Kurds and other minorities; to recognise the genocide of the Armenians, and to open its border with Armenia, with all the socio-economic consequences that this will entail."
"If Turkey hopes to continue and complete its accession course, then it is patently obvious that the measures and policies it adopts will have to lead to full compliance with the European acquis and absolute respect for international law, which ultimately governs the workings of the EU."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (EL) Mr President, what we have heard is astonishing, and it comes from none other than the competent Commissioner, who was all too ready to brand as terrorists those claiming to be fighting for freedom."
"I wonder if we are not over-willing to describe Turkey as being attacked on all sides."
"This is a country that keeps troops in an EU Member State, and is not the first and only country to adjust to EU requirements."
"I shall end by turning to a much more technical matter."
"Shortly before the adventure on its eastern borders, the price of oil in Turkey was USD 76 a barrel in Europe; now, owing to its arms, to which it always has recourse when solving its own problems, oil has risen to more than USD 90 a barrel."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, during the discussion of this resolution in committee, it seemed as if Parliament as a whole was half asleep."
"Vague criticisms are formulated as a pure formality but, apart from that, it seems as if we have to accept the accession of Turkey as a fait accompli."
"Yet Turkey has made hardly any progress since the beginning of the negotiations."
"I refer, for example, to a recent report by Amnesty International about the human rights situation and the treatment of minorities."
"Turkey's position on Cyprus is hardly mentioned any more."
"What is more, there is a serious risk that Turkey is about to launch a large-scale military attack on Iraq."
"Then we would be faced with a situation where a candidate country is not only occupying part of the territory of an existing Member State with its military, but on top of that is going to wage a kind of local war in another neighbouring country, Iraq on this occasion."
"Mr President, the majority of the population in Europe is against the possible accession of Turkey."
"This is because Turkey is not a European country and so it does not belong in the European Union."
"Instead of compromising the credibility of Europe even more, we would do better to pursue a favoured partnership with Turkey, in all openness and unequivocally, instead of full EU membership."
"Mr President, I detect, particularly from the Commission, a tendency to present non-European Turkey in the best possible light."
"Not surprising, maybe, considering the millions of pre-accession aid which we are pouring in, but there are uncomfortable realities to be faced."
"Honour crimes, gross human rights abuses, lack of protection for non-Muslim minorities, absence of religious freedom and anti-Christian attacks and propaganda are my biggest concern."
"This year, fatal attacks on Christians have continued, such as the slaying of three men in Malatya in April."
"Genuine freedom of religion is often the touchstone of a country's abiding commitment to human rights."
"In Turkey's case, it has much to do, including the legal status of religious groups and property rights, but fundamentally the right to worship freely and the right to convert must be respected."
"(DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for drawing up this report which will be submitted to the Commission and should be taken into account as Parliament's contribution to the forthcoming progress report."
"Turkey has overcome domestic problems, the Government has a clear mandate, the referendum on Sunday on constitutional amendments concerning the election of the President produced the right outcome, and there is now no reason to delay the reforms any longer."
"I would therefore like to begin with an appeal to the Turkish Government: if it is serious about joining the EU, then it has to increase the intensity of the reforms."
"Relatively little happened here last year, as we all know."
"Secondly, the reforms are intended to benefit the Turkish people first and foremost."
"They are not an end in themselves or any sleight of hand on Europe's part; they are intended to address the deficits which should not be present in a democracy, notably in relation to freedom of opinion, freedom of religion, women's rights, minority rights, electoral law, etc. Turkey must tackle these issues and dismantle these deficits of its own accord."
"I would like to mention another subject as well, namely the Armenian question."
"As a German, I think that we can expect a clear acknowledgement of its historical responsibility from Turkey."
"Its refusal to speak out on this issue and remove the blockades of Armenia is a topic which must continue to be addressed in the discussions."
"At present - as Mr Swoboda has just said - there is a concern that military conflict in the Kurdish region will spill over into Iraq."
"Here, we clearly prefer a diplomatic solution, a negotiated solution, instead of a military solution."
"I fully endorse the position of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on this issue."
"Ultimately, Turkey itself must determine whether and how it wishes to continue down the road to Europe."
"From our perspective, full accession to the EU is not the only option; the negotiations have purposely remained open-ended and it is ultimately up to Turkey whether it wishes to pursue this route proactively."
"It is not only about whether Europe itself has the capacity to grant accession to Turkey."
"(NL) Mr President, I would also like to express my compliments to the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"My immediate response to Mr Langen's remark is that in my Group we are definitely talking about negotiations with a view to membership of the European Union!"
"The resolution we are debating today is an encouragement to the Turkish Government to keep going down that route whatever it does."
"Prime Minister Erdoğan was given a strong mandate to do that by the Turkish electorate."
"That does indeed put him in a position to spur on the reforms."
"We expect rapid results now and we therefore expect that the Commission will soon come up with a progress report to that effect."
"Urgent issues should not be overlooked, of course."
"I think that it would be a hugely important symbolic step, which would have a huge ripple effect, if the Turkish Government were to do something about Article 301, if they were to repeal it or reformulate it."
"That would create the necessary openness in Turkey for debate, including debate on issues from the past, and that brings me to the Armenian question."
"We believe that it is very important that there be an internal debate on this in Turkey, but it is mainly up to Turkey itself to organise that and not so much for Parliament or the US House of Representatives to try to force the issue."
"It is mainly an internal matter; we can help, but there is not really much point in us continually pushing for this from outside."
"The new constitution has been announced."
"That also creates opportunities, we believe, to finally seek a political solution to the Kurdish question."
"I share the view of those who say that we should do everything we can to prevent a military escalation in northern Iraq, but we can only do that if we first distance ourselves from the terrorist attacks of the PKK and demand the PKK to stop."
"Secondly, we must also support Turkey in its dialogue with Iraq and the Iraqi authorities, and also in its dialogue with the regional authorities in Kurdish Iraq to cooperate in practice to stop these attacks."
"We welcome new diplomatic initiatives, but we believe that it is mainly practical cooperation in the region itself that will drive down and end the violence."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council presidency said 'it depends on Turkey' and many colleagues have repeated this idea, including Mr Langen who said 'it is up to them to decide'."
"Well, I do not believe that is so. In my opinion Europe must assume its own responsibilities."
"This is not just a problem about Turkey and its compliance with the formal accession criteria."
"The truth is that in recent months Europe, Europe's governments - beginning with, but not only, the French Presidency - have been sending out a message that Turkey will not join the European Union."
"The Oomen-Ruijten report starts from this assumption and the text is probably the best that could be drafted in this House, but we need to have the courage to alter the overall context: the current political and military crisis on the border between Turkey and Iraq is partly the responsibility of the European Union, given that politically we have slammed the door in Turkey's face even though the relevant negotiations are continuing."
"What is needed is a major leap forward, whereby the European Union, the governments, explicitly call for a political report on the individual right of citizens living on Turkish soil to democracy and the rule of law, with a view to joining Europe."
"This may help Turkey move towards Europe and not towards the Middle East."
"(DE) Mr President, unfortunately, today's vote on Parliament's resolution on Turkey is overshadowed by very distressing and worrying events."
"Last Wednesday, Turkey's Grand National Assembly voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of a Turkish military incursion into northern Iraq."
"Since then, we have heard the distressing news of deaths and casualties on the Turkey-Iraq border, of bloody battles and combat, and we have heard that the Turkish military is firing on villages in northern Iraq."
"We have heard about attacks on Kurdish institutions and DTP offices, and about enraged nationalists attempting to lynch their Kurdish fellow citizens."
"Yet the signals that were sent out by Turkey after the end of the constitutional crisis in late August were so promising."
"There was talk of a new civilian constitution, further reforms, and more intensive reform efforts to address still unresolved issues."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and many of my fellow Members wanted to take account of these positive signals and developments in Turkey after the reform efforts in Turkey came to a standstill last year."
"The motion for a resolution is balanced and fair in its assessment and evaluation."
"However, in view of Turkey's recent decision and the blatant threat of a military incursion which violates the territorial integrity of Iraq, I do wonder which aims Turkey is actually pursuing."
"Is it really about the PKK?"
"The fact is that the Turkish military has carried out 24 cross-border operations in recent years and not one of them has actually had any lasting effect."
"Why should it be different this time?"
"Or could it have to do with the oil reserves in the region around Kirkuk and Turkey's intention of removing the autonomous status of the Kurds in northern Iraq?"
"What is clear, at any rate, is that the Kurdish issue cannot be resolved with an incursion into northern Iraq."
"From my perspective, however, it is also clear that Turkey cannot be seen to breach international law and violate Iraq's sovereignty before the eyes of the European Union and the international community."
"Europe must now take responsibility and participate actively in developing a strategy for the resolution of the Kurdish issue, for this is the key to achieving genuine peace and democracy in Turkey."
"(NL) Mr President, in a recent interview in the Dutch press, Commissioner Rehn stated unequivocally which reforms in Turkey are the most urgent for the EU, and I quote: 'they are in the area of freedom of speech and religion, core principles of democracy'."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for this clear statement of position."
"It also led me to bring to his attention a document from the Alliance of Protestant Churches in Turkey."
"The document is dated 1 September 2007 and describes the serious distress and concerns of Turkish Protestants about the absence of freedom of religion."
"Commissioner, I trust that you will speak firmly to your Turkish interlocutors about the vulnerable position in Turkish society of the Turkish Protestants, or all Turkish Christians."
"Treating the symptoms, Mr President, is really not enough."
"The media and politicians are creating a very intolerant, dangerous climate for non-Muslim minorities in Turkey."
"Here too the situation calls for swift action from Brussels toward Ankara."
"I will hand a second document on this to the Commissioner and eagerly await a swift response from him in writing."
"(DE) Mr President, a few days ago I was in the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus and I gained a first-hand impression of the systematic destruction of around 500 Greek Orthodox churches and the destruction of European cultural heritage which can never be made good."
"In my view, this conflicts with the spirit of Europe just as clearly as the continuing lack of tolerance towards Christians and other minorities, or indeed the offence of 'insulting Turkish identity' which is used to suppress freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, to say nothing of the continuing human rights violations, the failure to address the issue of the genocide against the Armenians, and ongoing Islamicisation."
"It is quite unacceptable that an accession candidate should still be occupying parts of an EU Member State, namely Northern Cyprus, to say nothing of planning a military attack on another country, as is currently the case against Iraq."
"Brussels never tires of emphasising that compliance with fundamental rights, especially freedom of religion and freedom of expression, has the highest priority for accession to the EU."
"In the case of Turkey's membership aspirations, these are clearly nothing but empty words."
"(EL) Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her report."
"And now, a timely issue: what will happen, Mr President, if Turkey, a candidate country, ignores the admonishments of the EU and invades northern Iraq?"
"What are Turkey's intentions?"
"Are they, perhaps, to bring about another Cyprus situation, or to occupy territory in Kurdish-speaking Iraq, further complicating the efforts of many, including European countries, to stabilise Iraq?"
"How can Member States or candidate countries be allowed to act as destabilising factors in an area in which European soldiers are losing their lives in an attempt to achieve stability?"
"May I remind you that Turkish troops are occupying 40% of Cyprus."
"This has not prevented the country from starting accession talks."
"May I remind you that Turkey is still not complying with the EU's request to extend the Ankara Protocol."
"I wonder what the European Commission's report, which is expected on 6 November, will have to say about this."
"If the message is one of tolerance, then why not be tolerant on so many other issues of principle and values that are at the heart of the EU?"
"In the final analysis, the key question is: are we talking about spreading EU values or diminishing their sphere of influence?"
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the constructive message we are preparing to send to the Council and the Commission, but also to the Turkish Government and Parliament."
"I regret, however, that our Parliament did not express itself more clearly on an issue that is undoubtedly sensitive but no less important: I am talking about the Armenian genocide."
"Since 1987 this Parliament has applied the word 'genocide' to the massacre between 1915 and 1917 of 1.2 million Armenians, i.e. two-thirds of the Armenian population living at that time under the Ottoman Empire."
"The US Senate and House of Representatives have just said the same and it is unfortunate that this Parliament is lagging behind the Americans on this issue."
"As highlighted recently in a press release by the International Federation for Human Rights, many Turkish citizens are charged with insulting Turkish identity on the basis of Article 301 of the Penal Code."
"In order to tackle this period in history publically, I believe that this article has to be abolished as soon as possible."
"We are not benefiting our Turkish friends in any way by making them forget their history."
"This duty to remember is also a duty to the descendants of the people who survived the genocide and to the international community itself."
"I thus call on Parliament to support the amendments that call for recognition of the Armenian genocide and those that underline the need for complete respect for religious freedoms and minority rights."
"Mr President, Turkey is an important country for political, economic, military and cultural reasons, and it is therefore important to the EU."
"Realising this, the EU has decided to commence accession negotiations."
"The path towards accession has not been very smooth, but it has helped initiate a much-needed democratic reform programme in Turkey."
"Such reforms are welcomed both by the EU and by the citizens of Turkey."
"Those reforms must continue, and for that reason, at least, our support for Turkish accession must be firm."
"Nobody is ignoring the fact that problems exist."
"My country, Cyprus, is at the centre of one such problem, but I, like most people in this Chamber, realise that problems are not solved by conflict, but by peaceful negotiation."
"A more European Turkey is much better for discussing and solving problems with, and hence I fully support Turkey's accession to the EU."
"Consequently, I endorse the compromise reached through the wise handling afforded by Ms Oomen-Ruijten, with the honest and fruitful cooperation of all those interested colleagues, who may have differing opinions on certain specific issues, but who all agree on the principle that the EU can achieve more by cooperating constructively with the Turkish people than by destructively antagonising them."
"Turkey is undergoing a difficult period right now, and the use by the EU of more carrot and less stick is presently the appropriate way to proceed."
"Let our overwhelming support for this report be proof to the Turkish people that we do want them in the EU, and let it be a help for greater and faster reforms in Turkey and for enhanced facilitation of solving the far too longstanding Cyprus problem."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of us have invoked geopolitical reasons for opposing Turkey's accession to Europe."
"Now the facts on the ground are proving us right, given that Ankara has burst in like an elephant on the delicate balance of Iraq, where our troops are risking their lives every day and fighting for the population's freedom."
"I believe we need to think about this because, fellow Members, your dear democratic Turkey, that human rights paradise on earth, is knocking at Europe's door at the very moment when a dreadful, unpredictable, tragic scenario of war is opening up on the Iraqi front."
"When you return to Brussels, do what I intend to do: go and visit the Armenian restaurant."
"Do not your non-EU friends include the Armenians?"
"Yet their premises have been wrecked by hooligans, by Turkish criminals, who have burned down a restaurant in the capital of Europe just because it is Armenian."
"Such is the democratic nature of Turkish nationalists!"
"Therefore, why should we welcome them, when they still do not acknowledge the Armenian genocide? I invite you to vote in favour of my amendment."
"Mr President, the resolution emphasises that Turkey must fully comply with the Copenhagen criteria as a basis for accession to the EU."
"The report also urges the Turkish Government to bring its approach to freedom of religion in line with those principles as defined by the European Court of Justice."
"Since Kemal Atatürk, Turkey has maintained a secular state against the growing power of fundamentalist and literalist Islam."
"I wonder whether the Turks realise that entering the EU will fundamentally undermine their ability to resist militant Islam."
"If Turkey joins the EU, their Islamists will use the human rights legislation as a shield from behind which to advance their jihad in Turkey and Europe."
"The British people are coming to realise that if Turkey joins the EU, another 70 million people will have the right to come to Britain."
"Turkish accession will be a disaster for the Turks and a disaster for Britain."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate on the Florenz motion for a resolution, it was rightly observed yesterday that a large majority of the population support strict measures to ban smoking at the workplace and in bars and restaurants."
"I had hoped that this resolution would also take account of the view of an overwhelming majority of the population, that is that Turkey cannot join the European Union."
"However, I am obviously cherishing too many illusions."
"When it comes to crucial matters, such as the Constitution or the accession of Turkey to the European Union, the opinion of the people suddenly does not count any more."
"Turkey, a friendly nation, is not a European country."
"Full stop, amen, finished."
"That should be the end of the discussion."
"However, not only does Parliament not accept its responsibility, more than once it has been blind to specific recent developments that clearly demonstrate that Turkey does not belong in the European Union, and that the decision to start accession negotiations was a mistake."
"Why does this resolution not mention the resistance of the AKP to a constitutional provision that would make conversion to another religion no longer punishable under the law?"
"Why are people so vague about the Armenian question and about Cyprus?"
"This is another example of European Realpolitik, which you can count us out of."
"Mr President, according to The Times newspaper of London, the recent US Congressional resolution on the Armenian genocide was appallingly timed."
"So, when is it a suitable time to talk about genocide?"
"The Armenian lobby is so vociferous in this Parliament precisely because of the apparent conspiracy of silence that has surrounded the genocide question for almost a century."
"The murder of the Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink should have provided a period of national reflection but, sadly, this did not happen."
"Nevertheless, reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia, including the reopening of the closed border, is an important element of Turkey's efforts to join the EU."
"But, in my view, no true democracy can be in denial of its past, even its deepest and darkest secrets."
"Just as important is a lasting settlement of the conflict in Cyprus, which remains at an impasse caused by the presence of occupying troops in an EU Member State as well as non-implementation of the Ankara Protocol."
"Minority religious rights, in particular Christian, also give cause for concern."
"For instance, the Greek Orthodox seminary of Halki remains closed since 1971; the Assyrian Christians who fled to Germany and Sweden during the war with the PKK have been stripped of their Turkish citizenship, preventing them from claiming back their homes lost in the conflict."
"And Turkey sees the Alevis as no different from the majority Sunni Muslims and therefore does not recognise their separate religious needs."
"Article 301 of the Penal Code on insulting Turkishness has resulted in many convictions and, in March - rather bizarrely in my view - a court in Istanbul issued an order denying access to the video-sharing website YouTube when allegations were made on the sexuality of the founding father of modern Turkey, Kemal Atatürk."
"Speaking entirely personally and not on behalf of my party or my Group: a lot clearly still needs to be done."
"(EL) Mr President, today's discussion gives us an opportunity to express our satisfaction with the election results in Turkey, and to welcome the Turkish people's express wish to continue the reforms."
"Turkey's prospective accession to the EU, which remains the objective, has opened the way to attempts at reform."
"Unfortunately, these efforts have reached a plateau and have slowed down."
"The new government, with its fresh, strong mandate, needs to move very fast to fully implement all the provisions of the Association Agreement and its Additional Protocol."
"The reform process is above all about democratisation, fundamental human rights and religious freedoms."
"In line with this, it is essential to repeal Article 301 of the Criminal Code and respond firmly to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's requests."
"Unfortunately, the Turkish Government's attitude towards this issue so far has allowed for extremist acts."
"We must also mention the Turkish authorities' inexplicable insistence on keeping the Theological School in Halki shut."
"Another issue that concerns us is the tense situation in south-east Turkey."
"I believe that the culture of settling disputes violently should not be allowed to prevail, because it will mean instability in the wider area."
"It is the present government's responsibility to take action in order to reach a peaceful settlement on the Kurdish issue, and this presupposes dialogue between the two sides."
"The international community must play a peacekeeping role in this potential crisis."
"To conclude, Mr President, I should like to say that we expect Turkey to honour all its obligations so that it can progress steadily towards prospective European integration."
"(EL) Mr President, let me first congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her excellent work."
"Mr President, the popular mandate given to the Erdoğan Government and to Mr Erdoğan in particular allows for the continuation of a course of reform that has been under way since Turkey's claim for a place in Europe became a firmer prospect."
"At the same time, the mandate inspires a new desire for a fair and lasting solution to the Cyprus issue, with the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus as the first requirement."
"There is a new desire for genuine neighbourly relations, both in general, and with Greece in particular."
"Thanks to the mandate, human rights are respected under new laws such as the law on ecclesiastical foundations, and the laws protecting rights and freedoms."
"This is a historic coming to terms with the past, and the genocides of the Armenians, Pontic Greeks and Assyrians are being recognised."
"Thanks to the mandate, the Kurdish issue is being seen in a new light."
"The potential invasion of northern Iraq is an issue that should be of serious concern to the EU."
"Such a move must not be permitted, because the need, on which we are all agreed, to combat terrorism should never be used as a pretext for creating a fait accompli of occupied territory in northern Iraq, as happened in Cyprus."
"Mr President, I am not sure what this morning's debate is adding to the Turkish accession issue rather than giving an opportunity to a small number of vehement opponents of Turkish accession to repeat their arguments in this Chamber."
"Of course we should urge Turkey to show restraint and to act proportionately in response to the terrorist threat from northern Iraq but I note the criticisms this morning are being made by the very same people who in other debates have been against the European Union's contribution to reconstruction in Iraq."
"I welcome the strategic partnership between the UK and Turkey announced by Prime Ministers Brown and Erdogan in London yesterday, including positive cooperation in combating organised crime and terrorism."
"I call on other Member States to do the same."
"I welcome the youngest female Turkish MP elected, Ayla Akat, who was in Brussels last week as one of a number of Kurdish MPs returned to the Turkish Parliament for the first time in 14 years, who give us hope that the problem of Kurdish cultural and political rights could be solved through democracy and not through violence."
"(CS) Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten carried out an outstanding piece of work when she found a compromise wording on a subject which divides this House."
"I am convinced, however, that in the future adopting such resolutions and reports, which strive to find compromises at the expense of not expressing Parliament's views on contentious key issues, should be abandoned."
"Our efforts to achieve unanimity send Turkey a message which does not sufficiently reflect the different opinions on Turkish membership held both within this Parliament and among the European public."
"I will not conceal the fact that I consider the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey to be in itself a fundamental mistake."
"At the same time I am aware of and I respect the fact that not everyone in this House shares this view."
"The European public is itself strongly divided when it comes to this issue of key importance for the future of European integration."
"It is our duty to reflect this polarity."
"I would therefore hope that our future resolutions and reports clearly bear witness to this division within Parliament regarding the possible Turkish membership of the EU."
"While compromise is welcomed in many other areas discussed in Parliament, Turkish membership and EU-Turkey relations are not among them."
"Let us change the approach."
"Let us not continue producing reports and resolutions which attempt to give the impression of agreement and unanimity."
"Instead, let us show, through our agreement or disagreement with clearly formulated positions, that there is a division among us in the matter of Turkish membership."
"It is a question of our responsibility towards both the EU citizens and Turkey who do not deserve half-truths."
"I am certain that the Turkish people will welcome much more a communication on disunity rather than a concealment of the real situation, which both Parliament and Europe as a whole have been doing for a long time."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's resolution on Turkey, the European Parliament is sending out a positive signal and has thus entered a new phase of constructive dialogue in its relations with Turkey."
"Turkey is currently involved in an intense debate about internal reforms."
"Turkey now has a government in power which has a clear popular mandate and can set to work."
"This is a chance to give fresh impetus to the accession process in several key areas."
"Calling for additional requirements to be met which are not part of the accession negotiations is counterproductive."
"In Turkey, the development of a new constitution is now the highest priority."
"The outline of this constitution is already discernible."
"The call for the revision of Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code is being considered by the Turkish side."
"Turkey now needs further positive signals from the EU."
"We must encourage Turkey to continue this reform process with great zeal."
"The Commission's progress report is expected on 7 November, and I think it is very important that the current positive developments in Turkey are reflected in that report."
"(EL) Mr President, Turkey is a candidate for accession to a united Europe."
"It has rights and obligations."
"The rapporteur has given a balanced interim report."
"This offers Turkey another chance to proceed with the reforms and fulfil its obligations, which relate mainly to economic changes, respect for the Copenhagen criteria, and human, religious and minority rights."
"We want Turkey to change because Turkey itself is asking for change and also because the times demand it."
"Change in Turkey means meeting its obligations towards Cyprus by recognising the Republic of Cyprus and ending the occupation of Cyprus."
"The report correctly states that the withdrawal of the Turkish army will help to reach a solution, and that the Turkish army can be replaced with a small European force under the command of the Security Council."
"Turkey must fulfil the following obligations: end colonisation and change the demographic character of Cyprus; repatriate the settlers, who form the great majority in the occupied territories and are the time-bomb waiting to undermine any solution; end the appropriation of Greek Cypriot properties in occupied Cyprus; and stop the destruction of our cultural heritage."
"As a first step, Turkey must respect the decisions of the UN and return the city of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants."
"Ankara regards Turkish Cypriots as isolated, owing to the presence of 45 000 Turkish soldiers, who are keeping Greek Cypriots away from their homes and properties."
"Turkey holds the key both to its accession to Europe and to solving the Cyprus issue."
"The Turkish policy of dividing Cyprus into two states is not a solution."
"We live in an age of unification, not partition."
"We say yes to a European Turkey and yes to a European solution, which have little in common with partition lines and zones; they should be based, as the rapporteur rightly stresses, on the principles of a united Europe."
"This will create a viable model state for the whole of Europe, where Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and Christians and Muslims, can live peaceful and productive lives based on mutual respect for the principles and values of a united Europe."
"(ES) Mr President, as you know, the enlargement of the European Union to include another country is always a dialectical process in which the candidate's efforts must be determined but in which the Union's efforts must also be clear."
"In my view, when the European Union has a new Reform Treaty to enable it to be more democratic and more effective, it will also be in a better position to continue its enlargement."
"That is the case following the Lisbon agreement."
"Turkey is making significant progress."
"We are all behind the Ankara Government, behind the Turkish people in the fight against terrorism. Nevertheless, in order to continue the progress I mentioned, we must call for restraint, moderation and compliance with international law."
"A large-scale military operation in northern Iraq would only add fuel to the fire there and could also cause serious problems in Turkey."
"Finally, I want to congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her resolution, although there is one topic missing: why do we often forget that Turkey is not just a candidate country but also a vital Euro-Mediterranean partner in the Barcelona Process?"
"This point is indeed missing from the report."
"Turkey is vital in that Process just as we are vital for Turkey in the Euro-Mediterranean Process too."
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her balanced resolution."
"I was in Turkey ten days ago and while I was there I spoke to members of the new Turkish Government and the new Parliament."
"I stressed the need to carry on with the reforms, with special emphasis on freedom of speech."
"The Minister of Justice and other members of the Cabinet assured me that Article 301 will be amended."
"The new Government also promised reforms on the path toward EU membership."
"The resolution also refers to that membership as the ultimate goal."
"The resolution will therefore make a direct contribution to the reforms in Turkey, including reforms in the areas of women's rights, trade union rights and social legislation."
"However, calm is needed for reforms to take place, and at the moment fear and anger are rife in Turkey."
"Fear of attacks by the PKK, anger that could lead to escalation."
"To prevent that, Turkey and the EU must join forces in order to use diplomatic and political means to prevent and punish terrorism."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this lively debate was very useful to the Presidency."
"It has clearly demonstrated, if there were any doubt, how much the opinions and views of the many Members differ with regard to the negotiations on Turkey's accession to the European Union."
"However, regardless of the many opinions that may exist on this issue, I feel that this debate has clearly shown that Turkey is already a vital strategic partner of the European Union in political, economic and also security terms."
"I also feel it is clear from this debate that the prospect of Turkey joining the European Union has been the driving force behind fundamental political and social reforms in Turkey."
"Clearly, some people regret that these reforms have not been as rapid or as extensive as might have been hoped, but the fact is that Turkey's people and Government are making gradual progress along the road set out by us, towards an increasingly democratic and pluralistic society which more fully respects the rule of law."
"The Copenhagen criteria, as the guide or reference framework for this whole negotiation process, are extremely clear for both Turkey and any other candidate countries: only those countries which clearly respect our economic principles and, in particular and perhaps even more importantly, our political principles can be members of the European Union."
"If Turkey fully complies with these criteria, then obviously it can become a member of the European Union."
"This is absolutely clear and therefore cannot, or at least should not, give rise to any doubts."
"As regards the PKK's terrorist attacks on the border between Turkey and Iraq, I would draw your attention to the Presidency's statement of 22 October on this issue."
"In that statement, the Presidency totally condemned the terrorist violence perpetrated by the PKK and expressed our active solidarity with the victims' families."
"We also noted that it is vital for the international community to support Turkey's efforts to fight terrorism, while respecting the rule of law, preserving international peace and stability and regional stability, and naturally calling on Turkey to refrain from taking any disproportionate military action."
"We also call on both the Turkish Government and the Iraqi Government to effectively cooperate to address this problem and in particular to prevent Iraqi territory from being used for terrorist actions against Turkey."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I want to thank you for this very substantive and timely debate shortly before we issue our progress report on Turkey on 6 November - that is, in two weeks."
"In the Commission we aim at presenting as objective and fair a report as the one presented by Ms Oomen-Ruijten."
"With today's debate and your subsequent resolution, this House sends some very clear messages to Turkey."
"First of all, I think we all agree that now is the time to step up the reform efforts in the country for the sake of the Turkish citizens, yes, but also for making serious progress in the EU accession negotiations."
"Especially, there is very strong emphasis on reforms without unnecessary delay as regards the freedom of expression, the infamous Article 301 and other equivalent articles, as well as religious freedoms."
"Likewise, we need to see progress on women's rights, trade union rights, as well as cultural and religious rights and international obligations over Turkey."
"Moreover, we condemn terrorist attacks and we understand the Turkish need to protect its citizens, but we also urge Turkey to seek a political solution in cooperation with Iraqi regional authorities and the international community and to show a sense of proportionality in its response to PKK terrorism."
"Concerning the Armenian issue, the Commission supports Parliament's call, as expressed in your draft resolution, for a process of reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia."
"This is the best and most effective way that in time would lead to genuine results over reconciliation and justice."
"We also consider that all the issues in Turkey, including the Armenian issue, should be debated openly and peacefully within Turkish society in the name of freedom of expression."
"Therefore, the reform of Article 301 is also essential for a serious and effective debate on the Armenian issue that could lead to genuine reconciliation."
"The current restraints over freedom of expression have a chilling effect and even contribute to creating an atmosphere of intolerance and hatred, as was unfortunately and sadly shown in the case of the assassination of Hrant Dink earlier this year."
"Finally, we have to recall one thing."
"I do, and you have also, set very strong demands for Turkey as regards the reform process and rightly so."
"At the same time, we need to recall that the equation works only if both sides do what they have got to do."
"That means, when we are firm we also must be fair."
"We have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective of Turkey as outlined in the negotiation mandate."
"(Applause)"
"Otherwise, we can shout as loud as we wish, but it would be like shouting for the forest."
"There would be no response, only a long silence."
"Two motions for a resolution to wind up the debate have been tabled."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Turkey still has a long way to go before it meets the conditions for EU membership."
"Despite considerable progress in recent years, there are still outstanding issues about freedom of expression (particularly Article 301 of the Penal Code), human rights and Armenia."
"However, I reject the arguments of those who say that Turkey should never be allowed to join on the grounds that it is not a European country."
"We have accepted Turkey as a full member of the Council of Europe for more than half a century."
"We have started accession negotiations, thereby recognising its eligibility to join the EU in principle."
"Those claiming that Turkey is not European really mean it is not Christian."
"But why should that be a criterion?"
"The motto of the European Union is 'unity with diversity' -we are not trying to standardise cultures, but to find ways of working together while keeping our different languages, religions and so on. Accepting a secular state whose population is largely Islamic would enhance that principle."
"EU-Russia Summit (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the EU-Russia Summit."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the 20th EU-Russia Summit will take place on Friday of this week in the Portuguese town of Mafra."
"This represents, in our opinion, an excellent opportunity for the leaders of both Russia and the European Union to take stock of our relations."
"We believe that relations between the European Union and Russia are generally good and certainly much better than the international press would sometimes have us believe."
"Russia is a key partner for the EU and we take our relationship very seriously."
"The summit will tackle the situation in the EU and in Russia."
"We will report on developments in the European Union, in particular on progress made in drafting the new Reform Treaty which has just been adopted in Lisbon and on the energy liberalisation package proposed by the Commission and adopted on 9 September."
"As for the common spaces, we will review the progress made in implementing the road maps."
"This process continues to be wholly positive, although some areas need to be driven forward."
"In certain important sectors, the Permanent Partnership Council (PPC) has helped to achieve this objective."
"The PPC on Culture, which will be held the day before the summit, will help to intensify our cultural cooperation."
"In terms of priorities for the summit, we intend to reach agreement on the launch of the early warning system in the energy sector, on which agreement in principle was reached at the last summit held in Samara."
"Given the interdependence of the European Union and Russia in terms of energy, confidence must be increased and mutual cooperation reinforced."
"We will therefore highlight the objectives and principles that the EU must respect in relation to our energy partnership, in particular reciprocity, transparency, openness and creation of an effective legal and regulatory framework."
"In our opinion, the principles of the Energy Charter Treaty and the text on worldwide energy security adopted by the G8 in Saint Petersburg must be included in the new EU-Russia Agreement which will be legally binding and will replace the current Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA)."
"In the area of investment, we welcome the formal dialogue planned in the road map for the common economic space."
"It is vitally important that transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable conditions are created for EU undertakings investing in Russia, bearing in mind the law on strategic investments which is being considered by the Duma."
"We will also urge Russia to avoid the selective use of flanking policies, such as the environment or taxation, to hinder existing investments or create hidden obstacles for new investment."
"We believe that Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a priority which is why we also intend to broach this issue at the summit."
"The Commission may have something more to say on this."
"I must point out that the summit will also be used to apply pressure, in order to ensure progress, if a satisfactory solution has not been found to the main outstanding issues, such as wood export duties or discriminatory rail tariffs."
"We are aware that this summit comes at a time when both the presidential and Duma elections in Russia are imminent."
"In the election process, freedom of expression, including freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, will be vitally important and a real test of the democratic legitimacy of Russia."
"The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) must be given free access to observe the Duma elections."
"As a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe, Russia has a particular responsibility to protect our common values."
"It is regrettable that certain issues have overshadowed relations between the European Union and Russia, given that our interdependence is increasing, not reducing."
"Russia and the EU need to work together to overcome their differences as there is really no alternative to our cooperation."
"Unfortunately, the start of negotiations on a new agreement between the EU and Russia is still deadlocked."
"Russia's bans on imports of Polish meat and vegetables continue to form a major obstacle to the start of negotiations."
"The Commission has indicated its readiness to continue contacts in order to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Unfortunately, the situation has been further complicated by the decision taken by the Russian veterinary authorities at the end of last month to ban the import of meat produced by 36 EU undertakings."
"The interruption to oil supplies destined for Lithuania through the Druzhba pipeline also represents a sticking point preventing negotiations on a new agreement between the EU and Russia from getting underway."
"More than a year has passed without Russia having given any official information on the leak from the pipeline or on the prospects of resuming supplies."
"It is therefore vital to find a satisfactory solution that will create the necessary confidence to continue developing the partnership between the EU and Russia in the area of energy."
"Despite the current deadlock in the negotiations, the situation should not be overdramatized."
"We actually agreed with Russia in 2006 that the PCA would remain in force, thus avoiding any legal vacuum in our relations with Russia."
"Finally, we will certainly be raising the most important issues currently on the international agenda, in particular Kosovo and Iraq."
"We will also stress how vital positive cooperation with Russia is in our common neighbourhood, so that we can tackle common issues of interest and concern, particularly the 'frozen' disputes."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Russia is not only a close neighbour, for us it is a strategic partner."
"If we look to trade and investment we see they are booming, and we also see, as our President has said, that interdependence is growing."
"But we also know that Russia is a key partner in tackling regional conflicts and global challenges - also mentioned here - and that much remains to be done to develop the full potential of our relationship."
"The upcoming summit on Friday is the next occasion to assess the state of our relationship."
"While several of the outstanding issues will not be solved, we will make progress on some others and thus will also prepare the ground for future work at this moment of transition."
"We know it is a critical period for Russia, a few months ahead of the crucial parliamentary and presidential elections, and we also know that the European Union has repeatedly expressed its concerns on the implementation of democratic principles and human rights commitments in Russia."
"We, the European Union, are watching developments very closely - the forthcoming elections will be an important test in that regard - and we expect Russia will make a sensible choice and invite the OSCE observers to monitor the elections."
"We shall also take the opportunity to raise our concerns on human rights issues, such as the limitations on press freedom, the attacks on journalists, the pressure on NGOs and also the situation in the northern Caucasus."
"I had the occasion to discuss the forthcoming summit with the President's key advisor, the special envoy Mr Yastrzhembsky, when I was in Kaliningrad on 11 and 12 October."
"Let me start with a few good examples, but then say where we will not make progress."
"I believe that Russia is about to announce a major financial contribution to several EU-led cross-border cooperation programmes."
"This will be very welcome since cooperation across our developing borders is an important feature following the 2004 enlargement."
"And Kaliningrad is, of course, a very special case, due to its unique geographic location."
"This requires, as we have always found, special arrangements to facilitate cross-border cooperation and local border traffic."
"Russia's financial contribution, however, would also be very timely, considering the very serious traffic congestion on borders between the Member States and Russia in Kaliningrad and at border crossing points with several Member States elsewhere."
"Lines of trucks of up to 50 km on the EU side of the border are clearly not acceptable."
"We need to implement the measures and therefore we have agreed with Russia to reduce the bottlenecks."
"We are just launching a pilot project in the Commission, exchanging customs information and financing modernisation of border infrastructure."
"For its part, Russia must streamline its procedures at the borders."
"In principle it is ready to do so but it takes a certain amount of time."
"Our President has already mentioned energy."
"I would just like to add that we should be able to announce an agreement on the early warning mechanism to deal with problems in supply before they come to crisis point."
"Our President has spoken about energy culture and also investments so I need not add anything here."
"I just would like to complement it by saying that investment and business relations will also be discussed at an industrialists' round table in Lisbon, with the participation of Günter Verheugen and Andris Piebalgs, starting tomorrow, Thursday."
"This round table will then report its conclusions to the summit on Friday."
"I think this is a good contribution to what is really a growing business relationship."
"Russia is a key economic actor and, on WTO, I would like to add that we will help Russia's efforts."
"You know we have always been committed to Russia's WTO accession."
"We also think it is very important to have a level playing field, and that is why we will place so much emphasis on the completion of Russia's accession to the WTO."
"The summit will give a new impetus to this complex process, which is at a critical stage."
"We shall be signing a new agreement on steel on the margins of the summit, thus increasing the quantities which Russia may export to the European Union."
"Another sign of positive elements in EU-Russia cooperation is the fact that the memorandum of understanding between the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction and the Russia Federal Drug Control Service is going to be signed on the margins of the summit."
"On a less positive note, I would like to inform you that, although there was a clear Russian commitment in Samara in May to finally sign our agreement on the Siberian overflights, in time for the next summit in Mafra, prospects for this happening seem to be very slim."
"We want to turn the page on this long-standing dispute."
"A positive move by Russia would then allow us also to go ahead with the aviation summit, planned to take place in Moscow in November, to identify the enormous potential for cooperation in this sector."
"As regards international issues, Kosovo will certainly be one of the most important and we need to consider jointly with Russia how to bring this question to a solution, based on the ongoing efforts of the Troika."
"We must avoid a renewed conflict in the Balkans."
"We will also discuss other important international issues such as the Middle East prior to the Annapolis Conference;"
"Iran, following President Putin's recent visit to Tehran and Afghanistan; Burma/Myanmar; and the situation with regard to the frozen conflicts particularly in Georgia and Moldova."
"We would like to work with Russia in a constructive spirit in the search for solutions for these vexed issues."
"Therefore, what we have to do is continue our ongoing work and never lose sight of our long-term projects."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, we hope that, as the press pointed out, the Portuguese autumn will be warmer than the Russian spring as far as the Samara Summit is concerned."
"As the Commissioner said, I believe that we need to continue working to build the strategic association with Russia, but the climate will depend more on Russia's temperature than that of the European Union: to some extent in the light of what the Commissioner was saying, above all in the light of the new role that Russia wants to play on the international stage, and, in particular, as far as the security of energy supply is concerned."
"However, Mr President, this relationship has to be built on a series of pillars."
"The first is that any decision or any act against a Member State must be seen as a decision or act against the European Union as a whole."
"Secondly, Mr President, the European Union is irrevocably and unquestionably committed to human rights and it has to be very firm when defending those positions."
"In this respect, I feel that we should welcome the Russian Government's decision to authorise and finally grant visas to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to allow it to have a meeting in Moscow."
"One aspect that gives cause for concern is the statement made, in relation to the recent summit of countries bordering the Caspian Sea, about forming a type of broad front to combat to some extent the regional and international threats and some positions in the United Nations."
"I am just finishing up, Mr President."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, defend with pragmatism the European Union's interests, build this association, but do not forget that the figures have to match up to the ideals. I remember something I read in a recent - naturally excellent - article in The Economist: apparently at the Wiesbaden Summit Mr Putin told the Federal Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, that that was where Dostoyevsky had lost at roulette."
"I hope that the European Union is luckier in Portugal than the Russian writer was in Wiesbaden."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, in the run-up to the coming summit, the key assumption for my Group remains that Russia and the European Union have a number of important interests in common and, despite our many differences of opinion, the European Union should continue to operate on the basis of that assumption during the coming summit."
"Russia and Europe need each other to tackle problems in Europe, but they especially need each other for tackling major international issues."
"Sustainable security in Europe is only possible in cooperation with Russia."
"For these reasons we, my Group and I, have always supported the strategic partnership with Russia."
"There is a very full agenda for this summit and the Commissioner and the representative of the Presidency have already spoken about this."
"All the same we hope that at some point there will be some movement on the question of the negotiating mandate for the new partnership and cooperation agreement."
"We hope that a new Polish Government will be able to cooperate with Moscow better and as a result perhaps create some room for progress."
"The energy relationship is extremely important and we also think that the starting point has to be reciprocity, but we do have to realise that we are dealing with a form of mutual independence here that we should try to manage better together."
"We also want more cooperation in the Black Sea area, and we hope that issues such as Transnistria and Georgia will also be discussed at this summit."
"Previous speakers have already mentioned the state of democracy in Russia and, of course, that is not something that can be left out of the discussion."
"We are also concerned about the run-up to the Duma elections."
"We also want the campaigns to be free and fair, and that all parties have an equal chance to have their say."
"That is why it is so important that we press the issue of observers in Moscow: not only observers on the actual election day, but also observers during the campaign in the run-up to the elections."
"We all know how important it is to be able to form a proper judgement of the elections; a country that has ambitions to hold the presidency of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe really should also be able and willing to work with the OSCE when it comes to observing the elections."
"Finally, and I reiterate what I said at the beginning, we should continue to be critical towards Russia; critical when it comes to human rights and democracy, but we should not polarise things unnecessarily."
"Our starting point should still be to be a good neighbour, to cooperate, and to try to tackle issues in Europe together and not to constantly make an issue of things."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, May's summit in Samara exposed the cracks in our strategic partnership with Russia - on energy, on Kosovo and on human rights."
"Those fissures have become fault lines that are now so deep and so wide that we are hard pressed to say how meaningful 'partnership' based on common values can be pursued."
"By Mr Putin's own admission, 'Russia will not soon become, if it ever becomes, a country where liberal values have deep historical roots'."
"How long can we go on ignoring the growing evidence?"
"Not that Russians refuse the cultural trappings of the West, because President Putin has spoken time and again of his country's place at the cultural heart of Europe."
"No, this vehemence, this denial, is directed primarily against what President Barroso calls Europe's 'sacred values' - values like freedom, democracy and the rule of law, which are conspicuously absent in Russia today."
"Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra was right."
"From the Council and the Commission we have heard too much Realpolitik and not enough Moralpolitik."
"Our relationship with Russia is strategic, certainly, but it cannot be described as a partnership."
"We need a pragmatic approach, cooperating where we can on issues of mutual concern, like border crossings, energy supply, and joining the WTO - although yesterday's announcement on price controls on foodstuffs suggests a return to the economic policies of the past."
"Some progress can be made with Russia, but without the fanfare, followed by frustration, which marks too many EU-Russia summits."
"A bit more honesty is needed, too, as Russia comes up to two major elections."
"If human cloning were better developed, President Putin would probably run for both President and Prime Minister following the Kaczyńskis' example in Poland!"
"For a country which overturned oligarchy back in 1917, it is quite incredible that a new autocracy is gaining ground, and we should not cut down our criticisms for fear of endangering a partnership which exists but on paper."
"Only when an independent judiciary, freedom of expression and democracy exist as more than sound bites and when journalists, opposition parties, and NGOs can operate without fear of retribution, can Europe stand in solidarity with Russia."
"It is for that reason that my Group sought a resolution to close this debate, and over 300 MEPs backed our calls."
"We must be prepared to put on paper what we say in public and refute those who say this House is nothing but a glorified talking shop."
"The Reform Treaty promises Parliament a real say on external action for the first time."
"So let us raise our game to meet the challenge and deliver at the summit a message that President Putin cannot ignore."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) The decision taken yesterday by the leaders of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats not to adopt a resolution prior to the EU-Russia Summit demonstrates that we still have a problem with Russia."
"The decision amounts to a serious error."
"This is not the kind of Franco-German engine we expect in our part of Europe."
"Our resolution of 2 May in advance of the Samara Summit was very helpful."
"I trust our silence today is not indicative of an attempt to depart from a clearly defined and demanding policy towards Russia."
"If the approach adopted at Samara is undermined, Russia will become ever more convinced that integration and especially the 2004 enlargement are developments that may be disregarded or played down."
"The politicians who are currently attempting to turn a blind eye to Russia's move towards dictatorship in the name of pseudo-realism are acquiescing to a repeat of the Finnish case."
"They are consenting to discrimination against Central Europe and therefore to weakening the European Union's position as a global partner."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen."
"Minister, you said in your introduction that relations with Russia are good, or anyway better than is reported in the international press."
"Minister, are you living on Mars?"
"Are you living on Venus?"
"Do you dare to tell the Russians what matters, or is the European Union for you ultimately just about money and naked commerce?"
"Is that more important to you than democracy and human rights?"
"Let us not mince words: Russia is sliding down the slippery slope to becoming a full-blown dictatorship with a strong leader: a strong leader who will not tolerate any protest and who deploys his secret FSB police whenever he thinks it necessary; a leader who will not give up power under any condition and who will use all kind of trickery to keep his hands on the reins of power after the parliamentary elections in December and the presidential elections in March."
"Russia, Minister, is evolving into a closed society where the ruling regime would prefer not to allow anyone to look over its shoulders."
"I do not want to confine myself to theoretical considerations."
"The reality is that human rights in Russia are constantly under pressure and the state of democracy there is lamentable."
"The reality is that freedom of speech and press freedom are succumbing to a strict self-censorship."
"The recently passed law on extremism can easily be used to gag independent journalists and political opponents."
"The reality is that the Russian regime sees a strong and independent civil society as undesirable and that the position of NGOs is coming under severe pressure due to very restrictive legislation."
"The reality is, Minister, that free elections are utopia there."
"Only those who are tolerated by the regime can take part."
"The 'Other Russia' coalition united around Gary Kasparov, for instance, has been stopped from taking part in the imminent parliamentary elections."
"To conclude, Minister, the situation in Chechnya may not be a topical issue in politics any more but the reality there is still extremely worrying."
"People are still being murdered, people are being picked up and detained illegally, people are being blackmailed; kidnappings are still a daily occurrence and torture is standard practice."
"That is the reality in Russia, Minister, and I hope that you will remember this when you speak to Mr Putin at the end of this week."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, stability and development in Europe and the world are impossible without sensible cooperation between the European Union and Russia."
"What would I like to see, in contrast to Samara?"
"What I would like is for you to come back and tell us that you have a common strategy with Russia for the resolution of the Kosovo problem and a common strategy for the peace process in the Middle East, and that you have a common position on the nuclear problem in Iran and a common strategy to solve the Transnistria problem."
"It is not just about energy supplies."
"Let us forget about Galileo."
"Industry does not want it, and the taxpayers are supposed to foot the bill."
"Let us work with Russia on a sensible energy policy using new technologies."
"Let us solve the problem of visa-free travel with Russia."
"Why have we still not made much progress here, only for these specific groups?"
"In my view, there is a great deal that could be done."
"What will be the European Union's position on the missile shield?"
"Will we stand with Russia and say that we do not want a US defence shield?"
"I think it would be wonderful if we could achieve that."
"Of course, we also have to be critical of Russia and tell Russia that if I speak out against the anti-terrorism plans being forged by Mr Schäuble and Mr Jung in Germany, then I must also say to Russia that I do not want this anti-discrimination law."
"That is quite clear."
"If our view is that the situation in Chechnya is completely at odds with human rights, we need to make that very clear to the Russians, but we also need to follow up on it afterwards."
"I think that if we have a sensible partnership agreement, this is something that good partners can and must say to each other."
"We need Russia and Russia needs us, and we will go forward together if we put all the issues on the table and, above all, outline ways of resolving them."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, if we want to stand our ground in global terms, it is necessary that the EU as a strong grouping and Russia as a superpower integrate their economies."
"Only in this way will they be capable of facing up to unavoidable political pressures, which might otherwise divide this rational partnership."
"As it stands, Russian exports to the EU, excluding energy-related trade, correspond approximately to those to Morocco or Argentina."
"This is why I support the appeal by the Trade Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, who asked the EU and Russia to stop acting as two cities connected only by a narrow road and a gas pipeline."
"I am convinced that both partners should focus on building long-term, mutually advantageous economic and trade relations and not allow short-term political tactics to take over."
"I believe that it is in the interests of EU citizens that the EU acts with consistency towards Russia, which is not the case at present."
"We should push for the establishment of a more stable political and entrepreneurial climate in Russia, which would encompass fewer obstacles to imports and create a better platform for investors from the EU."
"(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two ways of examining the EU's relations with Russia."
"We can see them either as problems or as opportunities."
"As we know, at present both are in plentiful supply."
"Last week in Lisbon, Union leaders took a step towards a more coherent foreign policy."
"Could not policy on Russia be the first port of call for both sides, which is to say for Russia too?"
"The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement needs revamping, and we know it."
"In the area of the Northern Dimension something has been achieved in matters relating to the Baltic Sea, but we must move on to new areas."
"The road maps exist, but there are not many travellers on the road."
"We have endorsed Russian membership of the WTO."
"We need to finalise the agreement. Then the duty on timber and illegal charges imposed at borders which Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner mentioned would be kept in check."
"We are completely dependent on one another in the matter of energy, but that dependence needs to work both ways."
"Exports represent dependence just as much as imports."
"We therefore need to end the dumb act with Russia."
"Unfortunately, the situation has been going on for a long time, but I salute Poland's new leader, who wanted to improve relations with Russia, and Germany too."
"Russia is obviously more of a problem."
"Talks must also achieve results in the area of citizens' rights, and not just when it is a matter of goods."
"I would ask the Council if the timber duties will be mentioned at the summit."
"Furthermore, what about the new law in Russia regarding the practice whereby a suspect is not handed over for questioning in the country in which the crime has occurred?"
"That is a strange procedure."
"In other words, a criminal who commits an offence in a Member State can seek asylum in Russia."
"Will the Council be addressing this issue at the summit?"
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, from listening to this whole debate and the statements from the Council and the Commission, it has become abundantly clear how difficult it is, with respect to Russia, to combine the requisite respect for that large and important country and that large and important people with the propagation of our fundamental principles on the rule of law, a functioning democracy, free media and respect for human rights."
"It is difficult to find the right balance, all the more so since President Putin, like no other, understands the art of exploiting every difference of opinion or different nuance of opinion between the Member States."
"We have heard that there are soon to be elections in Russia and we know this will be in a few weeks' time."
"In this context I want to stress that the conditions being imposed on parties which are not represented in the Duma are completely unworthy of a democracy."
"Whether we are talking about the amount of the deposit, the number of signatures required, the checks on this - look at what happened in St Petersburg a few months ago - on not one of these points do they meet the criteria that we and the rest of the world would consider constitute free and fair elections."
"In other words, things do not bode well at all."
"We have also heard some very worrying reports about attempts to keep a close check on students' contacts and people on visitors' programmes."
"In other words - and I am coming to the end now Mr President - the Member States need to remain more united and vigilant than ever to allow cooperation to continue."
"(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, Russia is an important partner, but its policies are a cause for concern."
"No statues of Mr Putin have been erected in the streets of Russia as yet, but there are signs of a personality cult."
"The candidacy of the State President in parliamentary elections is an unknown precedent in the history of a democratic state, just like the nomination of the head of the radical movement 'Nashi' for the post of minister for youth affairs and the refusal to receive a delegation from the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"Russia's manipulations of foreign nations are dangerous."
"Investigations in Latvia show that Russia's support for peoples is radically opposed to the integration of society."
"I also fear that the history of the political activities of those persons who recently organised the Russian forum at the European Parliament gives cause to believe there may be destructive plans in other European states."
"Our duty is to combat these manipulations, since Russia is pushing the limits of our patience."
"In relation to the dialogue on energy, it is necessary for the principles and ratification of the Energy Charter to form an integral component of the new agreement, in spite of Moscow's dissatisfaction with the reciprocity clause. Thank you."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear!"
"The decision we took yesterday will be interpreted - and already has been in fact - by the Russian authorities as a great success: no resolution, no message."
"That is a real bonus following the rejection of an official human rights delegation from the European Parliament."
"Russian society is, more than ever, hostage to a propagandist press and is retreating into dangerous nationalism."
"Today in Russia violence based on fear prevails while racism and xenophobia are taking hold."
"The word 'independent' can no longer be used."
"'Independent' human rights activists, journalists or political opponents are automatically labelled 'enemies of the regime'."
"A law adopted in 2007 is officially devoted to them."
"Under the guise of combating extremism, it actually gives the authorities complete freedom in this unfair fight."
"As Marie Mendras told us yesterday, this climate of permanent violation of human rights is not spurring the people there into action."
"Mr Putin's gamble has thus paid off: he has managed to convince his fellow citizens that Russia has its own special rules when it comes to democracy and human rights."
"With such a belief, it is no surprise whatsoever that Russia is still the last member of the Council of Europe not to have ratified Protocol 14."
"This is for Putin a godsend, a blessing."
"It means that he does not have to comply with the rulings and can prevent the cases from going anywhere, particularly those of tortured Chechens."
"In light of this situation, it would be naive to think that free and transparent elections will take place in Russia on 2 December."
"Given the circumstances, are they not really just a plebiscite for or against Vladimir Putin?"
"Without any amendment to the Constitution, he will continue to have power over all political, economic, financial, administrative, judicial and security matters."
"On the eve of the EU-Russia Summit, I am calling on the Council and the Commission to include human rights at the highest political level."
"It is vital that they play a key role, whether discussing the future agreement, Kosovo or energy."
"That is what Russian democrats ask of us."
"They simply say: 'Continue to talk about them, continue to tell the truth'."
"At least we are not risking our lives when doing so."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, debate on the EU-Russia relationship is one of the most frequent themes in this House."
"The same clichés are regularly heard, whether intentional or motivated by misunderstanding or ignorance of the issues."
"In spite of this, whether or not we want to, we must deal with Russia as a partner."
"If we cannot find a shared language and do not strive to gradually improve relationships, the EU will suffer from it more than Russia."
"This does not imply closing our eyes to difficulties, but rather looking reality in the face and judging everyone by the same measure."
"It is a fact that today's Russia is stronger economically and is as a consequence more self-confident."
"It also protects its own interests just as the US does or for that matter the EU."
"We need a sober approach."
"This is why I am happy that by postponing the resolution we gave a freer hand to our representatives at the summit in Portugal."
"Today's Russia is not the former Soviet Union."
"I am saying this not only from my own long experience of work in this country, but also on the basis of words borrowed from the head of American diplomacy."
"(NL) Madam President, I would like to thank the Presidency-in-Office and the President of the Commission."
"I do not plan to measure the success of the summit by the length of the final joint declaration."
"What is important to me - and I hope this will be discussed - is that we flesh out the details on those topics where we know that we have to find solutions together."
"Relations between the EU and Russia are incredibly complex."
"That is not going to change at this election time."
"However, we really must acknowledge that for Russia and the EU there is no economic and political alternative to partnership."
"Madam President, we have an excellent agreement for that partnership."
"It has been in place now for ten years."
"How are we going to handle that creatively in the future?"
"The summit is also an important occasion to ask for clarification about the concept of democracy and I thank the Commission for what it plans to do on this point."
"What always strikes me is that in Russia stability and democracy are seen as opposites; that is not and never can be our view, of course."
"It is very important for all of us that Russia enters the WTO."
"(DE) Madam President, there is not much point in playing Realpolitik and Moralpolitik off against each other, as Mr Watson has said."
"The fact is that we need both: in our dealings with Russia, we need to be realistic and we need to be clear and firm about our ethical and moral standpoint."
"Many of us thought that, after the collapse of communism, Russia would simply vanish from the world stage, and that is what many people wanted."
"However, that did not happen. It did not happen mainly because, due to rising energy prices, Russia has been able to increase its revenues and thus regain power in the international arena."
"We have to recognise that; if we do not, we fail to recognise reality."
"There is something that we do not want to accept, however, and that of course is the negative developments, and both the Council Presidency and the Commissioner have made that clear."
"We are not prepared simply to accept that more and more steps are being taken to dismantle democracy in Russia."
"These are steps which we cannot accept and which have nothing to do with democracy-building and everything to do with its erosion."
"We do not want to accept that Russia, unfortunately, is unwilling to offer its neighbours - our common neighbours - an open partnership."
"That would be in our interests, and we should make it very clear that we want to work with Russia to foster this partnership, but with a Russia which recognises the independence and sovereignty of all its neighbours."
"What we cannot accept is a situation in which Russia rightly seeks to influence other countries through its membership of the Council of Europe or the OSCE, for example, yet on the other hand does not wish to take on responsibility and therefore objects to election observation, for instance."
"We should not distrust the elections on principle, but a country such as Russia which thinks that it has fully developed its democracy must also allow some measure of scrutiny."
"If Russia wishes to play a major role in the Council of Europe and the OSCE, then we must call on Russia to demonstrate this by admitting election observers to ascertain whether its own elections are transparent and fair."
"That is the clear message that the European Union should be sending to Russia."
"(PL) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that as we debate relations between Russia and the European Union we should ask ourselves what Russia wants from the European Union and what the European Union expects from Russia."
"A certain Russian politician has stated that Russia should now opt for a so-called policy of containment."
"If Russia does indeed do so, this will in a sense imply a return to the Cold War era."
"We should consider what exactly Russia would be attempting to contain."
"Perhaps the winds of freedom, originating in the European Union?"
"This is a major problem."
"At the same time, the European Union claims to be seeking a strategic partnership with Russia."
"The challenge is certainly a difficult one, and we would do well to bear in mind that the principles of the rule of law are an essential prerequisite to developing a sound partnership with Russia."
"The rule of law involves the independence of the courts."
"It involves freedom for the media, freedom of expression and economic freedom."
"It also involves not jailing entrepreneurs."
"Furthermore, it involves applying the principles of the rule of law in the area of international relations, which implies unfreezing the conflicts in the Caucasus and in Moldova and urging the international community to take up the issue of Kosovo."
"(PL) Madam President, the EU-Russia Summit coincides with a crucial time in the history of Russia, namely the end of Mr Putin's era."
"Will this era really come to an end, though?"
"The presidential elections in the Russian Federation will not result in change."
"Power will remain in the hands of the same individual who will this time bear the title of Prime Minister."
"Andrei Lugovoi, the alleged murderer of Alexander Litvinenko, is set to become a Member of Parliament, thus acquiring immunity."
"The Russian authorities are therefore openly protecting an individual who appears to have committed a serious crime on the territory of the European Union."
"In so doing, they are sending out a clear message that the Kremlin's interests take precedence over all laws and over respect for European Union Member States."
"Nothing will change after the elections. The people of Chechnya will continue to be exterminated, the press will continue to be silenced, and the Kremlin's abundant reserves of natural resources will allow it to continue implementing a brutal foreign policy."
"I very much hope that the European Union's representatives will bear this in mind during their talks with the Russian delegation. Our representatives should also remember that the talks themselves are not significant."
"They will only become so if they lead to genuine changes within the Russian Federation."
"Madam President, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner to provide this House with assurances, as was requested yesterday, that the views expressed by it will be put directly to President Putin and to his advisers at Mafra on Friday."
"We have heard about the three guiding principles, which President Barroso describes as sacred principles, of solidarity, reciprocity and the rule of law."
"Being Portuguese, the President-in-Office will know that my own country, England, has one of the oldest of alliances with his country."
"We therefore understand what solidarity and mutual support means."
"If we forget, our mutual patron saint, São Jorge, is there to remind us."
"An attack on one Member State or on one Member State's diplomats, or cyber attacks on one Member State, are an attack on the whole of the EU."
"It is surely appropriate that President Putin be reminded that this solidarity and reciprocity are essential to us."
"We cannot accept the concept of sovereign democracy if it means, on the one hand, that Russia accedes to international organisations - Commissioner, you have referred to the WTO - promising to abide by undertakings, and then fails to meet those undertakings."
"That has to be underlined."
"Tomorrow, Mikhail Khodorkovsky comes to the end of his four-year prison sentence in Siberia."
"According to Russian law, that sentence should have been served in Moscow."
"It might be appropriate to remind President Putin that the rule of law is a two-way thing, as far as our relationship is concerned."
"Mr Khodorkovsky will not be freed, as new charges have been raised."
"You might ask what relevance this has to the EU."
"The answer is that many EU shareholders are concerned that commercial and legal commitments are not being followed through."
"Finally, President-in-Office, we are not condemned to cooperation, and cannot have a partnership without mutual respect and mutual understanding."
"We are trying very hard from our side to ensure that."
"We need assurances from President Putin that he understands our guiding principles."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with the words of Minister Antunes when he says that the EU-Russia relationship is stronger and more solid than it might at first glance appear."
"The EU and Russia share an interest in a strategic partnership."
"After all we inhabit the same continent."
"There is a mutual economic dependency."
"Without a mutual collaboration we cannot solve any serious international issue, be it global warming, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, conflict in the Middle East or in Kosovo, and so on."
"In other words, strong, versatile and balanced neighbourly relations between the EU and Russia have a fundamental bearing on the stability, security and prosperity of the whole of Europe."
"While cultivating and strengthening this relationship we should not forget, however, the fundamental values underlying the EU, such as human rights and civil liberties, democracy and the rule of law."
"I am convinced that we should keep reminding our Russian colleagues of these values now in relation to the imminent elections in Russia."
"At the upcoming summit in Mafra, the EU should also be reminding our Russian partners of the principles of transparency and reciprocity in economic relations."
"European markets should in fact remain open to Russian firms."
"Equally, however, Russian markets should be fully open to European firms, including the energy markets and associated firms."
"(EL) Madam President, the transition to a new Strategic Partnership between the EU and Russia is not an easy undertaking."
"It is hampered by successive divergences, which are sometimes a source of considerable tension."
"Over-dramatisation of these divergences allows the constraining patterns of the past to re-emerge, makes the present uncertain and hinders constructive progress."
"Some reasonable questions may be asked about the EU-Russia partnership."
"Has Russia come to terms with the reality of the enlarged Union?"
"Has the Union got over its teething troubles with expansion in the east?"
"Do the new Member States feel they are participating in an effective European security system?"
"How is the Union responding to Russia's attempt to redefine and strengthen its new role in the international balance of powers?"
"Will the two sides continue in a climate of distrust and 'quiet diplomacy', or will they seek to achieve common action plans?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that sector-based approaches alone are not the best option."
"The declared aim of creating four common spaces must remain politically binding, and likewise the aim of Russia's accession to the WTO."
"Broad, robust partnership structures are therefore needed for cooperation in the areas of: economic issues; freedom, security and justice; external security; and research, education and culture."
"Russophobia is inappropriate for an EU based on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms."
"I understand the sensitivities among some citizens of the new Member States, but over-emphasis on past experiences may cast doubt on the prospects for transparent political cooperation and close institutional interconnection."
"President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is in the mutual interests of the Union and Russia to set common political and economic targets for the sake of democratic principle, peace, stability and security."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by highlighting the importance of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia, and by stating my affection for the people of the Russian Federation, and indeed for all the nations of Russia."
"I also wish to recognise Russia's achievements in terms of economic development and dealing with the social crisis."
"A genuine strategic partnership demands a serious and honest approach to mutual relations, however."
"The European Union has noted with concern the emergence of a new system of authority centred on President Putin."
"This system threatens to permanently weaken liberal democracy in Russia itself. It is also fanning the flames of neo-imperialism in Russian foreign policy."
"In the documents it has prepared in advance of the EU-Russia Summit, Amnesty International draws attention to human rights violations in Russia."
"The information provided by Amnesty relates to the infringement of human rights by governmental authorities in the northern Caucasus, notably in Chechnya and Ingushetia, to the worsening situation regarding freedom of expression and association, to the murder of journalists and to the increase in racially-motivated violence."
"The Portuguese Presidency should raise the issues referred to by Amnesty International at the summit due to take place in Mafra on 26 October 2007."
"Russian civil society, journalists and human rights activists need to be able to perceive the European Union as a guardian of fundamental rights and as an ally of a Russia that is democratic, liberal and open to the world."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the EU-Russia Summit will prompt us to pause for a moment and define our common interests for once, for these common interests undoubtedly exist."
"They include economic interests and security policy interests, notably on issues such as the Middle East, Iran and combating terrorism and so on, where we must recognise that we cannot achieve our objectives without Russia on board."
"However, Russia must also understand that if it does not come on board, it will be undermining its own interests."
"Looking at Russia's demographic development and the vast expanses of Siberia, and at the countries with large populations here, if I were on the Russian side, I would not be imagining a threat from Europe."
"In the long term, I would see the threat as coming from elsewhere."
"I think that here, there is a high level of consensus on where we need to act."
"On the so-called Western side, we - and I include the Americans here - did not really take Russia seriously when things were going badly for that country, with the result that it is now reverting to a more imperialist type of behaviour."
"This also applies to developments in Russia itself, notably in respect of human rights and press freedom, and its increasingly frequent and unacceptable statements concerning the independence of its neighbours."
"It is not acceptable that demands are being made of Russia's 'near abroad' to the effect that certain types of conduct must be adopted towards a specific country."
"Every country has the right to take its decisions on a free and independent basis, and to determine where its path should lead."
"Russia has to accept that."
"There can be no reversion to outdated notions and the use of energy as a weapon, which is even less acceptable."
"We can only move forward if we embark on a careful analysis of our interests again."
"I think that, once the elections are over in Russia, this will again be possible, and I also hope that it will stop Russia from proceeding down the wrong economic path."
"The large amounts of revenue flowing into the country from its oil and gas operations are being used to revitalise the old heavy-industrial combines in the aerospace, shipbuilding and similar sectors."
"If the situation takes a turn for the worse, they will face the same disastrous scenario as before, for Russia has not built up a sound, broad-based economic structure with small and medium-sized enterprises, and the consequences of that failure are obvious."
"It is in our interests, too, to ensure that no new vacuums emerge in Russia if oil prices fall."
"(PT) The summit may prove useful in resolving the ambiguities that continue to affect relations between the European Union and Moscow."
"However, Minister Amado has already been careful to lower the bar by explaining that the Presidency does not have an ambitious agenda for the Mafra summit."
"In a recent interview with LUSA, his counterpart, Mr Lavrov, complained about the growing disease in the European Union, alluding to the unconstructive attitude of certain members."
"Yet what is poisoning our relations is the slow death of democracy, human rights, freedom of the press and rule of law in Russia and the impunity with which former members of the security forces are defining the agenda of the Russian Federation."
"This is worrying European public opinion and is reflected in our relations."
"The growing disease in the European Union, namely disagreement, is being treated and the Reform Treaty is a potent remedy."
"Unfortunately, there is no cure in sight for the drift towards autocracy of Putin's Russia and, if the Council of the European Union continues to shut its eyes to the situation, it will take even longer to find a cure."
"(RO) The Mafra Summit of 26 October 2007 will take place on the brink of events of major importance for the future of the relations between the European Union and Russia."
"I would mention only a few of them: the expiry of the partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia, the parliamentary elections of December 2007 and the presidential elections of March 2008 in Russia."
"This context offers the possibility not only to urge Russia toward an open and honest dialogue with the European Union, but also to make a cold review of the last 10 years of cooperation."
"Joining the previous speeches of my colleagues, I would like to focus my speech on the important role Russia should play in the common neighbourhood and in the Black Sea region."
"The review of the last 10 years proves to us that frozen conflicts have persisted in this region and that Russia's economic and political relations both with the countries in the region and with its neighbours, current European Union Members, are not always based on reciprocity, confidence and the principle of good relations."
"If we speak about frozen conflicts, a good recent and well-known example in this respect refers to the conditions under which the political prisoners Andrei Ivanţoc and Tudor Popa were released, they being living proof of the fact that there is instability in the area, that there is an area of insecurity that affects the entire region."
"Consequently, the Mafra Summit should also approach these themes, reminding of the fundamental objective that the European Union has undertaken - namely to create a true area of democracy, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region and common neighbourhood."
"In this context, Russia's position and constructive involvement in this respect, in compliance with the international standards and obligations, should be a permanent theme in the European Union dialogue with this country."
"A truly strategic partnership and a strong and advantageous relationship involve increased responsibility and a firm commitment from both parties."
"(ET) Yesterday a Hungarian puppet show opened in Parliament."
"I was struck by the thought of how we sometimes vote here, by numbly raising our hands."
"Have we become puppets too?"
"There are rumours of back-door deals on a proposal by the Presidency to allow the resolution on Russia to slip through, ostensibly so that it would not cloud the atmosphere of the European Union-Russia summit."
"It is scandalous that we so meekly surrender our own stance on self-expression."
"This is the best example of how Europe has failed to understand that the problem in relations with Russia lies not in the details but in how we conduct ourselves."
"Previously the European Parliament has opposed situations such as these, but today it would appear to me that the fear which continues to paralyse Russian society has begun to affect us."
"Why are we repeatedly making exceptions for Russia?"
"Do we continue to believe as before in our own principles or do we allow the thought to force its way into our heads that Russia is so different that not only our pancakes but our relations as a partnership must be after the Russian fashion."
"Such behaviour is destructive to both sides, to the European Union as well as to Russia itself."
"Madam President, I think it is high time to face realities."
"Mr Watson has said that there are cracks in the present cooperation mechanism which are developing towards becoming fissures."
"The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement declares that we share the same values."
"However, some years ago, Chris Patten wrote that he does not believe that we really share the same values at this point."
"The traditional feature of Russian state policies is pretending - building Potemkin villages - and Mr Putin is still pretending to have democracy while having almost completed building up the authoritarian highly nationalist state."
"We also pretend that the coming elections will be crucial."
"I doubt it, because everything has been prepared to manipulate these elections and to obtain results in accordance with Mr Putin's wishes, including artificial opposition parties and the creation of phoney NGOs."
"If we now agree to play along with this game of pretending, pretending we believe in this sort of democracy, we are going to take co-responsibility for what is going to happen in Russia and for the fate of ordinary Russians who deserve better than this fake democracy."
"I strongly disagree, therefore, with the Council statement that there is no alternative to cooperation."
"Democracy is based upon creating and having alternatives and we also have to commit ourselves to strongly defending human rights."
"We have to balance our relations and we have to signal that we are prepared to stop our cooperation if Russia does not answer with reciprocity and openness."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have paid close attention to all the speeches made here today on the imminent summit between the European Union and Russia and in general on relations between the EU and Russia and also on Russia's internal situation as you see it."
"I must say that, as of course is my duty, I have duly noted and will take due account of these opinions."
"In my view, there is one common thread running through all the comments and analyses made here today which is that Russia is a strategic partner for the European Union."
"The EU needs Russia in the same way that Russia needs the EU."
"It is based on this absolutely undeniable finding that we must build a relationship which is course mutually beneficial but which is also solid and firm, based on common values and principles."
"Mention has been made of solidarity, human rights and reciprocity."
"Now more than ever the European Union must stand firm before Russia in terms of its internal solidarity."
"A problem for one Member State - and I have always said this - is a problem for all Member States."
"This solidarity cannot under any circumstances be called into question."
"On the issue of human rights, we all know that at the root of our Union lies respect for rule of law, democracy and human rights."
"These are our inalienable values and principles which must guide our relations with third countries in all cases."
"For our part, we must of course ensure reciprocity."
"However, in so doing, we are also entitled to expect reciprocity from others."
"If, at this moment in time, there are fracture lines as the Member has stated, I consider that the European Union and Russia can only stand to gain by doing everything possible within the reference framework that I mentioned, in other words a framework of solidarity, reciprocity and respect for human rights."
"It is certainly essential for the European Union that these fractures are healed and so this is what we are going to work towards."
"In our work we will naturally be aware of the difficulties and different goals, but we will also be determined as we are also aware that the current situation does not serve the best interests of the Union."
"It is of course our duty to work in the interests of the European Union and we will do this openly and transparently, by talking face to face as we must always do with partners who we regard as strategic."
"It will certainly be an intense and important dialogue."
"We will talk about economics, trade, human rights and of course the international political situation and the regional political situation."
"We hope - and this is what we will work towards - that, despite the difficulties, problems and differences of opinion, despite everything, we will be able, at the end of this summit on Friday, to say that some progress has been made in our relations and that, despite the difficulties, we have managed to achieve our objectives."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up on some of the points made."
"The debate has made one thing very clear: the very wide relationship of tension here today."
"I am still of the opinion that Russia is a strategic partner."
"However, I also said that it is of course a neighbour country and that is why it is especially important to take issues such as those raised by Graham Watson, Christopher Beazley and others very seriously."
"We do indeed take them seriously."
"Let us just cast a glance back to the previous summit in Samara."
"On that occasion, Angela Merkel, as the President of the Council, put her cards on the table, not only in the meeting but also to the media."
"Please do not think, therefore, that these values are not important to us."
"We know that there are some very worrying developments as regards media freedom, the independence of the judiciary, and the issue of fairness, also in relation to the elections."
"All the issues which have been raised today are of course the right ones."
"However, let me also say that Elmar Brok's comments describe a little of my own view, namely that we need to define our interests clearly."
"On the one hand, there are very substantial security issues at stake here, of course, while on the other, there are human rights and democratic interests."
"It is also important, of course, to mention the three major principles which Mr Beazley has referred to: solidarity, reciprocity and the rule of law."
"Naturally, they appear in various forms and we cannot argue with that."
"You are absolutely right, Mr Beazley, but I can assure you that they will be on the table as well."
"I know that President Barroso will address these issues very clearly, especially in the context of energy, for example."
"As you are aware, the Commission has just adopted a package of measures which point in this direction."
"We want clear rules here which are upheld by everyone in the interests of true reciprocity."
"Having said that, I would just like to remind you of one point: the more we are prepared genuinely to speak with one voice in the European Union, the stronger we will be."
"As we all know, we do not always manage to do that."
"However, the stronger Russia becomes, the more we should speak with one voice."
"We have this energy dependence, but we can only defend our interests effectively if we send out a strong and clear message."
"Perhaps we have not paid enough attention to that in the past, and when Russia was in a weaker economic position, so to speak, we probably did not give it enough support."
"Today, however, we must pursue a position which is based on reciprocity and seek a genuine partnership approach, but this means that Russia must recognise what is important to us as well."
"Six motions for a resolution to wind up the debate have been tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) In connection with the EU-Russia summit, I would like to draw attention to a few factors concerning energy policy."
"It is no exaggeration to say that the rules of the market economy are not applied at present in the Russian energy industry."
"Russia does not identify with the principles of protecting foreign investment and non-discriminatory trade."
"It seeks admission to the European energy sector, but meanwhile does not open its own market to foreign businesses."
"In matters relating to energy in recent years, we have also seen Moscow use its energy exports to exert political pressure on numerous occasions."
"This has gone hand in hand with efforts aimed at sowing discord among European Union Member States."
"When devising a common European energy policy, we need to take into consideration the fact that Russia is already unable to meet its natural gas consumption and export requirements from its own gas resources."
"A not insignificant percentage of its gas requirement is therefore imported from Central Asia."
"A decline in supplies could mean Moscow using politics to an even greater extent as the basis for fulfilling its energy orders in future."
"We believe it is important to apply the principle of free competition in the European Union's foreign relations too."
"We must make it clear that we consider it unacceptable to try to create a monopoly over energy resources."
"Ensuring a stable energy supply is a fundamental concern of the European Union."
"We are convinced that the mounting pressure being exerted on Member States can be combated successfully only by a united European Union acting on the principle of Community solidarity."
"At present it is impossible to conceive of Europe's energy supply without Russia."
"At the same time, however, this special relationship must be based on reciprocity."
"Now and in the past, the EU and Russia have been linked by their common history, strong economic and political contacts and shared traditions."
"Their close cooperation has deepened further through the ongoing process of globalisation and the European countries' growing demand for fossil fuels."
"In order to safeguard energy supplies in future too, the EU Member States have relied on more intensive cooperation in this sector since the 1990s."
"The Energy Charter is a key instrument in this context."
"This treaty serves to promote the development of the Eastern European countries' energy potential while guaranteeing the EU Member States' continued energy supply."
"As the line between foreign policy/external trade issues and energy supply issues is becoming increasingly blurred, Russia's failure to ratify the Energy Charter is worrying."
"In this respect, the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights must never be put at risk, also in the EU's external relations."
"In light of the strong economic interdependence between the EU and Russia, threatening economic gestures can never be a useful means by which to achieve foreign policy objectives and must therefore be rejected."
"I urge the Commission and the Council to withstand Russian attempts to secure unilateral advantages in the European energy markets."
"Full reciprocity in market liberalisation and protection of investments must be safeguarded."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. for the award of the LUX Prize and resumed at 12.00 noon)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I have a request to make to the President of Parliament, not to you as President in the Chair, but to the President of the House."
"I have a request to make on behalf of my Group."
"However, I am sure I speak for all democratic groups in the House."
"I take the view, as do my colleagues, that the matter which I wish to raise is so serious that I must ask President Pöttering to take action against the individuals I am about to name."
"Major protests have occurred in Budapest over the last two days."
"There is nothing unusual about that: demonstrations are a normal occurrence in Europe's capitals, and they sometimes spiral into violence."
"One might certainly object to that, but they cannot be prevented."
"However, there is a new dimension to the events that have occurred in Budapest in recent days, and I would like to tell you why."
"You can think what you like about Prime Minister Gyurcsány."
"You may be for him, or you may be against him."
"What is not acceptable, ladies and gentlemen ..."
"(Uproar in the Chamber)"
"You may be for Prime Minister Gyurcsány or you may be against him."
"What is not acceptable, ladies and gentlemen - and I suggest that you look very carefully to see who is already trying to shout me down - what is not acceptable is that a Prime Minister in the European Union is branded a 'dirty Jew' during demonstrations."
"That adds a new dimension, and it is a dimension of the Fascists, on this side of the House."
"(Sustained applause)"
"I would be grateful, Mr President, if you would ask Mr Pöttering to express the House's overwhelming support for the issuing of a reprimand to these people."
"(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"Thank you very much."
"I think that the message has been fully understood but I will of course pass it on."
"Mr President, I rise on a completely different matter."
"I should just like to express, on behalf of many in my Group and I am sure of many others, our thanks to you for organising this presentation of the LUX Prize."
"It is the kind of thing we have not done as a Parliament before."
"It is the kind of thing we should do, and, as a former Swedish Prime Minister once said, 'politicians would do well to go the cinema more often'."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, I am grateful to you for your comments."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the pleasure of reminding you that today we are celebrating the 62nd anniversary of the United Nations."
"You should have received in the last few days a copy of the message from the UN Secretary-General to mark the occasion."
"I also wish to inform you of the official launch today in the European Parliament in Strasbourg of the annual report on cooperation between the European Union and the UN on crisis management, development and the promotion of democracy and fundamental rights."
"This act is testament to the importance of the relationship between our institutions, our common commitment to multilateralism and the importance of us working together for the peace and welfare of our fellow citizens."
"Statement by the President: see Minutes"
"Welcome"
"I have the pleasure of telling you that, in the framework of interparliamentary meetings, a Mauritanian delegation, led by Mr Ould Tolba, is currently visiting the European Parliament."
"I would like to wish our guests a warm welcome and emphasise the importance we place on such a visit, the first in Europe for almost 10 years."
"Through its election observation missions the European Union has been paying close attention to the recent political transition in Mauritania, which could set an example for the region."
"We congratulate you on the democratic election of your Head of State and Parliament and, on behalf of this Parliament, I hope that your meetings here are fruitful and that your visit to Strasbourg can actively contribute to bringing our two institutions closer together."
"Thank you once again for your visit."

"Immunity and privileges of Gian Paolo Gobbo (vote)"
"- Report: Wallis"
"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I believe that the next report is the report by Mrs Wallis."
"On behalf of my Group, the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group, I would like to invoke Rule 168 and table a motion for this report to be referred back to committee."
"Mr President, this motion is based on Rule 168 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Upon reading Mrs Wallis's report it is very clear that the rapporteur and perhaps the committee are confused over Article 9 and Article 10 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities."
"The report states that Mr Gobbo's behaviour did not comply with Article 9 but Article 9 refers to the words and acts of the Member in the exercise of his functions, notably in this Chamber."
"Consequently, it was not Article 9 of the Protocol that should have been examined, but Article 10, which refers to other acts by a Member. What needed to be examined was whether or not Mr Gobbo's acts - which, I must add, I do not support on a political level - fell into the political sphere."
"These acts obviously do fall within the political sphere."
"Mr Gobbo committed a number of acts in the name of what he calls 'Padania'."
"These are naturally political acts and there is no doubt that, given the traditional case-law on immunity, a Member of any other political bent would have had his immunity confirmed, as was the case in the Italian Parliament for the national members of parliament who carried out the same actions as Mr Gobbo."
"As a result, if Mrs Wallis's report is adopted as it stands, we risk introducing a distinction, a form of discrimination between national immunity and European immunity, contrary to the Protocol, which refers precisely to national immunity."
"That is why I believe that this report should be referred back to committee."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am in favour of referring the matter back to committee, although my reasons might be a little different."
"In actual fact, judging by Rules 5, 6 and 7 of the Rules of Procedure and Articles 9 and 10 of the Protocol, Parliament clearly is not competent to express a view on the facts alleged against Mr Gobbo, simply because at the time of those facts Gian Paolo Gobbo was not a Member of the European Parliament."
"Article 9 of the Protocol, which safeguards MEPs' freedom of expression, refers to people who were Members of this House when they used certain terms or committed acts identifiable with them."
"Since Mr Gobbo was not an MEP at the time of the facts, I believe that the most proper solution should be for Parliament to refrain from taking a stance because he was not a colleague of ours."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, as the author of this report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can confirm to the House that there was a full debate in committee before the report was presented in plenary."
"The committee also heard from Mr Gobbo, and there was a clear majority in favour of the report."
"It is a shame that Mr Gollnisch did not raise the issues he mentioned before, but I am perfectly comfortable and perfectly confident that the committee adopted its position in full knowledge of all the facts and all the regulations."
"I see no reason why the report should now be referred back to that committee."
"(Parliament rejected the request to refer the matter back to committee)"

"Draft amending budget No 6/2007 (vote)"
"- Report: Elles"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the Commission."
"In its preliminary draft amending budget 6/2007, the Commission proposed the creation of a new budget item - 'Damage requests resulting from legal procedures against the Commission's decisions in the field of competition' and the classification of the related expenditure under Heading 1a of the multiannual financial framework as it refers to an operational activity in the competition policy area."
"The Commission would charge against this budget item possible budgetary implications stemming from rulings of the Court of Justice or the Court of First Instance in the field of competition."
"The need for this budget item derives from recent judgments of the Court of First Instance and from the structure of the budget."
"While fines in the field of competition policy are entered as general budget revenue, the amounts to be paid require the creation of a budget item in the expenditure side of the budget, which does not exist at the moment."
"The Commission takes note that the budgetary authority does not intend to support the creation of this budget item for the year 2007."
"Despite this decision, if necessary the Commission may have to proceed to payments in order to meet legal obligations that might result from the Court's decisions in 2007 within the limits of the current budget and in application of the relevant rules."
"It does not prejudge the final decision on the creation of the dedicated budget line and on the classification of the related expenditure within the multiannual financial framework."
"14."
"Protocol amending TRIPS (vote)"
"- Recommendation: Susta"
"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, the basis for agreement with the Council on this report was a statement made by the Commission which was supposed to be read out yesterday during the debate."
"However, that statement was not read out."
"If the Council would agree to attach it to the Minutes or give it some kind of legal status and transparency, then that would help further the process on this issue."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, access to affordable pharmaceutical products in poor developing countries and LDCs is essential to attain the proposed EU development goals and would contribute to poverty reduction, increase human security and promote human rights and sustainable development."
"I think we both agree on the importance of ensuring the coherence of EU policies and that consistency in the EU's external actions, namely trade and development policies, should go hand in hand."
"We recognise that the mechanism created by the WTO decision and the protocol to the TRIPS Agreement represent just a part of the solution to the problem of access to medicines and public health, and that other measures to improve health care and infrastructure are equally indispensable."
"Even if the TRIPS amendment is not the complete solution, we believe that the positive acceptance of the protocol represents an important step."
"To this effect, it is worth recalling that the Member States of the European Union remain free under WTO rules to use the different exceptions provided under the TRIPS Agreement in their domestic patent laws, including those provided for under Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement."
"Furthermore, in order to facilitate access to medicines in countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector, the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission all worked hard to adopt Regulation (EC) No 816/2006 on compulsory licensing of patents relating to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for export to countries with public health problems."
"Let me add that we support the use of the 'flexibilities' built into the TRIPS Agreement and recognised by paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the Doha Declaration as well as the additional flexibilities for less-developed countries made available pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Doha Declaration, in order to be able to provide essential medicines at affordable prices under their domestic public health programmes."
"In view of the Doha Declaration in the framework of the EPA negotiations with the ACP countries and other future bilateral and regional agreements with poor developing countries and LDCs, the European Union is not asking, and does not foresee asking, to negotiate pharmaceutical-related provisions, sometimes referred to as TRIPS+ provisions, affecting public health and access to medicines."
"Finally, we look favourably upon initiatives encouraging the transfer of technology, research, capacity strengthening, regional supply systems and help with registration in order to facilitate and increase the production of pharmaceutical products by the developing countries themselves and we will work with Member States towards that end."
"Concerning the corresponding measures and the budgetary procedures, we are sure that the commitment of the European Parliament which has raised the visibility of the issue of access to medicines will help to increase their efficiency."

"The Sittings Service is not in agreement, but I will ask Mr Davies to explain briefly."

"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"- Before the final vote:"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is most regrettable that the House has not had the courage to voice genuine and serious criticism of a tax policy trend in the European Union which is moving in completely the wrong direction, which benefits multinational corporations and the wealthy to an unbelievable extent, while consumers, workers and especially the low-paid face an ever heavier tax burden."
"In my view, the report is unacceptable as it stands."
"I wish to withdraw my name from this report and appeal to everyone in this House who genuinely wants a tax policy for the European Union which not only serves the interests of the top ten thousand but genuinely benefits the majority of Europe's citizens: please, vote against this report."

"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"(in writing). - (CS) It can be reasonably assumed that the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, as recommended for second reading (Council common position), will contribute towards reinforcing legal security of both natural persons and legal entities within the Member States."
"It is well-known that the service of the above documents is a serious issue, with a significant impact on both the process of justice and civil and commercial relations."
"I believe that the recommendation of the European Parliament is in line with the effort to produce high-quality legislation at Community level."
"In relation to the agreements between the EC and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on readmission and the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas which are to be approved by the European Parliament, I believe that insofar as these agreements - and similar agreements with the Western Balkan countries - have a significance in terms of generally strengthening the rule of law and fighting against crime, issues related to illegal migration should be resolved first of all by economic and political means."
"In addition, I would like to underline another important factor mentioned in the relevant reports which is that the conclusion of these agreements will imply a considerable financial burden for Macedonia and other Western Balkan countries."
"Taking into account the economic situation in these states it is essential that the Community provide appropriate and effective assistance, in particular financial."
"in writing. - (NL) I remember in the early '60s there were reciprocal visa requirements for inhabitants of the countries of the then European Community and those of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"Shortly after that those visa requirements were abolished."
"This meant that the populations of the seven countries that together still made up Yugoslavia at that time were free to travel throughout much of Europe."
"Only for EU Member State Slovenia and candidate country Croatia has that not changed."
"The inhabitants of all the other territories, including candidate country Macedonia, have been cut off from the EU Member States since 1992."
"The young generation that has grown up since then has hardly been able to go outside their own borders."
"At the embassies of the EU countries in the Macedonian capital Skopje, for instance, you find large signs listing a large number of strict obligations."
"Only criminals can easily meet them, but students, researchers and journalists cannot."
"I support the improved access for those groups from 2008 and the lowering of the visa fee to EUR 35."
"Unlike some other members of my Group, I do not see the introduction of biometric registration as a reason to reject this improvement."
"I regret the conditional sale with the readmission policy, which does not adequately guarantee the safety of the refugees concerned."
"in writing. - (PT) The mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund to help the populations of Germany and France (La Réunion) who were the victims of natural disasters in January and February respectively proves, despite the delay, the relevance and importance of this Fund in assisting Member States."
"Bearing in mind the deadlock in the Council on a decision on the Commission proposal to improve this Fund, we would reiterate that the continued eligibility of regional disasters must be defended."
"The European Parliament has previously confirmed that 'the EUSF should continue to enable action to be taken in the case of disasters which, although significant, do not achieve the minimum level required and that assistance may also be provided in special circumstances in cases where most of the population in a specific region has been affected by a disaster which will have serious, long-term effects on their living conditions'."
"It is also essential to recognise the particular characteristics of Mediterranean natural disasters, such as droughts and fires - particularly in terms of time limits and eligible actions - and the possibility of higher levels of financial assistance for 'cohesion' countries and 'convergence' regions in the event of a disaster."
"The creation of an EU agricultural disaster fund must also be assessed."
"in writing. - (FR) Mrs Castex voted for the Susta report on the Protocol amending the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement)."
"For French Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the agreement hereby obtained, which will allow countries to produce generic drugs and export them to poor developing nations with no capability of producing these medicines themselves, constitutes an important step forwards."
"For French Members of the Socialist Group, this report makes a positive contribution to resolving a public health problem that is clearly a matter of serious concern."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the protocol amending the agreement on TRIPS and Access to Medicines because I strongly believe the EU should be a key actor in the promotion of public health and access to medicines to all in the third world."
"This protocol is a step in the right direction."
"in writing. - (PT) The costs associated with introducing 'intellectual property' protection standards in the pharmaceutical sector in 'developing countries' have been known about for a long time."
"The dramatic and unacceptable situation caused in these countries by the application of 'intellectual property rights' in the area of health, particularly in the fight against diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, has been highlighted and warned about for a long time."
"We therefore feel that this report represents an opportunity lost by the majority of this House, within the scope of its powers, to assume a humanist position and to clearly fight for a policy which could bring an end to intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical sector."
"Hiding behind the idea that a negotiation of the Protocol seems very difficult, the majority of this House have signed a blank cheque to the Council because such vague recommendations can only cause the current situation to continue, creating financial and legal obstacles which will prevent those countries with fewer resources from being able to access the advances made in science and technology in this field."
"We abhor the fact that it is particularly the pharmaceutical multinationals that will gain through this inhumane policy, by maintaining their fabulous profits at the cost of many lives."
"Madam President, following the vote, Parliament has decided to have both a written verbatim record of its sessions and an audiovisual record of its sessions."
"This obviously has budgetary implications and I would urge the Bureau to examine the situation, enact the necessary changes to the budget or come up with a new proposal if it wishes the committee to re-examine this matter."
"I rather suspect, given the very large majority of the House on this issue, that the will of Parliament is rather clear, so I think it is rather the first course of action that will have to be taken."
"in writing. - Keeping a record of all debates and making them available to the public could help Euro-scepticism."
"However this will also allow the EU to boast of greater transparency when in fact it will in reality do little to enhance democracy, because the European Parliament cannot initiate legislation and can be ignored by the European Commission."
"In the EU the unelected Commission initiate EU legislation and they offer no transparency at all."
"The opportunity for a week to make corrections to speeches (amendment 4) was well intended and would protect MEPs from errors, but up to date news on the EU could potentially be buried by a week's delay, hindering the free press in informing the public."
"Therefore I voted against the report"
"in writing. - Keeping a record of all debates and making them available to the public could help Euro-scepticism."
"However this will also allow the EU to boast of greater transparency when in fact it will in reality do little to enhance democracy because the European Parliament cannot initiate legislation and can be ignored by the European Commission."
"In the EU the unelected Commission initiate EU legislation and they offer no transparency at all."
"I do not support the opportunity to make corrections to speeches (amendment 4) the verbatim report should be as spoken."
"I make mistakes as much as anyone."
"Up to date news on the EU could potentially be buried by a week's delay, hindering the free press in informing the public."
"A separate note by way of explanation might be acceptable."
"Therefore I voted against the report."
"in writing. - (FR) The Corbett report recommends that, in order to save about EUR 10 million a year, we should no longer have the verbatim reports of proceedings in this Parliament translated into all the official languages."
"Access to the debates in each language would then only be guaranteed by way of the audiovisual recordings available on the internet, though individual Members of Parliament would be able to request the translation of certain extracts."
"However, not everyone in Europe has broadband internet access and, moreover, it has been suggested that requests by Members for translations should be restricted to some thirty pages a year."
"What Mr Corbett is proposing is therefore to limit the access of European citizens to the work of those whom they have elected to represent them and to defend their interests within the European Union."
"This is unacceptable."
"It is all the more unacceptable because at the same time the same institution is spending EUR 100 million a year on its own propaganda."
"To say nothing of the Commission, which spends more than EUR 200 million on vital activities such as the large-scale broadcasting of pornographic internet videos that are supposed to be promoting European cinema."
"Fortunately, good sense - or rather the mortal fear of the electorate - has prevailed among most of our colleagues and multilingualism has been preserved."
"in writing. - (SV) We firmly reject the report's proposal that oral contributions should appear only in their original language in the verbatim report."
"The European Parliament is trying to make a big thing of the fact that speakers are speaking to the whole of Europe as spokespersons for their European groups, but at the same time we are going to refuse subsequent access to their statements and restrict availability by cutting back on translations into different languages."
"If we are to have a democratically functioning EU, we must be prepared to pay for it."
"An organisation that pours out more than SEK 360 billion on a protectionist agricultural policy must be able to pay SEK 90 million to show respect for the EU's citizens."
"However, if the translation costs are deemed to be insupportable in future, the minimum must be that the verbatim report contains the speaker's original language and an English translation."
"in writing. - (FR) The French Members of the Independence and Democracy Group voted against the Corbett report on the amendment of Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament which seeks to abolish the full and systematic translation of parliamentary debates."
"The idea behind publishing the debates, which applies to judicial proceedings and political deliberations alike, is one of the fundamental principles of democracy."
"Publication helps to reduce ideological bias, arbitrariness, cronyism and dirty tricks."
"This of course is based on the assumption that all have access in their own language to the full published proceedings by ensuring that the same words do indeed express the same notions for everyone."
"Who among the peoples of Europe would be capable of recounting and understanding a debate when faced with a hotchpotch version of it in twenty languages?"
"It would probably be the same as someone trying to understand the so-called 'simplified' treaty and attempting to replace the 400 new clauses contained in the existing treaties, since here too, apparently, no consolidation version has been made available during the ratification process."
"Faced with increasing reticence from the inhabitants of its Member States, the European Union seems to be capable of displaying nothing but obfuscation, falsification and concealment."
"in writing. - (NL) The decision of the Secretariat of Parliament to no longer report the debates in plenary in every language went unnoticed in 2006."
"Parliament has now reversed this decision."
"I agree that too much time and money is spent on translating debates and documents into the 23 official languages of our Union."
"It is a pity that no compromise solution was put to us, in which the debates could be translated into English and French, so that the proceedings would still be available in written form in addition to the audiovisual data."
"in writing. - (PT) Multilingualism is much more than an expression of the cultural diversity of the European Union."
"In an organisation of sovereign and independent states which have joined together as a means of ensuring, through cooperation, the best advantages for their citizens without having at any stage waived their status as free and sovereign states, multilingualism is the recognition of the relationship of equality between all the members."
"This reason alone would suffice for us to defend the continuation of this multilingualism in the functioning of the Community institutions."
"However, other arguments may be added to this."
"Giving up multilingual internal communication potentially means reducing the possibility for political action by Members of the European Parliament who are fully entitled to express themselves in their mother tongue."
"Furthermore, if we minimise multilingualism in our external communications, we may end up distancing an institution which expends a great deal of energy trying to bring the EU closer to its citizens."
"Finally, there is a counter economic argument to the economic argument made: the linguistic diversity of the European people and the mastery of numerous languages has to be a competitive advantage, not a cost."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Corbett report on the amendment of Rule 173 relating to the verbatim report of proceedings, even though I regret the adoption of a whole series of amendments recommending the verbatim translation of the reports into all the official languages."
"To those hard-line advocates of multilingualism I would say, somewhat euphemistically, that it is a fiction to claim that, without this extension to the translation process, the European Parliament would be the only parliamentary assembly in the world not to have all its proceedings and debates translated in hardcopy into all the relevant languages."
"This is a fiction to the extent that it has been agreed that not only will the multilingual version be retained but the simultaneous translation into all the official languages should also be made available, on request, to all the Members of the House as well as to the public at large."
"This is the really essential part, it seems to me."
"Finally, I regret that Parliament has been unwilling to adopt a more contemporary approach as far as access to the documents is concerned: I say yes, a thousand times yes to multilingualism."
"However, I shall continue to oppose the so-called defence of linguistic diversity when this is used as an excuse by those who support the status quo and openly oppose change."
"in writing. - (NL) I voted against the proposal in the Corbett report and I did so for the same reasons that I have previously opposed the scrapping of the budget for translating the verbatim report of our sessions in this House."
"In a parliament, the spoken word is sacrosanct."
"What we say is not just an item on the day's news if we are lucky, it is part of the democratic legislative process."
"Making this accessible in the official European languages is not a luxury."
"Translation is politically necessary for a proper archiving system which after all serves to allow open access to information."
"We have to bear the consequences of our fundamental decision to choose multilingualism and not let it surreptitiously crumble away."
"A parliament that has self-respect does not ditch its traditional archiving system."
"If we need to economise, we would do better to choose different areas of the budget."
"Anyway, I stick to my view that our insistence on multilingualism is a necessary form of respect for the diverse cultures and languages in the EU and a blessing for democracy."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which advocates the establishment of a European Statistical Governance Advisory Board in response to a Commission proposal to improve the production of EU-wide statistics."
"in writing. - I voted for this uncontroversial report, proposing the establishment of a European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy."
"The amendments Parliament also adopted will ensure the Committee's efficiency, and affect its name and composition."
"(RO) Today's vote on Mr. Mantovani's report is important due to the stimulus it gives to the European policy in the field of lifelong education."
"Examining the current situation in this field and its correlation with the labour market, the Mantovani report proves to us, one more time, the existence of a reality we have lived for many years, but which has not been followed by a firm and coherent policy that could cope with its challenges."
"Therefore, I believe it is important to implement the new proposals as soon as possible."
"In fact, I would like to point out the importance of recognizing and promoting education for tolerance on the entire European Union territory."
"This is the only way in which mobility on the labour market will not generate socially excluded groups, whose behaviour becomes deviant sooner or later."
"in writing. - (FR) Mrs Castex voted for the Mantovani report on the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework."
"This French Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcomes the future introduction of the European Qualifications Framework, which will facilitate transnational mobility for workers and learners, while at the same time meeting the requirements of the labour market by way of a common reference point for the transposition of qualification levels."
"According to the proposal all qualifications, from the end of compulsory education to the highest levels of university teaching and professional training (the Commission's initial document only concerned general educational qualifications), should be classified according to one of eight reference levels based on knowledge, ability and acquired skills."
"Mrs Castex believes that the EQF, as a tool for comparing, translating and converting the qualifications of one Member State to those of another, will respect the diversity of the certification systems and the richness of the qualifications that exist in the European Union."
"It is a tool that will also facilitate greater mobility for the citizens of Europe."
"It is now up to the Member States to set about the massive task of classifying the reference levels required for the EQF, otherwise the European Qualifications Framework will be destined to remain an empty shell."
"in writing. - (PT) This report contains several contradictions and we are critical of the compromise accepted by the majority of the European Parliament on the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework."
"However, there are positive aspects to the recognition of qualifications among the various Member States which should be supported."
"However, the final text adopted accentuates the federalist nature of the European Parliament's proposal by setting specific dates for the adaptation and correlation of the various education and training systems used in the Member States, despite specifying its non-binding nature for the next few years."
"We would stress that education policy is the sole responsibility of Member States which is why we feel that the 'adaptation' proposed infringes this principle."
"We regard as negative the link with the Bologna Process and the trend towards the commercialisation of education, with emphasis being placed on 'employability' and on the prospects of the labour market being linked to the Lisbon Agenda."
"This report deals with the certification at Community level of lifelong learning qualifications."
"This is a completely desirable measure and one that should be encouraged."
"However, I reject the internationalist justification used in the document, especially as I recall the total defeat suffered by the Lisbon Strategy."
"There is an element of Europeanist ideology in this text."
"It is written that the sacrosanct objective of globalisation constitutes our one and only hope of salvation and that globalisation is beneficial both economically and socially."
"In my opinion ultra-liberal globalisation is a machine for destroying the economic, social and cultural fabric of nations."
"Moreover, the report only refers to potential progress, something for the future."
"Should we not be looking at the present as we attempt to analyse the failures and damage that has already been done to our society by globalisation?"
"In the face of such blindness, irresponsibility and inadequacy I intend to vote against the report."
"in writing. - (PL) Madam President, I voted in favour of adopting the report on the recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning."
"The future development of European society will be increasingly dependent on education, scientific research, innovation and technology."
"That is why it is so important to provide support for the promotion of mobility across the European labour market."
"I am convinced that setting up the European Qualifications Framework will facilitate access to the European labour market."
"The rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, has rightly pointed out in his report that as of 2012 all qualifications certificates, diplomas and Europass documents should relate to the relevant EQF level."
"The European Qualifications Framework should be used to facilitate comparison of levels of qualification."
"It is very important for the Member States to garner support for the implementation of the European Qualifications Framework, notably by the exchange of best practice."
"The European Qualifications Framework Advisory Group mentioned in the report is in a position to ensure the cohesion of the cooperation process and monitor the latter."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which seeks the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework to help with the EU-wide recognition of the qualifications that people receive."
"It should lead to an improvement in mobility for people who wish to work in other Member States by providing a neutral and credible reference point for the comparison of various qualifications."
"in writing. - (DE) In theory, it should be possible for a professional's qualifications to be recognised in any other Member State and for the same conditions to apply as for the domestic workforce."
"In practice, there are still some problems which need to be addressed."
"For example, if an experienced teacher from Austria were required to complete a two-year period of practical training in order to do the same job in Germany, there would obviously be something wrong."
"In some Member States, work placements are not only being misused as a way of employing well-qualified staff with academic degrees as cheaply as possible, they are also being used to create barriers to certain professions."
"Precarious working conditions, which initially only affected the low-wage sector, have long since spilled over to skilled workers as well."
"The EU must not give further impetus to this trend with the 'Blue Card' scheme."
"We have enough qualified workers, if only we were prepared to pay them properly."
"in writing. - (EL) The adoption of the European Qualifications Framework reinforces EU intervention in the Member States' education systems, homogenisation, and adaptation to predetermined quality and performance indicators."
"It is yet another way of replacing education with flexible 'learning', outside the socially instituted process of education."
"Knowledge is replaced with ephemeral, superficial ongoing training that will equip workers with whatever skills are needed by capital at the time."
"These qualifications will be recognised on the basis not of certificates awarded by the formal education system of each country, but of certification examinations set by organisations that are controlled by employers."
"This further promotes the separation between degree certificates and the possibility of pursuing a career."
"Linking different levels of education and forms of learning, which aims to put learning by experience on a par with systematic education, is an attempt at levelling down workers' rights and driving down the wages of all workers to the lowest possible level."
"Through a system of lifelong learning and certification of professional qualifications, the EU's wider aim is to subordinate all education to the priorities of the market and strengthen the profitability of capital."
"This is at complete variance with the educational needs of workers and young people."
"For these reasons, we are voting against the report and the Commission's proposal."
"in writing. - (SK) Transnational labour mobility in the EU has become inevitable: it is an everyday reality within the EU-27 after enlargement."
"These changes are accompanied by demands for more innovative and flexible education that will prepare Europeans for their integration into the modern labour market where education is the basic precondition for all age groups and all strata of society."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Mario Mantovani on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning because I am convinced that this is the only way to fulfil the goals of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The structure of the European Qualifications Framework is based on eight vertical levels, termed 'reference levels', defined in terms of three horizontal criteria - knowledge, skills and competence - thus enabling individuals to better integrate in the labour market on completion of a learning process."
"In order for the European Qualifications Framework to be successful, it is absolutely essential for the Member States and social partners to base their cooperation, during the implementation phase, on mutual trust."
"The labour market structure in Europe is changing and we see an emerging need for a flexible approach to education."
"The Member States should therefore make use of the European Qualifications Framework to improve the lifelong learning programmes."
"There is also the need for both employers and European citizens to understand the practical importance of qualifications."
"This will lead to greater, and most importantly barrier-free, labour mobility across the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) The globalisation of the economy is a question for which Europe has not yet found a clear and convincing answer."
"A more globalised economy implies a readiness for change which means greater mobility."
"The creation of a common reference framework for the recognition, comparability and transfer of qualifications originating from different systems is fundamental to the development of a decisive component of the European project, in other words the mobility of workers facilitated in this case by the portability of their qualifications."
"Better training of our workers combined with a harmonised system for the recognition of their knowledge, skills and abilities will enhance their mobility and the development of the internal market."
"More and better skills among European workers could help to ensure better organisation, more innovation and improved competitiveness among our undertakings."
"(LT) It is a shame that the launch of SIS II keeps being postponed."
"Today we have adopted a resolution on this important issue."
"We are so far behind schedule that it is essential to find a way out of the situation that would enable us to use the SIS 1+ network after 13 November 2008."
"It is now clear that the human and financial resources allocated for the implementation of SIS II will have to be shared between three projects being developed simultaneously: SIS II, SISone4all and the installation, operation and management of a communication infrastructure."
"This is why, in my opinion, the correct distribution of EU and Member States' resources will be of great significance."
"However, in view of the project's importance as regards the security of the EU, it is obvious that SIS II is the greatest priority."
"We must allocate funds for EU security and the development of communications infrastructure."
"in writing. - (PT) To 'fill a gap' during the extension of the Schengen Information System (SIS), which includes the Visa Information System (VIS), the current proposal aims to provide a temporary solution to prevent any hiatuses and potential interruptions caused by the delay in installing the 'infrastructures' of the 'new' system."
"The costs will be distributed between the Community budget and Member States."
"We would point out that this involves expanding the features of the SIS by developing them, extending access to new authorities and interlinking them, with the addition of new categories of data (such as the data capture mandate and biometric data)."
"This extension of the previous system significantly threatens the rights, freedoms and guarantees of citizens by adding new elements to a database which is, in addition, shared by numerous bodies."
"The confidentiality of this data cannot be fully guaranteed as records may be kept 'for a longer period' and be shared with third countries."
"At the root is an attempt to bring the SIS into line with the dangerous and unacceptable objectives of the current security offensive and with the expansion and growing communitarisation of internal affairs in the EU, which we clearly reject."
"in writing. - We do not oppose the suggested temporary solution in order to guarantee the existence of a network for SIS 1+ for the period from 13 November to 17 December 2008."
"However, we cannot support the use of the passerelle in Article 67(2), indent 2, of the EC Treaty as suggested by Mr Coelho."
"That is why we have chosen to vote against the report."
"in writing. - (DE) We already have a major problem with organised criminal gangs and illegal immigrants who tend to congregate in border areas where they are also easier to apprehend than in cities."
"Both groups are already on the starting blocks and are intent on crossing into other countries as soon as the borders open, where they will vanish without trace."
"We must respond to this situation with increased cross-border cooperation and intensive checks in border regions."
"The expansion of Schengen is, after all, a major responsibility for all the countries involved."
"Accession to Schengen should therefore not be made solely dependent on the functionality of the Schengen Information System, which is something Poland, for example, does not yet appear to have achieved."
"Instead, we must ensure that future members of Schengen are able to assert effective control of the EU's external borders, that there is no softening of the transition periods for the protection of labour markets, and that begging does not increase any further."
"Until this is guaranteed, over-hasty and ill-considered expansion must not be allowed to occur."
"According to the FRONTEX Annual Report for 2006, the apprehension figures at Schengen's current external borders (mainly Austria and Germany) are still far higher than those at the EU's external borders, so it is highly doubtful whether the expansion should be approved."
"Indeed, the question is whether Schengen should not be abolished in part, especially since the Austrian Interior Ministry's report on human trafficking indicates that almost 50% of illegals in Austria have entered the country across the Schengen border with Italy."
"in writing. - I do not oppose the suggested temporary solution to guarantee the existence of a network for SIS 1+ for the period from 13 November to 17 December 2008."
"However, I cannot support the use of the passerelle in Article 67(2), indent 2, of the EC Treaty as suggested by Mr Coelho."
"That is why I have chosen to vote against the report."
"(SK) I am in favour of a reasonable compromise that would achieve a balance between health and environmental protection on the one hand and agricultural production on the other hand."
"This is why I voted for the report prepared by my Slovak colleague, Mrs Irena Belohorská, who is a recognised expert in the field of prevention and treatment of cancer diseases."
"I congratulate her on the report which is based on her vast experience as a medical practitioner and which introduces a balanced strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides."
"I believe that this report will contribute to the adoption of more effective measures for better information of the general public and lead to the setting up of correct application methods and a gradual reduction in the use of pesticides in agriculture."
"A possible solution is to support farmers in ways that would encourage them to reduce the use of artificial fertilisers in their fight against diseases, pests and weeds on their farms, and in doing so help achieve a gradual changeover to bioproducts."
"The report can inspire consumers not to choose, at a market or in a supermarket, only the best-looking produce but to give priority, for the sake of their health, to less visually appealing but healthier bioproducts."
"(CS) All of us wish to breathe clean air and halt the melting of the glaciers."
"At the same time, in spite of energy saving programmes, our need for energy is growing exponentially."
"At stake is also Europe's dependency on gas and oil imports."
"We must therefore invest in the development of renewable sources and tackle issues of nuclear power plants safety, in particular the question of final disposal of radioactive waste."
"In this way we could obtain up to 14% of our energy from clean sources."
"We cannot ignore, however, the fact that 32% of our energy comes from fossil fuels, employing 300 000 people and substantially polluting the environment."
"This is why I welcome and have supported the report by Mr Reul on conventional sources."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we should review investments and also develop those technologies capable of increasing the efficiency of fossil fuel energy production and reducing emissions."
"We have much to work on."
"(LT) Today we have reached an important decision on the strategy on the use of pesticides."
"I voted in favour of the resolution."
"We are well aware of the fact that the air we breath is polluted and therefore poses health risks and that the food we consume has been processed using chemicals that are dangerous to human health."
"Our children, the future generation, are growing up in these conditions."
"I am absolutely certain that the hazards that pesticides pose to human health must be reduced."
"Therefore, we should take decisive measures and do our best to find the necessary funds."
"I welcome the plans to require the Member States to draw up action plans highlighting the areas in which pesticides would be entirely banned and making substantial reductions in the use of pesticides within the next 10 years."
"in writing. - (PT) It is well-known that, in July 2006, the Commission presented a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, together with a proposal for a directive establishing a framework for Community Action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides and a proposal for a regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, with the aim of reducing the general risks and negative impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment."
"The risks associated with pesticide use have already been reduced, but, in some areas, particularly in countries which have for a long time used intensive agriculture, these can still be found in the soil and water in undesirable quantities."
"This also means that countries such as Portugal, with more traditional agriculture, should receive more support in order to maintain less intensive agricultural production."
"However, we do not feel that the solution lies in substituting GMOs for pesticides."
"While the undesirable effects of chemical pesticides on human health are well-known, the precautionary principle should be applied with regard to the effects of GMOs on human health as these have not yet been studied."
"This Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides only relates to plant protection products, in other words to one area of pesticides."
"in writing. - (PL) I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has adopted a new directive on the production and use of pesticides."
"The directive tightens up the conditions under which trade in the chemical substances used in the manufacture of plant protection products may be permitted."
"The outcome will be beneficial to the citizens of the European Union, especially as regards their life and health."
"In addition, the directive details the cases in which spraying from the air may take place. It also recommends lowering the amount of pesticides used and prioritising non-chemical alternatives."
"The report by Mrs Belohorská is worthy of support, if only because of the very wide but also up-to-date scope of the provisions."
"There can be no doubt that European Union citizens no longer wish to have daily contact with toxins, and do not wish to consume contaminated products. Our citizens do not wish either to be affected by carcinogenic or toxic substances, or by substances with endocrine-disrupting properties."
"In response to these clear expectations expressed by European society, it was appropriate also to support a ban on the use of pesticides in rural and urban public areas."
"The use of pesticides in areas surrounding hospices, sanatoria, rehabilitation centres, clinics and hospitals should be banned. Such a ban should also extend to parks, public gardens, sports and leisure areas, school grounds, children's playgrounds and similar locations."
"in writing. - (DE) The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides is an important addition to the proposal for a regulation and a directive which has been voted on at first reading today."
"The Thematic Strategy is needed because the use of pesticides in the European Union has not decreased, despite the successful measures adopted voluntarily by some Member States between 1992 and 2003, and remains at a high level."
"The Belohorská report underlines, once again, the need to apply the precautionary principle in the use of pesticides."
"(LT) I consider the report on conventional energy sources and energy technology to be of the utmost importance."
"The realities of life are forcing the EU Member States to change their attitude towards energy within both the EU and the world markets - resources, the energy mix and security of supply."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of nuclear energy, as it is a secure, reliable and environmentally friendly resource."
"The fact that Germany, which has 17 nuclear power plants, produces six times more CO2 pollution than France, with its 59 nuclear power stations, is very persuasive."
"Nuclear energy is particularly important for countries that are not rich in renewable energy resources such as wind, solar energy, water and biomass, the use of the latter being particularly expensive."
"Electricity is of the utmost importance and should be accessible to everyone."
"I voted in favour of the report and would like to stress the importance of EU assistance for the construction of nuclear or other environmentally friendly power plants."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I just feel a need to clarify a few points about the new generation of nuclear technology."
"It is worth remembering that Italy's nuclear power stations were shut down following a rescinding referendum in 1987, perhaps rightly so, although that has gradually placed us in a situation of dependence on foreign sources of energy."
"However, the new generation of nuclear technology, which is clean and safe and environmentally friendly, is undoubtedly necessary to confront the problem of energy supply and climate change."
"The energy mix must hence be updated and, along with renewables, clean coal and gas, nuclear will enable Europe to limit its dependence in future."
"For this reason I voted in favour of the building of fourth-generation nuclear power stations, which will enable energy to be generated in a safer and more environmentally friendly manner."
"I do, however, still have doubts, serious doubts and concerns, about the storage of nuclear waste."
"The report may consider the problem of waste storage solved, but quite frankly I disagree: the waste problem is crucial and, if it is to be solved in the near future, requires a huge amount of investment in research."
"To conclude, I believe that the choice of energy mix - just three more seconds please - to ensure security of energy supply for the Union in coming years must be altered as research progresses and in particular as new technologies develop."
"(DE) Madam President, my colleagues from my delegation and I myself voted against the Reul report because we do not believe that nuclear energy is either safe or clean, and nor do we believe in the new generation of nuclear power plants and the new generation of nuclear energy."
"If it really is the case - and there are reports and statistics about this - that nuclear energy is to have a massive impact in terms of reducing our CO2 emissions, then we will have to have a substantial increase in the number of our nuclear power stations."
"That is neither realistic nor practicable."
"For that reason - and I will speak more on this subject when the next report comes round - effective measures to improve energy efficiency and also to cut CO2 emissions from cars would be a better way of making Europe a healthier place and convincing other countries and continents to follow suit."
"in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote against the report as we do not consider it to be balanced and, among other things, it fails to address important problems in relation to nuclear energy."
"Nor do we believe that the Union's energy research funds should be used to develop new generations of reactors for nuclear fission."
"We question the value to the environment of synthetic fuels produced from fossil sources, or hydrogen gas extracted with energy from the same origin, or nuclear energy, as none of these energy sources is sustainable in the long term from an environmental or supply point of view."
"We also believe that fossil fuels must be actively phased out in the long term, which is not mentioned in the report."
"We think that CO2 capture can be an important part of reducing CO2 emissions, but other energy-saving, efficiency-boosting measures and the development of renewable energy are more sustainable in the long term and should be the final goal."
"in writing. - (PT) This report contains various positive aspects, including the recognition of the role of conventional energy sources and the need to use these in order to produce energy, opening up prospects for the relaunch of nuclear fission energy and calling for the lifting of restrictions on new coal-fired power stations."
"It also opens up prospects for the relaunch and mining of coal and calls for international cooperation, including with countries outside the EU, such as China and India."
"In addition, it emphasises the value of endogenous resources and places the contribution of renewable energies on a more realistic plane."
"It contains certain criticisms of the production and use of liquid biofuels and points to the need for countries to encourage more R&D in the area of energy, particularly as a way of overcoming environmental and nuclear safety problems."
"However, it also contains various negative aspects, including the association of the growing problems in the oil market solely with contextual and episodic issues, while disregarding the strategic issue of depletion of resources and continuing to ignore the enormous potential of biomethane produced from waste, an approach which is already being implemented in various European countries."
"This is the reason for our abstention."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this own-initiative report on energy issues which canvasses many areas of energy efficiency, supply and conservation."
"I did not support amendments endorsing nuclear power: my view is that sustainable, renewable energy resources should be developed and that research & development efforts should focus on these areas first."
"in writing. - (DE) In principle, we all agree that we need better energy efficiency and more rational energy transmission and that the expansion of renewables is important."
"Nonetheless, the promotion of renewables must not be used as a pretext to curtail even more of the Member States' sovereign rights by the back door as part of the EU's Constitution."
"As this point is not made sufficiently clear in the present report, the report must be rejected."
"Despite the ongoing expansion of renewable energy sources, we will remain dependent on conventional energy generation for many decades to come, and we must therefore ensure that it becomes more environmentally friendly."
"In the EU, however, there still appears to be a fixation with nuclear power, which is not only reflected in its glowing description as an 'environmentally friendly source of energy', which itself is a mockery, but also in the generous funding of the nuclear research budget."
"I see in this a failure to rethink our approach in any discernible way, which is another reason why I reject the report which is the subject of the vote."
"in writing. - (DE) The Reul report is an apology for the nuclear industry."
"Flying in the face of common sense, nuclear energy is depicted as the technology of the future, with even more EU research funding and budgetary resources to flow into the development of this high-risk dinosaur technology."
"Indeed, despite the recent 'incidents' at Vattenfall's nuclear plants, the focus is on expanding nuclear energy in Europe."
"In light of these incidents, it is extremely cynical to claim that nuclear energy generation is becoming 'ever-safer'."
"Instead of continuing to invest in this troublesome energy form, with a deliberate failure to address the issue of final storage, a social and ecological revolution should finally be the aim."
"This means breaking apart the private monopolies which exist in the nuclear industry, providing a massive injection of funding for renewables and localising energy production."
"Given that it is the nuclear companies, in particular, which have initiated a new round of massive price increases, there is an urgent need for action."
"The report merely serves the profit interests of Europe's nuclear industry."
"The call for new nuclear power plants in Europe is unacceptable."
"The legal basis for funding for an indefinite period is to be enshrined in the Reform Treaty."
"This is yet another reason to reject the Treaty."
"Every additional cent for EU nuclear funding is one too many."
"Promoting energy production from renewable resources, solar, wind and hydro power, is the only sustainable energy policy."
"in writing. - (PT) When it launched the Energy Package at the beginning of this year, the European Commission highlighted the need for a technological action plan for fossil fuels and underlined the fundamental requirement for a pragmatic approach towards nuclear energy."
"The reality is stark: there are no alternatives to fossil fuels which are as cheap and as efficient."
"This means that these fuels will remain the central and essential component of the EU's energy policy beyond 2020."
"This is why we must find new solutions to the energy supply issue in the EU, bearing in mind the need for competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply."
"As a result, all investments in the development of new energy technologies, firstly to reduce environmental impact and enhance the safety of existing installations and secondly to develop new energy sources and ensure more efficient and cleaner use of fossil fuels, are of particular importance."
"As it is essential that Member States and the EU concentrate their efforts on energy research, from more efficient use of energy sources to new technologies and the cleaner use of existing energy sources, I voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Reul on conventional energy sources and energy technology."
"The report raises a very important current issue that calls for broad debate within the European Union, namely that we need a unified strategy and should develop a common energy policy."
"Ensuring Europe's energy security is a priority issue, and the Commission's proposal to submit a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan to the 2008 Spring European Council is therefore very welcome."
"As a world leader, the European Union must also take the lead in the development of modern energy technologies whilst maintaining all the relevant economic and environmental standards."
"in writing. - (SV) I have chosen to support the report because the EU has conducted an unusually balanced discussion of the need to include nuclear energy in Europe's future energy mix."
"Among other things, the report states that 'nuclear energy is indispensable if basic energy needs are to be met in Europe in the medium term', and that 'nuclear energy is currently the largest low-carbon energy source in Europe and [it] stresses its potential role in combating climate change'."
"At present nuclear energy is responsible for one third of the EU's electricity supply and will always be one of the most important energy sources in many EU Member States."
"When the issue of CO2 emissions is raised, it is unfortunate in my view that greater attention is not given to nuclear energy."
"If we are to meet future energy demand without greater dependence on fossil fuels and rising CO2 emissions, the development of safe, new nuclear energy will become increasingly important."
"Unfortunately, nuclear energy is not included among the measures that are considered to be realistic with a view to achieving the target of between 20% and 30% by 2020."
"(CS) Today we gave the car industry the task of developing engines which will reduce CO2 emissions to less than 120 g/km."
"Currently the figure stands at 157 g."
"I want to warn, however, those who applauded this proposal that reducing emissions is greatly hindered by the increasing number of drivers in general as well as the high number of drivers driving old vehicles."
"Double regulation of advertising will not solve the issue."
"It is well-known that the majority of people give priority to cost-efficiency when buying a car, rather than the vehicle's environmental impact."
"Costs, but also emissions are growing also because of the imposition of increased vehicle safety."
"Ladies and gentlemen, until vehicles with a lower environmental impact and running costs become more affordable, road transport's share of emissions will not show any considerable decrease."
"This is why I was not among those applauding today's report."
"Neither the committee's report nor the Commission's strategy are sufficiently comprehensive."
"This is why I supported other proposals, related to fines for exceeding emission limits and especially fiscal measures and car fleet renewal support."
"(SK) The report just adopted on the future CO2 strategy for cars contributes without any doubt to one of the most polarised debates taking place in the European Parliament at present."
"At stake are not only the environment, and therefore the health of EU citizens, but also the competitiveness of an important industry."
"I voted for the amendment since it represents a compromise between both aspects. It pays attention to environmental protection and at the same time provides suitable and realistic terms for the European car industry."
"Car advertising represents up to 20% of total advertising turnover for publishers of printed media."
"Laying down mandatory advertising requirements as stipulated in the original report by Mr Chris Davies would breach the fundamental principle of freedom of expression."
"This is why I voted in favour of the amendments that leave out the controversial paragraphs 36 to 41 of the report."
"I supported the PPE-DE motion inviting car manufacturers to sign up to a voluntary code of practice on car advertising."
"After most amendments were adopted, in the final vote I voted for the report by Mr Chris Davies."
"The outcome of the vote is a clear political signal in favour of preparing European legislation dealing with the issue of cutting CO2 emissions."
"(DE) Madam President, we do still have the legislation by means of which Parliament can demonstrate that we take climate protection seriously in Europe, and we need to summon all our efforts so that we can genuinely achieve, through that legislation, everything that we have not voted on today."
"I think it is regrettable that we have not committed to a 120 g/km ceiling from 2012."
"More than ten years have passed since our industry promised to achieve this with its proposed self-regulation on the grounds that this approach would be better and more efficient, and I would have liked the House to send out a clear climate policy message today."
"We have not done so."
"That is why I have also voted against the report, and I hope that in the legislation, we will show more grit and determination and make it clear that we really take climate issues seriously in Europe."
"(CS) I voted against the proposal of the report on the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars, although for reasons different from those mentioned here earlier."
"I voted against the proposal because with it we are moving away from an integrated approach, contained in the earlier strategy documents, and placing the whole burden of CO2 emissions reduction on the European car industry instead."
"I also disagree with the call for an obligatory allocation of 20% of advertising space."
"It bears a dangerous resemblance to the information campaign on the harmful effects of smoking."
"Such an approach overall turns CO2 emissions reduction into a dogma which, when translated into future binding legislation, will result in a reduction in our competitiveness."
"(DE) Madam President, I voted against the Davies report because, in my view, we have taken what is, in essence, an unacceptable and unrealistic decision by envisaging uniform CO2 efficiency categories for cars."
"There should have been a sliding scale based on size and weight, primarily to level the playing field for manufacturers in the European Union."
"Let me give you an example: it makes a difference whether I heat a house or just one room."
"That is why it also makes a difference whether I drive a large car or a small car."
"That is why there needs to be segmentation and a sliding scale based on weight."
"We have missed that opportunity, which I think is regrettable, and with this decision - which I did not support - we have also missed the opportunity to establish a measure of balance between the interests of the environment and those of industry."
"(DE) Madam President, I voted against the Davies report because, as a result of the amendments adopted, we are still a long way from the optimum situation, which is to protect the environment, on the one hand, but also promote employment in Europe and not burden the consumer unduly with excessively high prices."
"In essence, the decisions that we have taken are at the expense of employment and the consumer."
"In technical terms, we have moved away from the integrated approach which would have been essential to create a situation in which everyone contributes to cutting CO2 emissions, not only the car manufacturers but also the manufacturers of other vehicle components."
"We have abandoned that route."
"What is more, we have not included weight and we have not completed weight segmentation, which is important for European competitiveness, because it is the higher-weight vehicles that are at the forefront of innovation, the innovation that Europe needs."
"We have set timeframes which are difficult or expensive to achieve and we have taken the absurd step of not heeding the call for CO2-based taxes in the Member States, which means that the old vehicles which pump out CO2 are still on the market and on the road."
"That is why I have voted against the report."
"Madam President, I have two points to make, the first on the procedure, the second on the voting list."
"On the voting list: firstly, there was no mention of paragraph 3; secondly, I think we should look again at what happened about Amendments 52 and 51."
"If you look at it, 51 is clearly the nearest to the original text and should have been voted first."
"52 is furthest away and should have been voted second."
"I would ask that the Presidency look at this because that is clearly what should have happened."
"So, on those procedural points, I would like some answers."
"Secondly, on the politics of it, this was the first real vote on climate change."
"It was not a piece of legislation - that will come - but, by failing to support the 2012 date backed by the European Commission, I think that the ALDE Group and the PPE-DE Group in this House failed the first test on climate change and the people out there will be looking at what happened here today and wondering whether we really are serious about the commitments we made back in March to reduce CO2."
"We talk about Europe being a Europe of the environment."
"We have to do it in legislation if it is ever going to happen."
"in writing. - (FR) Mrs Castex voted for the Davies report on the reduction of CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles."
"While France continues to be monopolised by the Grenelle Environment Forum, the European Union has in turn added another valuable building block to the quality of our environment by adopting a strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from private vehicles."
"Mrs Castex is very pleased that Parliament has called on the European automotive industry to ensure that new vehicles do not emit more than 120 g/km of CO2 by 2012."
"This French Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcomes the Carbon Allowance Reductions System (CARS), as this mechanism will impose financial penalties on manufacturers who fail to meet their quotas, while at the same time issuing credits to those who have taken the initiative by achieving emissions that are below the limit value curve."
"in writing. - (SV) We have essentially voted in favour of Mr Davies' report on a strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from cars."
"In order to reduce CO2 emissions, it must be a priority to reduce the proportion that comes from car traffic."
"It is important to find more environmentally friendly alternatives to using cars."
"However, in our view car manufacturers should be given the opportunity to choose themselves how they wish to meet the environmental targets set by us politicians."
"Legislation should not regulate in detail how this should happen."
"We also oppose the rapporteur's rules on advertising, which are unjustified and restrict freedom of expression."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report."
"Some 19% of all CO2 emissions produced in the Community now come from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles."
"The European Union must commit itself to an ambitious and realistic target for reducing average emissions from all vehicles placed on the EU market."
"The impact of road transport on air quality must be reduced as the vehicle fleet is gradually renewed."
"I welcome the adoption of the deadlines that have been set by Parliament."
"If verifiable and measurable actions are to be taken by the automotive industry after 2011, setting 2015 as the date for achieving a threshold of 125 g/km seems perfectly reasonable to me."
"Indeed this corresponds to the entry into force of the Euro VI emission standards."
"For legislation to be effective it must above all be realistic and the industry has for a long time been putting environmental issues at the heart of its policies."
"When it comes to climate change the priority must be to reduce CO2 emissions in absolute terms."
"in writing. - (NL) The Davies report deserves support because of the political signal it sends."
"All sectors will have to do their bit to remedy the climate change problem, including the European car industry."
"That is why I warmly support the compromise to achieve a maximum of 125g CO2/km by 2015."
"For the Netherlands, the Davies report has another extra dimension that is undeniable."
"Because of the problem of particulate matter in the air in the Netherlands, it is necessary that measures be taken at European level to tackle this at source."
"If this does not happen, then for transport-intensive areas like the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol airport, it will be impossible for us to meet the present and/or stricter norms for particulate matter."
"I am in favour of better information to consumers about the environmental friendliness of particular cars, like what we have now for fridges and washing machines for instance, but I voted against the proposal for cigarette-type warnings to be made compulsory in all advertising and marketing statements from the car industry."
"In the area of advertising and marketing, I have more faith in self-regulation than all kinds of European legal obligations."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted against Mr Davies' report on the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles."
"Having initially voted in favour of the report in the direct voting in plenary, I then withdrew my vote in writing, as noted in the parliamentary records of 25 October 2007."
"In my view, the report is extremely arbitrary and fails to take appropriate account of the needs of Germany's automobile industry or environmental concerns."
"For example, the report does not differentiate between the various weight classes of vehicles and therefore makes unrealistic demands of car manufacturers."
"As regards advertising, an increasing comparison is made between labelling needs for tobacco products and vehicles."
"The rapporteur (Mr Davies, an English Green Liberal) was only prepared to compromise on one point at the very end of the process during the deliberations on his report."
"This was much too late to formulate a sensible recommendation from Parliament which could have secured the support of all the groups."
"in writing. - I voted for the original version of this report, which proposed tough limits on emissions of 120g carbon dioxide/kilometre by 2012."
"Unfortunately, the proposal was weakened by Tory and Liberal MEPs to allow for a higher emissions limit and a longer phase-in period."
"The overall strategy is good, but it is a pity it has been weakened unnecessarily."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament has approved the Community Strategy for reducing CO2 emissions from passenger cars and I welcome this very much."
"This initiative will enable us to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and at the same time contribute towards achieving the EU's more general environmental targets and energy security objectives."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the message that this vote has sent to the Commission and to the international community at large could have been a more ambitious one."
"The 120 g/km threshold for CO2 was first put forward in 1995 as a feasible target for the automotive industry."
"Now 12 years later its implementation is still being resisted, even though technological advances have meant that CO2 emissions can now be reduced more than was possible a dozen years ago."
"In being satisfied with a maximum mandatory limit of 125 g/km of CO2 Parliament does not go far enough."
"For this reason I voted against Amendments 42 and 52 because their objectives, under the pretence of being prudent and realistic, are in fact simply too moderate."
"At a time when the consumer is becoming increasingly sensitive to pollution from motor vehicles, any measure aimed at reducing CO2 emissions from this source will benefit the car industry, the consumer and, of course, the planet itself."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the proposals to introduce a binding average emissions ceiling, albeit with some concern."
"In my view, a sliding scale based on the size and weight of the vehicle would have been preferable."
"Although I otherwise tend to be in favour of voluntary commitments from industry, I believe that binding legal requirements are essential for the automobile industry: experience has shown that voluntary commitments here would be bound to fail."
"As we know, a reduction of around 5% in greenhouse gas emissions from the EU-25 was achieved between 1990 and 2004. Not for road traffic, however: in stark contrast, this sector saw a rise of 26%."
"There is clearly an urgent need for action here, and the car industry must make its contribution to cutting emissions."
"The year 2012 for the introduction of the ceiling has been criticised on the grounds that it does not allow a long enough phase-in period."
"However, this date has been in discussion for years, and the industry has known what to expect for a very long time."
"The issue which we must always consider, however, is balancing environmental interests and the interests of the car industry, as this is also in the interests of jobs and competitiveness in the European Union."
"This is a buoyant industry and it is important for the EU."
"Without robust industries, we would have no money for environmental programmes!"
"(LT) So far the Member States have only succeeded in reaching an agreement on the consolidation of indirect taxation - excise duty and VAT, determination of the minimum rate, the application of numerous VAT exemptions."
"I doubt that a minimum excise duty rate - for fuel, for example - would increase economic competitiveness."
"It is more likely to result in increased prices and reduced consumption, particularly in view of the global increase in prices."
"The proposed coordination of excise duties would constitute an unbearable burden to new Member States."
"The proposed consolidation of tax bases at EU level would have been more appropriate for the economies of the 15 old Member States, as they have similar development levels."
"This proposal is a step towards the consolidation of tax on profits."
"The greatest burden would fall on the weaker economies of the new Member States."
"This would lead to a loss of opportunity for them to benefit from tax competition as well as accelerate their economic growth."
"It would deprive them of the chance to raise their standard of living to match that of the old Member States."
"I voted against the report, as it was ill-timed, in spite of the amendments."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats believe first and foremost that taxation policy should be a national matter."
"The report also stresses the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States."
"We chose to vote in favour of the report as in many ways it stresses the role of taxation policy in the Member States as regards employment, welfare and the environment, as well as a well-functioning internal market."
"in writing. - (FR) I supported Amendment 20, as tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which seeks to delete paragraph 17 of the Wagenknecht report concerning the contribution of taxation to the Lisbon strategy."
"In order to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market I am in fact in favour of any measure that contributes towards fiscal harmonisation within the EU."
"While taxation is still essentially a matter of national sovereignty, it has very quickly become apparent that we need to ensure a minimum degree of fiscal coordination between the Member States."
"This is why, in matters relating to indirect taxation, the Commission has gradually established a minimum rate for excise duty, in order to reduce distortion of competition."
"Yet in the report that is being voted on today, paragraph 17 now seeks to re-examine this very system and proposes to replace it with a code of conduct."
"I do not believe that it is sufficient merely to 'encourage' Member States when it comes to coordinating indirect taxation."
"What is more, I believe even less in the effectiveness of a code of conduct on excise duty matters: this is likely to provide even greater temptation to unpick the EU's rules and practices, which would in turn create the sorry situation of unfair competition in this area."
"in writing. - (PT) We voted against the final text because, among other issues, it assumed a position of defence of economic and financial groups, as highlighted by the rapporteur who removed her name from the report before the final vote and called for it to be rejected."
"The resolution aims to ease the rules and procedures so that large undertakings can easily enter the various markets and reap the largest profits with the least number of obstacles in any Member State."
"Furthermore, we consider that the fiscal sovereignty of Member States in terms of defining their own fiscal policy must be respected in all discussions on this issue."
"This is not what has happened here."
"A supposedly common European fiscal policy which promotes 'tax competition' would only serve the interests of major European and international capital."
"Available data show that, in the last 10 years, there has been a significant drop in the average rate of taxation of corporate profits, whilst income tax has remained virtually unchanged."
"We regret that the proposals made by the rapporteur, which highlighted the redistribution potential of taxation and pointed out the transfer of the tax burden from high incomes to lower incomes, have not been included in this final text."
"in writing. - (SV) The June List is firmly opposed to this report, which seeks to move towards a common taxation and customs policy for the EU."
"It is amazing that today the European Parliament is taking decisions on matters for which there is no common policy."
"It is not for the EU to decide on taxation matters and promptly to call on the Member States to harmonise their national taxes."
"In addition, it is entirely unreasonable to try to move towards the imposition of a Community tax."
"In the report it is also possible to see how the Lisbon Strategy opens the door for the EU to tackle new policy areas, with supranationalism, new projects and increased costs in their wake."
"The June List is voting against this report, as taxation must be decided nationally and sovereignly by the Member States."
"in writing. - (FR) The report on the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy, as voted on by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, constitutes an acceptable compromise between the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the one hand, and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on the other, and I support it."
"I am also glad to see that we have succeeded in maintaining this balance during the vote in plenary."
"For me the key point in the report is paragraph 4, which underlines the benefits of healthy tax competition in the European Union."
"If indeed we wish to achieve the objectives of economic growth and employment, as set out in the Lisbon Strategy, we must ensure that we do not impose too great a tax burden on undertakings, for it is they who create the jobs."
"What is more, we should never overtax employees and consumers, either directly or indirectly, for they make a considerable contribution to growth."
"Tax competition forces Member States within the Union to moderate their fiscal demands and to be more efficient in the management of public spending, and this can only be of benefit to the taxpayer."
"The common consolidated corporate tax base, which is another controversial theme in the report, would in my view bring an element of coordination to fiscal policy that will render European corporate taxation less bureaucratic and more efficient."
"in writing. - (EL) Tax policy is used to redistribute income for the benefit of capital."
"It is used by all centre-right and centre-left governments, and governs capital in the EU."
"There is no common tax policy because of intra-imperialist conflicts."
"Even if such a policy existed, however, capital would be furthering its own profitability at the expense of ordinary people's income and needs."
"Amid unrelenting competition, capital now moves easily and rapidly from high-tax countries to countries with lower taxation."
"Indeed, in all the Member States, the corporate income tax rate is decreasing at the expense of personal income."
"However, this is not true of tax on labour income, which remains constant, while indirect taxes and VAT have risen, increasing inequality and the gap between rich and poor."
"This is also reflected in OECD figures, which show that indirect tax in the form of VAT rose to 6.9% of GDP in 2006."
"Thus capital is systematically being exempted from tax and the levy on workers is being increased through indirect taxation."
"This is happening in Greece as well: corporation tax has been reduced by 10% and VAT has increased by 1%, with a further increase of 2% on the way."
"This is the barbarity of capitalism, which creates inequality and poverty for the majority of people, and we must reverse this."
"in writing. - While the report contains a number of positive elements concerning greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden, I cannot support any increased role for the European Union in relation to taxation, which would further undermine the economic sovereignty of Member States."
"in writing. - The Fine Gael delegation in the European Parliament decided to oppose the Report on the final vote because of the proliferation of references to the CCCTB and related matters."
"We support the Lisbon Agenda and are in favour of the Report, such as recognising the positive aspects of lower taxation and the benefits of tax competition, but do not accept the right of EU Institutions to interfere with the rights of Member States, such as Ireland, who are also in the Eurozone."
"Interest rates are set by the ECB and the Growth and Stability Pact sets borrowing and inflation requirements."
"Tax policy is therefore one of the instruments left to those Member States under the Treaty and should be safeguarded."
"in writing. - There are many ways in which fiscal attitudes across the EU could be helpful in generating a series of better conclusions for the Lisbon Strategy."
"Simply put, the incentivisation of growth of small businesses and job creation, as well as environmental issues, is seen as a positive."
"This is for Member States to undertake and follow through - such is their competence."
"Consolidating tax bases at an EU level would not make the difference suggested by the rapporteur."
"The EPLP maintains that many good things towards the Lisbon Strategy can be reached by Member State action rather than EU action."
"in writing. - (DE) In its vote today, the European Parliament has shown that a majority of its Members support a taxation policy which serves the interests of the top ten thousand and is to the detriment of the large majority of people living in the European Union."
"Although some of my proposals were accepted - after all, no one is keen to openly champion the cause of increased rates of VAT, higher taxes on earned income or better opportunities for EU-wide tax dumping - the proposals we made on increasing taxes on wealth and financial transactions and limiting tax dumping through the introduction of a uniform consolidated corporate tax base were rejected by the majority of Members."
"As the final report after the individual votes was almost unrecognisable as my original draft, with certain aspects of its content deteriorating further in the version of the report agreed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I felt compelled to remove my name from the report and call for Members to vote against it in the final vote."
"I welcome the fact that relevant sections of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament also felt unable to endorse the final version of the report, as the outcome of the voting shows."
"Today, the House has passed up the opportunity to heed calls for a more equitable and socially compatible taxation policy and adopt this as the clear position of the European Parliament."
"Instead, the EU's misdirected policies have yet again been confirmed unquestioningly by the majority in the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (SV) Today I chose to support the report on the contribution of taxation policy to the Lisbon process."
"I advocate healthy tax competition and a common consolidated corporate tax base for international companies, without harmonisation of tax levels and with an option for each Member State to remain outside it, if it so wishes."
"It is also important to lay down the Member States' sovereignty in the field of taxation."
"I also take exception to any attempt to move towards an EU tax."
"(SK) I admire and respect the determination with which some countries have introduced a smoking ban not only in offices and in all workplaces but also in restaurants, pubs, bars and clubs."
"We have economic impact studies that have not confirmed worries of restaurant owners about an income loss."
"We also know that the treatment of respiratory cancer diseases and other illnesses costs us up to EUR 50 million."
"In Scotland, the number of people admitted to hospital with myocarditis has decreased by almost 20% since the introduction of the smoking ban."
"Children born to women smokers as well as to women exposed to passive smoking during pregnancy are born prematurely and have lower than normal birth weight."
"I appeal to the Member States of the European Union, including my own Member State, to introduce without delay effective laws that would result in a smoking ban in workplaces and restaurants, and in effective measures for reducing the overall use of tobacco."
"(RO) At the same time with voting on this report, I would like to emphasize its importance for the future of the European citizens and of the entire European Union."
"I welcome the strategic approach of the smoking issue, including passive smoking, as well as the proposal of concrete and exigent actions to fight against it and its negative consequences at a European level."
"Also, I am convinced that a strategic approach of this issue should include the smoking prevention policy, as an essential element, by developing a true system of education in this respect."
"Today's reality is obvious; there is a clear and increasing need for awareness as regards the consequences of smoking among the entire European society."
"It is not less important to focus these efforts of prevention on educating children and youth, as well as their parents, in advance, in order to ensure a smoke-free Europe for future generations."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to explain my vote on the report by Mr Florenz on combating the worrying phenomenon of nicotine addiction."
"I wish to emphasise that I voted in favour of this report, despite being an advocate of freedom for smokers and despite obviously being a defender of pluralism."
"Nonetheless, the problem of the harmful effects of so-called passive smoking, that is to say the effect on non-smokers of being surrounded by smokers, is very alarming indeed."
"Suffice it to remind the House that the deaths of 650 000 people a year are smoking related. This figure includes 80 000 passive smokers, some of whom are children."
"That is the reason why we should impose limitations on the freedom of certain individuals in order to prevent deaths."
"(FI) Madam President, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with this report."
"It is excellent that we are adopting a clear position against passive smoking."
"I voted for this report because it is high time we acted at European Union level to prevent people from actually being exposed to the dangers of tobacco smoke."
"As we heard earlier, 650 000 people die each year from the effects of smoking."
"It is time to take action."
"Despite my support for the proposal, I know that it will be difficult to put into practice and implement everywhere."
"Article 11 incorporates the notion that smoking should be banned in private cars everywhere in the EU if underage children are present."
"This is a good aim, but we have to consider how it might be monitored."
"A smoke-free environment is a goal we should strive for, but in future we will need to pay more attention to ensuring that the action we take is reasonable and that compliance with the law can be monitored."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of course we all know that smoking is bad for our health."
"Nevertheless, I voted against the report on a smoke-free Europe as a matter of principle, for it is true to say that nowhere else has the state asserted itself quite so successfully as in the fight against smoking in public."
"Countries in the EU - and that includes us - are intervening on an unprecedented scale, with their smoking bans, in citizens' private habits."
"We are experiencing a state-sponsored prohibition policy across the board, designed to train people to change their behaviour."
"The report itself makes this clear."
"Unanimity - or, as we have it today - virtual unanimity is no guarantee of freedom."
"The opposite is true."
"In essence - and this is something we should recognise - freedom thrives on the opportunity to deviate from the norm."
"Concerned citizens are on the march, we have the nanny state, and all those who have anything to do with this and support it think that it has nothing to do with liberty."
"They are quite wrong!"
"(DE) Madam President, yes, I also voted against the report on a smoke-free Europe, although by doing so, I am subjecting myself to what is tantamount to a witch-hunt, even in the House by the way."
"That is the reason why so many of our fellow Members simply did not have the courage to vote against the report, even though they do not want this nannying policy either."
"Of course I am in favour of protecting non-smokers, children and young people, but a matter of principle is at stake."
"Firstly, we have no health policy competence."
"That lies with the Member States."
"Anything else is a violation of subsidiarity and is a constructed competence at EU level."
"Secondly, and more particularly, we have had enough!"
"We have had enough, ladies and gentlemen!"
"For years, the EU has waged war on smokers, alcohol and the obese in Europe, apparently on the assumption that our citizens are stupid and need nannying through legislation."
"That is precisely what I am opposed to."
"The citizens who I represent are not stupid."
"A prohibition policy is always counterproductive and my job is to represent people, not nanny them."
"Madam President, if ever there was an issue that cried out for subsidiarity, it is surely that of smoking."
"Pass over the hypocrisy of subsidising the growing of tobacco in the European Union while penalising its consumption."
"Disregard the double standard of discouraging smoking within the EU but encouraging it outside."
"Focus instead on the more basic question of what any of this has to do with Brussels."
"Surely the legal and fiscal status of tobacco is a national prerogative, and the question of where and when we may consume it should be decided more locally still: in a privately-owned space by the proprietor of that space, and in a public space by the municipal authorities."
"It ought to have nothing to do with national governments and certainly nothing to do with the European Union."
"Subsidiarity, colleagues - remember that?"
"(PL) Madam President, during this sitting we have debated the report by Mr Florenz on limiting the right to smoke cigarettes."
"I voted against this report because I believe that restrictions should only be imposed in cases where smoking will harm other people."
"We cannot, however, ban people who wish to harm themselves from doing so."
"That amounts to an intrusion into the rights of the individual that goes beyond the rights of any employer."
"The issue of treatment-related costs is of course relevant, but that is simply a matter for those responsible for insuring others."
"If it were deemed appropriate, the rates for smokers could be increased to cover treatment costs."
"There is another issue worthy of mention too, namely subsidiarity. Previous speakers have already referred to it and of course I entirely agree that this issue, which is in any case essentially flawed, must come under the competence of national authorities, not that of the European Union."
"in writing. - (DE) I welcome all measures in the Member States to inform citizens about the risks of smoking."
"In my view, all these measures fall within the purview of the Member States, not the European Union."
"I have therefore rejected the Florenz report in the final vote."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Mr Florenz's report on the 'Green Paper: Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level' as I consider it essential that appropriate steps are taken to reduce the number of deaths and serious illnesses caused by tobacco smoke."
"In that regard, I support the call for the Commission to amend Directive 2001/37/EC on tobacco products in order, in light of new scientific advances, to revise the rules on the use of additives and other substances in these products, particularly in relation to carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic additives."
"in writing. - (FR) Strasbourg is not Qom and the European Parliament is not the 'supreme leader' who has been sent down to dispense propriety and righteousness across the Union."
"Everybody now knows that smoking is bad for your health."
"But life itself is dangerous, for it always ends in death."
"I personally have never smoked in my life."
"While it does not shock me that some adults are prepared to take the risk, I never cease to be amazed at the proselytising of the ayatollahs on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety who, by issuing own-initiative report after report, are attempting to 'save the planet' to the detriment of human beings and their weaknesses."
"I say 'no' to these zealots."
"in writing. - (PL) As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and also as a non-smoker aware of the many negative consequences of cigarette smoking in one's immediate surroundings, I welcome the report by Mr Florenz entitled: 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke'."
"I believe it is entirely appropriate for the European Parliament itself to send out a firm and unequivocal message to all EU citizens and Member States making it clear that we do not wish to see people smoking in public places, notably in restaurants, in bars and on public transport."
"We particularly do not wish to see people smoking in the workplace."
"We are also calling for stricter measures against the sale of cigarettes to minors."
"In addition, I think the introduction of restrictions should be accompanied by a wide-ranging information campaign that should cover more than the harmful effects of smoking."
"The latter are generally well-known, but it also needs to be made clear that non-smokers' rights to live in a smoke-free environment cannot be dependent on or restricted by smokers wishing to exercise their right to smoke at the expense of non-smokers."
"If our appeal for a Europe free from tobacco smoke is to bear fruit, we Members of the European Parliament should set an example and give up smoking at our workplace. That means no more smoking in any Parliament premises."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for this report which seeks not only to support Member States in the strict measures they have adopted to combat tobacco addiction, but also to promote better public health."
"Not only is tobacco smoke a major source of air pollution, the chemicals contained in cigarettes expose smokers and non-smokers alike to serious risk. This is particularly true in enclosed spaces, such as workplaces, bars and restaurants."
"It therefore seems essential to me that we should clearly and unilaterally ban smoking in such places."
"Imposing strict legislation designed to provide maximum protection for the health of our citizens cannot effectively be achieved without a real effort at alerting and informing the public as to the risks associated with tobacco use."
"I also welcome the willingness that has been expressed to direct information campaigns at certain target groups, especially the young, pregnant women and parents."
"Finally, I regret that an amendment has been adopted calling on the Commission to investigate the health risks associated with chewing tobacco and the impact this has on cigarette consumption."
"I believe that this request does not belong in a report such as this, for the health risks presented by chewing tobacco, namely cancer of the tongue and so on, are generally recognised."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which sets out the options for reducing the harm caused by tobacco smoke across the European Union."
"It does not call for EU legislation, but calls on Member States to institute comprehensive smoking bans within two years."
"The UK already has such a ban, but given the harm tobacco causes I support this sensible approach being extended across the EU."
"in writing. - (DE) Smoking bans are, of course, in the interests of public health and, for public buildings, are therefore to be welcomed."
"It is also sensible to protect children and young people."
"However, with these particular groups, it would be more helpful if people set a good example and maintained existing anti-smoking campaigns."
"It is hypocritical, however, for the European Union to attempt to prescribe smoking bans wholesale for all Member States when it has shown itself to be incapable of even reaching an agreement on facilities here in the House."
"Our democratic system and modern attitudes to life are based on freedom of choice and, logically, this should apply to smoking as well."
"If a majority of the population is in favour of a smoking ban in restaurants, then this will come into effect over the short or the long term."
"There is already a trend for people to become non-smokers and, in line with the principle of sovereignty, it should remain a matter for each country to decide whether smoking bans should be introduced in restaurants, for example, and what form these bans should take."
"in writing. - (EL) I have supported the Florenz report on the Green Paper 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke'."
"I believe it will contribute to public health protection and help substantially in reducing the harmful effects of smoking, both in young people and in chronic smokers."
"It will achieve this by pushing for the immediate prohibition of all additives that strengthen addiction and by promoting preventive measures at European and Member State level."
"in writing. - I strongly support smoking bans in public places to protect public health and to avert the dangers of passive smoking."
"A Scottish ban on smoking in public places has now been in place for 19 months, and figures show that since the smoking ban was introduced there has been a 20% reduction in heart attack admissions to hospital."
"The smoking ban has therefore saved lives and has been effective in promoting better health for Scots."
"I look forward to seeing this approach applied across the rest of Europe."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Florenz entitled: 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke'."
"Tobacco smoke is a very harmful substance. It contains thousands of chemical substances, including over 250 carcinogenic and toxic components."
"Even the slightest exposure to these substances can contribute to the development of tumours."
"Tobacco smoke particles are deposited permanently in enclosed areas causing air pollution that even the best ventilation systems cannot deal with effectively."
"Thousands of people die each year in the European Union as a result of passive smoking. These deaths could be prevented."
"It has to be possible for every European Union citizen to live and work in surroundings that are free from tobacco smoke. This must be emphasised particularly in connection with public institutions and premises."
"Seventy per cent of the population of the European Union is non-smoking. We must bear this in mind and ensure that these people are able to live in a clean and safe environment."
"(SK) I voted against the report because it does not clearly reflect the European Union position on Turkey."
"It is necessary to freeze accession talks with Turkey completely. There are numerous reasons for doing so."
"At present Turkey is an untrustworthy partner."
"By refusing Turkey's EU entry, in other words by telling the Turks the truth about their future EU membership, we would help the country democratise their society at last."
"Turkey continues to occupy a Member State of the European Union: 40% of Cypriot territory is under Turkish military occupation."
"There is no freedom of religion in Turkey."
"Non-Muslims, Christians, members of the Orthodox Catholic Church and Protestants all suffer from persecution because they are not allowed to build churches."
"Five hundred Orthodox churches have been destroyed while everywhere in the European Union Muslims are building mosques."
"There is no freedom of speech in Turkey."
"Turkey denies the massacre of one-third of the Armenian population in the past."
"It is getting ready for another military intervention in Iraq."
"It is not solving the issues of the Kurdish minority on its territory."
"Turkey is not in Europe and does not belong in the EU."
"A privileged partnership with Turkey, instead of full membership, will be quite enough."
"(DE) Madam President, I did not vote for the resolution on Turkey because I am greatly concerned that the Turkish Parliament has agreed a military strike against Iraq."
"This could not be taken into account in the report, but is a very topical issue."
"Taking measures against a terrorist group is rather different from voting to invade a neighbouring country."
"It is not in the EU's interests to see any destabilisation of Iraq."
"We should be reminding Turkey that, as a candidate country, it should be considering EU interests within the framework of common interests."
"This shows that full membership for Turkey - which I do not support, incidentally - with its shared borders with Iran and Iraq would mean a complete redrawing of the political map within the EU."
"In my view, we should spare ourselves the associated risks."
"(NL) Madam President, I voted against the Oomen-Ruijten resolution because I think that Parliament should play a more active and a more ambitious role in monitoring the negotiation process with Turkey."
"Now it seems that we have to make sure that we do not hurt the sensitive feelings of Mr Erdoğan and Mr Gül."
"It is becoming increasingly clear that Turkey is a candidate country unlike any other."
"Turkey evidently does not need to adhere to the Copenhagen criteria so strictly, despite all the promises from the Council, the Commission and Parliament that it would have to."
"The way things are going we should not be at all surprised that more and more citizens in the European Union are turning their backs on the Union."
"(NL) Madam President, this new vote on Turkish accession is a clear illustration of the fact that not only for most of our citizens is Europe far away and of no great concern to them, but that the European institutions themselves are increasingly alienating themselves from the citizens of Europe."
"To the Eurocrats, Europe is not really Europe any more, as we blithely proceed to prepare for the accession of a country that is not European at all, not European in historical, cultural or religious terms, not in the euro, and not even European in geographical terms."
"What is more, this whole business has been pushed down our throats in a fundamentally undemocratic way, because the vast majority of European citizens really are against the accession of Turkey, but they are not allowed to have their say."
"The citizens are not allowed to have their say on Turkey, just as they are not allowed to have their say on the new Constitution that we are not allowed to call a constitution."
"Are the Eurocrats actually afraid of democracy, afraid of consulting the people?"
"This Europe is operating in an increasingly undemocratic and antidemocratic way, and it will all end very badly."
"(FI) Madam President, two weeks ago Hrant Dink's son Arat Dink and the publisher Serkis Seropyan were sentenced to prison for a year under Article 301, that is to say for insulting Turkishness."
"What was their crime?"
"Over a year ago, thus prior to the murder of Hrant Dink, their newspaper Argos published a story stating that Hrant Dink, in an interview with Reuters, had said he thought the killings which took place in 1915 were genocide."
"The newspaper was therefore only reporting this, and that is all."
"I therefore think it is vitally important to vote in favour of our resolution calling on Turkey to acknowledge the Armenian genocide."
"I say this as a friend of Turkey."
"It would be good if Turkey understood that this is not meant as an anti-Turkish stance."
"It is more about the custom the EU has of trying to create a better society in which the horrors of history can be avoided."
"A mindset where national identity protects itself with a penal code in which Article 301 is a continual frame of reference, and in which the mistakes of a nation are denied, is in serious conflict with this custom."
"One of the bases of the European identity is that history is looked straight in the eye and held to account."
"The Armenian genocide is a historical truth."
"Parliament will be demanding that Turkey acknowledge it in the resolution on the start of negotiations."
"in writing. - (FR) I wish to support the amendments made to the text that has been submitted for today's vote on relations between the European Union and Turkey and in doing so would recall the conclusions reached at the European Council held in Brussels in December 2006."
"These set out the principle whereby, as far as enlargement was concerned, the European Union would require each candidate country to comply fully with all the Copenhagen criteria, but that any enlargement would still be subject to the Union's capacity for further integration."
"Quite a few of you will have been aware for some time of the doubts, or rather the concerns, that I have had about the European Union's ability to continue to function properly if Turkey were to become one of its Member States."
"Of course Turkey is a 'friendly' country and in geo-strategic terms is a very important partner for the European Union."
"I am therefore completely in favour of the EU maintaining a privileged partnership with Turkey."
"However, I am fiercely opposed to that particular country becoming part the Community."
"Moreover, I believe that the problems of integrating Turkey as a potential Member State will become increasingly clear as the accession negotiations progress."
"in writing. - (FR) I congratulate the rapporteur on having tabled the resolution on relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"The motion for a resolution by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is a consensual and balanced document and in it she has sought to cover all the issues relating to this particular problem."
"On the one hand the resolution congratulates Turkey on having recently held free and fair elections, calls on the Turkish Government to accelerate the process of reform and welcomes its intention to adopt a new civilian constitution."
"The motion for a resolution further calls for a new political initiative to be launched for a lasting settlement to the Kurdish issue."
"It also refers to attempts at reaching a settlement to the Cyprus question within the UN framework."
"On the other hand, and this is in accordance with the position being supported by France, I welcome the fact that the resolution recalls that Turkey's accession continues to depend on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and on the EU's capacity for further integration."
"For all these reasons I have decided to support the adoption of this resolution at the final vote in plenary."
"I can only once again express my deep regret that Parliament has not formally called on Turkey to officially recognise the Armenian genocide of 1915."
"in writing. - (PT) As we highlighted earlier, many questions are raised by the negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU."
"This process is being encouraged by the major powers which, despite the contradictions, are aiming to integrate this great country into the EU's 'single market', thereby gaining control of its economy and using its geo-strategic position for their own plans in the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia."
"The resolution is therefore illuminating in this respect as it underlines 'the importance of Turkey as a transit hub for the diversification of gas supplies to the EU' and 'energy projects involving Turkey in the South Caucasus', and also 'the geo-strategic position of Turkey in the region' whose 'role in transportation and logistics will become more important in the coming years'."
"The following are some of the other important aspects that should be underlined:"
"Turkey has not made any steps towards recognising Cyprus - an EU Member State - and still militarily occupies the north of this island and disregards UN resolutions on this issue;"
"the Turkish authorities are still engaged in repression against the Kurdish people and are still denying their legitimate cultural, political, economic and social rights."
"in writing. - (EL) The report on the progress of Turkey's course of accession to the EU includes utterly spurious congratulations to the Turkish Government and the new president."
"The report is a hypocritical and ineffectual expression of wishful thinking about human rights in vague and general terms, condemning terrorism and mentioning the joint struggle waged against it by the EU and Turkey."
"On the other hand, there is no reference whatsoever to the continuing occupation of Northern Cyprus by Turkish military forces."
"There is not even a token condemnation of Turkey's continuing refusal to recognise the Republic of Cyprus, and no pressure brought to bear on this issue."
"There is no condemnation of the Turkish regime's policy of contesting Greek sovereign rights or of its threat to use force against neighbouring countries."
"There is no serious condemnation of the barbarous persecution and crimes committed by the Turkish authorities against the Kurdish population."
"There is not the slightest allusion to the political persecution, at the hands of the Turkish middle class in all its guises, both pro-burka and secular, of communists and other progressive-minded people."
"Despite all this, Turkey is urged not to use disproportionate force in the impending attack on northern Iraq!"
"In the context of the EU, the report reflects the objectives of powerful imperialist countries in line with their geopolitical interests in the wider area."
"It is in the interests of the Turkish people and other peoples in the area to oppose Turkey's integration into the EU and its imperialist plans."
"in writing. - (FR) This resolution loses its impact because important amendments relating to the recognition of the Armenian genocide have been rejected by the majority of Members."
"I am and will remain in favour of Turkey's accession to the European Union."
"However, this accession process has to recognise some historical facts."
"Moreover, I am totally opposed to the contradiction that Parliament has now introduced. In paragraph 5 of the resolution of 28 September 2005 it in fact called on Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide and regarded this admission as a precondition for accession to the European Union."
"The decision to omit the Armenian genocide from the new resolution is a step backwards and one that I cannot support."
"in writing. - (PT) Regardless of the end result, the current negotiations with Turkey must bring about the reforms which the country so desperately needs and which, in themselves, are the most important aspect of a country's potential accession to the EU."
"In this context, we must regard the AKP's victory more as a commitment to economic reform than as a vote for Islam."
"Given recent developments, the Kurdish issue must be tackled in conjunction with the United States, bearing in mind the issue of Iraq where the Kurdish north is peaceful."
"On the other hand, we cannot refrain from criticising the Kurdish terrorist attacks on Turkey or the lack of integration and acceptance of Kurds within Turkey itself."
"Finally, we can never highlight enough the geo-strategic importance of Turkey in relation to the security of Europe's borders, energy supply, particularly as an alternative to dependency on Russian gas, as a partner in dialogue with Islamic countries and on the Iraq issue."
"For all these reasons, the EU's strategy must be to negotiate seriously and firmly."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the resolution that urges Turkey to accelerate the pace of its reforms."
"We have to call on Turkey to do more: to ensure civilian control over the military; to have zero tolerance of torture; to provide protection for women and minority groups, and to recognise the Armenian genocide."
"The handling of the Kurdish issue also has to be used as a criterion for assessing the reform process."
"The report that we have voted on urges the Turkish Government to launch a political initiative aimed at finding a lasting settlement to the Kurdish problem. It also deplores the violation of Iraq's territory, while at the same time, of course, condemning the violence perpetrated by the PKK."
"This is not about targeting Turkey as such, it is about recalling that we cannot have double standards, that we cannot sell off cheaply the values that we hold dear."
"It would also be disastrous to continue to ignore public opinion, which was again expressed in a poll carried out by Notre Europe before the Lisbon Summit."
"The people of Europe are concerned about ill-prepared decisions on any future enlargement and about the EU's capacity to absorb any more countries after the huge wave of new accessions that took place between 2004 and 2007."
"in writing. - (DE) I support the resolution on Turkey."
"The Turkish Government must be vigorous in implementing reforms at last."
"As for the Armenian genocide, although Turkey's admission of this genocide is not part of the Copenhagen criteria, a country which aspires to join the EU must surely face up to the dark side of its history."
"Overall, Turkey has a very long way to go before it meets the Copenhagen criteria."
"Substantial deficits in relation to human and minority rights, civil and political rights and the general weakness of Turkey's democracy vis-à-vis the military still exist."
"There is still no progress on the Cyprus issue."
"For that reason, we must continue to push, this year, for the ratification of the Ankara Protocol."
"Without this, and also without the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island, there can be no solution."
"Turkey apparently refuses to understand that there are 27 Member States of the European Union and that one of these is the Republic of Cyprus!"
"As regards the conflict in the south-east of Turkey, the plan to launch an incursion into northern Iraq has existed at least since spring 2006."
"At present, it is to be feared that the invasion will indeed take place."
"However, a country which - despite international support for the securing of its borders - claims the right to violate international law as it sees fit disqualifies itself from accession to the European Union once and for all."
"in writing. - (PL) I abstained in the final vote on the report concerning EU-Turkey relations. This was because, despite negotiations lasting several months, the resolution makes no reference to the issue of Turkish responsibility for the massacre of Armenians in 1915."
"Turkey is attempting to impose censorship on the international community regarding this matter."
"The most recent proof of this was the pressure brought to bear on the US Congress. The latter nevertheless stood firm and adopted an appropriate stance."
"It is a mistake to give in to unjustified pressure from Turkey on this matter."
"I should like to add, however, that I very much appreciate the inclusion in the aforementioned resolution of statements concerning the rights of Christian minorities in Turkey, such as the right to train clergy and Church institutions' right to legal personality."
"in writing. - (FR) I decided to abstain on the resolution on EU-Turkey relations in order to signal my opposition to the accession negotiations currently under way."
"Two recent events should make us aware of the risks associated with this hypothetical accession."
"First there is the political crisis that the country went through before the new President of the Republic was sworn in: this illustrated the tensions that exist within Turkish society and also the fragility of that country's institutions."
"I am also thinking of the tensions that have built up at the Iraqi border and the risk that this could destabilise one of the few areas in that country where violence has been contained."
"The Turkish Parliament's decision to authorise the army to make military incursions into Iraq is unacceptable."
"Turkey is playing a dangerous role in the region and the EU should not lend any support to these populist and aggressive actions."
"All this only reinforces my conviction: if we enlarge the Union to the borders of Iraq, I do not see what we will have left that is European."
"I believe that Turkey is still unfit to join the EU."
"It is up to us to put forward an alternative option: here the 'Mediterranean Union' proposed by Nicolas Sarkozy certainly offers an opportunity that should be seized by the EU and by Turkey."
"in writing. - (SK) I did not vote for the European Parliament resolution on EU-Turkey relations because enlargement of the European Union and Turkey's entry into the Community are rather serious matters requiring more detailed knowledge and more intensive debate."
"In my opinion, in the accession process the same rules should apply to all countries."
"The proposed amendments calling for an admission of the Armenian genocide and for an apology to Armenia and the Armenian people were not adopted by the plenary."
"Only such an admission and apology can give impetus to the process of reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia."
"Furthermore, Turkey continues to hinder progress in the search for a solution to the Cyprus problem."
"The cross-border military operation against Kurds who live along the border with Iraq, approved in a declaration issued by the Turkish Parliament, will not lead to a constructive solution to the terrorism problem in the country."
"It will simply lead to the destabilisation of the entire region."
"There is also no visible progress in the matter of freedom of religion within the territory of the Republic of Turkey."
"The safety of Christians living in Turkey and respect for their rights are not guaranteed."
"In recent times we have witnessed violent attacks on Christian priests, missionaries, publishers or converts."
"Turkey has also not re-opened the Orthodox Church's seminary without which the very existence of this ancient church is threatened."

"EU-Serbia relations (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Kacin, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on EU-Serbia relations, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on relations between the European Union and Serbia."
"Rapporteur. - (SL) Today I am speaking as a rapporteur, but at the same time as a Liberal Democrat, as a Slovene, as a former Yugoslav and as a European."
"Just 15 years ago the country in which I was born disintegrated in a number of bloody wars which lasted for almost an entire decade."
"Today many countries of that region, including Serbia, are still faced with the destructive effects of the conflict."
"To these fragile and young democracies membership of the European Union is a powerful incentive for further democratisation."
"The European Union, which these countries wish to join as soon as possible, is based on common values and standards, one of the most important of which is the rule of law."
"However, in the case of the Balkan countries the issue is not only reform of the judicial system but also full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague."
"Serbia has so far failed to honour its domestic and international duty to arrest four remaining fugitive war crime indictees, including Mladić and Karadžić, who stand accused of orchestrating the slaughter of nearly 8 000 civilians in Srebrenica."
"Anybody who kills a single human being commits a crime, but those who commit genocide represent an international and political challenge."
"I visited Srebrenica before preparing this report."
"I believe in Serbian self-respect."
"That is why I insist that the Serbian state has to prove it is cooperating with the ICTY."
"In May, a new pro-European government took office, with ICTY cooperation as one of its key objectives."
"That is a development which I warmly welcome."
"I also welcome the fact that the Government moved against, arrested and delivered two of the six most wanted fugitives, Tolimir and Djordjevic."
"Those arrests demonstrate that Serbia is able to locate and arrest the remaining war fugitives."
"As Chief Prosecutor Del Ponte has stated, the principal obstacle is not ability, but rather translating ability into tangible results."
"This is why the EU cannot afford to waive its conditionality at this crucial juncture."
"As the tensions surrounding Kosovo's future status mount, it would be wrong to think that caving in on EU conditionality and bending over backwards to make concessions to Belgrade will serve either the EU or Serbia in the long run."
"Turning a blind eye to war criminals may suit modern day Realpolitik, but it will not contribute to long-term peace or regional stability."
"It is often repeated that Serbia is the key to stability in the region, but politicians in Belgrade are wrong to assume that this will mean preferential treatment for Serbia."
"Serbia would do well to use its abundant talents and potential to act as an example to its neighbours in the region, rather than leaving them to languish because of Serbian recalcitrance."
"It is true that the EU will not be complete until the Balkans form part of the Union, but this cannot be at any price, and certainly not at the price of undermining international law and ignoring fundamental European values."
"The citizens of Serbia are entitled to know the truth about the recent policies of war committed in their name."
"It is also for this reason that I support the recent initiative by the Special Prosecutor to uncover the political motives behind the assassination of Prime Minister Djindjić."
"It is for that reason too that I regret the leniency of the sentences delivered by the Serbian war crimes court to four members of the Scorpions for the execution of six Muslims from Srebrenica."
"There is tremendous economic and cultural potential in Serbia, and a vast area of talented individuals in all spheres of life."
"The new Government has proved itself to have a number of dynamic and ambitious ministers."
"There is no doubt that Serbia possesses the administrative and institutional capacity to deal professionally with further EU membership negotiations."
"Progress has been made in a number of areas in recent months, for instance in the conclusion of the technical talks on the SAA negotiations, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, CEFTA and the election of an Ombudsman, a Governor of the Bank of Serbia, a Commissioner for Public Information and the members of the Council of the State Audit Institution."
"Disappointingly, however, there has been little tangible progress on the nomination of judges to the Constitutional Court."
"In addition, the public denigration of civil society actors who criticise the Government or try to draw attention to sensitive issues, such as war crimes, continues."
"In this regard, I condemn the recent events in Novi Sad, where a neo-Nazi organisation attacked a peaceful gathering of individuals who had gathered for an anti-fascist demonstration."
"It is imperative that the relevant authorities find the perpetrators and thoroughly investigate the crime."
"At the same time, I recognise that the EU's strict visa regime, which prevents ordinary Serbs from meeting with their counterparts in the European Union, acts as a brake on Serbia's democratic progress, and contributes to xenophobia and nationalism."
"I welcome the agreements which have been negotiated."
"While these mark an important first step, the ultimate goal must be to liberalise travel for all citizens of the region."
"Do you know that only one tenth of Serbs possess a passport?"
"We have to give something concrete to the rest of the population."
"I urge the Council to ensure that the agreements enter into force at the beginning of next year, as well as calling on the Council also to establish a concrete roadmap for visa liberalisation."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank my assistants, fellow Members, the Committee on Foreign Affairs secretariat, the political groups, the Commission, the Serbian Mission to the EU and the Serbian Office for European Integration."
"In concluding my intervention, I would like to add a short personal note."
"As one of the very few MEPs born in the Western Balkans, I am very proud to have worked as rapporteur."
"My country, Slovenia, became an EU member not because it was easy, but because it was difficult."
"We managed, just like Serbian politicians, intellectuals and business people will also manage, when they decide to do so."
"I call on Serbia and the Serbian people to wake up now, to start helping themselves, to help their neighbours, to help the entire region and to join us."
"Do it."
"You are strong enough."
"Together we will manage."
"I thank the House for its forbearance as regards the usual time allocation."
"I apologise to the House on the rapporteur's behalf."
"Thank you."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Serbia naturally lies within the European space and we all recognise that, in recent years, it has been faced with major challenges; in fact more than this, with extremely difficult challenges due to its importance to the stability and development of the Western Balkan region."
"The European Union has tried to help Serbia overcome these challenges by reinforcing and making more tangible and visible the benefits of the European perspective."
"We have therefore tried to prove to the Serbian people and authorities our commitment to bringing Serbia closer to the European Union."
"We have tried to show that there is an alternative, by helping the pro-European political and social forces which are favourable to pursuing the necessary reforms to consolidate the country's democracy and development."
"The stabilisation and association agreements represent a fundamental step in bringing the Western Balkan countries closer to the Union."
"They also form an essential instrument for clarifying the European perspective."
"In that regard, we feel that it is very positive that the Commission has completed the negotiations with Serbia on the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"We sincerely hope that the conditions for the Commission to sign the agreement will shortly be met."
"There is firm political support in the Council for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement to be signed as soon as the necessary conditions are met."
"However, before the Council can implement the agreement, Serbia must fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court."
"The ability for people in Serbia to travel more easily to the European Union would also reinforce the ties between us and undoubtedly contribute to the democratisation process and to the pro-European Union sentiment in Serbian society."
"The visa facilitation and readmission agreements which were signed in September and which will enter into force in January 2008 are, in our opinion, vitally important."
"The Commission has agreed with Serbia to begin dialogue on the liberalisation of visas after the entry into force of these agreements."
"The EU has also made it clear to Serbia that its integration process is not linked to the issue of determining the future status of Kosovo."
"In fact, every country moves towards becoming a member of the European Union on its own merits and in accordance with the conditions of the stabilisation and association process and the Copenhagen criteria."
"To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must once again reiterate the significance that the Presidency of the European Union attributes to the opportunity of discussing with the European Parliament the importance, for both Serbia itself and the region, of securing a European future for Serbia."
"There can be no doubt that the Western Balkans remain one of the European Union's priorities and that our ultimate goal is to create a situation of peace, stability, democracy and prosperity in the region."
"This is why we have a vision of the integration of these countries within the Union, with the stabilisation and association process remaining the framework for preparing for this potential accession."
"Serbia is a country of high geo-strategic importance to the stability of the whole region, which is why progress in this process is essential to achieve the EU's ultimate goal with regard to the Western Balkans: to see this become a region of stability, peace and progress."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Kacin for his solid report, which captures the essential aspects of the current state of EU-Serbia relations."
"I have asked my services to follow up on the recommendations of the report, which has already been useful in the preparation of the Commission's annual progress report, due to be adopted on 6 November."
"Your report highlights a number of areas where both the European Union and Serbia need to intensify efforts, which I fully support."
"I particularly agree with the importance granted to visa facilitation and with the call for progress now to be made on visa liberalisation."
"Precisely for that reason, the Commission has indicated its intention to start a dialogue early next year, with each of the countries of the Western Balkans, on a roadmap for visa liberalisation, by defining its requirements and conditions."
"This issue is of immense importance, not least in terms of giving concrete evidence to the young generation of the region of what Europe really means."
"We are at a very critical juncture in our relations with Serbia."
"Over the past fortnight I have had intense discussions with the Council Presidency, with Member States and with the Serbian authorities on the state of affairs."
"It will come as no surprise that the Kosovo status process and the stabilisation and association agreement, including ICTY conditionality, were the main items."
"The deadline of 10 December for Kosovo talks is fast approaching, and the work of the international troika is entering a crucial phase."
"We fully support the work of the EU's representative, Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger, and we will leave no stone unturned in seeking a negotiated solution."
"It is now essential that the two parties - Belgrade and Priština - assume their responsibilities and engage seriously in constructive and creative proposals that can lead to a negotiated, sustainable solution."
"I have also had intensive discussions with Member States and with the Serbian authorities on the stabilisation and association agreement."
"That agreement will constitute a political milestone in our relations with Serbia."
"It will be the gateway towards candidate status for membership of the European Union."
"The Commission has first negotiated and then finalised the technical work on the draft text of this agreement, which is currently being assessed by Member States in the Council working group."
"It is working intensively with the Presidency and Member States to complete a legal-linguistic review of the text so that we, as the European Union, are technically ready to sign the agreement soon, provided that the political conditions are in place - namely full cooperation with the ICTY - which should lead to the arrest of the remaining indictees."
"This is, to my understanding, in line with the recommendation in your report, addressed to the Council."
"Concerning the ICTY, as I have said before, for the moment I see Serbia's part of the glass as being half full rather than half empty."
"I have made it clear to the Serbian Government that signature of the SAA is within reach."
"It is now a question of political will and translating ability into results."
"We are ready, once Serbia is ready by meeting the conditions."
"The ball is now clearly in Serbia's court."
"At the same time we should also appreciate the efforts Serbia has made up to now."
"Too often, these tend to be forgotten in our debates."
"Since 2004, Serbia has cooperated in locating and handing over 20 of the 24 ICTY indictees."
"That shows that our policy of conditionality works."
"However, ICTY cooperation cannot be a stop-start process, and more needs to be done to achieve full cooperation, especially concerning intensified search operations and access to archives and documents."
"The Chief Prosecutor will return to Belgrade tomorrow for two days, and the Commission will take her findings strongly into account when making our assessment on the initialling of the SAA agreement."
"Signature will then depend on full cooperation with the ICTY, and we will assess that together with the Council."
"This requires Serbia to do everything in its powers to locate and arrest the fugitives and to provide the ICTY with all the necessary information leading to their arrest and transfer to tribunal in The Hague."
"To conclude, Serbia indeed has tremendous economic, cultural and intellectual potential that is just waiting to be released in the pursuit of the country's European future."
"The Commission is fully committed to Serbia's European perspective."
"I am convinced that the country can make relatively rapid progress on its European road once it meets the essential conditions."
"That is crucial, not just for Serbia's European aspirations, but for the stability and progress of the whole Western Balkans."
"It is, therefore, high time for Serbia to turn the page on its painful past, and to fully approach its European future."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, all in this House would agree that Serbia has a European future and that this European future is highly desirable, both for Serbia and for Europe."
"The question then is how to get there from here."
"The heart of the problem is that, whilst Serbia certainly has some of the characteristics of a democracy, it is still some way from having a stable, democratic infrastructure."
"The legacy of communism and of the wars following the disintegration of Yugoslavia has left deep marks on Serbian society, hence the operation of trustworthy, neutral institutions is that much more difficult to sustain."
"The weakness of the rule of law, the corruption and nepotism, and the worryingly high level of casual violence are all indicators of a society that has to undergo a significant shift before democracy can be regarded as complying with the Copenhagen criteria."
"Perhaps the most toxic part of the legacy is the way in which nationalism retains its attractiveness for a politically important part of society, a part of the elite included."
"For the protagonists of Serbian ethnic nationalism, Serbian citizenship is understood as coextensive with the Serbian nation."
"This bears very hard on the non-Serb part of Serbian society."
"In this area, the country's political elite has a great deal of work to do."
"Only Serbia - the country's political elites and Serbian society - can make the necessary shift towards democracy, human rights and citizenship."
"The conclusions of this thoughtful report, on the other hand, offer cogent indications as to how that transformation can be made and how Serbia can once again take its place in Europe."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, with winter just around the corner, the political atmosphere in Serbia is heating up."
"That is why, by participating in the preparation of this report, the PSE Group is trying especially to grasp the situation of a nation that lost a privileged position in the former Yugoslav Federation, a nation where nationalist outbreaks have damaged the entire region, wrecked many lives, claimed a number of victims and received bombs and rockets in reply."
"In spite of everything, the majority of the country's population wants nothing else than to follow the European path and, by doing so, to heal its own and its neighbours' wounds."
"This report tries to help, in a friendly and yet demanding fashion, to draw the road signs for this important path."
"I would especially like to thank our colleague, Mr Kacin, who put into this report not only a lot of work but also sense and heart."
"I would like to emphasise the successful work of the pro-European Serbian Government in this not-so-easy situation."
"Its activities have allowed the European Parliament to suggest signing of the stabilisation and association agreement, perhaps even by the end of this year."
"Yet whether the country will be able to turn a page in its relations with the EU depends largely on the Serbs themselves."
"We, for our part, will keep strongly to our opinion that the agreement will be signed only when Serbia shows results in capturing the remaining war criminals."
"The PSE Group has proposed a few amendments to the report which seek to soften the formulation of sensitive issues for Serbs."
"These suggest, inter alia, changing the formulation of Recital M to underline that inter-ethnic reconciliation is paramount for securing stability in the region."
"We are of the position that Kosovo is a separate problem, which is why it remains almost untouched in this report."
"The solution to that problem should not divert Serbia from the European path along which, after time, it is forecast to meet with Kosovo and former Yugoslav republics, and indeed with the rest of Europe."
"on behalf of the ALDE group. - (HU) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kacin, on his constructive and balanced report."
"In 2003 the European Union committed itself to the integration of Serbia into the EU because of its conviction that Serbia is an important factor in regional stability, and that Serbia's future lies in Europe."
"From this point onwards, the pace of integration depends entirely on Serbia."
"Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague is an important prerequisite."
"Progress has been made; two out of the six most wanted war criminals have been handed over, but the most serious war criminals, Mladić and Karadžić, are still at large."
"Further efforts are needed."
"The biggest test of strength for both Serbia and Europe is the issue of settling the status of Kosovo."
"The current situation is the most serious obstacle both to regional stability and to Serbia's EU integration."
"We expect Serbia to act in a constructive manner in order to resolve this situation as quickly and as satisfactorily as possible."
"Progress has been made in the field of minority rights; the number of violent assaults has fallen, and minorities have been granted new rights under the constitution."
"The progress made, however, is far from adequate: regulations relating to National Councils are not yet in place and legislation guaranteeing self-determination for minorities is lacking."
"There are also European tasks that Serbia needs to undertake, given that in practice the Constitutional Court is non-functional, the justice system is slow and subject to political influence, and corruption and organised crime permeate all areas of economic and social life."
"If Serbia genuinely desires integration, it is vitally important that it steps up its efforts in these areas."
"Europe will give Serbia all possible assistance in order for it to carry out these tasks successfully, but it is Serbia that must undertake the tasks."
"We must emphasise that the responsibility and the obligation to do everything in their power to ensure the successful integration of Serbia into the EU lie with our Serb friends themselves. Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, the Commission will soon be taking a decision on the stabilisation and association agreement to be concluded between the EU and Serbia."
"I support this agreement."
"It will send out a clear message at international level that Serbian membership of the EU is on the current political agenda."
"This is the country's first significant step towards EU membership."
"Although many colleagues have spoken about the difficulties which Serbia has faced in the past and the ongoing problems that there are concerning Serbian accession and the stabilisation agreement, we must also give recognition to the tremendous road which has been travelled despite the difficulties which have occurred."
"As with all relationships between countries that are in close proximity to each other, there will still be difficulties in the future with regard to how Serbia will deal with the issue of Kosovo, their ongoing cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal, and in particular with regard to their relationships with other neighbouring countries that were formally part of Yugoslavia."
"However, the clear message being given by the authorities in Serbia is that there is an ongoing desire on their part to see progress being made."
"They are willing to hear the best practice models that we can encourage for them."
"And look at what the European Union has delivered in the past - over EUR 165 million in the reconstruction effort."
"The issue that we must all remember is that the Balkans War continues to be a huge psychological scar on the development, not just of Serbia, but of other countries."
"And indeed, if you look into the recent past of any of our own countries, there are similar psychological fractures which took us a while to overcome."
"We should give some leeway to allow for Serbia to make that transition and that progress."
"Our role and our duty is to ensure that we act as a good neighbour, as a faithful teacher of how best things can happen, but also to reward the good things that have happened."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to extend my warm thanks to the rapporteur for his sound and comprehensive work."
"We very much welcome the fact that the European Parliament makes clear and regular contributions to the political debate about the situation in South-East Europe."
"Serbia plays, and has played, a prominent role in this region."
"That is why it is essential to underline, time and again, that Serbia's future lies within the EU and that we are good and reliable partners."
"However, it takes at least two to build a partnership, and so I appeal to Serbia to continue along the path towards EU integration and to play a constructive role in the resolution of the Kosovo issue."
"We expect unlimited cooperation with the Hague Tribunal at last - that point has been made several times - and compliance with the criteria of European standards."
"I very much hope that the better opportunities for travel will also make a contribution here and bring about improvements in the future."
"What I cannot endorse, however, are the proposals that have occasionally been made to apply different standards to EU accession."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the representative of the Council take the same view, especially as we paid dearly for this not long ago."
"I have great understanding for the difficult and painful position in which Serbia finds itself, but I repeat, it takes at least two to build a partnership."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, as in any country that has lost a recent war resulting in the loss of territory and influence, nationalistic feelings of superiority also enjoy strong support in Serbia."
"Rather than isolating and punishing Serbia because the war criminal Ratko Mladić cannot be found, it should be offered a future in which guarantees are also established for the ethnic minorities in Vojvodina, Sandžak and Preševo."
"My Group supports the efforts of the Kacin report towards overtures with a view to Serbian membership of the European Union."
"Unfortunately, paragraph 8 added by the Committee on Foreign Affairs pre-empts the decision on Kosovo."
"After 10 December, Kosovo will probably be unilaterally recognised as a state by America and a number of Member States of the European Union, and Serbia will unilaterally take back the northern part of Kosovo."
"This is why we do not share at all the confidence that the future status of Kosovo can only contribute to stability and integration."
"While this groundless optimism in paragraph 8 is maintained, my Group is withdrawing its support for this report."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this report's opening sentence is: '... the future of Serbia lies in the European Union'."
"It goes on to say: '... the future of all countries in the region lies in the EU'."
"The countries of the region are of course Croatia, Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania."
"Some of them have historic enmities that have erupted in tragic wars in recent times."
"The EU, of course, believes that if they joined everything would resolve itself in sweetness and light."
"But follow through one consequence of what would actually happen if they did join."
"These states have a combined population of over 24 million people."
"Many of these people would take up their right to move to other parts of the EU."
"On past experience, many of them would come to Britain."
"Britain is already swamped with immigrants and asylum seekers from the EU and beyond."
"The British Home Office has an unofficial policy of moving different ethnic and religious groups of asylum-seekers to different parts of the UK for fear of the violence and conflicts that might erupt between them."
"If Serbia and other Balkan States were eventually to join the EU, Britain would import yet more of their historic hatreds and blood feuds onto British soil."
"The way forward for Serbia and for her neighbours is as democratic, independent nation states, resolving their problems peacefully - not to join the European Union."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, the European authorities, and in particular the Kacin report, generally seem to treat Serbia not as a sovereign state but as a naughty schoolboy, a ne'er-do-well, someone the European Union has the right to give good marks and bad marks to."
"Serbia gets good marks when it acquires a government that is described as being pro-European. This pro-European reference of course means being liable for and subject to the dogma that pertains in Brussels."
"It gets bad marks when the Serbs prove less than enthusiastic about collaborating with the International Criminal Tribunal."
"Here it is useful to recall that this Tribunal has scorned two principles that in fact go to the heart of our justice system: the legal sovereignty of states and freedom of expression."
"As a result, Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the Serbian Radical Party that represents 28% of the electorate, has been imprisoned in The Hague since February 2003 and is still awaiting a verdict, even though he turned himself in voluntarily."
"This Tribunal is therefore blatantly violating the very principles that have been declared by the European Union, namely respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"To tell the truth, Mr Seselj's only crime is to be a Serbian patriot."
"The rulers of the European Union, who wish to break up the nations of Europe, cannot in fact forgive the Serbs for having resisted the destruction of their state, and in particular the secession of Kosovo, the historic heart of Serbia."
"The treatment inflicted on the Serbs in Kosovo is a warning to all the peoples of Europe."
"If today the Albanians are calling for the establishment of a Kosovar state, it is because immigration from Albania and the falling birth-rate among Serbs have given them a majority in a province where, some fifty years ago, they were in the minority."
"The Kosovan example should compel us more than ever to reaffirm the right of the peoples of Europe to be themselves and to make their own decisions, in other words to preserve their identity and sovereignty, and in an enlarged European Europe of nations and homelands there should also clearly be a legitimate place for the people of Serbia."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kacin has presented a report which has attracted very broad support in the House."
"A number of us contributed to that effort."
"I therefore do not intend to discuss the finer points of detail, but would simply like to make various comments in a personal capacity."
"Serbia's democratic forces were too late in making the radical break with the Milošević era, much too late."
"As a result, cooperation with the Hague Tribunal was not addressed seriously and credibly, which was why cooperation within the Stabilisation and Association Agreement was also delayed, then suspended, then resumed, and now we are waiting again."
"In other words, Serbia's path to the EU is already mapped out and Serbia has the capacity, but it does need to make efforts of its own."
"The unresolved Kosovo issue hangs like a dark cloud over Serbian politics and is having a paralysing effect."
"Who is suffering as a result?"
"That is easy to answer: the young generation."
"After the embargo and the NATO bombing - and the Serbs have Mr Milošević to thank for both of them, not the democratic forces which are in government today - young people now face another intractable problem, namely Kosovo."
"This is impeding efficient political work as well, which plays straight into the hands of the radicals and their cronies at the top."
"Thankfully, visa facilitation will finally create some breathing space, and this is something which we in Parliament have long been campaigning for."
"We want to see young Serbs participating very soon in our education and youth programmes which we opened up with effect from 2007."
"I would also like to pay tribute to the very positive work being undertaken by the Vojvodina regional parliament in relation to tolerance and youth cooperation, which is having a major impact."
"A great many young people have come together in the Danube region this year, and this is a marvellous example of a commitment to tolerance and peaceful social relations."
"There is a great longing for normality in Serbia."
"Politicians should be doing more for the present and the future and should leave the past behind."
"They should also be doing much more to improve the daily lives of ordinary people, to ensure that they do not lose popular support."
"(DE) Mr President, in the speech made by our esteemed colleague Mr Kacin, there were two things missing, in my view."
"The first was the expression of thanks to the generous President, and the second, more importantly, was the balance which is certainly expressed in his report."
"We worked well together and I would like to thank him very much for that."
"I think that this has developed into a very good draft report."
"In saying that, I echo what Commissioner Rehn said."
"Some substantial progress has been made, but when assessing a country, both the positives and the negatives should be mentioned."
"Substantial progress has also been made in terms of cooperation with the ICTY."
"However - and here we are in accord - this progress is not enough."
"I hope that an agreement will be reached with Carla del Ponte in the next few days, and I made it clear on behalf of my Group when I spoke to Minister Ljajić that all the issues have to be resolved."
"We cannot stop halfway and we cannot stop three-quarters of the way either."
"Full cooperation has to be established."
"That is the common position of Parliament and the European Union as a whole."
"As I see it, the crucial issue in this country is that unfortunately - and here I would echo what Doris Pack has said - the nationalists often still seem to be setting the agenda."
"You cannot overtake extremist right-wing nationalists even further to the right, which is what some people are trying to do."
"This simply leads to chaos."
"The fact that Mr Nikolić held office as the Speaker of Parliament, even if it was only for four days, is scandalous."
"Given the difficulties and sensitivities of the situation, how can anyone think of having the leader of the extreme right as the Speaker of Parliament?"
"It is scandalous."
"This is not the way to conduct politics and take Serbia forward."
"That is something which repeatedly confirms that Serbia is actually pursuing a nationalist course."
"I hope that all the forces of the centre will reflect for a moment and realise that there has to be a clear dividing line between the nationalists on the one hand and the rest, whether they are now Conservative or Socialist, on the other."
"The centre is the only force which can take the country forward, provided that they are not tempted to dally with the nationalists."
"Yes, we need to do more about visa-free travel."
"A step towards visa facilitation has been taken, and now we should be moving towards visa-free travel so that young people can come to Europe and see what it is all about."
"That is what young Serbs need, and that is what Serbia needs as well."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, first I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kacin, for an excellent, thorough report."
"The report mentions the difficult problems which thwart relations between the EU and Serbia, but it also highlights many positive factors which have emerged in Serbia's development."
"I would like to stress the importance of natural relations in the development of EU-Serbian cooperation."
"It is important that young Serbian nationals should have more opportunities to travel abroad on student exchange and cultural programmes."
"There has been positive experience of this with many countries in the context, for example, of the Erasmus Mundus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes."
"Natural relations with Serbia will also be given a boost with the visa agreement that has been concluded."
"We must ensure that the agreement takes effect before the end of the year, at the same time as we speed up visa processing and develop support action to increase travel opportunities for young people and professionals in particular."
"Finally, I want to say that the European Agency for Reconstruction has also fulfilled its role in Serbia."
"Its work is now coming to a close and the Agency's tasks can be transferred to the Commission units, with the emphasis on support for administrative and judicial development."
"In this way, we can encourage Serbia and other countries in the region to enjoy closer relations with the European Union."
"(PL) The report refers to recent changes in Serbia."
"Much still remains to be done, however, notably in the area of cooperation between the Government and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia."
"Despite promises made, Radko Mladić has not been arrested and handed over to the Tribunal in The Hague."
"The lack of progress in this area of cooperation is cause for concern and impacts negatively on perception of the action taken by the Serb authorities to strengthen the rule of law."
"The new constitution and the provisions relating to the protection of human rights and the rights of national minorities, the security services, the judiciary and the army, and also the efforts to eliminate corruption, do represent movement in the right direction."
"There are certain shortcomings to the reforms, however, such as the failure to appoint a Constitutional Court which would act as the guardian of democracy."
"It is essential for the measures adopted and the commitments entered into by Serbia to be monitored."
"Despite the progress made, much still remains to be accomplished in Serbia."
"(NL) Mr President, Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, we are attempting today to underline the positive developments in Serbia, and let there be no misunderstanding about it, there is nothing wrong with that."
"It is important for the European Union that Serbia develops towards democracy and it is important that we, the European Union, acknowledge that process and, where possible, support it."
"It is the same endeavour being undertaken at present in other EU institutions, in particular in the Council."
"We must not overdo it, however, ladies and gentlemen."
"Even if Serbia does everything it is asked to do in this report, but at the same time it plays a negative and destructive role in the negotiations on the future of Kosovo, then that will of course have negative consequences for the pace of Serbia's overtures toward the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is how it should be."
"That is why I find it incomprehensible and not good that up to now the link - which I believe is a real link, everyone knows that - between the Serbian position in the negotiations on Kosovo and Serbia's route in the direction of Europe is not made."
"I am therefore appealing to fellow Members to support the amendment in which this link is made."
"There is a connection between the Serbian position on Kosovo and the pace and content of the negotiations between Serbia and the European Union."
"The refusal to make that link up to now is explained by the argument that we - the European Union - do not want to make things even more difficult for the democrats in Serbia, for President Tadić, and so we have to keep quiet on the difficult issues."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I disagree fundamentally with that assessment of the situation."
"I agree with the predecessor of the present Commissioner, Chris Patten, who recently wrote that it is a misapprehension if we believe that we are helping the democrats by being soft, by not being candid and honest to Serbia."
"By not being open and honest, we are strengthening Kostunica who can then say: if we take a hard line we can force the European Union to make concessions."
"That is not the way forward."
"Once again I beg you, be positive, but be honest and make things plain too."
"The citizens of the EU and Serbia are entitled to that."
"(EL) Mr President, the EU shares responsibility for the unjust and dirty war waged by NATO against Yugoslavia."
"It is jointly responsible for the murder of thousands of Yugoslavs; for the enormous destruction inflicted on the infrastructure, factories and the country as a whole, and for the use of enriched uranium."
"Those who should be arrested, tried and sentenced for war crimes are Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Javier Solana (the former NATO Secretary General) and the other leaders of the countries that attacked Yugoslavia."
"Unfortunately, nothing of the kind has happened."
"Yugoslavia has been dismantled; you are creating protectorates and you are now trying to annex Serbia."
"You are asking for a declaration of repentance from a people who did what is self-explanatory: they defended the independence of their country."
"You may receive such a declaration from the government, but the young people will not forget and will not forgive the crimes of ΝΑΤΟ and the EU."
"You are now continuing the same policy with the independence of Kosovo and the creation of a new protectorate."
"Among other things, the measures proposed in the report are an attempt to redeem slaughter and destruction by using money from the workers of Europe."
"The measures aim to present the murderers of the Yugoslav peoples as saviours in a bid to create favourable conditions for linking Serbia to the imperialist chariot, and for European capital to take over the country."
"The Communist Party of Greece condemns this report and believes that the interests of the Balkan peoples will be served if we do not forget, but struggle against the EU and the barbarity you are nurturing."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Kacin's solid wide-ranging report gives a balanced view of the socio-economic development of Serbia."
"The dark and bright sides are both presented: excellent growth figures against high unemployment, for instance; in concrete terms, 7.2% against over 20% for the past three years."
"Direct foreign investment is essential for Serbian development and that is exactly what is lacking at the moment."
"The causes are obvious."
"They can mainly be traced back to Belgrade's image problem."
"What frightens off foreign investors, more than anything, is protracted political insecurity - byword Kosovo - and also the marked slowing down in the pace of market reforms on the part of Belgrade."
"That brings me to a crucial question."
"Is Serbia standing in its own way?"
"The Kacin report opens with the proposition that the future of Serbia lies in the European Union; the European conditions en route to that are perfectly well-known to Belgrade, as is European commitment to cooperate on that route."
"In the end the Serbian authorities should themselves answer the pressing question: is Serbia standing in its own way?"
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr Kacin's report is excellent, a professional piece of work."
"One can tell that he was born in the region and knows it well."
"My comments are as follows:"
"1."
"The principle of values."
"It is vital that no one should be allowed to enter the European Union with the kind of legacy where not only is there a failure to investigate collective crimes and mass murders, but where it is not even permitted to remember them, to remember the dead."
"This has been a minimum human right, the right to human dignity, since Antigone."
"In a place where this point has not yet been reached and is not even being called for, we should not be surprised if radical groups are prowling the streets and gaining strength, or neo-fascists are on the march in Vojvodina."
"This must be resolved, because if we fail to do so, it is not only Serbia that we should be worried about, but also Europe."
"2."
"I think we should at least undertake what we ourselves have set out as regards this report."
"In other words, let us not weaken it with amendments, let us not censor the resolutions we have made or the points made in them, but cite them exactly as they are."
"The same goes for territorial arrangements, which Mr Kacin has quite rightly brought into his report from the Commission, because no one will understand what we want if we pointlessly water it down."
"3."
"We must help Serbia, and not just talk about doing so."
"After relaxing visa requirements, we need to abolish them altogether so that ordinary Serbs are able to enter Europe whenever they wish."
"Until then, there is no point in harping on about Serbia's European Union prospects, as we cannot take the third step before we take the first."
"The same goes for Serbia's membership of CEFTA, for implementation of the Association process, and its future within the WTO."
"My last remark is that we need a bottom-up society, and one that demands proportionality, both for representation of ethnic minorities in the public administration, which is vital, and for ensuring appropriate forms of autonomy."
"Lack of proportionality signifies a lack of trust, and if there is no trust we will not really be able to move forward towards new, long-desired cooperation in the Balkans. Thank you."
"(FR) Mr President, the Kacin report deals with Serbia, not Kosovo, and not with what will happen after December."
"It is also true to say that it does not link Serbia's reaction to the Kosovo issue to the promise of accession to the European Union."
"Mr Lagendijk is upset about this, while my Group welcomes it and takes the view that here Parliament can deny any political bargaining or double diplomacy."
"It is true that there is one question that is constantly raised, namely the International Criminal Tribunal and Serbia's cooperation with it."
"Now Mrs Del Ponte has just sounded the alarm bells, or at least something very like it, in referring to the intransigence being displayed and is using the European Union as a link with everything that affects human rights, in other words conditionality, and I believe she is not wrong."
"I do not believe, as Mr Lang does, that this is simply a matter of handing out good marks and bad marks."
"I take the view that the issue of nationalism, this culture of impunity, with four wanted criminals - and not small fry either - still running around free in Serbia, is intolerable."
"Furthermore, I would say that we know from experience that a country has everything to gain by recognising its past and acknowledging its crimes."
"We called on Croatia to make huge efforts and we asked Bosnia to do the same; and these are the very same efforts that enabled us to rebuild Europe after the Second World War."
"All this goes to the very heart of what we value most."
"It is not a matter of handing out points, it is the very core of our values and it is the key to reconciliation in the Balkans."
"Finally I would add, even though we are not discussing Kosovo, that the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic, who visited the European Parliament several weeks ago, reaffirmed to us that whatever happened about Kosovo his country had no intention of resorting to arms."
"I remember these words and, without linking this to the Kacin report, I hope that this appeal has reached the ears of his own people."
"(PL) Mr President, I have noted the negative attitude adopted by certain European countries towards Serbia over the years."
"Serbia is perceived as the country that is implementing Russia's policy for the Balkans."
"Another aspect has been largely overlooked, however."
"Serbia lies on one of the main routes for the expansion of Islam into Europe."
"Personally, I am in favour of maintaining the best possible relations with Turkey and other Muslim states, but it is not in Europe's interest to allow constant humiliation of a Christian country whilst favouring Muslim ones."
"This may have far-reaching consequences for our continent in the future."
"What the region concerned needs is stabilisation, not incitement to racial and religious tension."
"The ongoing democratisation of political life in Serbia must surely be welcomed by all."
"Our relations with Serbia should respect that nation's pride and national tradition."
"Only then will Serbia turn to the Union in preference to other powers, and stabilise the region at the same time."
"(DE) Mr President, the future of the former Yugoslav republic of Serbia lies in Europe."
"That applies to all the republics of the former Yugoslavia."
"As is the case for every potential candidate, there are conditions that apply to accession to this community of values, and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur not just for his report but also for making it clear in his speech what these conditions are."
"Unlimited cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is indeed a precondition for the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"I find it hard to stomach that war criminals such as Mladić and Karadžić still have so many sympathisers, not only among the general public but also among the police, the military and many public office-holders in Serbia: in other words, the very people with whom we will soon be negotiating Serbia's closer relations with the EU."
"Dealing with the past is not a formal condition for closer relations with the EU, but it would help the Serbs, their immediate neighbours and the EU as a whole."
"The Kosovo issue, too, must be viewed separately in formal terms, but I find this nationalist stonewalling very unhelpful."
"I also think it is wrong to purchase a Russian veto in the Security Council with generous sell-offs of key companies to Russian firms."
"At the end of the process - according to Belgrade's calculations - the EU is expected to provide compensation, in the form of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, for concessions which have not actually been made in the Kosovo issue."
"That will become apparent after 10 December."
"I therefore fully support Mr Lagendijk's position."
"The level of cooperation on the issue of Kosovo will thus be one of the factors which is either more helpful or more of a hindrance to Serbia's closer relations with the EU, and Belgrade should take note of that fact."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, last year Serbia went through some significant changes which I am convinced were also successfully negotiated."
"The difficult and painful process of dissolution of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro was successfully completed."
"Democratic parliamentary elections were held fairly and freely and a new pro-European government was established."
"Substantial and much needed economic growth followed."
"After a 13-month break, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations between the Serbian Government and the EU resumed."
"There is a realistic prospect that in the near future the signature of the SAA may take place."
"This would be a significant step on the path to Serbia's EU membership."
"As has already been mentioned today several times, the condition for this is Serbia's cooperation with the ICTY."
"I trust that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, during Carla del Ponte's visit to Belgrade, at least some of the obstacles will be overcome, such as, for example, full access to archive documents in ministerial departments."
"In my short contribution today I will not make any comments on Kosovo as we are discussing the report on Serbia."
"What I would like to do, however, is to commend Serbia for its responsible and proactive approach and its collaboration in the context of regional initiatives such as the Stability Pact and CEFTA (Central European Free Trade Agreement)."
"This collaboration is evidence of Serbia's clear interest in developing and sustaining good relationships with its regional neighbours."
"(PL) Mr President, Serbia is a European country that has made considerable progress towards integration into the European Union over the last few years."
"One could of course mention a number of problems that may not actually be greater in Serbia than they are in Albania or in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although it seems we are prepared to turn a blind eye in the case of the latter two countries."
"I believe we should create a system of incentives for Serbia to encourage it to try even harder to meet European standards. Nevertheless, the goal, namely the European Union, should be clearly visible."
"There is certainly a point in what Mr Gahler said about relations between Russia and Serbia."
"It should be made very clear to Serbia, however, that its place is within the European Union and that it will be easier for us to work with Serbia if it is inside the Union rather than if it remains outside."
"That much seems obvious to me."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Serbian authorities must show greater commitment to cooperating with the Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, so as to ensure that the war criminals are caught."
"We all agree that this is a precondition for the safety of the entire Balkan area and for the entire European Union, as well as a legal and moral obligation."
"We must also see to it that the Serbian Government renews its commitment to a climate of peaceful coexistence among all the ethnic groups living in the land."
"The Ministry of the Interior has already been undertaking initiatives to prevent and control inter-ethnic incidents in Vojvodina since 2004, but the participation of minorities in social life and their proper institutional representation must be promoted."
"We are all in favour of an immediate settlement on the status of Kosovo this December. Nevertheless, many problems will remain unresolved, beginning with the need to clamp down on Albanian organised crime which is destabilising the whole geographical area, including the areas bordering on Macedonia and Albania, thus greatly endangering the overall safety of the Balkans as a whole."
"Kosovo must not be abandoned to its own devices. We must demand that the safety of the entire Balkan area be secured by means of a continued European Union presence."
"From this point of view, accelerated entry into the EU by Serbia would stabilise the area, not least with respect to illegal trafficking in every field possible and imaginable: trafficking is rife throughout the Balkans, beginning with the environmental sector."
"We must call on Serbia to act quickly to introduce a proper environmental policy in respect of energy, as well as water treatment and an integrated waste cycle, so as to prevent organised crime from getting its hands on this sector too."
"(HU) Mr President, the report by Mr Kacin marks a turning point in the attitude of the European Parliament."
"For a very long time, the European Parliament one-sidedly rewarded the Albanians and punished the Serbs in every statement it made on Kosovo."
"Here at last we have a credible, objective picture of Serbia, and the reason why this is crucial is because we must ensure that Serbia is no longer given the role of punchbag or scapegoat."
"This does not mean, however, that the Serbs will not some day have to come to terms with the crimes of the Milošević era, just as the Kosovo Albanians, and every people, must come to terms with their historical crimes."
"It is good and proper that we are drawing Serbia closer to the European Union, and I agree that visa facilitation is not enough; we should establish a visa-free regime for Serbia's citizens, and it is at least as important to speed up the process of granting Serbia candidate status."
"Here we have Kosovo, which presents a huge risk; according to Council of Europe intelligence estimates, around 100 000 refugees, Serb refugees, are expected to leave Kosovo, and it will be largely Vojvodina that has to deal with this situation."
"Thanks are due for the fact that Mr Kacin's proposed amendments give an objective picture of the inter-ethnic processes in Vojvodina, of the atrocities that still persist, and of the need to legislate on the legal status of the National Councils, the need for proportional representation of minorities in the police force and the judicial system, and the need to maintain minority radio broadcasting and funding for it."
"All in all, I congratulate Mr Kacin: drawing Serbia closer to the European Union is an important step."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Madam President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this report, and believe that the version adopted by the Commission is a particularly good and balanced one."
"Serbia's prospects for European Union membership are especially important for Hungary."
"We have a fundamental interest in seeing our neighbour admitted into this Community as soon as possible."
"This represents the only alternative for reconciliation as opposed to inter-ethnic strife, war, and discrimination against people or humiliating them because their mother tongue or customs happen to be different."
"Obviously, we are not indifferent to the fate of Serbia's Hungarian ethnic minority, and indeed we have made an effort to keep the issue of Vojvodina on the European agenda."
"Something that is very important, and I am glad to see that it is in the report, is to draw attention to the need to maintain the multi-ethnic character of Vojvodina that has evolved over many centuries."
"The basis for this multi-ethnicity is the coexistence of different ethnic groups, the kind of coexistence that is based not on silence and humiliation, but on genuine equality before the law and equal opportunities."
"At present, unfortunately, this is not part of day-to-day reality there."
"I believe it is particularly important to maintain the region's ethnic balance and its special characteristics, and, in my opinion, resettling Serb refugees in this region would jeopardise chances of maintaining this precarious balance and could exacerbate inter-ethnic conflict."
"We have already seen a good many ugly examples of such conflict in the recent past."
"In this connection I would draw your attention, for example, to a case that remains unresolved to this day: the fate of the ethnic Hungarian youths who were given a disproportionately severe sentence in a clear-cut example of ethnic discrimination in Temerin."
"All in all, therefore, the Balkans need the European Union, because the spirit, principles and institutional system of the European Union, and the fact that it is consistent - and I lay particular emphasis on the latter - will be able to bring about a life that is liveable. Thank you very much."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have naturally followed this debate with great interest and I have of course taken note of the suggestions and concerns that many Members have voiced."
"As it happens, the result of this debate seems clear to me: it points to the fact that only by giving Serbia a truly European perspective can peace, stability and progress be achieved in that country, and also stability in the whole Western Balkans region."
"This is absolutely accepted as the Council has repeatedly asserted that the future of Serbia naturally lies in its future membership of the European Union."
"We all know that this plan cannot be without conditions."
"There must of course be conditions which will and must relate to the internal political process within Serbia itself, to respect for democratic values and to respect for those values specific to the rule of law."
"However, these conditions also of course relate to Serbia's essential cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal."
"Much has been done by Serbia in this respect to cooperate with the Tribunal."
"We all know that other actions and steps will have to be taken."
"However, please allow me to express a note of confidence and encouragement that the Serbian authorities will be able, by the end of this process, to take the necessary steps so that this cooperation becomes full cooperation."
"We in the European Union must help Serbia."
"We believe it would be a strategic error to leave Serbia and its people in a kind of limbo without any direction, perspective or plan."
"This is a strategic error that we must not commit and, to this end, we must do everything we can to prevent it."
"I must also of course welcome the progress made in relation to the possibility of the free movement of Serbian nationals within the European space."
"We must continue along this road."
"Something has been done and this and the other initiatives that we are taking must be duly applauded."
"We must also offer future prospects to the youth of Serbia as it is naturally through and with them that a democratic Serbia can be built which fully shares our values and principles and which aspires to be an integral part of the European Union."
"Commissioner. - (FI) Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank everyone for an objective and responsible debate, as well as the rapporteur for a very factual report."
"Judging from the discussion, there is broad consensus in Parliament and the Union as a whole that Serbia's future is in the European Union and that the European Union's door will be open to Serbia when the country meets the conditions, and that its government has the means to take Serbia into Europe."
"The majority of Serbian citizens support and endorse this development."
"The Serbian government is now playing the role very much of a guard: it has the keys in its hands."
"I hope that the Serbian government will now use its keys and implement the will of the Serbian people - the will of the Serbs to turn towards the European Union."
"You may be sure that we shall take note of the views expressed in the report, and that we will also include them in our own progress report."
"(EL) The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 25 October 2007."
"EU-Africa relations (debate)"
"(EL) The next item is the report [2007/2002(ΙΝΙ)] (Α6-0375/2007) by Mrs Martens, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the state of play of EU-Africa relations."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the report on the state of play of relations between the European Union and Africa."
"This sets out a shared vision on the part of Africa and Europe on future cooperation with a view to promoting development in Africa and combating poverty."
"The strategy must amount to more than just defending present policy."
"It is about a vision, based on shared values and principles, on mutual respect, that is geared to the well-being of people."
"Africa and Europe have a long shared history, but relations between them really have changed: it can no longer be one-way traffic."
"Now it is about an equal partnership to tackle together problems that are affecting both continents, such as security, trade, migration and climate change."
"The European Union produced a European strategy for Africa in 2005."
"I was also the rapporteur on that occasion."
"In our view that strategy had two important shortcomings."
"It was a strategy that was too much for Africa, but without involving Africa, and Parliament and civil society were not sufficiently involved in the development of this strategy."
"I am pleased that we are now talking about a Joint EU-Africa Strategy and that Parliament and civil society will be more involved this time."
"This cooperation augurs very well for the future."
"Madam President, this strategy should provide us with the structure and direction for joint action in the future."
"The fight against poverty and the Millennium Development Goals must continue to occupy centre stage."
"Although the most recent MDG figures permit a degree of optimism, in sub-Saharan Africa 41.1% of people still live on 1 dollar a day."
"This situation cannot be improved with development aid alone."
"It is also necessary to foster economic growth."
"The economic partnership agreements being negotiated at the moment could be a good instrument for this, provided - and I stress this point - they have sustainable development at their core and provided they are more than just European trade agreements."
"I would very much like to hear from the Commissioner about the situation regarding the possible postponement of the deadline of 1 January 2008."
"Madam President, African governments are, of course, primarily responsible for development in their own countries."
"They have become more independent, both politically and economically."
"African development is in full swing, not least through the emergence on the scene of new institutions, such as NEPAD (New Partnership for Africa's Development) and the African Peer Review Mechanism."
"It is a long time since Europe was the sole and exclusive partner for financial and political support."
"Other countries are beginning to exert their own influence in and on Africa in a very emphatic way: look at China, for example."
"We can no longer take our relationship with Africa for granted."
"Madam President, the report highlights three priority policy areas: peace and security, good governance, and economic growth and investment in people."
"As far as European policy areas are concerned, the report draws attention to the importance of greater coherence between development activities on the one hand and other policy areas on the other hand, such as trade, agriculture and migration."
"Only if Europe can make more coherent, better coordinated use of its support and improve its financial accounting can the development policy of the European Union become more effective and more efficient."
"Peace and security are a grave problem in Africa."
"The report emphasises the importance of an integrated approach to tackling conflict situations."
"The top priority in this area should be our responsibility to protect people and to make a contribution to preventing and resolving conflicts, as well as reconstruction."
"Obviously good governance, a functioning rule of law and stable democracy are conditions for stability and development."
"Capacity building in these areas is vitally important. We support the Commission's ambitions in this area."
"Madam President, the second EU-Africa Summit is to take place in Lisbon in December after a gap of seven years."
"The Joint EU-Africa Strategy and the Action Plan will be decided on there."
"There is a great deal at stake and it is in all our interests that this summit is a success."
"Moreover, although the situation in Zimbabwe is a cause for very grave concern, we should remember that this is an EU-Africa summit and not an EU-Zimbabwe summit, that it is about a people-centred approach and not a president-centred partnership."
"It is good that the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament will get the opportunity at the summit to articulate the parliamentary view on the joint strategy."
"The delegations from the Pan-African Parliament and our Parliament met last week to prepare a joint declaration."
"I hope that our Presidents will be able to present this to the heads of government at the summit."
"Madam President, of course there is a great deal more to say on this but my time is up, I see, and so I will leave it at that, but not without first thanking my colleagues and the Commission for a very fruitful cooperation."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur, Europe, Africa and the world have changed a great deal in the last decade."
"Europe is now a block of 27 Member States bringing together at times extremely diverse foreign policy priorities and approaches."
"Although it is not fair to say that the African continent has been neglected, given the volume of public development aid that Europe makes available to this continent, we can, however, talk about a strategic vacuum in the relationship between Europe and Africa."
"In recent years the negative consequences of this vacuum have become more apparent."
"The European Union and Member States now recognise the need to bring relations with Africa onto a new level, with the second EU-Africa Summit being the right moment to clearly vocalise this desire."
"There are various reasons justifying this new recognition of the importance of relations between the European Union and Africa: the widespread realisation that all the global challenges such as peace and security or international trade require concerted action on the part of the international community, thus justifying the emergence of new forms of cooperation; the search for answers to problems affecting both Europe and Africa, particularly the effects of climate change; the management of energy resources or migration flows; the desire of Africa to collectively tackle common problems, and the need to adapt to specific geopolitical changes in the international context."
"This new relationship between the EU and Africa is set out in the documents that we hope will be adopted during the December summit: the Joint EU-Africa Strategy, its First Action Plan and, we hope, the Lisbon Declaration."
"These documents reflect the specific nature of the relationship between Europe and Africa."
"They set out an approach which, on the one hand, favours multilateral channels and, on the other, aims to deal with the various aspects of our relationship in a more integrated manner."
"This approach constitutes the difference that the EU can point to, particularly in comparison with other international actors."
"Africa's recognition as a strategic world partner is also reflected in the method used to prepare for both the summit and the documents to be adopted."
"While the EU-Africa strategy adopted in 2005 is an EU document which is only binding on the Union, the new strategy - for the first time a joint strategy - and the action plan are the result of joint work with our African partners."
"From the beginning the summit documents have been prepared by a joint group of experts and we hope that they will be endorsed at the EU-Africa Ministerial Troika Meeting to be held on 31 October, in a process that has also involved non-governmental actors and civil societies, both African and European."
"The joint strategy and the first action plan are therefore the result of joint work."
"As a result, their current wording reflects and responds to many of the concerns and suggestions contained in the report of Mrs Martens, a report which is clearly very complete and comprehensive."
"The partnerships between the European Union and Africa identified both in the joint strategy and in the draft action plan must cover subjects of common interest."
"Their fundamental criteria must be to add value to the cooperation and political dialogue that currently exist and, in our view, to ensure a positive impact on the everyday lives of European and African citizens."
"The partnerships that we want to build will also seek to ensure a balance between the commitments made by both parties, which will alter the unilateral and assistance-based logic of the relationship between the EU and the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries."
"Experience has also shown that political commitments require implementation and monitoring mechanisms so that they translate into something more than just good intentions."
"Between summits, in parallel with the regular meetings between the two Commissions and the Ministerial Troika, the possibility now exists of complementary sectoral ministerial meetings whenever appropriate."
"However, a true change in the relationship between the EU and Africa can only come about if the process is also effectively taken on board by various other actors."
"In this respect, we want to establish informal joint groups of experts for the implementation of each of the partnerships."
"These will be open to participation by a large number of stakeholders: European and African parliaments, local authorities, European and African civil society, African sub-regional organisations, research institutes, specialised international organisations and institutes, and the private sector."
"At the same time, cooperation and dialogue between the Pan-African Parliament and this House will be extended and these institutions will also act as channels for the implementation of the joint strategy and action plan."
"Although such profound changes cannot occur instantly, we are at a crossroads for change in the relations between the two continents."
"The challenge facing us is to take full advantage of this opportunity, by starting to implement this new strategic vision for EU-African dialogue."
"It is with this goal in mind that we plan to hold, with confidence and an awareness that what we are doing must be done, the next EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate and thank Mrs Martens for her most excellent report, which raises various issues and offers a number of useful leads, and which certainly provides us with a source of inspiration as Parliament's contribution to what is in fact an extremely important subject, and one that calls for a new approach in the area of EU-Africa relations."
"As you all know, 2007 will be a special year for the future of relations between Europe and Africa."
"Five years after the report on the Lisbon Summit of 2003, and no less than seven years after the first Africa-Europe Summit that was held in Cairo in 2000, it seems to me that we urgently need to redefine this relationship on a new basis."
"Africa has changed profoundly in recent years and has acquired a continental institutional architecture that resembles our own in many respects."
"The new institution that is the African Union now needs to be strengthened and consolidated."
"This institution has developed ambitious continental policies in key areas such as socio-economic development, peace and security, and indeed good governance too, and all these elements clearly deserve our support and recognition."
"Africa has now undeniably taken on an international dimension."
"Here I am thinking of the diverse nature of its relations with the international community, as mentioned by Mrs Martens, and I am thinking about the new role that China is playing, for example, and its influence on investment projects in that continent."
"I am also thinking, of course, of the global challenges that Africa, like all the other world players, has to face, namely climate change, energy supply, reform of multilateral institutions, the risk of pandemics, emigration and so on, and it is evident that Africa must make itself heard, must bring its influence to bear and, above all, must assert its rights."
"For after all, these global challenges that I have just listed are ours too."
"All these challenges and issues are common to us both and, what is more, they serve to highlight the interdependence that exists between Europe and Africa."
"For we share the same destiny."
"A joint strategy of a more political nature may make a difference to Africa and indeed to Europe too, and it has to be said to the rest of the world. The two continents therefore urgently need to establish a new framework and acquire a new set of instruments in order to place the EU-AU dialogue on a much higher level."
"The Joint EU-Africa Strategy that we have developed in recent months with our African partners should provide this framework."
"However, this does not mean that we turn our backs on the traditional relationship of solidarity. Instead we need to take a qualitative leap that will usher EU-Africa relations into a new era, one that brings together two partners with equal rights and equal responsibilities."
"These are the concerns that have been very well documented in the report and I can only support the significant new ideas that Parliament has put forward for monitoring and supporting the implementation of this strategy and the action plans that will follow from it."
"In this regard I view the setting up of a joint EP/PAP (Pan-African Parliament) delegation as crucial for completing the institutional architecture that will have to be put in place."
"To this I would add the regular meetings that will have to be held between the Presidents of these two institutions, together with the joint organisation of hearings and the preparation, also on a joint basis, of political reports detailing the progress that has been achieved."
"All this will be essential to maintain the momentum of the process and to give it the political vigour that it will need to succeed."
"We are aware that this approach also calls for solid and stable institutions to be set up by the African Union, bodies that will be capable of acting and interacting with our own."
"It is clearly with this in mind that we shall continue to support the African Union as it transforms and strengthens its institutions."
"As an early confirmation of this commitment I am pleased to be able to announce that the first action plan put forward by the Pan-African Parliament will be funded to the tune of EUR 275 000 from the institutional support programme, which is currently financed by the ninth European Development Fund."
"This was one of the particular concerns that was expressed to me by Chairman Borrell."
"I hope that this initial funding will allow the Pan-African Parliament to participate fully in the initiative you have taken towards organising a joint parliamentary event in advance of the Lisbon Summit in December, as the results of your work can then be presented to the heads of state at the summit."
"Finally, as I have said on a number of occasions, the involvement and commitment of the civilian populations of our two continents and of the elected assemblies that represent them constitute an essential factor in the success of an effective process of dialogue and cooperation between Europe and Africa."
"Perhaps we sometimes tend to forget, but we are speaking here about the common destiny of 1.5 billion human beings and it is they who are the most important actors in the partnership that we are now setting up."
"Mrs Martens, I am completely in agreement with the need for coordination; this is why we proposed the code of conduct, which should provide for a better division of labour between the different donors, which means greater harmony."
"I believe that we have been consistent in this regard because, as you know, in the tenth European Development Fund we have provided a special financial envelope for governance, which is one of the aspects, and clearly a very important one at that, of the political dialogue that we intend to establish with our African partners."
"As far as the EPAs (Economic Partnership Agreements) are concerned, I have no doubt that I will have to respond to questions on this subject after your interventions. I shall therefore save my reply for the interventions, so as not to say too much at the moment and therefore take up too much time."
"My last reference is to something that the President-in-Office of the Council also highlighted: there is no denying the importance of the EU-Africa Summit."
"It is now time to hold such an event because the momentum is there, and it is for a change in objectives."
"In some respects it is for a change in the nature of the relations between our two continents."
"We need to leave behind the traditional - we might even say banal - relationship, this fairly archaic partnership of beneficiary and donor, or donor and beneficiary, and move on to a much more political association involving two partners with equal rights and responsibilities."
"In my view this is clearly much more important."
"So that is it for now, and I am sure that I will be returning to some of these points when you have had the opportunity to put questions of a more specific nature to me."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which I represent as draftsman, is in favour of all these efforts."
"It is concerned about Africa and it supports everything that has been said. It only wants to know whether we are really bold enough for the task."
"What we cannot write, although our report suggests it and indeed I am able to say it, is that when it comes to Africa there is a lot of politically correct and asphyxiating hypocrisy that has to be got rid of before we can really achieve our objectives."
"As regards enabling Africa to develop by allowing its products access to our markets, it must be remembered that some forty African countries have nothing whatsoever to export."
"This slogan is quite simply dishonest."
"Not a single African country is self-sufficient in foodstuffs."
"They have to import to eat, while exports from here and from Brazil are killing off the local subsistence agriculture."
"We have to help Africa to protect itself. This is the message that we have repeated in the report."
"Of course corruption acts as a destructive blight on Africa."
"Yet this problem is endemic in extremely poor countries."
"We therefore need to start with the big fish and focus on them. This means the usual well-known suspects, even if they are ministers, and those on our own side who engage in bribery."
"Small-scale corruption will only disappear with economic development."
"Let us not start accusing them of the very same things we were doing a few centuries ago, for our expansion and development too were based on corruption."
"Finally, a dictatorship cannot become a democracy even with the help of trade and foreign aid."
"However, it can become an enlightened despotism."
"Putting an end to torture and abduction, allowing freedom of expression and establishing the independence of the courts and their control over the police all have to take priority over the pluralist elections that are organised simply to please the West, while all the time they are abducting people and murdering journalists and election candidates."
"The conditions that we impose should take account of these factors."
"There is still much to be said on this subject."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Martens has prepared an excellent report that was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Development."
"For the first time ever Africa and Europe are slowly beginning to work in partnership and establish a common approach to the development of democracy, support for development and strengthening peace and security across the African continent."
"I share the hope expressed by the representatives of the Council and the Commission that this report will prove a good source of inspiration in the run-up to the Lisbon EU-Africa Summit."
"Many of the provisions in the report, and more especially their implementation, will be of crucial importance to the development of relations between Europe and Africa."
"It will be difficult to make progress in our mutual relations without improving the consistency of various Union policies, such as the trade, development, environmental protection, agriculture and migration policies."
"It is also important to honour the decisions and commitments made in the past."
"In 2005 the Council of the European Union determined that at least 50% more resources for development aid would be allocated to African countries."
"In my own country, Poland, development aid has increased significantly in recent years."
"The difficulty is that last year barely 1.4% of all Polish bilateral aid was allocated to sub-Saharan Africa."
"The fact that certain Member States have been slow to ratify the revised Cotonou Agreement and the internal agreement regarding the 10th European Development Fund is also cause for concern."
"As things stand at present, only half the Member States of the Union have ratified the Partnership Agreement with the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries due to enter into force on 1 January 2008."
"If full ratification does not take place, it will be very difficult to carry forward the African programmes and the plans for supporting Africa will remain on the drawing board."
"I therefore urge Members of this House to put pressure on their national parliaments and governments to ensure the revised Cotonou Agreement is ratified."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has always strongly supported the principle that those people directly affected should have control over development strategies, as this means that their priorities are really taken into account."
"In this report we have therefore naturally emphasised that national parliaments and civil society need to be involved in the new EU-Africa strategy."
"This involvement has to a large extent been missing from the preparations that are currently being made for this new strategy, which seeks to open up a new form of strategic partnership."
"We urgently need to put this right."
"In this context we very much welcome the initiative by the Portuguese Presidency to invite delegations from the European and Pan-African Parliaments to attend the December summit in Lisbon."
"Let us hope that this is not just a symbolic gesture."
"We have also insisted - and Mrs Martens mentioned this just now - that there must be real coherence between the different European policies."
"This means that the measures adopted as part of our policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and immigration, for example, have to take special account of any repercussions there may be for development in the countries of the South and in Africa in particular."
"We have also recalled that the European Union promised to do everything possible to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to take all necessary steps to eradicate poverty."
"With this in mind we are insisting that the new EU-Africa strategy should clearly state its commitments and specify the concrete measures needed to ensure that they are honoured as far as Africa is concerned."
"As regards the Economic Partnership Agreements our position is quite clear: we are in no way opposed, either ideologically or on any other basis, to the signing of agreements sanctioning the terms of a partnership that would be beneficial to Europeans and to the peoples of the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries alike."
"However, we will resolutely oppose any agreement that, once signed, puts the peoples of Africa, in particular, in a position that is less favourable than the one they know today."
"This is the aim of the amendment that we have tabled."
"Finally, I would like to point out that, as things stand at present, we still do not know the wording that is to be put forward at the next Lisbon Summit."
"You informed us that the document in question was being drafted."
"We shall therefore pay very close attention to the manner in which the recommendations we have made in our report are taken into account in the drafting of this document and shall naturally reserve the right to react accordingly as soon as the text is made known to us."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Maria Martens's report contains a number of interesting recommendations, though I have to admit that my Group has a bit of a problem with the rather negative undertone and the lack of a clear, coherent vision for the future in the report."
"Seven years after the first summit in Cairo, the Portuguese Presidency together with the Commission is trying to draw up a new EU-Africa strategy in an - I really do think - honest attempt to divest themselves of the old model of donors and beneficiaries."
"The fact that this summit is taking place is extremely important, and not only for negative reasons, not only out of an anxious reaction to the growing influence of China."
"On the contrary, the growing realisation on both sides that Europe and Africa are no longer each other's exclusive preferential partners creates a unique opportunity to develop a totally new, more balanced relationship."
"At first sight the water between Europe and Africa does not look all that deep."
"It is essential for Africa that each new partnership should get away from the traditional aid dependency and the culture of charity and conditionality."
"Calls for more industrialisation, more development of the private sector and more investment in the knowledge economy are getting louder and louder."
"Awareness is also growing in Africa, fortunately, that people have to be responsible for solving their own problems in the first instance."
"Europe should now make clear how it will support these promising developments, without falling into the trap of paternalism and interference."
"Any future partnership between the EU and Africa will inevitably have to be based on the principle of mutual accountability."
"In that sense, an unconditional abolition of agricultural subsidies could, more than any other gesture, strengthen the credibility of the EU among its African friends."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for their intervention but also in particular our rapporteur, Ms Martens, for her work on this issue, because the reality is that we are dealing with a new partnership, a new arrangement between the European Union and Africa."
"I congratulate the Council for coming forward with the EU-Africa Summit in December and I would hope that the summit will not rest on whether or not one single person attends that summit."
"There is too much at stake with regard to the relationship between Europe and Africa to be determined by whether or not Robert Mugabe will be there."
"We all know and criticise the actions of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe."
"We all defend the rights of democratic institutions and democratic movements within Zimbabwe and we all call for the protection of those democratic rights, but that should not hinder the proper development and the proper work that must go on between the European Union and Africa as a whole."
"The issues with regard to governance, the issues with regard to development aid and, in particular, the issues with regard to free trade are vitally important for future developments of Africa."
"When we speak about development, the European Union is the largest donor of aid in the world."
"Ireland, my own country, per capita is the sixth largest donor of aid in the world."
"But that should not be about giving aid to get something back."
"That should be about giving people the freedom to free themselves, to trade out of difficulties, to create education, health and infrastructure to ensure they will no longer rely on or be dependent on aid in the future."
"There are issues with regard to China's involvement because China does not give the same credence to governance, lack of corruption, openness and transparency that Europe does. We should take cognisance of the influence that China has in that developing world."
"Thank you very much, Madam President, for your licence."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, in spite of stated intentions we cannot really say that any new elements have been introduced to the debates that have been taking place in recent months on the partnership between the European Union and Africa."
"Of course peace and the rule of law must be absolute priorities; the EU is now playing an increasing role in this respect and this is only to be welcomed."
"We also have to ensure that the support provided for the organisation of elections, for example, is subjected to real care and scrutiny so that the communities concerned see the practical benefits that democracy can bring to their everyday lives."
"As far as the other measures are concerned I would say that all in all the European Union's proposals are fairly typical, lying somewhere between promoting good governance and free trade, with the accent on economic development and the provision of health care."
"However, while there are burning issues to be dealt with, these EU-Africa strategies, in our opinion, fail to deal with two key problems."
"Firstly there is food security, which has to be seen in the context of rising prices for basic foodstuffs, especially cereals, and the upsurge in biofuels, along with the need to protect and develop agriculture, although the next European Development Fund - like most of the governments in Africa - has only allocated a small percentage of its budget to this objective."
"Even the World Bank recently stressed that a rethink was needed in this area, and that is saying something."
"The question of food provision has now become absolutely crucial, as has the future of small farmers who are all too often neglected by development aid policies."
"The second key aspect is that Africa, as you know, is an immense reservoir of natural resources that the African people, unfortunately, are unable to profit from, even though the price of these commodities has risen enormously."
"All the major economic powers, along with emerging nations like China, are rushing to get their hands on these resources which are becoming increasingly rare."
"This latter-day gold rush, this hunger for materials, is now having extremely brutal social and environmental repercussions and is continuing to fuel wars and corruption."
"In the light of all this the European Union is talking in theoretical, even angelic tones, while all the time it too is engaged in exploiting Africa's natural resources."
"How then do we rationalise, manage and share access to these reserves in such a way that the communities concerned really derive benefit from them without seeing their environment vandalised?"
"This is a major question and one that the EU-Africa strategy needs to take more seriously, for it will be imposed on us in any case, given the speed of events in this sector."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Martens, especially for the way in which we were able to work together in committee, for her attentiveness and also for the divergences that emerged, the differences between us; but I think the outcome, apart from a few points, is a very significant one."
"EU-Africa relations have come a long way since the Cairo Declaration of 2000."
"Much has changed in Africa, a continent that is full of diversity and wracked by war."
"Progress has been made with the formation of the African Union, the policy of unity in diversity."
"The Pan-African Parliament has adopted the motto 'one Africa, one voice'. Social movements in Africa are vibrant and calling for what Mr Öger was referring to just now."
"They are vibrant and forming themselves into networks, and they had a very high profile at the Nairobi Social Forum."
"There has also been real progress in the formulation not of a European policy on Africa but a joint African and European policy of partnership."
"The meetings between the Pan-African Parliament and the European Parliament, and their presence at the Lisbon Summit, are putting into practice what we said in the document was lacking, namely the role of this House."
"We are not only demanding a role but also to perform it in practice, and I think the assistance from Louis Michel has been extremely important, obviously in addition to that of the Portuguese Presidency."
"Nonetheless, our differences of opinion are clear."
"The various aspects of the strategy are important, but we must carry them forward with coherent policies, and I am referring here to arms sales and trade."
"We must therefore proceed along this road, in the knowledge that the road is strewn with obstacles."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, education is the bridge from misery to hope."
"It is a tool for daily life in modern society."
"It is the bulwark against poverty and the building block of development."
"Thus Kofi Annan described the strategy in the Millennium Goals, which are similar to those in the EU development strategy for Africa."
"It places education alongside trade as key to the development of the continent."
"Despite this, the EU is set to join wealthy nations like the USA, Australia, Canada and New Zealand in systematically exporting the skilled and educated from Africa and Asia."
"Commissioner Frattini announced last month that, to ensure Europe will get 'the migrants its economy needs', over the next 20 years the EU would import 20 million skilled workers from these continents through the blue card system, similar to the American Green Card."
"Though having a steady supply of skilled workers to fill in the gaps left by our ageing workforce will have benefits for us, this kind of braindraining will be devastating for the poor and underdeveloped countries of Africa."
"Europe is also engaged in asset-stripping among Africa's poor."
"Children are our countries' future, yet EU development funds are routinely tied to population control programmes aiming at eliminating future Africans."
"The EU Green Paper on demography clearly states that, without population growth, there will be no economic growth."
"Africa is now the only continent in the world with a birth rate above replacement."
"If we keep our Millennium Goals and if we keep our promises, Africa will emerge in this century as a world leader."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, no one can deny that this report describes in great detail the many problems of the African continent, and the various challenges for the partnership between the European Union and Africa."
"However, although I have the utmost confidence in the rapporteur's expertise in the field of development policy, I still think that this report fails to put sufficient emphasis on the fundamental cause of Africa's problems and does not come up with answers to some very basic challenges."
"It may not be politically correct to say so but that is the way it is."
"Contrary to what this report claims, Africa and the European Union do not currently share the same way of thinking about more democracy, good governance and human rights."
"The main cause of the poverty, the hunger, the lack of security and the socio-economic problems plaguing the continent - and which are rightly listed in this report - is in fact the very bad and corrupt regimes which make no effort at all to observe good governance, democracy and human rights."
"No one, for instance, disputes any more that Robert Mugabe is a criminal who has brought his country to its knees and who terrorises his own population."
"What though do the developing countries of southern Africa have to say?"
"That the elections were conducted properly and that western countries should mind their own business."
"I really do have my doubts about the promises made by these same leaders on good governance."
"This report rightly looks at peace and security."
"In Africa, with its innumerable undemocratic regimes, spending on weapons always far outstrips the massive amount of development aid that goes to those countries, according to Oxfam."
"All of these problems come back, therefore, to the same cause."
"Finally, I have to say that I do not agree with the section on immigration, because anyone who thinks that the concept of circular migration can put a stop to the brain drain from Africa and the pressure of immigration on Europe is, I fear, seriously deluding themselves as far as this is concerned."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur for her sound and comprehensive report."
"There is a broad consensus on the general principles here in the House."
"The EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December cannot come too soon."
"I welcome the fact that we will be agreeing a joint strategy."
"The European Parliament's position on the special case of Mr Mugabe has been known for years."
"However, this gentleman must not become a stumbling block to a new chapter in European-African relations."
"I believe there are enough European heads of government who have a clear and unequivocal message for that gentleman."
"That is why he needs to be present and endure the message that will be delivered."
"As Chairman of the delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament, may I express some specific parliamentary wishes for the future cooperation which we agreed last week in Midrand."
"Africa's parliaments have tended to be neglected institutions."
"They have an important constitutional role on paper but their own governments and, indeed, donors tend not to take them very seriously."
"Yet with proper resources and after successful and comprehensive capacity-building for Members and staff in the parliamentary administrations, committees and groups, these parliaments have the potential to perform their true role of exercising proper political scrutiny of the executive."
"The irresistible appeal of this scenario is also that we would thus have scrutinising bodies at local level with democratic legitimacy, and when problems arise, their criticisms would be more likely to be accepted than those of foreign donors."
"I therefore urge the Commission to incorporate parliamentary capacity-building on a targeted basis into its country programmes, so that in a few years time, we can genuinely see that African politics have become much more responsive, in practice, to the public's needs, also thanks to the involvement of the national parliaments."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to compliment Mrs Martens on her work and acknowledge the political will of the EU and the African Union to build a joint strategy comprising numerous subjects of interest to both communities: from security to the environment, from migration to development and the promotion of human rights and democracy."
"In order for this strategy to be truly effective, the EU must build this partnership as of now, properly involving civil society and local parliaments. The EU must promote tangible, incisive action to safeguard human rights, freedom of expression and association and the principle of democracy, so that economic and social development on the African continent can be truly sustainable and involve all strata of African society."
"Furthermore, I would echo other colleagues in calling for the strongest possible commitment from the EU to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, combating AIDS - which is decimating the working population - and elaborating European policies that are genuinely consistent with the spirit of development cooperation, above all in the context of international trade."
"(LT) I would like to congratulate Mrs Martens on her report on the state of play of EU-Africa relations and for the proposed measures for improving these relations."
"It is a shame that Africa is still the poorest continent of the world."
"Despite the international aid granted by the EU and other countries, the poverty level has not been reduced; in fact it has increased."
"The Millennium Goals still need to be achieved."
"This is happening in Africa, the continent of the world richest in natural resources."
"The main reason for this is because raw materials are exported at the lowest prices, while high prices are paid for finished products."
"The situation could be transformed through the development of the processing industry, small- and medium-sized enterprises, the introduction of new work places and the encouragement of regional cooperation."
"There is no doubt, as pointed out in the report and highlighted continuously by the European Parliament, that education remains one of the key factors in the development of Africa's independent economy."
"On the subject of the future of Africa, I would like to mention the military conflicts that continue to plague certain areas, such as Sudan, for years on end."
"On the one hand, this situation spells insecurity for both local and foreign investors."
"On the other hand, some countries exploit the conflicts for the purpose of increasing the production of raw materials under advantageous conditions."
"The EU and the international community should put more effort into resolving the military conflicts in Africa."
"This would boost the efficiency of the implementation of the Development Cooperation Programme."
"(DE) Madam President, a very important factor in African development policy is trade, and trade, if it is used properly, can of course help to reduce poverty and it can also help to improve health care in Africa."
"It can help improve education and it can help eliminate illiteracy."
"However, it cannot do so in the way the Commission sees it."
"I am very pleased that - either because common sense has prevailed, or because pressure from the African countries has become so intense - since last Monday, the Commission is taking a different approach to the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)."
"As a result, there are no more nonsensical demands for reciprocity in market liberalisation and no more insistence on the inclusion of the Singapore issues."
"There is now an agreement that individual topics will be taken out so that now the talks will only focus on goods, with other issues being discussed at a later date."
"If we were to pursue the same approach with the Doha Development Round, then perhaps we might achieve some success there as well, for this is why it has repeatedly failed until now."
"That is why the WTO has failed and the Doha Development Round has failed, because the Commission always insists on sending out the same message."
"It says, 'you need to understand that we only want the best for you, and if you do not grasp that, then we will not get an agreement'."
"Fortunately, if we look at the report by this Parliament - which in this case was much cleverer than the Commission - that was drafted by my colleague Mr Sturdy back in 2006, it is clear that Commissioner Mandelson could have conceded much earlier on to the demands that he now has to bow to, and perhaps we would not have let things go this far."
"You yourself appeared before us in committee and we asked you quite specifically about it."
"What was your response?"
"You said that Commissioner Mandelson is doing a wonderful job!"
"Frankly, the Council also has a responsibility here, given that it will have to endorse the Partnership Agreement at the end of the process."
"It could get involved in the negotiations once in a while, rather than simply saying, 'we'll let the Commissioner get on with it until he finally comes up with something'."
"No, you have a responsibility and in my view, when it comes to the EPAs, you have not fulfilled this responsibility, at least judging by your statements to our committee."
"Madam President, I am rather surprised to find myself agreeing with a colleague from the other side of the House so wholeheartedly."
"I congratulate Ms Martens on her report."
"There have been a lot of excellent words said in this Chamber this afternoon, but we have failed Africa."
"We have failed Africa in the past and, as the rapporteur on EPAs, I hope that this European Union will not fail Africa again."
"Yesterday the Commission published a communication on EPAs, which at long last acknowledged the impossibility of completing negotiations by the end of 2007, as was previously planned and reported in my report."
"But the Commission continues to insist that Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries must commit to signing up fully to EPAs in 2008 and that some countries in the region should sign up to EPAs while others do not."
"Is that not unbelievably farcical!"
"Too much is unclear and uncertain in these talks, with so little time left."
"The communication is deliberately vague and, while I understand what it is, it worries me: I never sign up to a deal about something that I do not understand, and yet we are asking Africa to do precisely that."
"Furthermore, these new proposals to create subregional agreements within regions with African countries which are willing to sign up would create a spaghetti-like mess of different agreements in neighbouring countries."
"The idea that other countries and ACP regions should join later would mean them signing up to a deal they had not negotiated."
"How is that a good idea?"
"Were EPAs not meant to be about regional integration?"
"So who is focusing on implementation, monitoring mechanisms and impact assessments while negotiating parties struggle to find an agreement on these smaller packages?"
"ACP countries should not have to choose between trade agreements which may damage their local/regional markets or barriers which cripple their export markets."
"There is still a choice to be made, and last-minute policy shifts from the Commission do nothing to restore the confidence of the disconnected."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioners, Minister, this debate should move us further along the road to Lisbon and the summit, and we must thank the Portuguese Presidency for having focused its attentions on the relations between Europe and Africa."
"We hope that it will help Europeans to understand, finally, that their destiny is inextricably linked to that of Africa, that we can understand that Africa's development is a condition for our prosperity and that we will not be able to control the migratory flows or have a secure energy supply without a strong partnership with Africa."
"We must be clear that it is not to help the poor people, but in our own interest."
"We must also be clear that the Africans sometimes listen to our declarations with little confidence and see them as rhetorical because we have not yet got beyond the colonial past to establish this solid partnership between equals that we all desire, that we announce, but that is still far from the reality."
"The job of modernising Africa is a huge one."
"The Africans have a great responsibility in this respect, but so do we."
"Without us - without our help, without our cooperation - they will not get out of the situation described in the Martens report, because they need not just trade but also aid and equal relationships to enable them to move beyond their past, for which, clearly, we are partly responsible."
"(SV) Thank you Madam President."
"In December, the first summit for several years will take place between the African Union and the EU."
"It is an important meeting for the EU, which has a great responsibility for supporting economic and democratic development in Africa."
"The Portuguese Presidency deserves credit for this initiative."
"The EU must become more active on the African continent."
"What concerns me, unlike Brian Crowley, is that Zimbabwe's dictator Robert Mugabe will probably be attending the summit."
"It is not worthy of the European Union to sit at the same negotiating table as Mugabe."
"Mugabe's misrule and corruption are paralysing the entire country."
"The political opposition are harassed and thrown into prison, free speech does not exist, there are food shortages in a country which was once Africa's granary, and hundreds of thousands of people have no homes."
"The economy is falling to pieces, inflation is more than 7 000%, the average age is the lowest in the world, and 25% of the population are infected with HIV."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Manuel Lobo Antunes, one way to show our disgust at Mugabe's dictatorial ways is for the EU not to accept his presence at the summit."
"Mugabe's terrible rule must be ended."
"Dictatorships need plain speaking, my friends. Thank you."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Martens, for this important report."
"On the one hand, it is a clear indication to the Commission that the parliamentary dimension must this time have a role in the drafting of the Joint EU-Africa Strategy."
"The fact that the Commission ignored not just its opposite number, but also Parliament, when it was preparing the EU Strategy for Africa in 2005, has, unfortunately, been a common approach for the Commission."
"On the other hand, the report, to its credit, raises a number of important questions of content which need an answer, and the matter of the strategy to adopt."
"Firstly, history clearly shows that universal human rights require universal protection if they are to be realised."
"For this reason it is vital that the priorities for peace and security in the EU's Africa strategy incorporate a view which recognises the concept of the responsibility to protect, and promotes it."
"We have a responsibility to protect, and that must also be the subject of a debate within the EU."
"Secondly, as the report laudably stresses, climate change must be a top priority in the strategy."
"Water, its quality and sufficiency, will, with energy, become a serious political problem, and then Africa will be its very first victim."
"I would nevertheless like to remind everyone that Africa's most serious environmental problems are for the present erosion and overgrazing."
"Climate change obviously makes things worse."
"Adaptation and support measures are needed."
"Besides, for the EU Africa is a natural partner in international contexts in the fight against climate change."
"Thirdly, I would like to stress the importance of small businesses and local entrepreneurship as a condition of sustainable and real economic development in Africa."
"We should ensure that the action we take supports it."
"Only the local population itself can get Africa on its feet."
"(PT) I must congratulate Mrs Martens on this important report at a time when the EU is redefining its relationship with Africa, largely due to the emergence of China as a player in that continent."
"However, the EU-Africa relationship can only move forward if the dual-aspect approach of development and security is coherent, particularly with regard to human rights, democracy and good governance."
"Given the importance of the joint strategy and its associated action plan to be adopted at the EU-Africa Summit, I want to ask the Portuguese Presidency to duly inform the European Parliament about the progress made in the negotiation of these documents and their contents."
"This will be useful for ensuring that the measures set out in the joint strategy and action plan subsequently become reality, with the support of the European Parliament and under the control of the various applicable financial instruments."
"Here in this House we hope that the joint strategy and action plan will reflect the commitments made by the European Union, with due priority being given to the fight against poverty and to the Millennium Development Goals, particularly access to basic health care and education."
"We want joint measures to be included on controlling trafficking in small arms and light weapons, which are the true weapons of mass destruction in Africa, and also measures for the empowerment of women and civil societies in whom lies the force for change, peace and development which Africa so desperately needs."
"(CS) Europe used to have a bad conscience over Africa due to its past colonial policies."
"Today we are trying to help the developing countries enter the globalised world."
"That is why the spotlight, in relation to these countries, has shifted to global challenges."
"Besides disease, starvation and drinking water shortages, these issues also include security, trade, migration, brain-drain and climate change."
"Besides charity, our task is to oversee responsible decision-making based on democratic principles on the part of the African institutions."
"In this light I regard Commissioner Mandelson's development strategy as hazardous as it focuses exclusively on trade relationships in the Pacific."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must insist that the Commission step up the capacity-building in the area of the human rights agenda."
"Without it democracy in Africa or for that matter in any other place in the world does not stand a chance."
"What troubles me is how deeply rooted the former communist block ideology is in Africa."
"What is also worrying is the growing influence of the totalitarian Chinese market model, which mines African raw materials and takes work away from the African people."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Martens, on the comprehensive and balanced definition of the new strategy as set out in her excellent report."
"We have to, however, also look to its financial framework and learn to read the outcomes from the appropriate indicators."
"It also appears to me that the Commission does not sufficiently divulge to European citizens the importance of EU collaboration with its most immediate neighbour of Africa."
"I hope that the December summit in Lisbon will adopt, based also on this report, a new vision of relations rooted in the human rights agenda."
"I would like to conclude by saying that the summit will be fundamental for a shift in EU-African relations, therefore I do not approve of the fact that the Czech Republic and the UK intend to block this pan-African summit because of the participation of the dictator from Zimbabwe."
"That said his presence ought to be categorically challenged and condemned."
"(NL) Madam President, relations between the European Union and the African countries have become unacceptably strained due to the negotiations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries about the Economic Partnership Agreements."
"If these negotiations fail, then Cotonou will end in a black hole for a number of countries from 1 January because our trade relations will then become the far less favourable Generalised System of Preferences."
"It would, however, be a disgrace if poor countries were to be penalised in this way, because they feel that the EU and the ACP countries are not equal partners at this moment."
"We must give poor countries the right to protect their markets in sectors that are weak and which would keel over in the buffeting of free trade."
"These negotiations stand in sharp contrast to the good principles and aims in Maria Martens's report and I share those aims."
"We, as Socialists, wanted to add that the trade and agriculture policy of the EU should not be allowed to stand in the way of development policy."
"We need coherence, and it goes without saying that the policy should still be aimed at emancipation and women's rights."
"It is up to the Commission to develop this into a concrete policy."
"After that the Commission will monitor development cooperation closely."
"(PL) Despite the several billion euros allocated to Africa, poverty is getting worse in that continent, as the sound report prepared by Mrs Martens indicates."
"I have not consulted with Mr Antunes, the representative of the Portuguese Presidency, or with Mr Van Hecke, but I wish to emphasise that cooperation with local African entities is a sine qua non for financial aid to be effective."
"The economy needs assistance regarding the introduction of technology, awakening the spirit of entrepreneurship, encouraging citizens' commitment and supporting individual initiative."
"Missionaries, for example, are engaged in such activities even though they do not have any funds, whereas the Union is not involved despite being able to count on substantial financial resources."
"One of the main challenges is education, that is to say, investment in human capital, which brings great benefits. Africa has also entered into certain commitments too, however."
"These include halting the import of arms and introducing certain legal provisions, notably regarding the right of property, which is essential for the development of the economy. I should like to conclude by saying that the role of governments must be understood as serving the people, and not benefiting from our aid as symbolised by the luxury cars used by representatives of African authorities."
"(FR) Madam President, the Africa of today has two faces: first there is the one of extreme poverty and human tragedy, as in the case of Darfur and Somalia, and then there is the other face, which is all too often ignored, of a continent that in spite of everything is innovating, that is becoming more democratic, although too slowly, and that little by little is returning to the path of growth."
"The new EU-Africa strategy therefore needs to take this dual reality into account and support this still fragile process by means of a genuine political partnership: one that is based on unity, for it is Africa in its entirety, through the voice of the African Union, that has to be our main point of contact; on equity with an agenda that has been drawn up together and not imposed by the North, and on humility, for Europe is not the one and only partner Africa has."
"The EU must also support the process by using the Millennium Development Goals as a roadmap, by keeping to its promises and meeting the financial commitments made by the EU and by the Member States and, finally, by recognising the role played by the African parliaments."
"The Martens report is in fact the message that we are sending today to the Commission and the Council, and we shall be in Lisbon in December to see if this message has actually got through."
"(PT) Madam President, as stated in Mrs Martens's report with which I agree to a large extent, the fact that the current EU strategy for Africa was not established in partnership with the people of Africa is one obvious limitation on its potential."
"This was a mistake that must and will be corrected in the next EU strategy which must reinforce the role of the African Union and be based on concepts of partnership and equality."
"The issues causing concern that must be covered include peace, the problem of displaced persons and the fight against serious diseases such as AIDS and malaria."
"Development must be our goal and trade one of its weapons."
"To this end, we need to support small and medium-sized enterprises and promote equitable international trade."
"However, we will only be successful in this strategy if we can help to reinforce democracy and human rights across the continent."
"In reformulating and renewing the EU strategy for Africa, the new local and global circumstances must be taken into account."
"The fact that we are talking today with an African Union is in itself significant."
"On the other hand, the generalised increase in consumption of both oil and food implies a need to increase global production capacity and, in that regard, Africa is a continent rich in oil and gas, but also with enormous agricultural potential to be exploited."
"Finally there is the issue of the summit."
"There is no need to hold a summit in order to determine a strategy for Africa."
"However, as the Portuguese Presidency has gone down this route, it would be wrong not to continue to the end, otherwise we will lose an opportunity to positively impact on the life of Africans."
"The talks cannot only be about debt cancellation as greater wealth in the world can and must be, Madam President, an opportunity for greater wealth in Africa."
"This wealth must benefit its people and not just its elite."
"International cooperation cannot continue to be a problem for Africa, as someone else has said."
"That is why we must improve this so that education, promotion of health, democratisation and development can be ensured."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and say that I agree with Mr Michel about the creation of a new type of partnership and relations between Europe and Africa."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Lobo Antunes on the Portuguese Presidency's organisation of a Europe-Africa summit."
"However, while that new type of relationship is being built, official development assistance continues to be, and will remain for some years, a very useful instrument in Europe's relations with Africa, and not just Europe as a whole but the Member States too."
"We should promote healthy competition between the Member States in terms of improving the quantity and quality of development aid."
"My country, Spain, has tripled its aid in this parliamentary term and compared with the previous government has increased its contributions from EUR 200 million in 2004 to an expected EUR 850 million in 2008."
"Spain is now the second largest donor of development aid in the world and it is also the country on the Development Assistance Committee whose contribution has increased most in that time."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must thank you for your comments, suggestions and even criticisms of what the Presidency is proposing in its plans for EU-Africa relations."
"I have of course taken due note of all these suggestions, observations and criticisms."
"I should like to make it very clear that what we are proposing in terms of a new relationship with Africa has two aspects that I would say are innovative, or at least we hope they are innovative or may prove to be so."
"Firstly, we plan to establish an effective partnership with our African partners; this partnership must also prove to be effective in terms of ownership."
"As I have already mentioned, the strategy that we are developing for Africa is not a unilateral strategy."
"It is a joint strategy, in other words a strategy that is being drafted, analysed and debated together so that what results and what is proposed is actually what our African friends are hoping for and expecting from us and what we would also of course like to receive, in a positive sense, from our African partners."
"On the other hand, we also want to increase the number of actors involved in this strategy so that it does not just involve governments as usual."
"In addition to governments, we want other public institutions, parliaments, as I have already mentioned, and also broad sections of civil society, their representatives and actors to be involved."
"The second aspect which in my view is extremely important is that we want to modernise the agenda between the European Union and Africa."
"We want this to respond to the new global challenges, to take account of the profound changes that are occurring in the world and, in particular, to genuinely offer Africa the opportunity to become fully integrated within the new world order."
"That is why we are going to discuss and debate with Africa such new and modern issues as the energy issue, the climate change issue, and issues linked to migration, mobility and employment, but obviously without forgetting those issues which continue to be fundamental in our traditional partnership, such as peace, security, democratic governance and human rights, and also issues linked to science and the information society."
"I believe this agenda is comprehensive, ambitious and, as I have said, thoroughly modern."
"We must modernise our agenda with Africa as this must be able to effectively respond to current needs."
"I would also say that the Portuguese Presidency and Portugal have never hesitated to name dictators in Africa or in any other part of the world and consequently to denounce them and we will continue to do so whenever necessary."
"Finally, I must also say a word of thanks for the work carried out jointly with the Commission in preparing everything for the second EU-Africa Summit."
"We have received from the Commission and from the Commissioners with specific responsibility in these areas, namely trade, external action and humanitarian aid, very committed and high-quality support and we are sure that we are all working towards a common goal of making the difference in Africa and for Africa."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Council for having responded so fully to the interventions, and would add that I endorse the points that have been raised."
"I too share many of the concerns that have been expressed."
"The Commission is endeavouring to apply greater coherence to its overseas activities and, as a matter of fact, the nature of the dialogue between Europe and Africa should gradually allow us to eliminate some of the contradictions, including those highlighted by Mr Rocard."
"It goes without saying that we sometimes pursue contradictory policies: you only have to think of the subsidies paid to agriculture."
"This is a contradiction."
"Unfortunately, a choice has to be made here between divergent interests and this sometimes just has to be accepted."
"I see that Europe is probably the only international actor that continuously self-corrects itself and manifestly tries, at any rate, to go in the right direction."
"A second point that has been raised is that of Zimbabwe."
"I do not wish to go back over this question."
"Mrs Martens has responded better than I ever could."
"What we are dealing with is an EU-Africa summit, not an EU-Zimbabwe summit."
"This is element number one."
"Element number two is that I am well aware of calls for Mr Mugabe to be denounced."
"I could do that too, but it would change nothing."
"The decision to invite Mr Mugabe does not depend on us."
"I am sorry but we cannot stand in for our African partners."
"Speaking as the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, with special responsibility for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and for political relations and dialogue with Africa, I have to tell you - and I am sorry to have to say this - that we do not have the right of coercion that enables us to say to our African partners: 'You can invite anyone apart from him.'"
"At the risk of being too forward I will also say this: if we are to judge things by the yardstick of dictators, or rather those whom we consider as being fit for this role, we would have problems with more than just Mr Mugabe."
"And let me just say something else on the subject: this is the reality."
"What is important is that the summit takes place and what is also important is that during this summit we are able to discuss matters and raise the issue of human rights in Zimbabwe."
"This is what appears to be useful and important to me, and I do not mind saying so."
"The summit therefore has to take place."
"We have waited long enough."
"There has already been an Africa-China summit."
"What is more, an Africa-Japan summit is in preparation and we will be there when it happens, though I do not know exactly when."
"I would also like to say that we have enlisted the help of South Africa. If there is one African country that has made considerable efforts to try to resolve this question in everyone's best interests it is South Africa."
"Moreover, that country is now most likely engaged in generating, inspiring and working on a major agreement between the majority and the opposition in Zimbabwe, and this should result in honest and fair elections in March 2008."
"These talks are still ongoing, but in any case the last conversation that I had with President Mbeki seemed to offer real hopes of success."
"So let us not criticise South Africa, for it is doing what it can and it is not doing a bad job."
"As regards the proportion of funding allocated to agriculture, I would simply point out that, between the ninth and tenth European Development Funds, the figure set aside for this sector increased from EUR 663 million to EUR 1.1 billion."
"It is true that, despite the increase in funds between the ninth and tenth EDFs, there was a reduction in absolute percentage terms, but as far as hard cash is concerned the actual increase was not insubstantial."
"In addition I should mention that I was delighted to hear the President of the World Bank announce several days ago in Washington, at a meeting that I attended, that there would be a much greater focus on agricultural development, and so I fully share the concerns that were raised just now."
"As regards the role of civil society and the parliaments, and the Pan-African Parliament too, I can do no more than wholeheartedly approve of the approach taken in the report."
"In a word, and to be brief because the allotted time is very short, I would again like to touch on the question of Economic Partnership Agreements or EPAs, which I promised to do."
"You will be aware of my position as regards these agreements."
"They are an essential condition for the integration of Africa into the world community."
"As experience from Asia has shown, it is not aid that is the most decisive factor for progress but rather economic development and integration into the global marketplace."
"I personally believe that EPAs represent an opportunity whereby the ACP countries can integrate gradually into the international trading community by first building up their regional markets."
"All the same, I would point out that 1 January 2008 will not herald the start of sudden and dramatic market liberalisation."
"So what will it mean?"
"In fact it will mean the gradual opening up of markets subject to varying transitional periods depending on the products in question, with the assistance of regional funds that will provide financial support and will also help alleviate the problem of net fiscal loss as a result of liberalisation."
"Of course there is no shortage of interesting proposals that could be applied in this area."
"What is more, we will also be able to mobilise quite substantial resources in a whole series of areas that could create optimum conditions whereby this process of liberalisation could in fact be made progressive, and this gradual opening up of the markets rendered useful, positive and productive."
"I understand only too well the apprehensions that some have expressed. However, as regards the call to extend the date for concluding these Economic Partnership Agreements I must say to you that I do not see any advantage in this."
"The WTO will not grant us an exception for the ACP countries - and it is all very well pretending that they might - because our current system is harming other developing countries that are asking to be treated in the same manner as the former colonies."
"The only alternative is therefore to use the Generalised System of Preferences."
"The least developed countries (LDCs) will have access to everything apart from arms, but for the non-LDCs - and I would just like to point out that there are 36 of them - this would represent a reduction in their current level of access."
"The EPAs will allow us to continue to guarantee this preferential access to our traditional partners, but more importantly they will help support the process of regional economic integration."
"I believe that this is where the real potential lies for trade to be able to contribute towards economic development."
"We are of course aware of the problems that this will pose for our partners, we recognise their reluctance and, it has to be admitted, we understand their legitimate fears."
"It is precisely for this reason that we have initially proposed concluding staged agreements that in the first place will resolve the trade problem by including market opening on a reciprocal basis that is compatible with WTO rules."
"As I have always said, market access offers from our ACP partners will of course be based on the principles of asymmetry."
"Remember that we for our part are opening up our markets completely, we intend to be as flexible as possible and shall make use of all the leeway available to us to incorporate the concerns about development, particularly the need to protect the main body of agricultural production and fledgling industries."
"We are at the moment continuing to work on this question."
"The real challenge is to prevent non-LDCs from slipping into a disastrous trading situation on 1 January. These countries clearly have huge commercial interests at stake."
"If by 1 January we have still not solved the question of market access it is obvious that they will be back with the Generalised System of Preferences, which means they will be on the sidelines and then they will be in a truly disastrous position."
"We therefore have to get a move on if we are even to have temporary agreements in place."
"This essentially is it as far as the EPAs are concerned."
"Finally I would like to say that I am in complete agreement with the views that Mr Borrell expressed so clearly."
"The forthcoming summit and the EU-Africa strategy will be all about bringing a fundamental change to the nature of relations between Europe and Africa."
"Let us therefore try - and here I borrow his expression - to create a strong partnership between two sides that respect each other and have rights and responsibilities towards each other, and let us leave behind what we have at present - I would not call it banal, it is more serious than that - this outmoded, archaic and counterproductive relationship, this often humiliating association, of donor and beneficiary."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The EU-Africa Summit should mark a change in the EU's policies on respect for the sovereignty and right to development of the African countries and peoples, by promoting a fairer, more peaceful and more human world with a greater level of solidarity."
"This requires, for example:"
"immediate solidarity measures to meet the most basic needs of millions of human beings;"
"respect for national sovereignty and independence, non-interference in the internal affairs of each country and a peaceful solution to international conflicts;"
"demilitarisation of international relations and a gradual reduction in armaments and military expenditure;"
"equitable and fair international economic relations, rejecting the impositions of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization and the 'Economic Partnership Agreements' on liberalisation of trade;"
"cancellation of foreign debt, which has already been more than paid;"
"proper policies of cooperation and active and mutual support for development;"
"guarantee of immigrants' rights."
"This relationship must no longer be based on neo-colonialist ambitions or paternalistic views aimed at recovering the ground lost when the African peoples gained their national independence - after being conquered in the second half of the 20th century - and promoting interference, the military presence of the EU's major powers, and the control and exploitation of natural resources by transnationals."
"in writing. - (FR) If we are to highlight the importance of Parliament's report on relations between the European Union and Africa, given the forthcoming EU-Africa Summit in December, then we must above all welcome its realistic approach."
"The report calls for a true partnership between the EU and Africa, a democratic and realistic partnership that is based on effective and coordinated aid, but also on trade."
"I would particularly like to express my support for the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) for, as the report stresses, international trade has to be conceived as an instrument working for development."
"Poverty can only be reduced on a permanent basis by means of economic growth that is fair, sustainable and properly supervised, growth that is the result of commercial activity stimulated by market access."
"Free trade is not an end in itself, it has to serve the needs of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries; this is why the ACP group of nations has to be involved gradually and asymmetrically, so as to take account of local characteristics."
"We cannot be satisfied simply by providing aid selectively, otherwise we will not be solving the problems, we will merely be forever postponing them."
"Africa is not just a theatre for humanitarian aid, it needs to be an actor in its own development, with the European Union as a partner."
"An international treaty prohibiting cluster bombs (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Council on an international treaty to ban cluster munitions; follow-up to the Oslo Declaration, by Josep Borrell Fontelles, on behalf of the Committee on Development - B6-0319/2007);"
"the oral question to the Commission on an international treaty to ban cluster munitions - follow-up to the Oslo Declaration, by Josep Borrell Fontelles, on behalf of the Committee on Development - B6-0320/2007)."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, the calls for a ban on cluster bombs are getting louder and louder."
"Use of these bombs in summer 2006 in the Lebanon war showed the extent to which they can cause a human disaster."
"They are weapons that are a danger to both civilians and military personnel, but in practice 90% of their victims are civilians. In addition, 10% of these deadly bombs do not explode: they remain in the ground and have the same effect as landmines."
"Therefore, clearing the land contaminated with these munitions is dangerous, both for the populations and for the international peacekeeping forces."
"These bombs are not only used for war; they act as a long-term obstacle to transport and agriculture, and they create trade barriers and obstacles to humanitarian aid."
"They are thus one of the main problems affecting the development of poor countries: it is the poorest countries that are most affected by them, and in those countries the main victims are the poorest and least-educated sections of the population."
"We can no longer say that bombing one's opponents from a height of 10 000 metres and showering them with bombs that remain in the ground is an efficient way of maintaining peace or taking military action."
"The deployment of peacekeeping forces and humanitarian aid are today essential to stabilise and rebuild the areas affected by conflict and these bombs now lack any justification, including from a military perspective."
"Today we are going to talk to the Commission and to the Council precisely about the initiatives that have come about as a result of the widespread change of attitude among the international community towards cluster bombs."
"The European Parliament has repeatedly adopted a very clear position: we want to see international regulation of a global nature prohibiting the use, production, transfer, financing and stockpiling of cluster bombs."
"Pending this, the EU Member States should implement unilateral actions to prohibit the use and transfer of these bombs, as many states have already done and others are preparing to do."
"Commissioner, Minister, the European Parliament wants to thank the Presidency of the Council, the Commission and the Member States for their efforts to negotiate a new protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons, which deals with all the humanitarian problems associated with the use of cluster bombs."
"Unfortunately, however, we must recognise that very little progress has been made to date."
"We therefore need a solid Oslo Process on the basis of which the states, the NGOs, the Red Cross and the international organisations can draw up and fulfil an ambitious agenda."
"For the moment, Oslo has been backed by 80 countries, including many developing countries, but it is far from clear yet whether this process will eventually result in a complete ban on cluster bombs."
"What is clear is that we need an integrated, comprehensive approach that has a humanitarian slant and that focuses not just on disarmament, but above all on the protection of civilians, helping them to cope with the consequences of war while ensuring that the existing stockpiles of these bombs are destroyed and that the contaminated areas are cleared."
"With a number of important events coming up, such as the Vienna meeting in December and the Brussels meeting the following week, as well as 5 November, the Global Day of Action to Ban Cluster Bombs, when there will be many events around the world, what are we going to do?"
"In this context I would like to ask the Commission and Council representatives what we are going to do, what our position will be?"
"What is the European Union's position on the state of the discussions in the framework of the Convention on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons?"
"Are we going to have a common position of the Council in this matter?"
"What initiatives are we developing to encourage the Member States to adopt national measures aimed at prohibiting cluster bombs?"
"What are we doing to support third countries in terms of clearing the areas affected by these munitions, providing education on the risks and destroying the stockpiles of munitions already prohibited?"
"Finally, is the Commission going to consider organising an international conference on the European Union's role in tackling the socio-economic, humanitarian and development consequences following conflicts in which these weapons have been used?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Borrell, I should firstly like to thank you for your three questions on this specific issue of the ban on cluster bombs."
"I will try to briefly and as objectively as possible answer each of the three questions put to the Council."
"As regards your first question, I must say that, within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons - to keep my speech short I will simply refer to this as the 'Convention' - the Presidency of the Council of the European Union has, as you know, voiced its concern, on behalf of the European Union, about the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions."
"In particular, at the Third Review Conference of States Parties to the Convention which was held in Geneva from 7 to 17 November last year, the European Union expressed the view that cluster munitions represent a particularly important element of the future work of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons."
"The EU presented a proposal supporting the establishment of an open-ended Group of Governmental Experts with the purpose of drafting recommendations for further action in the context of the Convention."
"This proposal was not adopted by the Conference of States Parties."
"However, it was agreed to convene, as a matter of urgency, an intersessional meeting of the Group of Governmental Experts on Explosive Remnants of War, with particular focus on cluster munitions."
"This meeting was held in Geneva from 19 to 22 June 2007 when the EU submitted a draft negotiating mandate for a legally binding instrument to address all aspects of the humanitarian concerns raised by cluster munitions."
"This instrument should be adopted by the end of 2008."
"The EU Troika carried out extensive consultations with third countries to promote the EU approach."
"The Group of Governmental Experts decided, however, to postpone any decision on a legally binding instrument until the 2007 meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the Convention which will be held next month."
"In parallel with these efforts to address the concerns relating to cluster munitions, as you know, a number of EU Member States have subscribed to the Oslo Declaration and participated in a series of meetings organised within the so-called 'Oslo Process', aimed at a total ban on cluster munitions."
"EU Member States have participated in their national capacity."
"So far no agreement has been reached on an EU position concerning the Oslo Process."
"The majority of Member States perceive these two processes as complementary and consider them to be parallel efforts leading to a common goal, namely an international legally binding instrument on cluster munitions."
"As regards your second question, I must say that, in relation to the forthcoming meetings in Brussels and Vienna, as already mentioned, EU Member States, including the Presidency, will participate in a national capacity if they so decide."
"No EU common position is planned."
"Finally, as regards your third question, I can say that the recent decisions taken by Austria and Belgium on the prohibition of cluster munitions, as referred to by Mr Borrell in his question, have been taken, as you know, on a purely national basis."
"The Council has not taken any specific action on this issue."
"Let us hope that it will express its view soon."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Borrell Fontelles for putting this oral question to us."
"I am glad because I think this is an opportunity for us to comprehensively answer this question on something which has particularly appalling consequences."
"It has a highly negative impact on human beings, particularly on civilians."
"The question is, therefore, very dear to me because things that affect human security are always very close to my heart."
"I fully agree with the position expressed by our Council President, but I would like to mention a few other things also."
"Over the past year I have had the opportunity to discuss it in several formal and informal fora, including in meetings organised - the first in Paris and then a later one in Alexandria - by the Institute for Peace Studies and chaired by Ms Mubarak."
"She took on this issue very strongly and I think she has tried to bring things forward."
"As in the case for antipersonnel landmines, explosive remnants of war pose great threats to the lives and safety of civilian populations and I would like to comprehensively answer the questions that Mr Borrell Fontelles has asked here."
"Their effects can be both immediate and long-lasting."
"By scattering explosives over wide areas they can kill and injure, as we all know, large numbers of civilians, very often children."
"In addition, many of the bomblets or submunitions fail to implode and to explode on impact, and their lethal effects remain after conflict so furthermore cluster munitions seriously hinder international humanitarian assistance."
"We have seen it in the war in Lebanon."
"As regards crisis management and post-conflict reconstruction programmes during and in the aftermath of conflicts over the past several years, we in the Commission have been very active in countering the problems created by landmines and also by other explosive remnants of war, including cluster ammunition."
"Through the two European Commission mine action strategies covering the period 2002-2007, over EUR 300 million have been committed worldwide in projects covering activities such as demining, stockpile destruction, mine risk education, mine victim assistance, rehabilitation and social economic reintegration."
"Projects covering cluster munitions have also been carried out in countries which are highly affected by these weapons, such as Afghanistan, Laos and Cambodia to name a few of them."
"As for the future, we will maintain our engagement through mainstreaming actions against antipersonnel landmines and explosive remnants of war in our Community external assistance strategies and programmes - so this will be everywhere."
"The Commission also makes use of the humanitarian aid instrument managed by ECHO to fund humanitarian demining efforts."
"The most recent case of humanitarian demining support has been in Lebanon, which received significant humanitarian aid following the conflict in December 2006, which I mentioned before."
"Concerning the Commission's role in the negotiation of disarmament treaties or conventions, I would like to recall that such negotiations are sometimes not in our competence."
"If the Community is not a party to the disarmament treaties or conventions, it can then legally only encourage partner countries to engage fully in multilateralism, in particular via participation in treaties and conventions."
"I think our President has said a lot on this already."
"We took part in the EU troika démarches carried out in key countries such as the United States of America, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Canada, Pakistan and Ukraine, to promote the multilateral initiatives on cluster munitions in the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, and in particular a negotiation on a legally binding instrument addressing humanitarian concerns about cluster munitions."
"The objective is to conclude negotiations by the end of next year."
"At the same time, the Commission closely follows the Oslo Process and intends to participate as an observer at the meetings planned in that context in Brussels and in Vienna."
"In conclusion, I would like to assure you, Mr Borrell Fontelles, and also the European Parliament, that the Commission will continue to make its best efforts to support all the multilateral initiatives that are aimed at a comprehensive and effective ban on cluster mines."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that I am encouraged by the fact that we share the same worries and goals and I thank her for her presentation and description of the developments."
"I am also glad about the good cooperation between the Members of Parliament in preparing a relevant motion for a resolution."
"First of all, it is a matter of urgency."
"It has a human and political urgency because, in spite of warning signals from all around the world, cluster bombs are still being actively used."
"So there are two problems we need to address."
"Firstly, the use of cluster bombs has an especially inhuman aspect."
"Those who launch these bombs are usually not able to target them very specifically."
"The failure rates happen to be much higher than might be expected."
"The tragic result is extremely high numbers of casualties among civilians, more than 90%, as has been said."
"Another problem is the multitude of unexploded cluster bombs that lie in the former conflict areas."
"This is a major handicap to states that have resolved to start to rebuild their economies after conflicts."
"Against this background I think the EU should take the lead in trying to ban any kind of production, use and sale of cluster munitions."
"The first step should be to introduce an immediate moratorium on the use of these weapons."
"Further, our resolution insists that EU troops should under no circumstances make use of any kind of cluster ammunition until the relevant international agreements have been achieved."
"We ask Parliament and the Commission to urgently increase financial assistance to communities and individuals who have been affected by both exploded and unexploded cluster munitions, using to this end all available instruments."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"These questions exemplify the leading role played by this House in relation to conventional disarmament, controls on the transfer of munitions and the strengthening of international humanitarian law."
"We fought for the extension of the Ottawa Convention to all types of mines."
"Well before the European Council, we argued for a global treaty on the arms trade."
"The vital need to convert the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports into a legally binding instrument has also been a constant demand of this Parliament."
"These questions on cluster bombs look to the future and to what Europe must do to eliminate these weapons which make no distinction between civilians and military personnel and which destroy so many human lives."
"We are calling for an immediate moratorium on using, producing, stockpiling and exporting these weapons."
"The moratorium must in due time be converted into a legal instrument which has the effect of banning these barbaric munitions, in the long term, from arsenals and battlefields in the same way as anti-personnel mines have already started to disappear."
"In addition to calling on the European Union to begin a diplomatic offensive in favour of this new instrument, we want the Member States to lead by example and eliminate the use of these weapons by their Armed Forces."
"Not only that, they must also permanently stop their export, production and stockpiling."
"Every day in the Lebanon, Chechnya, Afghanistan and dozens of other countries where the wars have already ended, people are paying the ultimate price for the criminal and immoral irresponsibility of Armed Forces which have lost any sense of the ethical and legal limits that should guide the actions of civilised people."
"It is up to Europe to lead a global alliance to re-establish, reaffirm and reinforce these limits."
"We urgently need a common position in order to eradicate cluster bombs and other cluster munitions."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, civilians - many of them children - are indiscriminately killed or injured by cluster bombs."
"Dreams are shattered and lives are destroyed."
"Take the case of the Iraqi boy, Ahmed Kamel."
"Attracted by a shiny object, Ahmed picked up a bomblet and it exploded."
"He lost both of his hands and his sight."
"How is a 12-year-old supposed to make sense of this?"
"And yet the shocking fact is that cluster munitions are stockpiled in over 15 EU Member States."
"Horrifyingly, at least 10 EU Member States are producing these weapons: France, Spain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden and Bulgaria."
"It is my view that these countries, as well as those that have used them, including the UK, have blood on their hands."
"Whilst I welcome moves by countries such as Belgium to establish national legislation to ban cluster munitions, all other EU Member States must follow suit."
"I urge the Council and the Commission to endorse the Oslo Process, as we have already called on them to do."
"Diplomatic manoeuvres by the UK Government and others to suggest there are 'dumb' and 'smart' cluster munitions must be given short shrift - they all kill and maim."
"The word 'smart' could not be more misleading or more inappropriate."
"We need an immediate moratorium on the use, investment, stockpiling, production, transfer or export of all cluster munitions by all EU Member States."
"All states which have used them must accept responsibility for their clearance, and the Commission must urgently increase financial assistance to the communities affected by unexploded bomblets."
"I urge you all to support this resolution."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Oslo Process offers an historic opportunity to achieve an international agreement - not just a declaration, but an international agreement - banning cluster bombs."
"For two decades, there have been campaigns and international initiatives, but they have been repeatedly bogged down in the diplomatic mire of military and economic interests."
"Now we have an opportunity to reach an agreement in 2008."
"This requires support not only from Parliament, which has a clear position here across all parliamentary groups."
"I was very pleased and interested to hear, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, that the Commission also supports this position, which is most welcome."
"The Council now needs to follow the clear stance that has been adopted by Parliament and the Commission; that is very important."
"It is not just about banning the use and stockpiling of cluster bombs and the trade in these weapons; it is also about production."
"We should have a ban on the production of these bombs, and the European Union is still one of the main producers of these weapons."
"They are still being manufactured in Germany, in the United Kingdom, in France, in Spain and Belgium."
"Legislation has now been adopted in Belgium and Austria to ban production but I know that production has still not stopped entirely in Belgium."
"There are loopholes in this legislation as well."
"We must press ahead with a ban on these weapons."
"The Member States must move forward towards a ban, and the Council must defend the clear position that has been set out here."
"That is the only way to ensure that, in 2008, we actually get an agreement."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, the first time I dealt personally with this issue was during NATO's war of aggression against Yugoslavia, one of the wars which I opposed and which like many other wars was waged by Western countries."
"Some 98% of the victims of cluster bombs are civilians."
"Between 5 and 40% of the submunitions of cluster bombs do not explode."
"Let me be blunt: it is mainly the major Western industrialised countries which produce and equip their armies with fragmentation bombs and deploy cluster bombs in wars."
"There are 34 countries which produce cluster bombs, including 13 EU Member States."
"Cluster bombs are a factor in wars being waged by EU countries, for example in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, so please, let us not shed any crocodile tears here!"
"The EU must bite the bullet."
"In specific terms, this means that we need the European Union to adopt a common position condemning these murderous weapons."
"That means an end to the production of cluster bombs, and of course no use of fragmentation bombs as occurred in the Gulf War, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon."
"It cannot be allowed to continue."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, much has already been said on this subject and we of course deplore - the word is hardly strong enough - the use of cluster munitions, which have caused so much serious damage in a number of countries, and I wish to thank Mr Borrell for having in fact raised this disturbing issue."
"However, if this ban is to be effective, and if the resolve expressed in the resolution is to succeed, we of course need to go much further than banning the use of such weapons."
"We also need to deal with their manufacture and sale, because we cannot have a humanitarian debate on the one hand - and it is true that these bombs that do not explode but that lie hidden in the ground in all kinds of places, thereby preventing communities and refugees from returning to their homeland, also prevent the distribution of humanitarian aid - we cannot have such a debate that seeks to highlight the humanitarian side of the problem without at the same time taking effective measures against those industries here at home that, regrettably, are still producing and selling these weapons."
"I would like to conclude by saying that this resolution perhaps gives us an opportunity to appeal to the Member States too."
"In this respect my own country, Belgium, has passed the necessary legislation, indeed I think that it was the first to do so, and I believe that we could be inspired by the law that has been adopted in Belgium to appeal to the other 26 Member States to follow suit."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to use my turn to speak to support both the question and the way it has been worded by Mr Borrell, as well as our joint motion for a resolution on this issue."
"I am all too well aware that all the efforts being made on arms control are always very difficult and are sometimes more like a procession of Echternach, where you take two steps forward and then one step back."
"I think that we must intensify these efforts, because it seems to me in the last few years as if people who are working for disarmament, for arms control, to control weapons, are old-fashioned specimens from a bygone age, because now rearmament is the order of the day."
"I find that extremely alarming."
"When you think that a head of state of the only remaining superpower in the world recently threatened a possible third world war, that strikes fear right to my heart."
"In this context, which is far less conducive to joint efforts, I think that it is more important than ever that both the Council and the Commission continuously underline that the Member States must act together on this, which unfortunately has not been the case up to now."
"(SV) Thank you Madam President."
"I am also speaking on behalf of my colleague Raül Romeva."
"He comes from Spain, I come from Sweden, and both countries produce these dreadful weapons and both countries have promised to ban them."
"But what is my own country doing?"
"At the talks in Oslo, Sweden argued that we should have restricted use rather than a ban."
"That is a disgraceful position."
"No civilised country can defend these cruel weapons, and I am delighted to see the great unity that exists between the Council, the Commission and Parliament today in support of a total ban."
"When these weapons strike, they constitute a weapon against innocent children."
"It is an effective weapon against human rights and economic development."
"We must therefore be highly effective in our fight to ban them."
"This is the beginning - let us complete the process as soon as possible, as another child is dying every minute."
"Thank you."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to echo those who have already talked about banning the production, export and stockpiling of these weapons - cluster bombs - which are so harmful to civilians, and to express my support for the Oslo Process, despite the fact that, as the previous speaker said, my country manufactures, stockpiles and exports these types of weapons."
"I must make one point, however: on 21 September - i.e. just a month ago - the government, in the shape of the party that supports it, the Socialist Party, tabled in parliament an amendment to the Law on control of external trade in defence and dual-use material aimed partly at restricting - and, where appropriate, prohibiting - cluster bombs that are particularly dangerous for civilians."
"In other words, the trend is changing in my country: the manufacture, stockpiling and export of these weapons were approved by previous governments."
"This government is fully committed to the Oslo Process and wants to see the gradual elimination and, eventually, complete prohibition of their manufacture, stockpiling and export. This was the important point that I wanted to make."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to raise two vital points, but I will be very brief as I know we are overrunning."
"The first is that this debate has given me a very clear idea and conviction that this issue will be followed very closely by the European Parliament and is something that concerns many Members."
"I will therefore of course duly take this into account."
"Secondly, I would point out that the European Union is also playing a leading role in this issue, possibly not with the energy that many Members would like, and certainly with some difficulty, but, despite everything, with a certain optimism."
"We have already voiced in the appropriate place, in other words in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the European Union's concern about the humanitarian consequences of this type of weapon."
"We have also already proposed the negotiation of a legally binding instrument to be adopted by the end of 2008 at the latest, although possibly not with the ambition that many of you desire."
"However, the fact is that we are here to take decisive steps."
"This is a process that I hope will amass ever more political will, enthusiasm and effort so that we can ultimately achieve the proposed goals."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would just like to add one thing to what I said before."
"I can, of course, only speak on areas within the Commission's competence, and you know that this area is a particular competence of the Member States."
"However, I can speak on the financial assistance to those affected."
"I can reconfirm what I said before, which is that we have already done our best to alleviate the problems caused by explosive remnants of war, including cluster munitions, in particular through our mine action strategies and the related horizontal budget line, which accounted for about one third of the funds spent in this domain."
"I can assure you that actions against mines and explosive remnants of war will continue to be carried out through the new geographical instruments, and are even being mainstreamed now - and this is new - into our external assistance strategies and programmes."
"Some actions can also be funded under the new instrument for stability, so we now have more instruments on hand to address this major challenge, and will take clearly into account the strong position expressed by Parliament in using these as effectively as possible, where necessary, because I totally share the objective that you have expressed."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few moments before Question Time)"
"Council Question Time"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is questions to the Council."
"As happened yesterday during questions to the Commission, we are going to experiment with some new rules which are proposed as part of the reform of Parliament."
"These are being studied by a special group and basically cover two areas."
"Firstly, I would invite Members to move to the front benches so that the sitting feels more inclusive and, secondly, supplementary questions will be answered in one go by the President-in-Office of the Council after they have been asked."
"As a result, as we usually have two supplementary questions, instead of each being answered immediately, the Council will respond to both questions together at the end."
"The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0318/2007)."
"The following questions to the Council have been tabled."
"Subject: Solidarity Fund for major disasters"
"Given the gravity of this summer's forest fires in certain countries of the Union such as Greece and Spain, and in the light of the Union's failure to respond quickly and effectively, will the Council be reviewing the Solidarity Fund rules so that in the future we may be armed with appropriate mechanisms to face up to these disasters and mitigate the damage caused?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in answer to this question I would say that, as you know, the current European Union Solidarity Fund was established to respond to disasters of major and extraordinary proportions, following the floods which affected Central Europe in the summer of 2002."
"In 2002, on a proposal from the European Commission, the Council adopted a Regulation establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund."
"Article 14 of that Regulation on the Solidarity Fund provides that the Council shall review this Regulation on the basis of a proposal from the Commission by 31 December 2006 at the latest."
"In 2005 the Commission proposed that Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 be replaced by a new Regulation on the Solidarity Fund."
"This proposal particularly aimed to extend the scope of the instrument in order to cover industrial and technological disasters, public health emergencies and acts of terror and to reduce the thresholds used to classify a disaster as major."
"The proposal was that the regional exceptional criteria should be removed from the Regulation in force, but that, in exceptional circumstances, the Commission could recognise that a major disaster had occurred."
"The European Parliament issued an opinion in that regard in May 2006 and, still in 2006, the Council discussed the Commission's proposal and Parliament's opinion at the appropriate levels, although no agreement was reached."
"As a result, Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 continues to apply, with the Commission having proposed its mobilisation during 2007."
"As I had the opportunity of telling you last month in answer to a similar question, as far as the Council is aware, in cases of disasters provided for by the Regulation, its application has been effective."
"The European Commission periodically prepares reports which describe in detail the use of the Solidarity Fund."
"(ES) The Council's proposal was perfectly clear."
"This new regulation is hugely delayed."
"The complementary and concrete question I want to put to the Council is the following: this summer the cradle of Western civilisation, Ancient Greece, along with the Olympic stadiums were almost burnt down."
"Is the Council waiting until the Vatican is burnt down, until the Prado is burnt down, until Belém Palace is burnt down, or can we hope that before next summer we will have a regulation that can cope with these types of disasters?"
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Medina Ortega, we are obviously not waiting for Rome, Lisbon, London or Paris to suffer natural disasters before we look at this issue in more detail."
"We truly hope that Belém Palace and Belém Tower will remain standing for many centuries, as they have done to date."
"As regards specific deadlines for amending the current rules, I cannot of course, on behalf of the Council, commit to any specific date."
"Thank you for your reply, but I would concur with the follow-up question."
"We do need to know when this is going to be changed."
"I am speaking particularly about flooding in the UK."
"Obviously this refers to fires, but the solidarity fund covers flooding."
"My region in the West Midlands was very badly hit."
"My particular village in Worcestershire was hit, along with the rest of Worcestershire and the surrounding areas in Hereford and Shropshire."
"Obviously the UK Government has put in a bid for solidarity fund money."
"I am hoping the Commission is going to look favourably on that and the Council will actually try and make changes to the way the solidarity fund operates so that in future we can get this funding at a faster rate."
"Also, can the Council representative tell us what he feels about the rapid reaction force and whether this is going to be brought forward so that emergency flood defences could be brought into affected areas?"
"(DE) Mr President, first of all, let me say that I think it is very good that we can now sit together down here."
"I think that is a very good idea."
"As to the question itself, I would like to say a few words about the fires, Minister, which in some cases are due to natural causes but in others are started deliberately."
"This fire-starting is encouraged by the legal position in some countries because it offers certain advantages to certain people."
"Has any thought been given to the possibility of bringing pressure to bear on these countries to change the legal position so that this incentive no longer exists in future?"
"(PT) Very well."
"I believe that I have already answered at least some of the questions that have just been asked."
"I have also already said that our assessment of how this Solidarity Fund has functioned in the past was positive, in the sense that it functioned properly."
"The issue of the rapid reaction force is being considered."
"No decision has yet been made as this is still being assessed and debated by the Council."
"No decision has been made either on the prevention of fires, although a great deal has been done."
"Much remains to be done and I suppose that this is an area in which the exchange of experiences known as 'best practices' and cooperation between Member States at EU level may prove useful."
"Efforts still need to be made in this area."
"I must say that my own country is somewhere that is systematically, year after year, badly affected by fires, arson and all the issues relating to fires, particularly forest fires."
"Nationally, we have adopted a series of measures and initiatives that have proven to be very successful in terms of preventing fires and arson and of course we are very happy to share our experiences with all the Member States."
"Subject: Integrated European policy for persons with special needs"
"Is the Council envisaging the adoption of a joint decision with a view to establishing an integrated European policy to support and provide vocational training for citizens with special needs and ensure their integration in society?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Thank you for your question, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou."
"As you know, the Council can only act in its legislative capacity on the basis of a proposal made at some stage by the Commission."
"As things stand, the Council has not yet received any legislative proposal for a Council decision with a view to establishing an integrated European policy to support and provide vocational training for citizens with special needs and ensure their integration in society."
"As you will know, in 2000 the Council adopted Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation."
"This prohibits discrimination on a number of grounds, including disability."
"In addition, this year (2007) was designated the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities for All' through a decision which the Council and Parliament took jointly under the codecision procedure."
"(EL) Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council."
"The elimination of discrimination in employment is not an effective way to address the problem of disability."
"Only yesterday the health programme involving new technologies was announced."
"Could this proposal not be used to enable a large proportion of European citizens, who could be active and useful to society as whole at a time of demographic decline, to reach their potential and live in social cohesion?"
"(PT) Mr President, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I feel that speech was more a general comment than a direct question."
"However, I believe that, despite everything, we have seen a gradual increase in awareness among the Member States and also at EU level of the need to work together in order to adequately respond to the issues involved in this area."
"I must also say that, during the Portuguese Presidency and as part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the Presidency will be hosting, in Lisbon on 19 and 20 November, a major conference on this issue during which we will of course try to review the situation as regards the relevant issues."
"We will also of course try to obtain political commitments on this issue for the future."
"(DE) What measures is the Council planning with a view to making public transport more accessible to the disabled?"
"Do you see any opportunity for the use of best practice and benchmarking in order, quite simply, to help improve the situation here?"
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, we have explicitly enshrined the rights of the disabled in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will be part of the Lisbon Treaty and will thus be fully and legally binding."
"Do you see any opportunity for the Council Presidency to call on Member States to react very practically to the new opportunities that have been created and take appropriate measures to ensure that the disabled have more and better prospects?"
"(PT) I should like to make two comments."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights is not yet fully in force and has not been published."
"Neither has the Treaty of Lisbon and we therefore have to wait for the time being."
"I obviously cannot predict in October what initiatives or decisions the Council may adopt in this area."
"Furthermore, as you know, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is not in itself a legal basis for legislative initiatives."
"With regard to the issue of transport, as the Commission does not propose initiatives to be adopted by the Council in this area, this issue still comes under the competence of the Member States."
"It will clearly be up to them, at national level, to propose the necessary measures as they see fit and according to specific circumstances."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the next three questions by Marian Harkin, Avril Doyle and Esko Seppänen were put down in yesterday's debate."
"In accordance with Annex II(A)(2) of the Rules of Procedure, these questions are not admissible so we will move on to the next question."
"Questions Nos 3, 4 and 5 are not admissible as the subject in question is already on the agenda for this part-session."
"Subject: Sex offenders"
"Is the Portuguese Presidency satisfied that the EU and its Member States are taking all possible measures to identify, bring to justice and monitor after conviction perpetrators of sex crimes against children, to exchange information on child sex crime and to protect and rescue children who may be missing, abducted or at risk?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mrs Ludford, protecting children from sexual exploitation and combating trafficking in human beings are extremely important issues for the European Union."
"In this respect, I would refer to the Council Resolution of 27 September 2001 on the contribution of civil society in finding missing or sexually exploited children in which the Council declared that combating the disappearance and sexual exploitation of children is a priority for the European Union."
"To this end, the Council has adopted various legal instruments which tackle specific aspects of this issue, including the Joint Action of 24 February 1997 concerning action to combat trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children, said Council Resolution of 27 September 2001 on the contribution of civil society in finding missing or sexually exploited children and, finally, the Council Framework Decision of 22 December 2003 on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"The recent proposal for a framework decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children, presented by the Kingdom of Belgium, has been assessed by the Council together with other proposals, such as the proposal for a Council framework decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings and the proposal for a Council framework decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States."
"Following the negotiation process, the Council has decided to merge the provisions of the initiative presented by the Kingdom of Belgium with the instrument on the exchange of information extracted from criminal records."
"As a result, information on a person's conviction for the sexual assault of children should be made available to the competent authorities of Member States."
"The Council Framework Decision of 22 December 2003 on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography contains a definition of offences concerning sexual exploitation of children and child pornography and calls on Member States to take measures to ensure that these offences are punishable by a term of imprisonment of one to three years and, in some cases, the maximum of five to ten years."
"Said Framework Decision sets 20 January 2006 as the date for implementation by Member States."
"On the basis of the notifications received by the Council and the Commission on the implementation measures and the report prepared by the Commission, the Council must assess, by 20 January 2008, the extent to which the Member States have complied with the obligations arising from this Framework Decision."
"I thank the Presidency very much for that reply."
"The case of Madeleine McCann has aroused a lot of interest and, indeed, controversy."
"I am not going to go into the details of that case, but what concerns me here is what lessons we can learn generally about the adequacy of European action in the case of missing children."
"I want to ask about three issues."
"The first is a missing children's hotline."
"Yesterday, Commissioner Frattini told us that he was not at all satisfied by Member States' action to implement the Council decision from February for a single 116 phone number for missing children, which should have been in place in August."
"Only four Member States have chosen a service provider, three Member States have failed to respond to a request for information at all."
"That is not very impressive!"
"Will you chase up the other 23 Member States?"
"Secondly, a few weeks ago, Justice and Home Affairs Ministers called for an EU database on missing children."
"I believe that some private attempts have been made in cooperation with YouTube and Madeleine McCann's parents."
"Will the EU support having a proper database?"
"Thirdly, you talked about work on the exchange of information on sex offenders, but when are we going to have a computerised database?"
"(PT) Mr President, Mrs Ludford, I should just like to say the following in response to the various questions asked."
"Firstly, many of these measures are relatively recent or very recent and their effects therefore need to be assessed."
"This is happening and we will of course be assessing what has worked and what has failed and whether we are making good progress in this area."
"This is what we have to do, not go hounding the Member States, trying to lay blame or apportion responsibility."
"This is a cooperation process which requires dialogue between the Member States based on experiences which we must exchange."
"Despite everything, I consider that we have made good progress in this area in response to situations which are truly terrible in humanitarian terms."
"Finally, I consider that the Reform Treaty is also good news in this respect as it effectively encourages and enables wider and better cooperation between the Member States in combating this type of offence."
"President-in-Office, you mentioned - and I was glad to hear you use the word - the 'trafficking' issue, because I think that, while we have publicity about children, including the McCann case, there are many children and young adults who are trafficked into Member States of the Union."
"I would like to ask you if you believe that enough is being done on this issue."
"And I would also ask to assist those when they are found in the Member State: to rehabilitate them and either get them back to their own countries or to make sure that they do not become criminals within the Member State in which they are trafficked."
"I think this is a really serious problem in the Union."
"(DE) Minister, I tried to listen very closely to your response to Mrs Ludford."
"She asked you a very specific question which you have not answered, namely how you propose to chase up the Member States which have not yet set up the hotline. Perhaps you could be more specific in your answer."
"(PT) I am neither an expert in criminal policy nor a Minister for Justice."
"I am here representing the Council and I can only tell you what, at the moment, seems to be the general feeling of the Council."
"It is always possible to do more and to do it better, but the truth is that, as I have already said, there is a series of legal instruments which duly correspond to this desire to effectively combat this type of offence."
"As I have said, many of these measures are recent and they will all need to be properly assessed."
"There was one new question: raising the awareness of Member States and their citizens about a phenomenon which, in terms of raising awareness about its extent and gravity, is actually new."
"As always happens with new phenomena which must be considered and assessed, there is of course a procedure to be followed."
"We will, where necessary, continue to call on those Member States which have perhaps not yet complied with their obligations in relation to implementing initiatives or legislation to do so as quickly as possible."
"If a commitment has been made, then this must be fulfilled and implemented in this and all other areas."
"Subject: Merger between Suez and Gaz de France"
"On 3 September it was announced that the boards of the French energy company Suez and the state enterprise Gaz de France had decided to proceed with the planned merger."
"This would create the fourth largest energy company, after Gazprom, Electricité de France and EON."
"The Commission has already ordered the merged company to hive off a number of operations in Belgium and France."
"Does the Council believe that these merger plans still accord with the current principles which it espouses with regard to liberalisation of the energy market in the European Union?"
"To what extent have the new merged company and the French State promised to carry out the divestment of ownership of the main networks which the Commission has called for?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly say that, as you know, the conclusions of the 2007 Spring European Council comprehensively covered the EU's energy policy, including the issue of the internal market for gas and electricity."
"The Council cannot venture an opinion as to whether the merger plans, as they currently stand, are in accordance with that part of the conclusions."
"The Council would point out that these European Council conclusions formed a contribution to the European Commission's Third Energy Package, presented in September 2007, which has the goal of subsequently opening up the internal market for gas and electricity. Only after obtaining agreement on the proposed regulations and directives and after these have entered into force will it be possible to assess whether the merged company GDF Suez complies with the relevant legislative provisions."
"Secondly, the Council must point out that, under the Treaty provisions on competition, the European Commission is responsible for ascertaining the compatibility of all inter-company agreements with the Community rules."
"(NL). I think that it is entirely right that policy and concrete steps are evaluated by the Commission."
"I do have an additional question relating to the European market, the realisation of the single market."
"The explicit aim behind the unbundling of companies is to bring about real investment in the networks, and we can see that in this area, including between countries, we have not kept up with the agreements that have been made."
"Countries are supposed to be able to exchange 10%, this was called interoperationality, and we are lagging behind on that."
"My question is this: what activities is the Council undertaking to actually prime the investments in order to improve the connection between France and Spain, for instance?"
"People can buy in cheaper from their neighbours but if there is no mains connection that is not possible."
"What are you going to do about that?"
"(PT) Mr President, Mr van Nistelrooij, the Council adopted a series of measures on energy issues at the last European Council in March."
"These must of course now be implemented, based on Commission proposals."
"Each body and each institution must assume its own responsibilities: the Commission by presenting its proposals, the Council by adopting, rejecting or amending these, and then the Court by ascertaining whether or not the legislation and penalties of Member States comply with the legislation in force."
"That is all I can say for the time being."
"Question No 8 has been withdrawn."
"As the author is not present, Question No 9 lapses."
"Subject: Facilitation of visas for citizens of Moldova and Georgia"
"Citizens of Moldova and Georgia are confronted with considerable difficulties in obtaining visas for the EU Member States."
"In addition, the entry into force of the visa facilitation agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation has brought about a paradoxical situation whereby the inhabitants of the separatist regions of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria, who mostly hold Russian passports, now benefit from a less restrictive visa and travel regime."
"What action will the Council take to contribute towards easing the visa regime for Moldovan and Georgian citizens and implementing the respective agreements?"
"It is also necessary, as a matter of urgency, that the Common Visa Centre in Chisinau should be able to count on the cooperation of more EU Member States with a view to transposing the practical process of facilitating visas."
"How does the Council explain the fact that so far only a small number of Member States have done so, and how it will ensure that the rest cooperate forthwith?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mrs Anastase, in a decision of 19 December 2006, the Council mandated the Commission to negotiate an agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Moldova on the facilitation of visas."
"This agreement was initialled in Chisinau on 25 April 2007 and signed in Brussels on 10 October 2007, by myself in fact."
"Given the rapid conclusion of this agreement, the European Parliament will be consulted on the draft decision on the conclusion of this agreement."
"On 17 October the Moldovan Government passed two bills ratifying the agreements with the European Union on visa facilitation and readmission."
"On behalf of the Council, I can tell you that the Commission does not currently have a mandate to begin negotiations on a similar agreement with Georgia."
"As regards the Common Visa Centre in Chisinau, cooperation between Member States is a matter to be decided by them alone."
"(RO) Congratulations on signing the agreements with the Republic of Moldova."
"As regards this issue, I would like to point out two things: first of all, I consider it necessary to include in the discussion regarding the relations between the Council and the Republic of Moldova a situation that occurred immediately after signing these agreements: on 12 October, at the border of the Republic of Moldova, some official delegations coming from Romania were refused access to the territory of the Republic of Moldova."
"Since I believe that a visa facilitation for a third country should be followed, eventually, by its reciprocity, I would be interested to know if the Council intends to approach this subject."
"Secondly, in the agreements you signed, a reference to the Moldovan language is made, a language that is not recognized."
"I would like us to point this out especially since there is only one language, the Romanian language, recognized in the European Union."
"As regards Georgia, I believe things should move toward avoiding the situation that the citizens of Georgia deal with as compared to the citizens of South Osetia."
"(PT) Mr President, as I said, I signed this visa facilitation agreement with Moldova and I can tell you that this action, this initiative, this agreement was duly appreciated and recognised by the Moldovan Government."
"This is an extremely important instrument in terms of both our relations with Moldova and all our relations with our neighbouring countries."
"I sincerely hope that this agreement will help, as intended, to strengthen relations between the EU and Moldova and in particular to reinforce the 'human dimension' of the European Neighbourhood Policy, in other words to bring people closer so that we can all get to know each other more and better, because undoubtedly this is what reinforces European spirit and understanding."
"Any difficulties in applying this agreement will of course have to be assessed."
"Such difficulties are very recent but I can say that, whenever agreements concluded by the European Union with third countries result in problems or difficulties, when they do not produce the desired results or when they produce the wrong results, the Commission, possibly in cooperation with the Council, must look into what is happening and, if applicable, make the necessary changes."
"With regard to Georgia, I have taken note of your comment, Mrs Anastase."
"(LT) Are there any plans to adopt an agreement on a visa facilitation regime for visas to Belarus?"
"After the expansion of the Schengen area, Lithuania, having extensive borders with Belarus, will have difficulty inviting people from that country to visit and, in addition, Belarusians will not be able to visit relatives living across the border."
"Are there any plans for this?"
"(PT) Mr President, Mrs Budreikatė, as you know, decisions on the conclusion of visa facilitation agreements are taken on a case-by-case basis."
"They naturally take into account the country in question, the type of relationship that we have with that country, technical security issues and so on. As a result, where applicable, with regard to Belarus or any other country, a decision would have to be duly proposed by the Commission to the Council and the latter would have to decide on this."
"However, as I have said, a decision cannot be simply made to conclude this type of agreement or to begin negotiations without certain technical and political conditions being met."
"However, where it is technically and politically feasible to conclude these, visa facilitation agreements do help, as I have said, with the 'human dimension' or 'humanitarian dimension' of the Neighbourhood Policy."
"We cannot be strangers to one other; on the contrary we must and can get to know each other more and better."
"Subject: Creation of a European civil defence force"
"On 4 September 2007 the European Parliament adopted a resolution (P6_TA(2007)0362) on natural disasters that makes particular reference to the lethal fires that affected Greece this summer."
"Like other documents, both the resolution and the report on establishing a Community civil protection mechanism of 18 September 2006) recognise the importance of the Community civil protection mechanism and call for the creation of a European civil defence force that could react immediately in emergencies, as also proposed in the report by former Commissioner Barnier."
"Given that the creation of a civil defence force would be of particular assistance in supporting Member States' national authorities responsible for civil protection, what are the Council's views on the creation of a civil defence force?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr Papadimoulis, the Council would point out that, on 15 and 16 June 2006 and also on 14 and 15 December 2006, the European Council endorsed or took note of Presidency reports on reinforcing the Union's emergency and crisis response capacities in order to improve coordination and delivery of available assets."
"The June 2006 European Council also provided further guidelines on improving the Union's emergency, crisis and disaster response capacities, both inside and outside the European Union."
"It called for particular attention to be given to further developing the European Union's rapid response capability, based on means made available by Member States, including civil protection modules, and to work on the Commission's proposals on reinforcing the Community's civil protection capabilities."
"As regards the report submitted by Michel Barnier in May 2006, the Council would also point out that the European Council of 15 and 16 June 2006 welcomed this document as an important contribution to the debate."
"Although certain ideas in the Barnier report have been incorporated in Community rules or practices, no proposal has so far been submitted to the Council aimed at creating a European civil defence force."
"In its conclusions of 15 and 16 October 2007, the Council, taking into account the recent devastation in some Member States and recognising the need for the European Union to be able to respond effectively and in a timely manner to crises and emergency situations following natural disasters, invited the Commission to continue examining the issue and to submit relevant proposals before the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 December 2007."
"(EL) Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office, but in familiar Council terms, he has chronicled 18 months of inertia and delays."
"The text you have read to us manages to undermine the entire Barnier proposal."
"I ask you: how many more fire and flood victims must we mourn?"
"How many properties must be lost?"
"For how long can the Member States waste their resources before you finally propose, in Council, the inquiry the European Parliament has long been demanding?"
"I ask you: will you, as President-in-Office, propose on 10 December that the Council examine what the European Parliament recommends, namely that this auxiliary civil protection force should be set up, or will your successor again tell us, 18 months from now, another tale of yet more delays?"
"(PT) Mr Papadimoulis, the Council is naturally awaiting with great interest the Commission's proposal on this issue, in other words on the possible creation of a civil defence force."
"It is hoped that these suggestions or proposals will be made by the Commission before the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 10 December, in fact in less than two months."
"We hope to look at and assess the Commission's proposals and we will then act accordingly."
"(LT) I too would like to point out the importance of this issue, so I am pleased that the Council has addressed the Commission and is awaiting an answer."
"Nevertheless, I would like to ask: what are the Commission's views on the force as regards extraordinary situations, and, bearing in mind all these floods and fires, climate change and the events taking place far from here, in America, what are the Commission's views on the actual role of such a force in extraordinary situations?"
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, you have mentioned the Barnier report several times."
"This report has prompted fears among the aid organisations because it seems to provide for quasi-military leadership structures or preliminary decision-making at military level."
"Is the Council aware of these fears about the 'militarisation' of this civil protection force, and how can, and will the Council, respond to these concerns?"
"(PT) Mr President, as I have already mentioned, the Council's proposal and conclusions on Mr Barnier's report were that this could form a working basis for future decisions."
"This was not a 100% endorsement nor even a partial endorsement that this should form a working basis."
"It was simply what the Council agreed at the time."
"As I have just said, I cannot pre-empt the Council's reaction to proposals, models and methods that do not yet exist, as that would be to pre-empt history."
"We must await the Commission's proposals and assessment."
"We will then discuss these in the Council and come to conclusions."
"We will also decide on the direction to be taken in that respect, which brings me to an important point."
"The Council, by asking the Commission to submit proposals on this issue, has unequivocally indicated its interest in the subject and its desire to move forward in this respect."
"In my opinion, that is an undeniable and positive sign."
"Subject: Fate of Professor Ukshin Hoti"
"The internationally recognised scientist and peace activist Professor Ukshin Hoti, Foreign Minister of the democratic underground Republic of Kosovo led by President Rugova in the nineties, was arrested by the Milosevic regime and disappeared without a trace many years ago."
"Can the Council ascertain from the government in the now democratic Serbia what happened to Professor Hoti and determine if the Belgrade authorities are prepared to conduct an investigation into this matter?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr Posselt, Professor Ukshin Hoti is one of more than 2 000 people included on the list of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) whose families reported their disappearance during the Kosovo conflict."
"The ICRC has, since January 1998, been gathering information on people who disappeared in Kosovo."
"This information has been sent to the authorities in Belgrade and Pristina, together with a request for them to do their utmost to discover the whereabouts of these people."
"The ICRC in Kosovo is also working on this issue in strict cooperation with the United Nations Missions in Kosovo."
"As part of the dialogue on issues of mutual interest between Pristina and Belgrade, the working group on missing persons which has representatives in both governments has met periodically since March 2004 under the auspices of the Red Cross."
"Work is being carried out on both sides in order to discover the whereabouts of missing persons, but progress is slow."
"The right to know the whereabouts of missing loved ones is a fundamental issue of humanitarian law and human rights."
"As a result, the Council of the European Union is supporting the work being carried out by the international and local authorities in Serbia and Kosovo to this end and is encouraging them to increase their efforts."
"(DE) Mr President, every victim is of course equally important, and so I welcome this inquiry."
"However, Professor Hoti really was very well-known."
"I am in close contact with his family."
"He was the closest aide of Ibrahim Rugova, our Sakharov Prize Laureate, and he has been formally detained by the Serbs."
"In that case, they must have some knowledge of his whereabouts!"
"This is an issue which has to be clarified formally with the government in Belgrade, with the involvement of the Council."
"What does the Serbian Government have to say about the whereabouts of its prisoner, for whom it has assumed responsibility, given that it is holding him in custody?"
"(PT) Mr President, as I have already said, the Council is of course supporting all efforts being made by the authorities with direct responsibility in this area to try and determine the whereabouts of Professor Ukshin Hoti."
"We also understand, as I said, that this is an issue of human rights and protection of human rights."
"In that regard, it must form part of our political dialogue with the respective governments which are responsible in this respect."
"Subject: Climate change"
"Does the Council still feel that the European Union's goal of keeping the global temperature rise to 2°C is likely to be met?"
"Has the Council discussed what additional measures need to be considered at EU level to meet the concerns expressed in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, as you know, the European leaders decided to send the international community a clear signal of their determination to combat climate change by assuming the following commitments, with a view to encouraging negotiations on a global agreement for the post-2012 period."
"Until said agreement is reached, the European Union has made the firm and independent commitment to achieve, by 2020, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to at least 20% of 1990 levels."
"Secondly, the European Union is ready to commit to a 30% reduction if the other developed countries make similar reductions and if the developing countries which are economically more advanced also make an appropriate contribution."
"The European Union believes that it must take the lead in terms of ambitious emissions reductions so that the developed countries can convince the developing countries to contribute to the global effort."
"Clearly, an ambitious target will also reinforce the global carbon market which must remain in place in order to limit the costs resulting from emissions reductions."
"Various measures have already been taken under the European Climate Change Programme and others are planned within the strategic analysis of energy policy in the European Union in order to achieve a significant part of the greenhouse gas reduction target."
"The emissions trading scheme will play a central role in achieving the EU's long-term targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and its analysis will be vital in realising the overall targets set for the European Union."
"Thank you, President-in-Office, for that quite encouraging response."
"You said you want to send a strong signal and that we need a global agreement."
"I was interested to hear about a 30% target."
"I agree with you that we need to be ambitious."
"Of course, this is an area that not only affects most European citizens but also one about which they are very concerned."
"I wonder if you could outline a little bit more about your thinking on what positive real steps we could be taking to encourage those countries that ought to be able to do more - like the United States - and to assist those countries - whether it is China, India or Russia - that are perhaps struggling at the moment."
"What more could we actually be doing to push this process forward, rather than talking?"
"I am not suggesting that is all you were doing, but, rather than just talking about the issue, what are we actually going to do to make it happen?"
"(PT) The tools available to the European Union are diplomatic tools and also our conviction and, shall we say, political determination."
"I feel that the best way of persuading others to follow us is to set the pace and lead by example, which is exactly what we are doing."
"Clearly, by setting ourselves ambitious targets which correspond to what our citizens expect of us, we are leading by example, not only within the Union but also globally."
"This inspires public opinion in other countries which in turn forces the respective governments to take measures on a par with our ambitious targets."
"As regards the United States, this leadership effect has, in my opinion, been very evident."
"The example set by the European Union in this respect at world level has led to pressure being applied by US society on the respective authorities in the sense that they must also be more ambitious."
"My personal view is that Mr Al Gore having received the Nobel Peace Prize for climate change issues has a lot to do with this, with our ambitious policy, with our desire for change, with our desire to make others commit to our targets, all of course in a context of multilateral diplomacy via the United Nations."
"Could I urge Parliament to show leadership by turning off the air conditioning, because I am frozen and it might help our contribution to climate change?"
"President-in-Office, you have answered one of the questions I wanted to ask, but it will probably take more than Al Gore to get the public engaged in this."
"I would therefore ask the Council to outline how it intends to translate public concern into public action within the European Union, and also to take into account that we do not want to stop the developing world making progress, because we are actually gaining from the fact that they are developing."
"We will try to solve this problem of the temperature in this House."
"(PT) Mrs McGuinness, thank you for your question."
"What we must do is engage in a constant campaign of awareness-raising and information."
"We must also lead by example."
"This has been done."
"Clearly there still remains much to be done, but I feel that the process of raising awareness among people of the climate change issue is increasingly gaining ground because the effects can be seen every day, they are real and people can feel them."
"I could mention my own personal experience, if it would be of any interest."
"The climate in Portugal when I was six or seven years old is not the same as it is today when I am fifty."
"In fact, I have observed, as have others, that things have changed."
"As a result, people are asking why things have changed and what are the consequences of these changes."
"On the other hand, the Member States must adopt the legislation needed to deal with, halt or minimise the causes of climate change."
"The Member States have made political commitments at EU level and must now make the commitment to adopt the legislation needed and ensure that this legislation is effectively observed."
"Once again, we must lead by example at world level."
"I would not wish to underestimate the campaign of former Vice President Al Gore as I believe that this has had a significant impact on public opinion worldwide."
"Subject: Turmoil in global financial markets"
"During a recent informal meeting of the EU Finance Ministers (Porto 14-15 September) the crisis that has arisen in Europe because of instability in US financial markets was discussed."
"Could the Council outline the nature of these discussions?"
"Did the Council consider the particular case of Northern Rock which is currently experiencing financial difficulties as a direct result of instability in the US?"
"Does the Council consider that this matter has broader implications for Europe's financial markets?"
"Finally, is the Council satisfied that existing safeguards in the financial services arena provide adequate protection to consumers, particularly those who have purchased financial products outside their 'home' Member State?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, what I have to say on this issue is as follows."
"At the informal meeting of EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors which was held in the Portuguese city of Porto on 14 and 15 September, various issues were discussed, including developments in the economic and financial situation."
"As indicated on the Portuguese Presidency's website, our assessment is in two parts."
"On the one hand, we believe that we are experiencing a period of volatility and re-appraisal of risk in global financial markets, triggered by difficulties in the subprime mortgage market in the United States which have been passed on to the global financial system through complex financial instruments."
"The functioning of the money markets has also been affected and this has required prompt and firm action by the main central banks, including the European Central Bank."
"On the other hand, although it is undeniable that the financial turbulence has heightened uncertainty about economic prospects, the macro-economic fundamentals in the European Union are strong and world growth remains robust, despite the slowdown in the US."
"European financial institutions appear to be strong and their healthy profitability in recent years ensures that they are in a position to weather the current period of increased volatility in the financial markets."
"However, I would point out that specific cases in the Member States were not discussed."
"During this assessment, we also discussed the lessons that may be drawn from recent financial market volatility."
"It was stressed that, although we have a sound regulatory and supervisory framework in the financial sector which has been reinforced by recent legislation such as the implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive and by the work in hand on the Solvency II Directive, we must remain alert, particularly in light of the rapid and innovative developments in the area of financial products."
"Accordingly, the recent episode of financial turbulence has increased the urgency of certain issues which are still on the Council's agenda and has heightened the need for the European Union to find, alongside its international partners, ways of reinforcing transparency, improving valuation processes, continuing to reinforce risk management and improving market functioning, particularly with regard to complex financial products."
"The Ecofin Council on 9 October agreed on a detailed work programme to be carried out until the end of 2008 by relevant bodies at EU level, in strict cooperation with the main international partners."
"At the same Ecofin Council meeting in October, conclusions were also adopted on reinforcing financial stability mechanisms in the European Union."
"These conclusions are available on the Council's website and are the tangible result of over a year's preparation."
"In particular the Council adopted a set of common principles to guide cooperation between national authorities in the area of financial stability."
"In addition, it was agreed to extend the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation and Exchange of Information signed in 2005 between EU Banking Supervisory Authorities, Central Banks and Finance Ministries in order to include three new elements: firstly, the common principles formally adopted at the meeting; secondly, a common analytical framework for the assessment of systemic implications of a potential crisis and, thirdly, common practical guidelines on procedures to be followed in potential cross-border crisis situations."
"A work programme was therefore defined with a timetable for this and other actions to be carried out in order to reinforce the effectiveness of the financial stability mechanisms in the European Union."
"Clearly, all this work is intended to protect consumers and investors who depend on the proper functioning of the financial markets."
"Please allow me to conclude by highlighting that, as I understand it, the Council, together with the European Parliament and the Commission, subscribes to the goal of achieving effective levels of prudential supervision and regulation in order to ensure financial stability, global competitiveness and consumer protection."
"Thank you, President-in-Office."
"I shall have to study your very detailed response, which is one that I appreciate because this is a very serious issue."
"One would have to agree that the confidence of depositors in Northern Rock has been shattered, and that there is a knock-on effect."
"Confidence is indeed the key to stability in the banking system and also to cross-border services and business in the financial services sector."
"Do you think that the actions you have outlined are enough to restore that confidence?"
"(PT) The Council can always surprise the Members."
"As I said, the Ecofin Council asked a working group to analyse the situation in great depth and detail and also any new instruments or measures which might in the future prevent situations such as these from affecting the European financial markets."
"It is therefore alert to the problems as it has asked the competent bodies to carry out detailed work."
"It has asked this working group to propose the measures which might need to be adopted in order to prevent situations such as the one we have seen recently."
"We will have to wait and see whether or not these measures prove effective in practice."
"However, the Council will be advised of the measures which might have to be taken in order to prevent our economy from being affected in the future by any further financial turmoil."
"I must mention that this issue was also covered at the Informal Meeting of Heads of State and Government which was held in Lisbon last week."
"At this meeting the following message was heavily underlined by our Heads of State and Government: firstly, that the European economy is presenting what the economists call 'good fundamentals', in other words our economies remain sound, and, secondly, that it supports the measures which have been taken by Ecofin and which are proposed in this area."
"Subject: Growing number of European agencies"
"There are currently 23 European agencies, spread over a number of EU countries and cities."
"There is scarcely any scrutiny of their activities or operation."
"The latest agency set up is the Agency for Fundamental Rights, which has its seat in Vienna and currently employs 100 people."
"The purpose of the agency is to monitor the protection of human rights in the European Union, although this task is already perfectly taken care of by the European Court of Human Rights and, in fact, also the Council of Europe, both of which have their seat in Strasbourg."
"All these agencies spend around 1 billion euros a year of taxpayers' money."
"Some observers take the view that hardly a European Council summit goes by without a new agency being set up."
"Does the Council intend to set up more new agencies?"
"Is the need to set up an agency carefully considered in each case?"
"Is the Council aware of the financial impact on the European budget?"
"Is the Council prepared to abolish some agencies if their existence is not justified?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Van Hecke, I would point out that questions on setting up and closing down Community agencies should be put to the Commission which has the exclusive right of initiative in this respect."
"The legislative bodies, Parliament and the Council, act solely on the basis of proposals presented by the Commission."
"As regards the Council, the honourable Member may be sure that the need to set up a new agency is carefully considered in each case."
"As for the budgetary aspects of agencies, I would refer the honourable Member to the Joint Statement of 18 April 2007 in which the three institutions agreed on a common set of principles for the budgetary management of existing or future Community agencies."
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Minister for his reply."
"My concern in putting this question was twofold: first, the explosion in the number of agencies opened up after each Council session; 12 new agencies in five years, with an increase in the number of staff working for these agencies from 166 to 3 700."
"The second part to this question is: does the Council re-evaluate the need to retain these agencies on a regular basis, when the reason for their existence may no longer be evident?"
"My second concern is how does the Council itself organise its internal control over the expenditure of all these agencies, and what role does he see for Parliament in this?"
"(PT) Mr Van Hecke, as I have already mentioned, the proposal to set up an agency is presented by the European Commission and then, in dialogue with the Commission, the Council assesses whether or not the Commission's proposal is justified."
"Decisions are then taken in accordance with the Treaty rules."
"I must say that Portugal hosts one agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency which has its seat in Lisbon, which we feel is definitely a very useful European agency."
"As regards the specific management of agencies, as you know, these have their own supervision mechanisms which, in my view, are pretty rigorous."
"In addition, the institutions have also agreed, as I mentioned, a set of common principles which very directly apply to the budgetary management of these Community agencies."
"My personal experience tells me that particular care is taken to ensure rigorous management and strict use of the funds made available to these agencies."
"That is my personal experience, for what it is worth."
"Subject: Cybercrime 24/7 emergency contact network"
"It is reported to me - from the USA - that 10 EU Member States are not taking part in the 24/7 emergency contact network for cybercrime."
"These are Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, and also Portugal, the current Council President."
"How great an importance does the Council attach to the fight against international cybercrime?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Newton Dunn, the Council has not been informed about the participation of Member States in this network which is primarily an initiative of the G8 and Council of Europe Member States."
"As a result, the Council cannot confirm or refute this."
"However, the Council does regard the fight against cybercrime as extremely important, as demonstrated by the adoption of Framework Decision 2005/222/JAI of 24 February 2005 on attacks against information systems and the fact that the Council supported the rapid ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001."
"In addition, the Council's conclusions on a general policy on the fight against cybercrime will be presented and discussed at the next Justice and Home Affairs Council which is planned for November."
"Furthermore, Portugal has a national central reference point which is available 24/7 and which is responsible for fighting this type of crime through Interpol and a global operational network."
"Thank you, President-in-Office, for that quite open, honest and factual reply."
"Will you, at the next JHA Council meeting, to which you referred, raise the interesting point that the Council does not appear to know about this, and that 10 of the Member States are not involved, which seems completely extraordinary to me?"
"Would you please raise this issue in the Council?"
"(PT) I note your question and your concern."
"Whether or not this issue will be on the agenda and discussed will naturally be decided at a later date, but I will voice your concern on this matter."
"Subject: Ban on visiting Cuban nationals imprisoned in the United States"
"Earlier this year I requested authorisation from the US Government to visit the Cuban nationals, René González, Gerardo Hernández, Antonio Guerrero, Ramón Labañino and Fernando González, who are being unlawfully detained in US prisons."
"However, I was refused authorisation on the grounds that I did not know them before they were imprisoned."
"It appears that in September this year two prisoners' wives were once again refused permits to visit their husbands, whom they have not been able to visit for nine years because of successive refusals."
"What does the Council think of this situation which does not constitute respect for these citizens' human rights?"
"Is it willing to convey its concerns to the US authorities?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mrs Figueiredo, as the honourable Member must surely know, a country's decision as to whether or not to grant entry to its territory is a matter of national competence."
"In the specific case of the treatment dispensed to Cuban prisoners and their family members, this is a bilateral issue between the United States and Cuba as, under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the protection abroad of the rights and interests of a country's citizens is the responsibility of that country."
"The Council is not therefore competent to give an opinion on this issue."
"(PT) That is true but the Presidency must consider this issue: there are five Cuban citizens who have been detained for nine years in US prisons and who have been denied visits by family members and even, in the case of two of them, by their wives."
"The latter have previously been to this Parliament and are in fact here today."
"It is also true that I am a Member of this Parliament and that I asked for permission to visit these citizens, but that this was denied."
"Now I am a Member of this House; I did not make this request solely as a citizen, but also as a representative of this Parliament."
"I believe that the European Parliament and its President and of course the Portuguese Presidency should take a stand on this issue, bearing in mind that refusing to allow a visit by one of the Members of this House, in this case myself, is a violation of human rights and also demonstrates a lack of respect for this House."
"However, there are also other Members of this House involved in this case and I therefore ask you, Mr President, to convey our concern."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Mr President, I have of course noted the observations and comments made by Mrs Figueiredo but I have nothing further to add to my previous answer."
"You must also understand that I cannot give a personal opinion on this issue."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Membership of committees and delegations: see Minutes"
"Production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Cappato, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in this report we propose that Parliament should take the initiative and make a proposal to the Council, primarily in the context of the common foreign and security policy, on the issue of opium production in Afghanistan."
"Our starting point is the realisation that the results achieved to date are inadequate."
"There has been a 50% increase in the production of opium used to produce heroin over the past two years."
"It seems that we are unable to find an effective means of reducing this enormous production mountain, all of which then goes to enrich not the growers, the farmers, of course, but the large international drug mafias, the terrorists and the Taliban."
"The report also starts from another premise: that at the same time there is in fact a very severe lack of access to painkillers."
"Of course, the two issues could be regarded as completely separate, but I believe it is the job of political institutions to be pragmatic and hence to understand that, faced with this enormous volume of production used for heroin - whilst a product from the same agricultural origin is in very short supply - it ought to be possible, as it were, to combine the two points of departure."
"The amendments put forward in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and by Mrs Gomes on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as well as those tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in plenary, have helped to ensure that the proposal on the table today is not an alternative one, that is, a negative proposal calling for the policy pursued hitherto to be replaced overnight."
"What we are asking of you, of the Council and of the Commission, is to conduct an experiment, to run some pilot projects converting part of the crop currently used to produce heroin to produce painkillers instead."
"On the demand side too, policies could be launched to try and take painkillers to continents such as Africa and Asia which are practically bereft of any such medicines."
"That is why the report, as it emerged from the Committee on Foreign Affairs and taking into account the proposed amendments, seems to me fundamentally well-balanced."
"It proceeds from a very simple assumption, namely that it is probably - I believe definitely - easier to cooperate with farmers if we propose converting part of their output to legal ends, rather than simply coming along with a policy of eradicating, fumigating and destroying plantations."
"That response in fact creates yet another reason for conflict with local populations and has proved counterproductive and unhelpful, at least until now."
"I therefore hope that, beyond the understandable official line taken by Europe's governments and the Afghan Government, asserting the need to fight opium production, beyond that official line we might send out another message, and the European Parliament is perhaps freer than others to make such a proposal."
"We have already assumed this responsibility and I hope we will reassert it tomorrow at the vote."
"We are freer than others to propose that alternative experiments be carried out and assessed pragmatically, not ideologically."
"Every one of us here has his or her own ideas about international politics and drugs, and about international policies in Afghanistan."
"This report is not intended as an ideological proposal, but as a practical attempt to help find a solution for what really is a global tragedy."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I too would like to say thank you very much to Mr Cappato - tante grazie!"
"I welcome this very timely debate on the drug problem - and particularly on Afghanistan's drug problem - which, as we know, is a major complex issue in the political and security context."
"We recently had a lot of discussions in New York."
"There were a number of very important discussions during the UN General Assembly with President Karzai, with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and with a host of countries."
"These focused exactly on this whole complex question."
"Tonight's discussion contributes to the wider debate on Afghanistan's reconstruction, but also on the role of drugs."
"Let me also commend you for setting up the EP Delegation for relations with Afghanistan."
"We are taking a keen interest in your work and consider it very important that you have done this."
"Afghanistan's drug industry does indeed pose an enormous challenge to progress in state building."
"The latest United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report makes for troubling reading."
"Both poppy cultivation and processing capacity have, unfortunately, increased significantly."
"Afghanistan's southern provinces are most affected, with 70% of all the production."
"The strong link between the insurgency and the drug economy hardly comes as a surprise."
"However, we must not overlook the positive developments, especially in the more stable parts of the country, where there have been real improvements in health and education, as well as economic growth."
"Thirteen provinces in northern and central Afghanistan are indeed poppy free."
"That, at least, is very promising, and something on which we can build."
"The Cappato report gives a complete picture of this situation - and I should thank you for your encouraging remarks on what the Commission is doing - and it also points, quite rightly, to Afghanistan's responsibility for tackling the opium industry."
"On that we are in absolute agreement."
"Yet I must say that I cannot share - at least not yet - the conclusions reached in the report, which proposes to legalise the opium poppy for medical purposes, albeit on a trial basis."
"At first sight that may be an appealing proposition, but unfortunately there are no simple answers to Afghanistan's complex drug problem."
"Let me share with you some of my concerns."
"Countries like Australia, Turkey and India, which are already producing raw opium for medical purposes, usually have effective law enforcement and also an absence of widespread conflict."
"Even then, implementation is very difficult."
"Where such conditions are not being met, opium cultivated legally is promptly diverted, as we have seen in Peru and Bolivia."
"Obviously, in the case of Afghanistan, licit cultivation would, we fear, simply add to illicit cultivation instead of replacing it."
"Also, the legal production of opium remains unappealing to local farmers as their revenues would only be around 25-30% of what they can now obtain on the black market."
"The implementation of such a scheme is complex, and only feasible with subsidies for quality monitoring and the distribution of medical products."
"Should we support this with taxpayers' money?"
"The Afghan Government, which is notoriously weak and has weak institutions, unfortunately does not at the moment have - and that is why I said 'not yet' - the capacity to oversee such a scheme."
"In some parts of the country, there is simply no governance, let alone good governance, at the moment."
"This applies notably to the unstable southern provinces, where the bulk of opium is produced."
"Finally, the Afghan Government itself has firmly ruled out - and this is an important argument - any licit production of opium."
"Against this backdrop, the political message in this report does not really send the right signal to our Afghan partners."
"It might even backfire."
"The hard and undeniable truth is that reconstruction in Afghanistan will need much more time and resources."
"It will also require stamina, if we want to bring lasting development to this war-torn country."
"Progress in state building is only possible with more resolve, including from Afghanistan's political leadership, notably at the local level."
"That was, by the way, the message we gave in New York."
"I agree it is high time to visibly tackle corruption."
"We have not only said this, but are also trying to help in this by building up a good judicial system and having a police force that really works, in order to convince ordinary Afghans who often remain sceptical."
"There is a clear way ahead."
"It is through Afghanistan's national drug control strategy, which has been endorsed by the international community and contains all the elements needed."
"This really deserves our unequivocal support, being a comprehensive strategy that includes interdiction, public information, prosecution of known drug dealers and the promotion of local development."
"Where such a careful policy mix has been used, farmers have already abandoned poppy cultivation, sustainably."
"In that context, the Commission considers that a proposal to legalise the opium poppy might simply undermine the work it is currently doing in other sectors, notably concerning the rule of law and policing."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Cappato, with whom I have been friendly for a long time, is trying desperately to contribute to the fight against drugs in the world and to help the unfortunate young or older people who are suffering close to death and who can be assisted with drugs."
"Regrettably, I repeat, I am not of the rapporteur's opinion. I believe the problem stems from the fact that his proposal concerns Afghanistan, a state where insecurity could not be any greater."
"Yes, Iraq is perhaps less safe, but Afghanistan is hardly the place to begin trying to convince farmers to abandon what for them is the very lucrative cultivation of poppies and switch to crops that are fairer, more Old Testament-like and more in tune with the civilised farming practices we are all familiar with."
"The report itself makes perfectly plain that the largest quantity of drugs in the world, about half, comes from Afghanistan and that opium growing is illegal in Afghanistan."
"Even though it is illegal, however, that country is the source of half of the raw materials needed to kill our young people or make them fall prey to drug traffickers who, as we know, draw them into the use of drugs, which harms them and society as a whole."
"I believe that there is only one effective weapon to combat all drug traffickers, beginning with the Afghan farmers who in my opinion are the first drug traffickers."
"Our inability to control and monitor them means that the only way to fight drugs is through prevention, and hence by helping to reduce opium-growing as much as possible."
"For this reason the PPE-DE Group opposes this part of Mr Cappato's report, and I think that what I am saying now must be clear to everyone, whatever tomorrow's outcome may be."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Cappato, not only on this very useful report but also on his readiness to accept contributions in order to get as wide-ranging an agreement as possible."
"His original intentions were laudable as he was trying to kill two birds with one stone: legalising poppy cultivation and opium production for medical purposes would not only have ended heroin production in Afghanistan but also the lack of painkillers worldwide."
"Unfortunately, we came up against several practical problems, such as the fragility of the Afghan institutions and their inability to regulate opium production, the uncertainty as to the economic viability of such a scheme and the danger in allowing the reintroduction of opium in some of the thirteen Afghan provinces which have stopped production."
"My Group's amendments tried to refocus the report on the essential element: the fight against opium production in Afghanistan which is affecting not only Afghanistan but also neighbouring countries."
"The drugs illegally produced from this opium constitute what some call the true weapons of mass destruction, particularly in Europe."
"In the fight against opium production, we must be sensitive to the individual characteristics of the various Afghan regions."
"Only a combination of measures will be successful."
"Firstly, the corruption permeating the Afghan central administration, particularly the Interior Ministry and police, must be eradicated as this has paralysed all policies to combat opium production."
"Secondly, the 30 or so main drug traffickers identified in a 2006 UN and World Bank report must be sought, captured and put on trial so that this murderous trafficking can be stopped."
"Thirdly, NATO must support the Afghan operations to fight this trafficking, by destroying laboratories and stores and preventing drug transports."
"Fourthly, the poppy eradication actions must be carefully and selectively applied and concentrated in areas where farmers have real alternatives."
"This brings us to the points of agreement with the rapporteur."
"We all oppose indiscriminate fumigation of poppy plantations, as has been advocated by the US, which will simply swell the ranks of the Taliban without substantially altering the production of heroin."
"Finally, in the context of a package of measures to deal with the Afghan drug problem, the rapporteur's proposal for a pilot project for the legal production of opium-based analgesics should be studied."
"More than anything, this report tries to encourage the European Council to be creative and daring in the fight against heroin production in Afghanistan."
"There are no easy solutions to this problem, but we know that the terrorism and violent obscurantism advocated by the Taliban and Al-Qaeda will only be defeated when Afghanistan is freed from the clutches of drugs."
"I am about to end, Mr President."
"This report must be viewed as an urgent appeal to the Member States not to spare any efforts in the economic and political reconstruction of a country which has been so badly affected by bloody conflicts and which is so important for regional and global security."
"Madam President, I speak on this matter in a personal capacity, and not on behalf of my Group."
"The production of illicit opium in Afghanistan has flourished since US and allied forces have been in that country."
"This despite the setting-up of various anti-drug-production authorities and anti-narcotic programmes, sometimes using large amounts of EU taxpayers' money."
"So it is obvious, even to the blind, that the Afghan people will go on producing opium come what may."
"The reason for this is quite simple."
"The world's anti-narcotic agencies are growing in size, number and expertise, and they are doing their job more effectively."
"They are therefore managing to confiscate larger amounts of drugs."
"However, since the demand from drug-addiction sufferers remains unaltered and since criminal drug traffickers continue to make huge profits from the illegal supply of opium to these sick people, the price of opiates goes up and the profits from dealing in opium increase."
"Therefore, the Afghan people are just following basic liberal market principles."
"They are increasing their production in order to meet illicit trade demand and in order to increase their profits."
"So it is a pure fallacy to expect that sponsoring more opium control programmes in Afghanistan is going to have any significant effect."
"The only way to deal effectively with opium production in Afghanistan, and elsewhere for that matter, is to deal with the drug problem globally."
"The only common-sense way to do that is to legalise drugs and recognise that drug addicts are not criminals, but sick people who need help."
"If those addicts were offered therapeutic drugs in a controlled medical setting, then the chance of avoiding serious side-effects, as well as the chance of achieving detoxification, would be much improved."
"At the same time, the enormous criminality involved in drug trafficking would vanish, and all anti-drug police agencies would be scrapped, leading to phenomenal budgetary savings."
"The logic of this is so basic, but politicians worldwide are having difficulty seeing it."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue addressed by Mr Cappato's report is extremely delicate and requires careful appraisal by the European Parliament to avoid putting forward misguided and disastrous solutions, albeit motivated by good intentions."
"I wish to highlight two points."
"Firstly, to increase the production of opium and its derivatives in Afghanistan could compromise the country's reconstruction and the already difficult stabilisation of the rule of law in that unfortunate region."
"Secondly, the increasing production of opium - up by 30% this year - has not been matched by an adequate anti-drugs strategy."
"For these reasons I think the proposal put forward in the report is absolutely unacceptable, and I would stress that:"
"1. the necessary quantities of morphine are already being produced in Afghanistan under special licences and subject to supervision by the United Nations drugs agency and the Afghan Government's Ministry of Counter Narcotics;"
"2. the International Narcotics Control Board maintains that there is already a worldwide surplus of opiates for medical use;"
"3. large-scale legal production of morphine would lead to more drugs being produced; these would ultimately meet the demand for drugs on the world market."
"Once they were placed on the market cheaply they would be available to all."
"We should instead oppose drugs - always and in every case and by all means - from production, to trafficking, to illegal distribution. Demand should be curbed through a value-based policy and through ongoing, widespread prevention work and information campaigns, especially among young people."
"In a country like Afghanistan, given the conditions in which it currently finds itself, the solution proposed by this report could be regarded as an indication of surrender and defeat; it could also thwart the efforts being made by the international community, the European Union, the United Nations and the reconstruction agencies in Afghanistan through programmes to diversify away from opium plantations and into other crops, supported by financial incentives."
"Finally I would just mention that the International Narcotics Control Board has approved the Afghan Government's decision rejecting the proposal to legalise illicit opium poppy cultivation and reiterating its commitment to comply with its international treaty obligations."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I want to begin by emphasising that this report is extremely important, timely and courageous."
"The two emergencies to which it refers both merit political attention and a political response that they clearly have not yet received."
"While the security situation and the situation regarding opium production in Afghanistan are increasingly worrying, the need to supply analgesics on a global scale is one of the greatest humanitarian emergencies of our time, although unfortunately it is also one of the most ignored."
"The rapporteur, Mr Cappato, did not have an easy task with this report and it is thus all the more remarkable, and I again reiterate both my support and that of my Group."
"As he himself said, although the link between the two issues is not simple, nor necessarily immediate, it is our responsibility as politicians to analyse the complex realities in order to find complex solutions to the complex problems."
"That is exactly what this report does."
"As regards security in Afghanistan, there is no doubt that it must be a priority if we want to implement reconstruction and development programmes with future guarantees."
"The problem, however, is that certain armed groups are funded precisely as a result of the lack of regulation of opium production."
"We also know that there is illegal cultivation and trafficking of opium, which accounts for 40% of Afghanistan's gross domestic product."
"In the light of this situation, I think it is appropriate at least to study and take account of initiatives such as those of the Senlis Council, which is proposing a system to authorise the cultivation of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan. This would focus mainly on the production of painkillers such as morphine and codeine, which could also be sold to other countries that currently have little or no access to these types of vital medicines as a result of preferential trade agreements."
"It is unfortunate that this proposal, at present and in real terms, does not have stronger support from the Commission or the Afghan Government itself."
"Even more worrying is the fact that the measures being touted as alternatives often consist of chemical eradication, as stressed over and over again by the US authorities."
"If this measure were to be carried out, it would give the Taliban a new argument to defend its positions and eventually would most likely result in the farming communities ending up as rebel camps."
"It would also have very serious health and environmental repercussions."
"It is clear right from the start that aerial spraying, which is presumably what is proposed for Afghanistan, guarantees that the contamination will extend to the humans who live in the treated areas and surrounding areas. This was demonstrated at the start of year when this practice was used by Colombia to fumigate cocaine production along the border with Ecuador, with the latter consequently taking a complaint and case to The Hague."
"I am not an expert and obviously this chemical issue is much more complex, but I believe that at this stage we should be well aware of some of the disasters caused by napalm and depleted uranium."
"We should not repeat this a third time and I hope that we do not."
"(SK) Production of opium must be controlled."
"The entire international community must concern itself far more with control of opium production everywhere in the world."
"Efforts undertaken so far by the UN and its Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), as well as by the World Health Organization, to regulate the use of opiates for the treatment of pain are necessary but still insufficient."
"At the same time the international community must not allow an unrestrained use of opiates and their misuse by drug addicts."
"In my opinion it is our duty not to give up the fight against the misuse of hard drugs that quite clearly destroy their users' lives."
"Neither do I support the notion that society should supply addicts with drugs instead of trying to re-educate them and return them to reality."
"What exactly is the Cappato report about?"
"According to one point of view, the international community suffers from a lack of availability of opiates, or might suffer from such a shortage in the near future, and it is therefore necessary, under certain conditions, to buy this drug from Afghanistan."
"It is true that opiates are needed for the treatment of various illnesses, for post-operative pain relief and, last but not least, for the treatment of people with malignant diseases."
"However, this theory suffers from several fundamental defects that cannot be ignored in the present situation."
"Firstly, the current political situation in Afghanistan is unstable."
"In Afghanistan it is necessary to fight the Taliban on the one hand and to side with the opium black market on the other hand."
"This black market has a decisive impact not only on the Afghan economy but also on Afghan politics and foreign relations."
"I have serious doubts and worries over this and I will explain now why in my opinion such an approach cannot work."
"Projects involving legal poppy cultivation for the purpose of opium production will not work because the International Narcotics Control Board can only impose sanctions on a country afterwards but the country will be losing a part of the crops to the black market."
"International demand is constant."
"The Afghan Government is not capable of acting as the sole manager of opium crops."
"It is clear that under these circumstances the Government will lose the fight against traffickers."
"Competition will increase the price of opium and farmers who grow poppies legally will turn to the black market."
"In addition to that (and this is very important) Afghan prices are not competitive compared with Australia where one kilo of morphine costs USD 56, India where it is USD 159 or Turkey where it is USD 250."
"In Afghanistan the price can go up to USD 450 per kilo."
"Regarding the use for medical purposes, if Afghan opium were to be used in medical products, this would only add to further over-saturation of the market in this area."
"I am about to finish, Madam President."
"I will oppose any support by the EU and its Member States for poppy cultivation in Afghanistan for at least four reasons: insufficient infrastructure, absence of economic competitiveness, huge expansion in the wrong direction and, finally, there is no lack of opiates on the world markets at present."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Cappato for his work on this report."
"The report posed a great challenge as it attempts to respond to one of the most difficult problems in the contemporary world."
"Opium production in Afghanistan is increasing year on year."
"According to the latest annual report, opium production is now double what it was two years ago."
"In practice, Afghanistan currently has a monopoly of the supply of the deadliest drug in the world. It accounts for 93% of world production of opiates."
"Our President is numbered amongst those who believe that Afghanistan's fate is our common cause."
"The heroic struggle of the Afghan people during the Cold War period contributed to the spread of freedom across the contemporary world and to the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe."
"The European Union is now honour bound to provide Afghanistan with military, administrative and economic assistance."
"This also involves assistance in combating the production of drugs in Afghanistan."
"It should be remembered that the main incentive for Afghan growers to produce opiates is financial profit."
"This should be borne in mind when devising the European aid programme aimed at resolving the problem."
"That is why I particularly wished to commend Mr Cappato on the courageous proposals he makes in this report. They may well help to resolve the situation in question."
"One of these proposals involves offering aid through the introduction of a pilot scientific project for the production of poppies for medical purposes which will allow for further research into the extent to which awarding licences can contribute to poverty reduction, diversification of the rural economy, general development and improved security."
"In a nutshell, this is not about moralising but about the European Union making an effective contribution to resolving this problem in Afghanistan."
"(RO) According to the 2007 Afghanistan opium survey, conducted by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, opium production reached a record of 8,200 tons, representing 93% of the world production of opiates."
"Thus, 40% of the gross domestic product in Afghanistan resulted from production of and illegal trade in opium, involving 2.9 million people in this process."
"Despite this fact, only 10 countries consume 80% of the opium derivatives legally available in the world, while in over 150 countries serious treatment insufficiencies generated by the illegal trade in opium have been found."
"We should emphasize that the main source of finance of the Taliban and terrorist groups is illegal drug trafficking."
"Moreover, the actions to eradicate or destroy drugs, which are sponsored by the international community, are used by the tribal political and military leaders for their own benefit and for eliminating competition."
"Based on the things stated so far, I am convinced that a strategic and balanced approach of the process of reducing and controlling opium production should involve social and economic alternatives to favour the establishment of a rule of law and democratic institutions in Afghanistan."
"This is why such an action could represent one of the basic solutions for preventing and eradicating terrorism."
"Madam President, I consider that an anti-drug plan in Afghanistan, consisting in the control of opium quantities by using them to obtain analgesics and other derivatives, might represent one and not the only alternative economic solution and a means of reducing poppy cultivation."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner on the outstanding performance by the Altenburg Boys' Choir that we have just heard."
"I am truly impressed."
"I must now turn to less pleasant subjects, however, namely the Cappato report."
"Members who took the floor earlier persisted in quoting the figure of 40% of GDP because that is the proportion of Afghanistan's GDP that is allegedly generated by the production of narcotics."
"That figure has been accepted but I should like to emphasise that a year ago our representatives in Afghanistan clearly stated otherwise before Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"They maintained that the proportion of GDP is above 50% which is even higher."
"I am reluctant to provide explanations, but at least 10% of the population of Afghanistan lives off drug production and trade."
"We should also recognise that soldiers from the international forces are involved in this trade, along with Americans based in the country."
"I consider this to be a risky proposal, although I do of course accept it has certain underlying advantages."
"I am firmly convinced, however, that the proposal will actually result in legalisation of the trade in drugs rather than of medical aid."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a matter simply of observing that 92% of opium in the world is produced in Afghanistan but of noting the upward trend: in 2001, according to data from the UN drugs agency, 8 000 hectares were given over to opium growing while in 2006 it was 165 000; 185 tons were harvested in 2001, 6 100 in 2006."
"This obviously means that the current strategy of destroying crops by fumigation solves nothing. Rather, it has social consequences that will subsequently cause opium production to spiral."
"Crops other than opium poppies are destroyed, so farmers become ever poorer and end up in the hands of drug traffickers, namely the Taliban and the warlords sitting comfortably in government."
"The goal is therefore to provide farmers with support which at least initially must be at the same financial level as now, freeing them from dependence on drug traffickers."
"This plan will not solve the problem, of course, but no one is claiming that it will."
"We are talking about an experiment in a limited area, and it could not be otherwise in a war-torn country where land is controlled by rival gangs."
"It nevertheless constitutes a step forward, in that at least part of that opium will not end up as heroin, but as morphine."
"That, I believe, is beneficial for the West and the entire world."
"Besides, I think we must clarify the fact that there is already provision for morphine production."
"I am not aware, Commissioner, that all these problems exist in India and Turkey; if so, regulation is needed."
"The resolution before us, however, envisages a regulatory role for international bodies: not over Afghanistan as a whole, which is unmanageable at present, but over an extremely limited area."
"Furthermore, international medical associations are making plain that there is still a need for morphine today, not only in the South of the world, but paradoxically in the North too."
"It must of course be sold at official prices, but it is a painkiller and in my opinion everyone is entitled to it, including African people and poor people."
"If we are talking about expense, it undoubtedly costs less to take action of this kind and to place price controls on morphine, rather than deciding to destroy crops using the existing methods which get us nowhere."
"One last comment: I welcome the fact that this has been a pragmatic debate, not an argument between those wishing to liberalise or legalise drugs and prohibitionism."
"We are trying to take practical, pragmatic action to assist part of the Afghan population."
"Madam President, it is important that substances derived from opium, like diamorphine (also known as heroin), are available for medical purposes, especially pain relief, but poppy cultivation provides the Taliban terrorists with 20-40% of their funds, which enables them to kill NATO soldiers."
"Regrettably, Afghan opium production increased 34% this year and constitutes over 90% of global supply."
"Troops from my country, the UK, are leading the fight against the Taliban as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)."
"They do not have the mandate or the manpower to police a large-scale poppy-growing medical project - or, for that matter, to eradicate the crop."
"They have got quite enough to think about dodging bullets, without becoming part-time market-gardeners."
"However, I do have some sympathy, as a doctor, with the arguments put forward by the British Medical Association, which does support cultivating poppies - under strict supervised conditions - to ensure the ready supply of analgesics."
"My UK parliamentary colleague, Tobias Ellwood MP, has done much to develop a plan of a six-year period of tapered replacement of poppy crops in Afghanistan by cash crops diverting the opium production for medical use."
"Therefore, we should at least explore the idea of a very limited pilot licensing scheme, mindful of the danger of it being hijacked by the Taliban for illegal purposes."
"Any trial will, inevitably, have to be confined to a very small area."
"It will need support from a range of partner organisations if it is going to work."
"We certainly cannot divert our brave troops from their vital task of fighting terrorism, but it might just have some beneficial effects all round."
"On the issue of EU-Afghan aid, we need a far more coordinated approach by the EU to developing Afghan infrastructure and fighting corruption; otherwise, the Taliban will indeed prevail, as we are barely containing the Taliban in the south of the country."
"The West must wake up to the realities of Afghanistan."
"International bodies are not coordinating their activities properly."
"The rampant corruption of the Afghan Government means that provinces are losing patience with President Karzai's Government in Kabul."
"The current centralised model of government does not suit the diversity of interests and ethnicities across the country, which has never had a tradition of strong central government in the past."
"The provinces are currently given no operational funding to pursue objectives separate from Kabul."
"No long-term economic plan is being followed to harness the plentiful water supply, 92% of which - shamefully and ludicrously - runs out of the country."
"Construction of dams and irrigation systems would allow industrial-scale growth of fruit and vegetables."
"Afghanistan was once upon a time famous for its pomegranates, now very much 'in' with the health food lobby."
"Building a much needed railway system would help ship such goods onto the international market."
"If the country is to be rescued from political and economic disaster, much still urgently needs to be done, Madam Commissioner."
"Madam President, as someone who has long opposed fumigation to eradicate drugs as inefficient, often counterproductive and always with damaging side effects to human health, I am sorry that this resolution combines this position with what I believe to be a misguided attempt to encourage licit opium production in Afghanistan."
"This resolution quotes the Senlis Council report suggesting a global poppy shortage; but that is not poppy, it is poppycock."
"The International Narcotics Control Board shows world stockpiles of licit opiates equivalent to two years' demand, whilst London-based Johnson Matthey, the largest producer of morphine in the world, attest to a world surplus of more than 250 tonnes."
"The Commissioner is right to argue that conditions in Afghanistan would not allow Afghan farmers to benefit."
"This is just one of many forced assumptions in the draft resolution."
"Opium poppy is grown on less than 4% of agricultural land."
"Licit cultivation would add to illicit cultivation, not replace it."
"According to the independent Asia Foundation survey, 80% of Afghan people oppose this drugs trade."
"The Afghan Government opposes it, President Karzai calling opium 'the enemy of humanity'."
"Just weeks before the time for sowing poppy, it would send precisely the wrong political signal."
"I have every respect for the rapporteur, but on this issue, I regret, the House will divide."
"Poppy for medicine is a beguiling phrase; but the truth, instead, is that opium funds the violence and insecurity in Afghanistan."
"Poppy for corruption and terrorism would be the more apt phrase."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to express my support for the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan."
"I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his courage. Combating the illegal trade in drugs is one of the major global challenges of the contemporary world."
"The European Union should organise its activities in such a way as to try and effectively control drugs and reduce the supply of drugs in the world on the one hand and, on the other, to increase the availability of analgesics and bring down their prices."
"The proposal to legalise opium production to meet the needs of the international pharmaceutical industry may well be a useful way of attaining the aforementioned aims."
"Following the example of Turkey and Australia, licences could also be granted in Afghanistan for the cultivation of poppies used to produce useful analgesics such as morphine or codeine."
"The specific conditions prevailing in Afghanistan must be taken into account, however, if licensing is to go ahead."
"Afghanistan is the main supplier of the raw material for the production of opiates in the world."
"Opium production and trade in Afghanistan have become an important factor in the growth of GDP, the basis of cross-border trade, the main source of income for growers and the only way for most of society to access land, work, and credit."
"Legalising poppy growing in Afghanistan will make sense only if the right conditions are created."
"The security situation must improve and the country become politically stable if the national authorities are to ensure effective control of the opium production process."
"Effective democracy has to come about and state credits be made available to farmers. In addition, the conduct of economic activity should be regulated."
"(SV) Madam President, I want to begin by thanking Marco Cappato for an interesting report."
"I am responsible on the LIBE committee for the long-term budget for the drugs programme."
"On that committee we are trying to be practical in our work on how we in the EU can reduce harmful use and supply."
"I therefore think that the debate on Afghanistan is crucial, because it is the origin of the majority of the heroin (93%) that kills our young people on the streets."
"If it is possible through production of opium for medical purposes to reorganise control and production for some farmers under EU and UN supervision, then let us say yes to the project."
"This is coming from me, someone from Sweden, which has a very strong anti-drugs programme and drugs policy."
"Unfortunately I do not think that it is enough, but we must of course also look at other possibilities, such as energy production."
"However, the farmers need jobs and livelihoods, and we in the European Parliament must therefore take responsibility and demand more action."
"We will be replacing 40% of the GNP, and we need to take responsibility for that!"
"As regards paragraph 1(a) calling on the Council to oppose the use of fumigation as a means of eradicating the poppy, I take a different view."
"I think that we must also look at it in order to break the deadlock we now find ourselves in, with nothing happening."
"Lastly, a few words on overproduction."
"It does not mean that there is a greater need for analgesics among the world's poorest, among women and children."
"They use very few analgesics compared with us in the EU."
"So let us take a global view and find constructive solutions in the EU and the UN together with Afghanistan, to support peace and democracy and to combat terrorism and drugs."
"Thank you."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say something about the demand side and something about the supply side."
"On the demand side, Mr Tatarella, who is no longer with us, and Mr Howitt raised the problem of overproduction: the fact that the opium currently available actually exceeds demand for processing into opiates for drugs."
"That is true, but it is true only of current demand levels."
"What the report attempts to address is potential demand."
"Some 80% of the world's population has no access whatsoever to painkillers, even for the commonest operations, for amputations or for the care of cancer sufferers."
"That is what we are talking about, and the International Narcotics Control Board bears partial responsibility for the absence of a global policy to promote painkilling drugs."
"On the supply side, I would take the liberty of saying to the Commissioner that this proposed pilot project would indeed cost money, resources from the taxpayer."
"That is true, but the existing policy costs huge amounts of taxpayers' money."
"The problem is simple, therefore."
"What we are asking you to check is whether it is more difficult and more costly to go in and forcibly uproot crops from one area which will then very probably be moved to the adjoining area, or else to buy up that harvest and process it on the spot, under supervision by the international community, so that it cannot be used to produce heroin but is used there and then to produce medicines."
"The second alternative is less costly, in my opinion, including for European citizens and taxpayers."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I think it was a very interesting discussion."
"Again, I appreciate Mr Cappato's courageous idea."
"But, again, let me also argue and say: yes, it is true that our strategy has not yet been successful."
"But, as I said before, it is not only a strategy with regard to drugs; it is a hugely complex situation."
"We are in a post-conflict situation and, of course, all the different elements are there: NATO, the European Union and the UN."
"We had these meetings in New York exactly on this matter."
"Now let me come back to the drugs question."
"There are indeed problems on the demand and on the supply side."
"On the demand side, there is, at this moment, no demand for additional licit opium for medical purposes according to the International Narcotics Control Board."
"And I hear that world demand is indeed fully met now, and Turkey and India had to cut their production in 2005 and 2006."
"The stockpiles were so high that they would last worldwide for two years."
"That is one point."
"I understand your saying that maybe people in other parts of the world do not even have the possibility of having medical treatment without pain relief."
"I understand that."
"But this is something that you are taking out of context."
"These are the realities today."
"On the supply side, let us also look a little at the proportions."
"Afghanistan is, as some colleagues have said, the country that produces the highest share of opium and drugs: 8 200 tonnes."
"If it were even allowed to produce legally, there would only be a possibility for a small amount and that would only be very small."
"So, even if there were a possibility, I think that would represent only five tonnes of opium production. Now, comparing 8 200 tonnes to five tonnes: this is nothing!"
"So you see, neither on the supply side nor on the demand side is there a real balance."
"Therefore, apart from this very complex situation, I think your idea is courageous;"
"I agree."
"But I think that, for Afghanistan, it is maybe not useful at this stage."
"On the contrary, I think what we have to do as a strategy is to have a combination of sustaining Afghanistan's long-term development and offering farmers alternatives to poppy cultivation, combined with improved governance."
"So the focus will be on justice and police, as we will try to do and as we have started doing."
"We have also been at the forefront on the rural livelihood agenda and helping to support legitimate employment."
"To this end, the European Commission is also supporting the Afghan Government's National Drug Control Strategy through supply-control and demand-reduction initiatives and the improvement of governance."
"For instance, we have been supporting the Law and Order Trust Fund, up to now with some EUR 135 million, while a sum of EUR 70 million is planned for the next two years."
"But I must also say, since we have been concentrating on rural development, on health care and on justice, and also helping on the police and justice reform, plus alternative production, as the European Union and European Commission, we cannot do everything alone in Afghanistan."
"This I would like to say to the honourable Member Mr Tannock, because I think he is addressing only us, the European Commission and European Union, but there are many other important actors there."
"I think we all have to get our act together."
"This is what we are trying to do more and more through a very coordinated strategy, which, on the one hand, is going to combat drugs."
"But, again, I think that, maybe, it is too early."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments in the EU: attachment of bank accounts (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Green Paper on improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments in the European Union: the attachment of bank accounts."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, that was an interesting debate."
"We now move on to a very different subject area."
"We will see if we can achieve an outcome sooner or later."
"There is a saying which, I presume, is understood throughout Europe, namely that money does not bring happiness, but it does bring peace of mind."
"In that spirit, let me start by wishing all our citizens in Europe peace of mind."
"However, if you are owed money by another person, if someone owes you money from a sale, damages or similar, this often gives cause for concern rather than peace of mind."
"Will the debtor evade his commitments?"
"Will he conceal his money or his assets, perhaps at an even later hour than our debate this evening?"
"All Member States have procedures which aim to prevent this from occurring."
"They include attachments, injunctions, arrest and seizure: there are many different terms."
"Procedures vary very widely and the situation is extremely complicated, and there is of course the language issue as well."
"Anyone wishing to make use of Member States' various cross-border procedures may well find that the horse has bolted, or as we say in Germany, the hare is already on the other side of the hill."
"In other words, the debtor has had time to hide his assets."
"This is now a widespread problem across Europe's borders, and it is becoming increasingly pressing given that we are all aiming for a single payment area with cash-free transactions."
"That means that the opportunities to hide assets on the other side of the hill are steadily growing."
"That is why the Commission has taken the initiative and, I would emphasise, is quite right to do so."
"It has presented a very good Green Paper which is comprehensive and detailed, albeit with some points which will undoubtedly require further clarification."
"That is still ahead of us and is the purpose of the hearing."
"At this stage, the European Parliament cannot deal with all aspects in detail, and neither can I, so I shall simply mention some of the key points."
"First of all, although this can really be taken for granted, the report is only about the attachment of bank accounts and temporarily freezing bank deposits."
"It is not about final settlement."
"Secondly, it is only about financial assets held in bank accounts."
"It does not deal with injunctions or the attachment of other assets."
"That raises the question of whether our purposes would really be served through the harmonisation of 27 different systems."
"In my view, that would be an extremely unwieldy approach and would take forever to achieve."
"It encroaches on so many other areas that it would not be helpful."
"The right approach is what the Commission has in mind: an independent and additional European procedure, preferably in the form of a regulation, to exist in parallel to the national provisions, which would remain in force."
"I should also mention the 'Brussels I' Regulation at this juncture."
"The Regulation which already exists is not adequate."
"The creditor must not only demonstrate credibly and summarily that he has a claim but must also demonstrate the risk."
"Our particular concern, which I share, is to protect the creditor."
"What I do not want, under any circumstances, is a situation in which creditors or third parties suffer harm precisely because we have a European regulation."
"That would reverberate on Europe itself."
"In some cases, attachment without just cause can destroy a person's livelihood."
"I would simply like to mention the main points: that a creditor may be liable for damages arising for the debtor, that the creditor should be obliged to institute the main proceedings within a fixed time limit, that the creditor may be required to provide security, that the debtor should be entitled to appeal, that a procedure should not be selected which takes an eternity but which is broadly in line with the previous proceedings, that there should be provisions preventing too much money being frozen for the benefit of the creditor, and that the debtor must be guaranteed the wherewithal to live on."
"There is the problem of trust accounts."
"If there is to be any possibility of attachment here - and I will leave that open - they certainly need to be specially protected."
"The same applies to joint accounts, although this is not the same thing; in fact, the two are not directly related."
"The point is that it is also important to protect third parties, and special protection measures are required for any third parties involved."
"I would just mention that standardised formal notices would be useful for banking communications and, in this connection, would like to conclude by saying that studies comparing the laws in force as well as detailed analyses are undoubtedly required."
"I would also, and specifically, like to thank the Commission for these comprehensive analyses and studies, and also thank all my colleagues."
"We worked together very well."
"I assume that there will be a broad consensus in favour of the report."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I think the report is an interesting contribution to dealing with a very complex issue: the difficulty of cross-border debt recovery."
"I think the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, is to be congratulated for paving the way for a general European solution to the current fragmentation of national rules on enforcement, which severely hampers cross-border debt collection."
"This situation is of particular concern to a creditor who has the misfortune of seeing his debtor swiftly moving his money out of a known account into another account in the same or another Member State."
"Therefore, the Commission welcomes Parliament's report."
"I will carefully consider the main concerns expressed by the rapporteur and by Parliament in relation to the Green Paper."
"In particular, the form and the scope of the possible Community instrument, the effects of future procedure, the legal condition for granting an attachment order, the compensation of costs and the protection of debtors are important issues that have been highlighted by the rapporteur."
"I can confirm to you that any proposal or communication in this area will be preceded by an in-depth evaluation and impact assessment, in close cooperation with this Parliament."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, I welcome the Green Paper and look forward to an early follow-up on more concrete proposals."
"It is clearly in the interests of fostering cross-border trade for businesses to have the confidence to be able to recover debt."
"Citizens also need that confidence at an individual and private level."
"My opinion received unanimous support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, not because we reached hard-fought compromises, but because there was a common view from the outset."
"I am pleased that almost everything that we adopted has fitted into, or been covered by, the final report by the Committee on Legal Affairs, for which I thank the rapporteur."
"Two points that did not make it into the report were the possibility of applying attachment to joint accounts and the investigation of optional domestic use of the cross-border provision."
"In a less prescriptive form, there is an amendment concerning joint accounts that has gained support elsewhere."
"It is clearly a loophole if a nominal joint account enables evasion of attachment orders, but genuine third party funds must be protected."
"Concerning the optional domestic use of the cross-border provision, I note what colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs said about the measure only being possible cross-border, be that for legal reasons or for practical reasons of achieving something in a reasonable timescale."
"However, unless alternative remedies exist in those Member States where attachment is not possible, or is extremely difficult, there could be a competitive mismatch, at least from the business aspect, with the rather unusual situation of a cross-border business being better off than a domestic one."
"Perhaps Member States will take note of this and competition will deliver what we do not or cannot legislate for."
"Madam President, I welcome the Commission's initiative on the cross-border regulation of the attachment and temporary freezing of bank accounts."
"I congratulate you in particular, Mr Frattini, as the competent Commissioner for this initiative."
"The Commission's Green Paper on this issue has laid down procedures for dealing with the problem, which arises when the enforcement of court judgments is avoided because of the operation or transfer of bank accounts outside national borders."
"The measure under discussion is contained in the strategy for developing judicial cooperation between EU Member States."
"The measure is a move in the right direction; it must be completed soon with the submission of a relevant proposal."
"The cause of justice is not served if civil or criminal court judgments cannot be enforced."
"For this reason, the proposal relating to the attachment and freezing of cross-border bank accounts that is under consideration really contributes to the evolution and consolidation of justice."
"The European Parliament rightly takes a positive view of the Commission's initiative and of the judicial procedure under preparation."
"The Lechner report and the opinions of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Finance set out the basic parameters for preparing a balanced proposal for a Council decision on the issue."
"I congratulate Mr Lechner on his succinct but very informative and comprehensive report."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, I hold positions that essentially coincide with nearly all of his."
"The report is expected to be approved by an overwhelming majority."
"It emphasises the need to meet the requirements for issuing a cross-border attachment order for bank accounts."
"It also stresses the concurrent need to protect the procedure against abuse and to provide guarantees of compensation to the alleged debtor if his order turns out to be to be null and void."
"I believe that a freezing order can serve, at the end of court proceedings, as an enforcement measure for a final exequatur judgment."
"This is not Mr Lechner's view, but it must seriously be considered when the relevant Commission proposal is submitted, in the interests of preventing unnecessary duplication of proceedings."
"I call on the Commission to proceed at once with preparation of the proposal on this issue."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, an unquestionable weakness of the current provisions of enforcement legislation is the situation in which, having verified enforceability of a court order in another Member State, enforcement remains the exclusive competence of national legislation."
"Pursuant to Community legal acts currently in force there is no way of obtaining an order to attach a bank account that could be enforced across the territory of the entire European Union."
"That is why a European system for an order allowing the attachment of bank accounts seems to be such an appropriate and necessary solution. It would allow creditors to secure the sums due or the value of their claim by making it impossible to withdraw or transfer funds deposited in one or many bank accounts across the territory of the European Union."
"Such a system should be created following the development of an additional independent procedure that would stand alongside national provisions with the proviso that it would only apply to cross-border issues."
"It is worth emphasising that such an order would only have a preventive effect."
"In other words, it would block the debtor's funds in the latter's bank account, without transferring them to the creditor's account."
"The court must of course refrain from hearing or informing the debtor of the proceedings before attaching his or her bank account, otherwise the effect might be the opposite of what was intended."
"The sum to be attached should be calculated on the basis of the creditor's claim."
"It should be emphasised, however, that the debtor must have the right to appeal the order issued, and the competent institution to hear that appeal should be the court where the order was issued."
"Provision should also be made for derogations from enforcement to allow the basic needs of the debtor and his or her family to be met."
"Clearly, at that stage, additional comparative legal analysis would be required, as many aspects call for further investigation."
"Nonetheless, the fact remains that the introduction of a Community legal procedure such as a European order for the attachment of bank accounts aimed at streamlining the implementation of monetary claims and improving effectiveness would be a milestone along the road to the creation of a European economic and judicial area."
"In conclusion, I should like to congratulate Mr Lechner on an outstanding and well-prepared report."
"The House must be well aware, of course, of how difficult it is to change Union provisions, particularly in this field."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I want to begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Lechner, on the excellent report he has produced: it is both balanced and moderate."
"Here at this time of the night, I cannot help but think about what attachment means."
"In practice, in day-to-day life, normally the creditors are large institutions with a great deal of economic power while the debtors are usually people in a much weaker economic situation."
"Indeed, one of the nicest poems in the Spanish language is dedicated to the attachment of a poor unfortunate worker."
"It is true that if there are no attachments - if creditors do not have the possibility of recovering their claim - those who need credit will not be able to get it."
"Since I think we are all a bit bored, I am going to tell you a story about one of the dictatorships we had in Spain, that of General Primo de Rivera."
"He believed that attachment of the assets of military personnel was an insult to the military profession."
"He therefore banned the attachments of accounts of military personnel."
"As a consequence, the banks refused to lend money to the military, and the military then had to ask the General to allow them to be subject to attachments again."
"That is only a story, however."
"I believe that Mr Lechner has managed to achieve a balance in terms of the protection of debtors' rights, but I still have one question, and Mr Frattini will probably be aware of what I want to say in this respect."
"When it comes down to it, the large debtors, the people who are involved in major financial operations and who end up owing billions to thousands of defenceless people, those large debtors do not usually have their accounts in a bank in Belgium, Brussels or Strasbourg, or even in London."
"They usually have them in tax havens."
"This, of course, is not covered by the provisions of the Commission's Green Paper. However, since I know that Commissioner Frattini has an interest in this matter, I will put the question to him: would it not be advisable to come up with a way of ensuring that these large international criminals who ruin the lives of thousands of families could also have their assets attached?"
"As I said, this is a scenario that is outside the scope of the Green Paper, outside the scope of what we are discussing tonight. However, since the main topics already appear to have been discussed very clearly by the previous speakers and by Commissioner Frattini himself, I think that it is something that we must examine."
"I am sure that Commissioner Frattini will have something to add in this respect."
"In conclusion, I just want to reiterate once again my congratulations to Mr Lechner: I think that he has produced a balanced report and that the position of debtors, of poor debtors, which means most citizens, is guaranteed."
"I hope that the Commission will soon present us with a legislative text that enables the cross-border credit market to continue to function."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Lechner on his report."
"I want to start with, as it were, a confession."
"Before I arrived in this House I was a lawyer."
"In fact I was not only a lawyer, but a lawyer dealing in debt collecting, often cross-border."
"My experience in this area is that the most damage is caused to small enterprises that have plucked up courage to trade cross-border, and are then ruined by a bad debt and a professional debtor hiding in another country."
"I therefore consider this initiative to be a way, if we can get it right, of boosting Europe's economy and encouraging cross-border trade."
"We have to get tough."
"The payment order was a step in the right direction."
"This is the next piece in the jigsaw."
"However, I have two points to make."
"First of all, we are dealing with cross-border cases only."
"We accept the reality of that constraint, but what I do not want to see is creditors having to make two applications to courts: one in respect of debtors in the home country, followed by another in a different country, cross-border."
"That may give the debtor warning and it may cause all sorts of complications."
"We therefore need to ensure that there are concurrent procedures available."
"Secondly, this is, of course, a balance of interests between the creditors and the debtors."
"We have a good system in England, under which when you are given such an interim measure, you have to provide an undertaking to the court, in damages, to respect the interests of third parties."
"This may be the bank that has to organise the attachment, or a third party that might hold a joint account."
"I would recommend a system along those lines."
"I commend the report and the ideas in it."
"I believe it could do much to boost Europe's economy if we get things right."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Green Paper on improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments in the European Union represents a further stage in the development of a European area of justice."
"I endorse the view put forward by the rapporteur in this report and support the introduction of a swift and effective procedure for obtaining an order for attachment of bank accounts in the European Union."
"In the context of ongoing integration in the Single Euro Payments Area, a legal provision of this nature seems to be both appropriate and desirable."
"In view of the many difficulties involved in investigating claims, it is my belief that the European Union should introduce an independent additional procedure that would stand alongside national provisions."
"Such a procedure ought to apply only in cross-border cases and relate solely to funds in bank accounts and not to other assets."
"It is simply a case of provisionally securing a creditor's claim, not of finally settling it."
"Unjustified attachment may have serious consequences for the debtor and impact negatively on confidence in the European legal system."
"I therefore believe that particular care should be taken to protect the debtor."
"This could involve, for instance, submission of security by the creditor, the right to object, limiting the amount liable or even a requirement for the creditor to submit an application for court proceedings to be brought regarding the main action."
"(PL) Madam President, the provisions relating to enforcement legislation are often described as the Achilles' heel of the European system of justice concerning civil cases."
"To date, no legislative motion has been submitted regarding the actual means of enforcing judgments."
"Enforcing a court order after establishing its enforceability in another country is still the exclusive competence of national law."
"The current variations between the principles for debt recovery in individual Member States of the European Union seriously hinder the recovery of cross-border debts."
"Creditors seeking enforcement of an order in another country are confronted with unfamiliar legal systems and legal requirements. They also have to cope with the language barrier, which entails additional costs and delays the enforcement procedure."
"Difficulties relating to the recovery of cross-border debts hinder the free movement of payment orders within the Union and impact negatively on the proper operation of the internal market."
"Payments that are delayed or never made endanger the interests of companies and consumers alike."
"The Commission's proposal to introduce a single European legal instrument that would be independent of national legislation and stand alongside it therefore seems to be entirely appropriate, if not essential."
"Article 65(c) of the Treaty establishing the European Community could serve as the legal basis for such a document."
"In this connection, pursuant to the provisions of the Green Paper, the creditor should have the right to submit an application for an order to be issued for the attachment of bank accounts before the start of the main proceedings."
"In view of the provisional nature of the procedure, the creditor should, however, be required to justify his or her claim and also the urgent need for an attachment order to be issued."
"Unjustified attachment can of course have very serious implications for a debtor, and can even deprive the latter of the means with which to satisfy his or her basic needs."
"Other important issues are a debtor's right to contest the order and setting the amount to be paid."
"Setting a single limit for the sum to be exempted from enforcement at European Union level does not seem to be a good idea."
"Such decisions should remain within the competence of the legal system of the debtor's home country."
"As regards serving orders for the seizure of assets from bank accounts, it is important to ensure that uniform standards concerning communication between courts and banks are established within the European Union."
"It seems essential to regulate the matter of recovery of cross-border debts by way of adoption of the relevant legal act."
"It is, however, important not to overlook the need to first undertake an in-depth study of the provisions already in force in individual Community countries and to assess the effectiveness of alternative solutions in relation to European provisions."
"I should like to conclude by thanking Mr Lechner for a well-considered and well-prepared report."
"(PL) Madam President, the problem of effective enforcement of monetary claims across the territory of the European Union is very important in terms of ensuring proper functioning of the internal market."
"It is worth considering Community action in this regard."
"There is a very important saying that was impressed on me when I was a trainee lawyer, according to which when we do someone a favour we become indebted to them."
"This is sometimes true."
"Delaying payments or failing to make them altogether endangers the interests of companies and consumers alike."
"The differences in the efficiency of debt recovery that currently exist within the European Union can threaten the competitiveness of companies whose activities extend beyond the borders of a particular Member State."
"The systems for enforcing orders differ between individual Member States."
"In some states they are more effective than in others."
"As things stand at present, a debtor may almost instantly transfer funds from accounts known to the creditor to other accounts located in the same country or in another Member State."
"This makes it practically impossible for creditors to block those funds."
"Furthermore, creditors seeking enforcement of an order in another Member State are confronted with a different legal system and procedural requirements."
"The language barrier and cost of the proceedings represent additional obstacles."
"I therefore believe that we should respond positively to the proposal to create a European system to attach bank accounts."
"Bearing in mind the increasing integration in the Single Euro Payments Area, legal regulation of this type is both appropriate and essential."
"I would like to thank Mr Lechner for this report. I am sure it will represent a turning point in the Union's legal system."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just a brief remark about the comments made by Mr Medina Ortega and also to thank everyone who has spoken."
"This European instrument, this European attachment order that is under discussion, really could complement national legislation and hence deal with the serious infringements of creditors' rights that occur on a transnational basis."
"I very much agree with Mr Medina Ortega about the fact that we must give thought to attachment, or protection, as it were, in respect of people who take refuge in tax havens."
"Clearly, as you are all aware, Europe has no unilateral power to act."
"What we must work towards, in my opinion, is closer cooperation between the judiciary, the financial investigation authorities and the major banking groups which operate in these so-called tax havens. We need to convince those countries' governments that it is ultimately in their interest to cooperate with the European Union."
"Therefore, even if we do not have an active instrument in the near future, a unilateral tool to counter the system of tax havens, we ought to be able to use the instrument of democracy, on the one hand, and that of judicial and financial cooperation, on the other, to tackle what is a very real problem."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences - Mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on criminal matters and sentences:"
"by Mrs Esteves, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council framework decision on the recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences [06480/2007 - C6-0129/2007 - 2007/0807 (CNS)];"
"by Mr Varvitsiotis, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council framework decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgements in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union [09688/2007 - C6-0209/2007 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I support both initiatives, which are, in my view, complementary and which would both enable the greater social reintegration of persons sentenced either to a non-custodial sentence or to a custodial sentence in a Member State other than the one in which they habitually reside."
"We also support initiatives such as these, which implement the principle of mutual recognition."
"The draft texts of both initiatives have evolved very much in the course of discussions in the Working Party on Cooperation in Criminal Matters."
"Many of Ms Esteves's and Mr Varvitsiotis' suggested amendments during the first parliamentary consultation have already been taken up during the course of the following discussions."
"I thank both rapporteurs for their interesting reports, and, in particular on the first initiative, Ms Esteves has carried out a very rigorous legal analysis of the German/French text."
"She has identified the main problems as being the different sanctions available in the Member States and the problem of how to operate mutual recognition when one's own system has no precise equivalent."
"The other problem she, as rapporteur, has highlighted is that of how to deal with a breach of non-custodial conditions, and of which Member State - the issuing Member State or the executing Member State - should be responsible for imposing the sanction for that breach."
"Some comments on some main amendments."
"I have a comment on Amendment 1 on the first report."
"The title will have to change on adoption, since conditional sentences have been removed from the scope."
"This is also relevant to a number of different amendments which refer to conditional sentences."
"Amendment 12 relates to the definition of 'lawful place of residence'."
"This is currently under discussion in Council, as is the possibility of going to another Member State for work or study."
"I refer, in particular, also to Amendment 16."
"I can inform you that discussions of the text in Council are going very well, and the Portuguese Presidency hopes - with the full support of the Commission - for political agreement by the end of December 2007, before the end of the Portuguese Presidency."
"On the second initiative, the initiative on the European Enforcement Order and transfer of sentenced persons, I welcome the second report by Mr Varvitsiotis, which states that issues raised by the European Parliament in the first report have largely been taken into consideration."
"This is correct: we took into consideration amendments and proposals by Parliament."
"Concerning the sole amendment suggested by the rapporteur concerning the new Recital 2a, I fully share the substance of the statement that procedural rights in criminal proceedings are a very crucial element for ensuring mutual confidence among Member States, and I also agree that it is highly regrettable that this instrument on procedural rights was not adopted, despite the support from Parliament and despite our efforts to make possible an agreement on procedural rights."
"This, unfortunately, was not possible."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I must firstly thank the Members who worked very closely with me on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and who helped me with their critical contributions, in particular Mr Guardans, Mr Demetriou and, last but definitely not least, Mr Correia."
"We all greatly miss Mr Correia who was a Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and a fellow Portuguese Member."
"He died after having helped me with this report."
"I think that the best tribute I can pay him is a kind of public promise that I will try, through my presence in the European Parliament, to help realise his ideas on Europe as a project of ambition and vision and as a giant capable of bringing its culture of rights to the world."
"It is this tribute that I want to pay, here today, to our friend and colleague, Mr Fausto Correia."
"I should like to briefly summarise the issues raised by this report."
"I must firstly stress that this report, like all other reports, is an open report: open to seeking and finding the best solutions."
"There are two fundamental benefits to this initiative by France and Germany, as underlined by the Commissioner."
"The first is that, by encouraging the recognition and supervision of alternative measures to prison sentences, we are promoting a political culture which will make the courts more likely to apply these measures."
"We are promoting the humanisation of criminal law in the Member States and the quality of European criminal law."
"The second benefit concerns the fact that this initiative will help to make criminal law increasingly European in terms of being more harmonised and less feudalised within the European space."
"In reality, European integration, which took a fundamental step forward in the recent Treaty on which agreement was reached in Lisbon last weekend, is at a level which criminal law in the European space has not yet been able to match."
"It is essential that we increasingly promote a culture not just of mutual recognition, but also of harmonisation in criminal law in terms of the design of sentences, their method of enforcement, the relationship between offenders and society and even greater equivalence between the substantive and procedural criminal laws of Member States."
"Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, by referring to a set of fundamental principles forming the common principles of the European Union, clearly shows that this only makes sense if we increasingly have European criminal laws."
"Most of these principles are protected by criminal legislation."
"Specifically on this report, I should like to make just two or three comments which I regard as fundamental."
"Firstly, Parliament's contribution has particularly underlined the need for the distribution of powers between the issuing State and the executing State."
"There is a clear logic to the State which exercises a given power applying its own laws thereto."
"Secondly, there is the principle that refusal is the exception, so that the future framework decision can be as effective as possible."
"Thirdly, there is the logic according to which it is impossible to adapt the nature of measures, otherwise the principle of strict penal legality will be called into question."
"Finally, there is also a need to safeguard the principle of hearing defendants in cases involving the revocation of a suspended sentence or the imposition of a conditional sentence."
"I will end, Madam President, by saying that all this progress in European criminal law will, despite everything, soon seem very limited to us."
"Europe will only be achieved as a project when we can establish anthropocentric and cosmopolitan laws, which must include criminal laws that are more harmonised and less divided by borders."
"rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, I should like to begin by turning my thoughts respectfully to our late fellow Member, Mr Correia, who contributed substantially to the compilation of the correct and comprehensive report cited by the Vice-President of the Commission."
"I should like to point out that the topic we are discussing today has a very long history."
"It began in 1983with a Council of Europe convention, which was accepted by all the Member States."
"However, the convention stipulated that a prisoner could be transferred from one country to another only with the prisoner's consent."
"The convention was therefore ineffective."
"A second convention was drawn up stipulating that the consent of the prisoner was not required, but this convention was not signed by all the Member States of the Council of Europe, and thus the attempt foundered."
"On the new initiative of three EU Member States - Austria, Finland and Sweden - a draft was submitted, which was properly prepared by the Council and issued as a framework convention."
"What does this framework decision provide?"
"It provides that a sentenced citizen of an EU Member State must be transferred to the Member State of which he is a national or in which he has his permanent residence or all his interests."
"This is very reasonable because we can see that rehabilitating him will become much easier when he comes out of prison: someone transferred to the Member State of their nationality will have much easier access to the language, and their friends and relatives, and will be in a familiar environment."
"This report, as you will recall, Madam President, was approved in June 2006 by a large majority in Parliament."
"Unfortunately, it met with a bureaucratic response from Poland, which, by various procedural ploys, delayed the implementation of this framework decision."
"We thus find ourselves in the midst of renewed deliberation."
"Fortunately, with a concession to Poland's demands, the problem has finally been solved satisfactorily."
"However, let me point out, Madam President, that if we think like this, talk of a united Europe is impossible."
"We cannot speak of a European consensus when each Member State, for its own petty reasons, undermines such a sound measure."
"In such cases, what sort of united Europe are we talking about?"
"I should like to underline that the Constitutional Treaty presented two days ago by the Prime Minister of Portugal fortunately provides for an augmented majority in this area, too, so the veto will finally be lifted."
"To conclude, let me thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, for his contribution, and express the wish that, after 25 years, this well-conceived initiative will finally become a reality as soon as possible."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, freedom, security and justice are three words we keep hearing in the EU."
"They are the three components of the Hague Programme that, in combination and individually, were invoked to serve all the Member States of the Union."
"The principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments, which eight years ago, in 1999, was described by the European Council in Tampere as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation, is making no progress."
"The few steps needed to implement this principle are being taken very slowly."
"Mr Varvitsiotis has correctly identified and dealt with the root cause of the problem: the individual, nationalist positions held by various states."
"The Council Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in criminal matters involving deprivation of liberty issued in other EU Member States is the subject of Mr Varvitsiotis' report."
"The decision proves how slow and sporadic the action has been in creating an area of freedom, security and justice because this decision is only one of many measures that should have already been taken, and because it took such a long time to prepare."
"In any case, we welcome the completion of the deliberation procedure and the adoption of a common position on the issue of recognising court judgments in criminal matters."
"Mr Varvitsiotis deserves praise for his contribution to the favourable outcome of the proposal, which we have adopted and shall be voting in favour of."
"The recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences, the subject of Mrs Esteves' report, is certainly another step among the many that must be taken to implement the principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments."
"The Franco-German proposal seeks to reintegrate sentenced persons into society."
"It proposes to allow them to serve, in their Member State of residence, suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences imposed by the courts of other Member States."
"The rapporteur has done excellent work and I congratulate her. However, I believe the definition given for 'lawful and ordinary residence' is incorrect."
"Furthermore, the use of the word 'unacceptable' for violation of human rights is unnecessary, because there are no acceptable violations."
"I understand, however, that there is a problem in the translation of these two terms, and I therefore call on Mrs Esteves to make the necessary verbal amendments so that the text can be rendered correctly in all languages."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the European Union is not simply a common economic area."
"The European dimension must also be understood now in terms of intensive political and legal integration within the Union."
"The Union is an example of a political organisation bringing together the interests of individual Member States within the framework of a developing cosmopolitan legal system. A number of the criminal law provisions of Member States are still at an initial stage of harmonisation."
"Nonetheless, we should rejoice at the fact that relations between Member States are characterised by trust in each other's legal systems. This facilitates cooperation and makes it possible for the executing State to recognise a decision taken by authorities in the issuing State."
"It should be noted that the humanisation of criminal law permeates through to the European legal system. The latter is of course based on the value of the fundamental entity, namely the human being."
"European policy should be consistent in every respect as regards handing down and enforcing sentences and the general links between convicted persons and society."
"Making it easier to impose alternative punishments will help to promote a humanitarian approach to criminal law and sentencing, and consequently to European law."
"Particular attention must be paid to the convicted person's right and opportunity to be reintegrated into society."
"A wider range of alternative sentences replacing custodial sentences should be considered."
"It is important to bear in mind that according to international standards the status of a convicted person is the basis for assessing the extent to which the judicial system of every political community may be deemed to be civilised."
"Consequently, the framework decisions on enhanced cooperation in the area of criminal law presented today are worthy of support. After all, the ongoing harmonisation of criminal law provisions across the Member States is a fundamental condition for the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice."
"Madam President, I would like to focus on one aspect of what is being proposed."
"It is evident that the raison d'être for this particular legislation is a humanitarian basis."
"If one looks at why a judgment given in one particular country can be enforced in another with regard to the criminal and penal sentences, one appreciates that, basically, what we are doing is making life for the person who has been convicted a better one: being closer, perhaps, to his family, being closer, perhaps, to his place of origin."
"In fact I am surprised that, whilst we are taking this legislation from a humanitarian point of view, one of the criteria that is absent when it comes to transferring a person from serving a sentence in one particular state to another is, in my view, the humanitarian aspect."
"We are basing the criteria, basically, on nationality, citizenship or legal permanent residence."
"On the other hand, we do talk about, as a proposal and counterproposal, 'close links', but the humanitarian aspect as a criterion in itself is absent."
"Let us take a particular case, for instance: it would not be possible for a person who is not a citizen of an EU country serving imprisonment in an EU country to serve closer to his homeland, because this aspect - the humanitarian criterion - has been left out."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Business registers for statistical purposes (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Mr Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common framework for business registers for statistical purposes and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93 [07656/5/2007 - C6-0218/2007 -."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, fellow Members, it is now so late that I can count just four of us here, including myself."
"However, one of the next speakers is a Quaestor who, I am sure, will use this opportunity to ensure that these forms of so-called debate, which in reality only take place for the purpose of the records, become more efficient and rational."
"Nevertheless, I am grateful, Commissioner, for your willingness to come here and subject yourself to this."
"To my mind, better governance, efficient and transparent governance, would be rather different from these debates at such an ungodly hour."
"As to the matter in hand, we have come here to resume work on an issue which goes back some time."
"It is a key area, namely statistics."
"On the one hand, we have an entirely justified and necessary interest on the part of most persons involved in the political process, which is to inform themselves and to find out more quickly and in detail about linkages which may exist, especially in the corporate sector, and how they work, especially across borders: borders which, happily, we have already dismantled successfully between many countries throughout Europe."
"We have thus taken up the Commission's proposal and taken it forward in response to this need, always being careful - through my numerous discussions at the time with my excellent colleague from the secretariat of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, from first reading onwards - not to create even more red tape, not to erect even more bureaucratic obstacles, and not to inflict even more form-filling on businesses in the Member States through the amendments and simplifications and, in some cases, more precise controls that this entails."
"This goal has been achieved."
"What has not been achieved is a situation in which the data available on the basis of the new directive is genuinely accessible to a wider interested public."
"We could have done more to facilitate transparency."
"Nonetheless, it was important for the House to achieve swift and clear results from first reading onwards."
"Unfortunately, having achieved an appropriate consensus, and soon after its adoption here - I am not aware that there was even one vote against in the House - amendments were made in other areas of the legislature, with the result that the report, which we believed to have been dealt with conclusively, suddenly could no longer continue in its present form."
"This has meant that at second reading, we have now had to make some minor changes consisting of just two words in three places."
"Taking account of all that has happened, the question which arises, as I have said, is this: was that really necessary?"
"Would it not have been possible to inform us, through better coordination of the exchange of information on and during decision-making, so that we could have spared ourselves this whole evening debate, which is a debate in name only?"
"We could have dealt with it at first reading, if we had adopted the report a few weeks later."
"The fact that we are sitting here at all is a classic example of how, in the European Union, it is often the minor detail which causes the hitches."
"There is an urgent need to push through all the initiatives which aim to achieve better coordination of the minor details of the legislative processes which are then played out on a large scale in Europe."
"This would then remove any future need for the type of debate which we are enduring now and would also save money, if we consider what it costs - from the first to the second reading, with all the preparations, all the interpreters and translations, and all these meetings at such a late hour - which would certainly be in the European Union's interests and improve its work on behalf of citizens."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very grateful to Parliament for this report, which should allow an agreement with the Council at second reading on the issue of statistical business registers, which is extremely relevant for the production of harmonised, complete and reliable statistics on business and other economic activities."
"This new regulation will extend the business registers framework to cover the whole economy by including, on a mandatory basis, two sectors that are currently optional: agriculture and public administration."
"But the most important innovation of this proposal is the extension to data on multinational enterprise groups active in the EU."
"This is a key input in the context of economic globalisation."
"Indeed, the informal European Council last week in Lisbon supported the approach proposed by the Commission to ensure that European policies are aimed at defending European citizens in a globalised economy."
"To this end, it is crucial for policymakers and socioeconomic agents to have at their disposal accurate information on the activity of any kind of transnational companies operating here in Europe."
"Concerning the alleviation of the burden of respondents to the surveys needed to produce statistics, the Commission, in the context of the overall drive towards better regulation, has paid particular attention to the simplification of the collection of statistics."
"Business registers form an important building block in a number of projects aimed at reducing the statistical burden of businesses."
"They are necessary for the efficient use of business-related data from different sources, such as a combined use of administrative data and targeted statistical surveys."
"Of course, no new surveys are needed to fulfil the new requirements of the regulation, which can be implemented using nationally available additional administrative sources and feedback from existing surveys."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, let me say to the rapporteur - who has just complained that we are sitting here debating at an ungodly hour - that I was a Member of a national parliament for 20 years."
"I do not know whether he has ever sat in a national parliament, but there, one becomes accustomed to holding night-time sessions, and for me, this is not an ungodly hour."
"The rapporteur may well claim that the matter should have been dealt with more swiftly, but may I remind him that he himself took his time before declaring himself willing to produce this report."
"(FR) Madam President, I would just like to say all the same that the current Regulation on business registers, which relates to the harmonisation of business registers used by Member States for statistical purposes, dates back to 1993 and is now partly obsolete."
"The proposal for a regulation contains two major amendments in respect of the new data requirements that have been identified in this context."
"All businesses engaging in economic activity contribute to GDP and their local units, as well as the corresponding legal units, will henceforth have to be registered on a compulsory basis."
"Some business sectors are registered on an optional basis under the current version of the Regulation."
"My second point is that financial links and enterprise groups should also be covered and data on multinational groups and their advisory units should be exchanged between the Member States and Eurostat."
"As regards the recommendation for second reading of the report, we have been presented with two technical amendments that have been proposed by the legal service of the European Parliament."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has proposed, as I do myself, to follow the recommendations of the legal service, which quite rightly points out that the inclusion of the terms 'purpose' and 'scope' among the powers given to the Commission would allow the latter to modify the obligations of the Member States, the authorities and the central banks, as well as its own obligations."
"These obligations are elements of the basic act; any modification of them in one direction or another could affect political choices made in the basic act and these modifications of the common position do not constitute an obstacle to an agreement at second reading, given that they reflect the results of agreements reached between the three main institutions, thereby allowing us to conclude this item of business at second reading."
"I believe that is the important thing."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the extensive effort he has made in preparing this very complex technical document, as statistical matters are usually of little interest to the general public and hold little attraction for them."
"That is why the discussion on this issue is taking place rather late."
"I am very pleased that Mr Frattini is present, although statistical matters usually fall within Mr Almunia's sphere of competence."
"However, we are talking about large databases, the use, security and management of which must be clearly defined."
"I believe that Mr Almunia is well aware of all the problems we are experiencing with different databases, their use, security and the possibility of their being used for the wrong purpose."
"The document recognises a number of points that would help to avoid similar problems."
"There is one more thing that delights me: the document will bring about increased transparency in government administrative functions."
"To my mind, this is very important; this sort of information should be accessible to the general public."
"On the other hand, as a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I cannot help worrying that we have recently been discussing a large number of documents relating to obtaining statistical data and including various activities in different registers."
"Less and less thought is given to profit, the ratio between the profit and the cost of data collection."
"As an economist, I do understand the importance of this data for defining economic policy, decision making - even in view of security it is important to be aware of the different aspects of multinational companies' activities within the EU, within the Member States."
"As a representative of Lithuania, a border country, an EU border country, I understand it only too well."
"Nevertheless, at the beginning of my tenure much has been said regarding the necessity of analysing how much it costs the trade and of making the relevant calculations."
"Some Member States were prepared to do this."
"For example, the Netherlands have actually done so."
"Regretfully, this initiative has fizzled out."
"I can only regret the fact that in this case the possibility of ascertaining the burden on business and the alleviation of this burden was not considered."
"Various small European selection groups could have been developed and considered to be examples, while analysing the statistical basis for the whole of Europe."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, now that Mrs Lulling has addressed me directly, may I say that just because others are doing things badly, that should not be a role model for us."
"The fact that debates are still being conducted at this hour or even later in the national parliaments does not improve the situation here."
"It is a bitter experience, when one makes reform proposals, to find that others are constantly blocking them with reference to something else."
"My second point is this: there was no delay, Mrs Lulling."
"At most, there were misunderstandings."
"The delay to which I have referred was the unfortunate coincidence of several matters having to be dealt with simultaneously."
"As to my third point, I stand by my opinion."
"I believe that, from a political and, indeed, a democratic perspective, it is not sensible to hold so-called debates at such a late hour, and I look forward to seeing the Commissioner again with our mutual friend Mr Staffler in the Hotel Laurin in Bolzano and conducting a dialogue there."
"I think it is very likely that political progress will be made on that occasion rather than here, given that there are now just three of us plus the Commissioner - yes, let me repeat that, just three of us - engaging in pseudo-debates with each other at this ungodly hour."
"(DE) Madam President, the rapporteur claims that he was not responsible for the delay."
"He most certainly was!"
"He was also behind the to-do in committee, and I really do not need to say any more about that."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to say one more thing by pointing out that the explanatory statement drawn up by the rapporteur contains remarks that are completely off the subject and out of context with the theme being dealt with in this report."
"The rapporteur's own personal views on ..."
"(The President asked the speaker to stand down)"
"You are the chairman of a working group."
"I have to say that the rapporteur's personal views on the pensions paid to EU staff members have no place in an official document put out by this institution."
"I would like to have this put on record."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting opened at 10.00)"
"European Ombudsman's activities in 2006 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Luciana Sbarbati, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2006."
"We are pleased to welcome the Ombudsman this morning, and Commissioner Wallström."
"Ombudsman. - Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for this opportunity to address Parliament on my Annual Report for 2006."
"I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Sbarbati, and the Committee on Petitions, for their excellent report."
"My report records progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and providing knowledge about the Ombudsman's role."
"I received 3 830 complaints in 2006."
"That means that the total number of complaints has stabilised at around the level reached following the 53% increase in 2004."
"I am delighted to inform you that the proportion of complaints falling within the mandate has gone up."
"This suggests that citizens are beginning to have a better knowledge both of my mandate and of that of my national and regional colleagues in the European Network of Ombudsmen, which is thus commensurately strengthened to the benefit of all concerned."
"The total number of inquiries dealt with in 2006 was 586."
"Of these, 66% concerned the Commission."
"Given that the Commission is the EU institution with which citizens have most reason to have material contact, it is normal that it should be the principal target of inquiries."
"During 2006, 250 decisions closing inquiries were made."
"In 95 cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration."
"Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institution concerned."
"Even when maladministration is not found, I may identify opportunities to improve the quality of administration provided by the institutions."
"If so, I point them out in a further remark."
"Many of my inquiries result in a win-win outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution complained against."
"During 2006, 64 cases were settled by the institution concerned to the satisfaction of the complainant."
"Whenever I find maladministration, I try to achieve a friendly solution, if possible."
"Three friendly solutions were achieved in 2006 and a further 27 proposals for such a solution were under consideration by the institution concerned at the end of the year."
"When a friendly solution is not possible, I close the case with a critical remark, or make a draft recommendation."
"A critical remark is appropriate if it is no longer possible for the institution concerned to eliminate the instance of maladministration."
"I wish to emphasise that the criticism is intended to be constructive, so as to help avoid similar maladministration in the future."
"In 2006, I closed 41 inquiries in this way."
"To better monitor the impact of my criticism and advice, I have this year launched a study of the follow-up to all critical remarks made in 2006, as well as to the 38 cases involving a further remark made during the same year."
"The results of these studies should provide further encouragement to the institutions concerned to improve their practices and develop a culture of service to citizens."
"In cases where it is still possible to eliminate the instance of maladministration, I normally make a draft recommendation to the institution, which must respond with a detailed opinion."
"During 2006, 13 draft recommendations were made."
"If an institution fails to respond satisfactorily to a draft recommendation, I may send a special report to the European Parliament."
"Two special reports were made in 2006."
"The first concerned the Council's responsibility for the choice of languages used in its Presidency websites."
"The second called on the Commission to deal properly with an infringement complaint concerning sports betting services."
"I am pleased to report that the Commission reacted promptly and positively to that report."
"A new feature of the Annual Report which I wish to highlight, with an eye to supporting and encouraging good administration, concerns what I call 'star cases' of good practice by institutions, revealed through my inquiries."
"I would now like to mention some other activities that I have undertaken during 2006 with a view to ensuring the best possible service to citizens."
"Firstly, I signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)."
"Our agreement aims to ensure the consistent treatment of complaints that raise issues of data protection and to avoid unnecessary duplication."
"The agreement allows me to benefit from the expertise of the EDPS by consulting him in cases where the text of the Data Protection Regulation and existing case-law leave room for divergent views."
"This has already proved to be a useful mechanism for me when dealing with cases in which it is necessary to reconcile the legal right of access to documents with the right to privacy."
"I also signed an agreement with the Spanish Government to enable citizens to complain to the European Ombudsman in any of the co-official languages in Spain."
"I thus aligned my practice with the conclusions reached in June 2005 by the Council, which provide for the use of those languages to facilitate Spanish citizens' communication with the EU institutions."
"Honourable Members, I am grateful for the support for the work of the European Ombudsman expressed in Ms Sbarbati's report, and I would like to inform Parliament that, as requested in her report, I am already engaged in preparing the ground for a memorandum of understanding with the European Investment Bank."
"Given that the implementation of EU law is largely the responsibility of Member States' administrations, I will continue to develop cooperation through the European network of ombudsmen."
"I am happy to inform you that the sixth meeting of the network took place last week in this very building."
"At the conclusion of that successful meeting, we adopted by consensus a statement that aims to make the EU dimension of the work of national and regional ombudsmen better known, and to clarify the service they provide to people who complain about matters that fall within the scope of EU law."
"The voluntary cooperation among ombudsmen that is now crystallised in the statement can, I believe, make an important and growing contribution to the European Union's ability to deliver concrete results, by ensuring that citizens can enjoy their rights as an everyday reality and that problems are solved in ways that are close to the citizen."
"The European Ombudsman was established to help bring the Union closer to citizens and to give the EU administration a 'human face'."
"A fundamental aspect of our institution is that the Ombudsman is an individual who communicates personally with citizens, who reviews their cases, and who seeks to resolve their problems and complaints."
"Each one of these 'microcommunications' constitutes an opportunity to build trust between citizens and the institutions."
"In pursuit of this goal, I will continue to promote a constructive dialogue with the institutions and to draw their attention to problems so that they can improve their performance."
"The way in which a public administration reacts to complaints is a key measure of how citizen-focused it is."
"While progress has been made in many areas, the year 2006 regrettably saw a rise in the proportion of cases which I had to close with a critical remark."
"That should be cause for concern for anyone who wants better relations between the EU and its citizens."
"Complaints offer an opportunity to put things right and to demonstrate that the institution concerned is serious about respecting the citizens' fundamental right to good administration."
"I am not sure that citizens can easily reconcile the statements often made by institutions concerning their desire to get 'closer to the citizen', and for 'more openness', with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations and increase transparency."
"I am positively encouraged, however, by a number of indications that, during the present year, 2007, there is a much greater willingness to take up the opportunities offered by my inquiries to resolve complaints."
"Such cooperation is essential, because the Ombudsman cannot succeed alone."
"Ensuring a top-class administration is a task that must be tackled in tandem with the EU institutions."
"Delivering on promises, providing proper redress mechanisms, learning from mistakes, working openly and allowing for public scrutiny - these are the all-important 'means' towards building trust."
"Equally, the European Ombudsman must work concertedly and systematically with national and regional colleagues to ensure that citizens' rights are fully respected throughout the Union."
"Finally, the Ombudsman must continue to reach out to citizens so that they can become aware of his services."
"With Parliament's support and guidance, I will continue to endeavour to build on existing achievements with a view to truly fulfilling my institutional mandate of bringing the Union closer to citizens and giving the EU administration a 'human face'."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to thank the Ombudsman for his excellent work as is borne out by this particular report."
"I should also like to thank the Legal Services of the Commission and all my parliamentary colleagues on the committee, especially the shadow rapporteur and Mr Mavrommatis, for their cooperation."
"The culture of service to the citizen, which is primarily designed to ensure high-quality, transparent, approachable, swift and cooperative public administration, has been encouraged and strengthened at Community level by the combined efforts of the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman, and its first emergence can be traced back to the resolution of 6 September 2001, the date on which the European Parliament adopted the code of good administrative conduct proposed by the European Ombudsman."
"Moreover, the Treaty of Maastricht produced a qualitative leap in European citizenship by offering all citizens the possibility of submitting petitions to a parliamentary body, which remains the sole arbitrator, or applying to a more specialised body which, while operating on an extrajudicial basis, follows a procedure which does not rule out parliamentary intervention in the event of the Community institution responsible for the instance of maladministration proving reluctant to cooperate."
"I shall not talk about the statistics, as the Ombudsman has already talked about them and they are set out in the report."
"Cases of maladministration currently relate to lack of transparency, refusal of information, abuse of power, legal error and failure to ensure fulfilment of Treaty obligations, in particular by the Commission."
"The Ombudsman's decisions are not legally binding, but the safeguards that his work offers help to strengthen his powers of persuasion."
"He enjoys the active support of the Committee on Petitions, whose meetings he attended on four occasions in 2006, and cooperates with the network of European Ombudsmen, which should be improved and extended."
"Italy, for instance, does not as yet have a national Ombudsman."
"It should be nevertheless be stressed that decisions with final effect should be reciprocally notified in real time in order to avoid conflicts of competence between the activities of the Ombudsman and those of the Committee on Petitions."
"The report divides the decisions taken on completed inquiries in 2006 into various categories: lack of openness on the part of Community institutions and bodies (25% of inquiries), the role of the Commission as the guarantor of the Treaty in relation to procedures under Article 226, the management of contracts, remuneration and grants, and the recruitment and management of the staff of the Community institutions."
"Procedures often end at the stage of critical remarks, which are a means of attempting to prevent the recurrence of cases of maladministration in future, in cases where it would be pointless to issue a recommendation."
"Various examples have been given by the Ombudsman, and can be read at leisure in the report."
"In that respect, the Committee on Petitions invites the Ombudsman to carry out a detailed study of the practical impact of critical remarks made during inquiries in 2006."
"The fact that institutions have a code of good administrative conduct is often not enough to guarantee the creation of a genuine culture of service."
"The report also shows that there are still some grey areas in relation to the Commission making wrong use of its discretionary powers by failing to take prompt action before legal proceedings were begun, using political considerations as a pretext."
"With regard to contracts and staff management, some of the investigations launched by the Ombudsman on his own initiative show how his powers provide an effective means of goading the administrative authorities into self-regulation, a sound principle that needs to be put to increasing use."
"In the view of the Committee on Petitions, however, the lack of synchronicity in timing and views with regard to the handling of the same case by the Ombudsman and Parliament needs to be avoided through ongoing and constructive dialogue."
"The Committee on Petitions has also issued a special invitation to the Ombudsman to investigate the systems used by EPSO, again with a view to protecting the rights of candidates, especially young candidates, in the European Parliament's competition procedures, and to investigate alleged discrimination reported at the European School in Brussels."
"In this year's report, Madam President, the focus is on the Ombudsman's role as a key actor in the Union's democratic life."
"He is a vital intermediary for citizens in their dealings with public authorities."
"His effective activities highlight the distinction between good and bad administration, offering guidance on recognising mistakes, and seeking satisfactory solutions for complainants, likely to transform bad conduct into good."
"To this end, it would be valuable if the Ombudsman were to draw up a list of best administrative practices, including not just exemplary cases, but less creditable ones as well."
"One of the cardinal principles that always has to be stressed is the democratic equality of all Europe's citizens, without any distinction or discrimination on the grounds of nationality or language; something on which the Ombudsman can rely in his continuing efforts to scrutinise and protect linguistic equality."
"The Committee on Petitions is in favour of speeding up procedures to ensure that the Ombudsman's annual report is considered more quickly, and it is also in favour of amending the Statute, provided that the amendments simply involve a qualitative expansion of the Ombudsman's powers, without affecting the nature of his competences or the non-binding effect of all his decisions."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission should 'take a leading role in promoting a service culture'."
"When the Ombudsman said this in the introduction to his Annual Report, I could not agree more."
"The European Union needs to be closer to its citizens, to explain better, to listen better and to deliver good policies."
"To have a top-quality public administration is a necessary condition for that."
"To have a well-equipped watchdog to monitor our progress is equally important to our common success."
"The Ombudsman acts as an external control mechanism for sound and accountable administration on the part of the European Union institutions and bodies."
"I therefore very much welcome the Ombudsman's Annual Report for 2006, and I want to stress that the relations between the Commission and the Ombudsman are very positive."
"For example, the number of open enquiries addressed to the Commission decreased by 20% in 2006 in relation to 2005 and 2004, and we more frequently acknowledge our mistakes and apologise."
"We seek satisfactory solutions for complainants, just as we follow up the critical remarks and the draft recommendations of the Ombudsman."
"I also welcome Ms Sbarbati's very important report and the constructive proposals in it."
"Just as I agree with the Ombudsman's call for a service culture, I agree with Ms Sbarbati's call for the necessary budgetary and human resources."
"We are judged by our deeds and not by our words, so we need to really ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses, as Ms Sbarbati says in her report."
"Let me briefly comment on a few particular points in the report."
"First, the Commission welcomes the Ombudsman's initiative to draw up a list of 'star' cases exemplifying best practices."
"We also welcome this initiative to prepare a study on the follow-up given by the Commission and other institutions and bodies to the critical comments and further remarks of the Ombudsman."
"I hope this can contribute to improving practices to the benefit of citizens."
"Secondly, regarding the alleged overlaps between the activities and powers of the Committee on Petitions and those of the Ombudsman, the Commission reiterates its willingness to work with those two bodies within the framework of their respective remit, and the definition of that remit does not fall within the Commission's competence."
"Thirdly, Parliament has requested the Commission make proper use of its discretionary powers under Article 226 relating to infringement procedures."
"Of course, we should avoid delays or failure to take action, and that is why the Commission recently adopted a communication on the implementation of Community law, and we laid down more targeted preventive measures, improved information provision and problem solving."
"In short, this was the Commission's new commitment: to seek a more efficient management of infringement cases and increased transparency."
"Concerning Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents, as you know, the review of this Regulation is under way, and the Ombudsman's contribution to the consultation has been very much welcomed."
"Only a few weeks ago we had a meeting with the Interinstitutional Committee on public access to documents which was chaired by Vice-President Wallis, and I want to thank her for taking this matter about public access to documents forward in a very constructive way."
"My penultimate point concerns the Ombudsman's Statute."
"It is being dealt with in a separate context but, as it is mentioned in the report, I just want to assure you that the Commission closely monitors the developments, and that contacts are under way between the Commission and the Ombudsman at different hierarchical levels."
"I want this issue to progress in a spirit of close cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"Lastly, concerning the Ombudsman's communication strategy and the European network of Ombudsmen, we need to share experiences and administrative practices."
"We need to raise public awareness and to bring citizens closer to the EU."
"The Ombudsman has a very important stake in this, and so does the European Parliament and the Committee on Petitions."
"This is important to me and the whole Commission, and you can be sure that we will do our absolute best to cooperate and find good, forward-looking solutions."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all thank and congratulate Mrs Sbarbati, the rapporteur on the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2006."
"I would also like to thank the secretariat of our committee for its assistance in drawing up Mrs Sbarbati's report, and also the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, for promptly submitting his annual report for 2006 and for his subsequent cooperation with the Committee on Petitions."
"The Ombudsman is an independent institution and a control mechanism for the administration of the EU."
"However, despite all the action taken by Mr Diamandouros to inform the public, confusion still reigns over the European Ombudsman's areas of jurisdiction."
"We must therefore continue to try and inform the public, with appropriate financial support from the EU."
"For this reason we, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, have again tabled a relevant amendment, which calls for ever greater participation by the media in publicising the work of the European Ombudsman."
"As shadow rapporteur, I have tried to contribute to the report on the European Ombudsman's activities, with amendments that I have tabled and supported."
"It was essentially through the adoption of these amendments that we saw progress in the following areas of the European Ombudsman's activity:"
"Firstly, the European Ombudsman was called upon to continue with his investigation of third-pillar issues."
"Secondly, reports concerning the European Ombudsman must be translated promptly into all official EU languages, particularly in the case of the European Ombudsman's annual report."
"Thirdly, the European Ombudsman must maintain good relations with the members of the Committee on Petitions and cooperate with them in order to achieve the desired results."
"Lastly, the European Network of Ombudsmen is called upon to expand and include within its membership specialised ombudsmen such as those dealing with minors' rights, family problems, the protection of personal data and prisoners' or patients' rights."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Diamandouros and Ms Wallström for their presentations and Ms Sbarbati for her excellent report."
"The Lisbon Treaty just agreed opens the door to the European Union's exit from a long-standing phase whereby its ability to function effectively on behalf of its citizens has been held back."
"We have a long-needed institutional system that works more effectively, but it also opens the door to so much more."
"I welcome the solemn proclamation of the Charter of the Presidents of the Institutions that will be made on 12 December."
"The inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as part of the legal order in the European Union will allow for the Union to begin to work on more effective, transparent and democratic foundations."
"European citizens expect, and will continue to expect, that the Union's institutions will act in accordance with its basic principles: with the Charter, and with efficiency, effectiveness and openness."
"The European Ombudsman is one vital part of the democratic structure and functioning of the Union."
"The largest proportion of the Ombudsman's enquiries concern lack of transparency."
"This is an area of our activities that we must improve if we are to become more credible in the eyes of the citizens."
"I am delighted with the work of the Ombudsman, as explained in his annual report and in his speech."
"He took a number of important decisions during 2006, including, not least, on the choice of the languages used in the websites of the European Presidencies of the Council, on inaccurate and misleading information contained in leaflets, posters and video presentations on air passenger rights produced by the Commission, and on access to the audit report of the European Investment Bank."
"It is important that we support the work of the Ombudsman, as well as the work of the Committee on Petitions, as it is through handling complaints and petitions on EU matters from citizens that we can find out what is not working well at European level and take corrective measures."
"Cases being brought to the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are of increasing complexity and therefore require a greater investment of resources by the institutions, in order that the citizens' concerns are properly addressed."
"In this context I would like to remind Members of Paragraph 2 of Ms Sbarbati's report: 'Calls for all European institutions and bodies to be given the necessary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions'."
"There will be no better way of putting the Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice than taking this on board, and I call on all the institutions and bodies to give priority to the interests of the citizens in this respect."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission Margot Wallström, Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, to start with I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"Over the years the role of the European Ombudsman has become ever more important for the citizens of the European Union."
"Once the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enters into force, that role will become even more important."
"This means that in the future we have to be even more careful to ensure that the Ombudsman has sufficient resources and that the code of practice under which he operates is relevant to the current climate."
"Commissioner Margot Wallström stressed the need for transparency."
"I would hope that now that the code of practice under which the European Ombudsman operates is changing, the Commissioner's words, increased transparency and promoting the idea that the necessary information is available from the Commission, will come true, because only deeds matter, not words."
"The Ombudsman's annual report and its summarised version are a splendid example of how our work should be presented to the public."
"The report is clear, succinct and to the point."
"Transparency is the key to European democracy and its principal construction material."
"Under Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union."
"That is saying a lot, and it places an obligation on all the European Union institutions and obviously on the Ombudsman's office too."
"Consequently, I would like to stress the importance of ensuring there are adequate resources of the relevant kind in place, so that people do not have to wait years and years for decisions on matters that affect them, because waiting for decisions is a tiresome business."
"Finally, I would like to thank the Ombudsman for the work he does, and I wish him every success in this very challenging role."
"It is not always appreciated sufficiently, as fundamental rights are implemented more successfully among the elite than among ordinary people."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Sbarbati for her work and to express my appreciation for the achievements of the European Ombudsman, Professor Nikiforos Diamandouros."
"I am expressing the views of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group as well as those of Mr Marcin Libicki, the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, who was unable to attend today's sitting and asked me to speak on his behalf."
"Hominum causa omne ius constitutum sit - every law should be applied from the point of view of human beings."
"This Roman principle can be seen in the work of the Ombudsman, who, working within his area of competence, tries to comply with the fundamental principle that everyone has the right to have their case heard in an impartial and just manner by EU bodies and institutions."
"It can be seen from an analysis of the report that only about 25% of the complaints submitted fall within the scope of competence of the Ombudsman."
"Is it that our citizens do not know the law?"
"Perhaps, to some extent, this is the case."
"However, I think that it is something different, that they treat the institution of the ombudsman as a last resort, when they are unable to find appropriate help in their own countries."
"The scope and quantity of applications submitted to the Committee on Petitions would indicate something similar."
"If the feeling that one is being treated in an unjust, sluggish, incompetent or bureaucratic way continues to grow, the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour will just become a collection of aspirations, and not everyday practice."
"Professor, may you, as the Ombudsman, be an effective guardian of the interests of the Community's citizens, and may Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as well as national parliaments and national ombudsmen, assist you in this work."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Madam President, I am not going to repeat all of the good things that have been said, apart from to thank both our Ombudsman and Commissioner Wallström."
"In addition, I would like to say something that must be underlined."
"I am a relatively new member of the Committee on Citizens' Complaints, as it would be better to call it."
"I have, to my consternation, discovered through being out in society that it is virtually only active citizens who are monitoring whether EU legislation is being respected in many places."
"The institutions are not doing this, and neither are the Member States."
"Therefore, if citizens do not do it, the whole thing will fall apart."
"Therefore, citizens are not only the victims of individual cases; they are indeed also active fellow players who are working to ensure that the EU's extremely transparent system is both understandable and close to citizens."
"We should also be clear that it is a perpetual battle even if we equip our instruments, i.e. the Ombudsman and the Committee on Citizens' Complaints, with the correct tools."
"An attack is currently taking place on the Swedish system of openness and access to documents."
"We must not believe that this is a battle that we can win once and for all."
"We must persist and continue to persist and we will not win the battle at any point."
"We will win it only if we continue to have very strong tools."
"Let me stress that I am very pleased with Mrs Sbarbati's report. However, I would like to highlight the amendments that we have fortunately been able to incorporate into the report thanks to considerable support."
"Firstly, it is now possible for Parliament to take the Ombudsman's cases to court if the institutions do not respect the Ombudsman."
"It is absolutely crucial that this can be done in reality and is not simply something that we can boast about around the world."
"We have the institution of the Ombudsman, we have a Committee on Citizens' Complaints, and yet this does not mean anything other than words and yet more words."
"This matter is therefore of enormous significance."
"The second aspect concerns the European Investment Bank."
"On many occasions the bank has not been as 'nice' as it should be."
"On many occasions it has acted as if it were assisting the major industries, and it is absolutely crucial that the citizens who should benefit from the bank's activities in countries outside Europe have the opportunity to bring matters before the Ombudsman."
"It is really quite shocking that they are refused on the grounds that they are not EU citizens and are not able to have their say."
"They have been treated in a patronising and arrogant way, and I am therefore also very glad that it has now been highlighted in this report that these citizens will naturally have access to appeal to the Ombudsman."
"Finally, let me say that it is important to emphasise that the Ombudsman also has competence within intergovernmental areas under the third pillar."
"Overall, we are taking a big step forward with this report, and I very much hope that the bodies of both the Commission and Parliament will take it seriously."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, today's discussion and the excellent work carried out by the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, over the past four and a half years, as well as Mrs Sbarbati's excellent report, all provide an opportunity for the European Parliament and the Commission to take stock of how the public views the institutions of the EU."
"A large section of the public is calling for greater transparency and exemplary administration, which are too little in evidence."
"I note some worrying signs in Mr Diamandouros's report."
"Fewer cases have been resolved by friendly settlement."
"There has been a decline in the number of cases where the Commission (I see that the Vice-President is not listening) has complied with the recommendations of the European Ombusdman."
"Congratulating the European Ombudsman, Madam President, is not enough; we must listen to his recommendations."
"Mr Diamandouros is quite rightly requesting an extension of his powers to cover third-pillar issues, thus providing for greater transparency and control."
"He is asking for a change to the European Ombudsman's Statute so that his work can become more effective."
"I believe he has the support of the European Parliament, but he must also have that of the Commission, and not just in word, but also in deed."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we read in Mrs Sbarbati's report that, according to the 2006 statistics, over 90% of the 3 800 or so complaints come from individual citizens, which is a very interesting fact."
"Mrs Sbarbati also tells us that the majority of complaints come from the larger Member States, with larger populations, but goes on to say that the figure changes if the ratio between population and number of complaints is considered, when Luxembourg and the new accession countries Malta, Cyprus and Slovenia take the lead with the largest number of complaints."
"This reflects, in my view, the fact that issues of a European nature and of European competence and legislation are the main concerns of the Ombudsman's day-to-day work."
"In my opinion, it is interesting to note, however, that it would be more useful to have functioning Ombudsmen in those countries and in particular in Italy than to have a European Ombudsman."
"I think I remember reading that in the 95% of cases examined, the majority do not fall within the mandate of the European Ombudsman, as the complaints are not made against a Community institution or body."
"Cases of maladministration relate to lack of transparency, unfairness, abuse of power, legal error and so on. There are no data on administrative inefficiency and injustice in my country, and I am sure that if such data existed and were brought to the attention of the European Ombudsman, Italy would be well in the lead, especially the left-wing administrations of my country."
"It is not surprising that the wrong use of the discretionary powers of the Commission is well in the lead in the ranking, and I would therefore exhort the European Ombudsman to scrutinise relations between citizens, the Council, the Commission and Parliament more thoroughly."
"I also agree that the Ombudsman's scope of investigation should be extended to cover the protection of minors, family problems, the protection of personal data and prisoners' rights, and for that reason I support the Mavrommatis amendment."
"However, I do not support, Mrs Sbarbati and Mr Mavrommatis, the exhortation to conduct inquiries under the so-called third pillar."
"That is wrong, and I do not agree."
"I would, however, congratulate Mrs Sbarbati on her productive work with the European Ombudsman."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and, through her, my colleague, Mr Mavrommatis, but, of course, especially the Ombudsman himself on another successful year."
"Three hundred or so complaints a month is a huge workload and equates both to rising interest in the system but also to rising concern at aspects of EU maladministration."
"Whilst many cases are dealt with by cooperation, the Ombudsman refers to the increase in critical comment that he is forced to make."
"This must improve, or Parliament will have to find ways of compelling the Commission to be helpful and responsive and, equally, to act upon the conclusions produced by the Ombudsman."
"He makes telling comments."
"I want to pick out one: 'I am not sure that the citizen can easily reconcile the statements often made by the institutions that they want to get ""closer to the citizen” with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations.'"
"The services of the Ombudsman should, and do, work hand in hand with the Committee on Petitions, but the Commission must develop a culture of service rather than the avoidance of problems, and Ministers and permanent representatives must understand the vital importance of responding positively to grievances from constituents and citizens, voiced either through the Ombudsman or the Petitions Committee."
"Finally, may I make a brief reference to an outstanding special report by the Ombudsman, namely that relating to a complaint against OLAF."
"As the Petitions Committee rapporteur for this issue, I give notice now that, the judicial process having been completed on this case, I will not allow the issue of the special report to be swept under the carpet."
"It will be reconsidered as soon as is practically possible."
"May I conclude with thanks, again, not only to you, Madam President, for delighting us with your presence, but also to the Ombudsman and the Commissioner for being here as well."
"(EL) Madam President, it seems we have really begun to understand how important it is that European citizens should feel close to the Union through democratic and especially transparent institutions."
"The European Ombudsman is the institution par excellence for receiving citizens' complaints."
"It is also the one most obviously able to make citizens feel that the Union is dealing with and responding to their problems."
"It shows that progress is being made in acknowledging and correcting administrative errors."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the thinking behind her report."
"She correctly brings out the Ombudsman's key role in the EU's democratic character."
"However, I am worried that although there have been fewer instances of maladministration, the Ombudsman's critical remarks, in those cases where a friendly settlement was reached, did not meet with a satisfactory rate of acceptance by the institutional bodies."
"The rapporteur is right, then, to remind us of Parliament's right of recourse to the Court, although, of course, one would prefer not to use this right."
"However, all of us here today should understand that we ourselves are the institutions - and the corollary of this is that the reliability of the institutions depends on our own attitude."
"I also agree entirely with the rapporteur's view of a balanced but at the same time energetic way of performing one's duties."
"The Ombudsman is not, cannot and should not simply be a display of democracy for the EU."
"We must acknowledge this, make it our joint decision, and above all, we must assume our responsibilities."
"In other words, we must be bold in our decisions, but above all more transparent in what is essentially our concern."
"Madam President, the most important aspect of the existence of the EU and its institutions is to uphold the fundamental principles of justice, democracy and respect for human rights, especially with reference to the citizens of Europe."
"Our Union would have no raison d'être or functional purpose if it did not have as its main objective to offer a fair, comprehensive and efficient service to the people of Europe."
"The European citizen was, is, and always will be, the centre of our efforts as a functioning Union."
"It is mainly for this reason that the activities of the Ombudsman are of such paramount importance."
"This is because the Ombudsman is the friend and guardian of the European citizen and is the facility through which Community institutions and bodies can be held to account over whether they have served the citizen properly and whether they are guilty of maladministration or bad practice."
"We welcome the 2006 Annual Report from Mr Diamandouros and congratulate and thank him for the very good work he and his staff have performed in upholding the rights of European citizens."
"At the same time, we congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Sbarbati, on her excellent report, which contains many important points and suggestions."
"I find most interesting, for example, the suggestion made in paragraph 12, which in effect encourages the Ombudsman to draw up and publish annually a list of shame and a roll of honour for the EU's administrative services."
"May I point out that the proper functioning of the Ombudsman may inevitably, in rare instances, lead him to be disliked by certain services."
"In such cases, the Ombudsman deserves - and must be reassured of - our full support."
"Lastly, may I commend the active support and cooperation the Committee on Petitions has shown the Ombudsman in the performance of his duties."
"The work of both those entities is very often interlinked, and their smooth cooperation is to be much appreciated and praised."
"(PL) Madam President, I represent Poland, a country that is in fifth position, statistically, as regards the number of complaints submitted to the European Ombudsman."
"Every 16th complaint submitted to the Ombudsman comes from my country."
"Every 20th complaint, almost, is written in Polish."
"Obviously I am speaking of absolute numbers, because, per inhabitant, the citizens of Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus are much more active in submitting complaints than my own countrymen."
"It is worth emphasising that last year the European Ombudsman received fewer complaints than in 2005."
"Just over 200 complaints came from companies and associations, and 18 times more than that came from individuals."
"It could be said that the functioning of the European Ombudsman provides the best indicator of computer use in the European Union."
"Twelve out of 20 complaints are submitted electronically."
"On the minus side, an indicator of the lack of knowledge of EU citizens is the fact that almost four out of five complaints do not fall within the scope of responsibilities of the European Ombudsman."
"This shows that this institution is treated as a receptacle for all maladies, even those that do not relate to EU institutions, which, by definition, is what the European Ombudsman is supposed to monitor."
"Clearly Europeans feel that the European Ombudsman has the right to crack the whip over everyone."
"In conclusion, I would like to express satisfaction that only 8% of the investigations instigated by the Ombudsman related to the European Parliament, while almost 66% related to the European Commission."
"(SV) Thank you Madam President."
"The Ombudsman's criticism regarding a lack of transparency is necessary and badly needed criticism."
"I also welcome Parliament's proposal that the Ombudsman should carry out a study of the practical impact of critical remarks that were made, inter alia, in relation to the Commission."
"Certainly, Parliament is often touchingly united in criticising other institutions, but there is actually good reason for Parliament also to be self-critical."
"The Ombudsman has recently asked Parliament to disclose information on payments received by MEPs for travel and for employing staff, but Parliament has refused to disclose the information, taking the view that it is a breach of data protection."
"I believe that this is merely putting up a smokescreen, and I have the support of the European Data Protection Supervisor when I say this."
"Payments to staff are obviously public documents."
"It is time for Parliament to come clean on payments."
"Only those who employ staff on slave-type contracts and other strange contracts have something to fear from more transparency."
"It surely cannot be the case that any Members here are afraid of not being re-elected in 2009 if it emerges in the media how employees are treated in certain cases, I say in certain cases. Thank you."
"(EL) Madam President, I should, of course, like to mention that we are examining the 10th report by the Ombudsman, who in 2006 received 3 889 letters or e-mails of complaint, 3 619 of which were sent by individual members of the public."
"Of the 3 889 complaints, 3 051 were outside the mandate."
"In other words, there were, in a single year, a total of 838 complaints within the mandate."
"I therefore think that the Ombudsman's department is large enough in terms of staff and resources to handle 838 complaints, which, of course, mainly concern matters of maladministration by the Commission and the European Personnel Selection Office, and to a lesser degree the European Parliament and the Council."
"It is of course commendable that the Ombudsman publishes a list of best administrative practices."
"I do not know, however, whether his department allows citizens to make complaints about the operation of his own department."
"I regret that the report by the Committee on Petitions refers us only to the European Personnel Selection Office, and not to the European Ombudsman, who until now has not carried out an ex officio scrutiny of his department."
"We are therefore requesting not a change in the Ombudsman's Statute, but rather a strengthening of the rights that we already accord him."
"This should allow him to show due respect for citizens, be very active in the correct administration of European institutions, and respect the personal data of citizens, Members of the European Parliament, and employees who are required to maintain secrecy."
"The European Court of Justice should operate independently, without the Ombudsman's intervention, and there should be respect for the effective international agencies that operate independently to protect fundamental rights."
"Our support for the European Ombudsman is not without limits."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, and Ms Sbarbati for their excellent work on the Ombudsman's report."
"It is important that this debate is taking place at a prime time in Parliament's plenary working day, at a time when it can have a high public profile."
"The service that the Ombudsman provides is extremely important for the citizen: it enhances the positive connection between Europe's institutions and the citizen and enriches the legitimacy of the work we do in the institutions, whether it is in Parliament, the Commission or the Council."
"The service continues to evolve and that is pointed up quite well in Ms Sbarbati's report, where she makes various suggestions, and the Ombudsman himself makes various suggestions, as to how it could continue to improve."
"Certainly, the idea of broadening relations with mediators who deal with issues regarding minors and children is an important development."
"At the same time, there is resistance in the system: resistance to transparency, resistance to a common code of administrative practice for all the institutions and resistance, as well, to updating the mandate of the Ombudsman."
"I believe the European Parliament should take a more active role, for instance, in dealing with the transparency issue, and I support the Ombudsman's call for Parliament to be more transparent in the publication of allowances paid to Members."
"(PL) Madam President, the activities of the European Ombudsman give EU citizens the feeling that they have some protection against inappropriate actions taken by EU institutions."
"The material presented raises some issues."
"The first of these is that the largest number of complaints submitted to the Ombudsman relates to the European Commission, the European Personnel Selection Office and the European Parliament."
"The failure of European institutions, with the exception of the Ombudsman, to implement the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour in accordance with the 2001 Resolution of the European Parliament may be a contributory factor."
"The second issue is that 78.5% of the matters submitted to the Ombudsman fall outside his competence, and 93.7% of these complaints do not relate to EU bodies or institutions."
"This would indicate that our citizens do not have sufficient information about the work of the Ombudsman or that, for various reasons, they are unable to get important issues dealt with in their own countries."
"This matter needs to be investigated."
"The third issue is that the Ombudsman should have the powers that are necessary quickly to remove bad administrative practices that give rise to complaints."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"Madam President, I would like to welcome our visitors, the citizens, to this debate."
"I hope that they understand what the Ombudsman is about, following his very detailed presentation of twelve months' work in a very short space of time."
"It is a pity that the Ombudsman receives so many cases that it is not within his competence to resolve, but I understand that these are redirected to the appropriate places."
"It is important to say that to people listening to this debate."
"Those cases do not fall by the wayside, but are sent in the right direction."
"That you are dealing with a certain number of cases and bringing about a resolution is positive, but we need to do a bit more work to educate people about what you do and how you do it, in order to bring even more cases to your desk."
"That would do no harm, because I am sure the small number you deal with does not truly reflect the problems of maladministration."
"Turning to the Commission, I quite like the idea of a culture of service, but I am not sure that the Commission uses the carrot and stick approach internally to make sure that there is indeed a culture of service."
"This is something that should be done through legislation."
"Are there penalties for divisions or individuals involved in maladministration when it comes to citizens?"
"Perhaps that is something we could have a closer look at."
"I like the idea of putting forward the star performers and the worst performers so that we can have that comparison, but at the end of the day what people want is results and positive outcomes."
"I keep saying to people in Ireland that the Committee on Petitions does not have huge power, but that through the work we do we can act as a pressure point for action."
"I wish we had more power, but at least we can use that little bit of pressure to bring about results for citizens."
"They are not interested in the process."
"They just want positive outcomes."
"Mr Diamandouros, I wish you well in your activities this year and hope you continue in the same way as in the past."
"I will certainly work in Ireland to make sure that we know a lot more about you in the future."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like first to thank Mr Diamandouros for his report and to acknowledge the enormous amount of work being done by Commissioner Wallström, and to congratulate Mrs Sbarbati on her pertinent report which will act as our guide to assessing the improvements we anticipate for 2007 and 2008."
"We welcome the content of the current report, which shows that the task of the European Ombudsman has become established and has bedded in; it also shows increased contact with authorities and with citizens."
"Personally, I particularly welcome the agreement with the current Government of Spain on the use of co-official languages - Basque, Catalan and Gallego, as this will bring the citizens of Spain closer to their rights without diminishing the functionality of Spanish, which will prove very useful in future contacts with third country nationals."
"There are, however, other aspects noted by Mr Diamandouros himself, which are a source of concern: more than 75% of complaints are not about European competences but national or regional competences."
"We therefore take the view that it is a matter of great urgency to strengthen the communication strategy of the European Network of Ombudsmen so that this can be put right."
"Another problem highlighted is the fall in instances of maladministration concluded by friendly agreement or consensus."
"We supporters of the Ombudsman urge him to improve his know-how and recover his effectiveness in this route."
"Persuasion is better than force."
"Finally I shall only add that it would be ironic if the legitimate ambition of the current Ombudsman to apply the Code of Administrative Conduct led him to be more diligent outside his home than within it."
"(MT) Thank you, Madam President."
"The office of Ombudsman is today well established and I would like to congratulate it on its good work."
"We now need to look ahead to ensure that the tools that citizens have at their disposal for seeking redress are clear, known to all and function more efficiently."
"At present there is too much confusion regarding where citizens should go when they want to make a complaint."
"Some appeal to the Committee on Petitions, some to the Commission, some to the Ombudsman, and some appeal to everyone, which results in a great deal of confusion, duplicated work and unnecessary expenses that could all be avoided."
"There is therefore a need, as Commissioner Wallström rightly said, for better coordination between the institutions that hear and make decisions on complaints."
"For example, there should be a clear commitment regarding the time within which these agencies must reply to citizens once they receive their complaints, and also a commitment regarding the maximum length of time they can take to give a definitive reply."
"We still hear all too often about complaints that were lodged years before and are still pending."
"As my colleague Ms McGuinness has stated, when a complaint is sent to the wrong agency, that agency should not send a negative reply but should itself pass the complaint on to the correct agency."
"Finally, when a citizen formulates his complaint in an unclear manner, because, after all, not all citizens are lawyers, a greater effort should be made to ensure that whoever receives the complaint gives the complainant the benefit of the doubt and does not automatically consider the complaint inadmissible."
"I think we have taken huge steps forward and once again I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman, but we still have a lot more to do. Thank you very much."
"(PL) I would like to express my satisfaction that the European Ombudsman fulfils his functions in a balanced and dynamic manner, both in the consideration of complaints, which numbered 3830 in 2006, and in running and completing investigations."
"Also encouraging are the good relations between the Ombudsman and EU bodies and institutions, as well as the encouragement given to citizens to exercise their rights."
"As we are debating this report, I would like to emphasise how important it is to make sure that there are the necessary budget and staffing resources to ensure that citizens receive rapid and objective responses to their questions, complaints and petitions."
"It is obvious that all institutions should work in a constructive manner with the Ombudsman at every stage of the procedure, and the Ombudsman should present Parliament with suggestions that, in his view, would help to improve procedures and make this cooperation even more effective."
"In congratulating Professor Diamandouros on his achievements as Ombudsman, I would at the same time like to encourage him to continue his efforts and to promote his activities even more, so that, in the eyes of European citizens, he becomes a guarantor of good administration in EU institutions."
"(RO) Ten years after the institution of the European Ombudsman was established, I am pleased to find the evolution of its role and activities in the process of protecting the European citizen."
"The 2006 activity report proves to us that, nowadays, European citizens benefit from a true competent court where they can defend themselves against any institution and, in fact, prevent and signal their defective operation."
"In other words, we speak today about a true instrument of democratic control, performed in an autonomous and transparent manner, which can only be beneficial to the European Union."
"Moreover, I am grateful to the European Parliament's Rapporteur for pointing out the aspects to be improved in the Ombudsman's current activity as well."
"First of all, I regret the fact that there are still many complaints from citizens who have not obtained the information requested in their own language."
"This proves to us that, in Europe, we still have problems in ensuring full linguistic rights and equality among citizens."
"We are on the brink of the year 2008, declared the year of intercultural dialogue, and are forced to immediately correct these deficiencies, which are contrary to the European Union's fundamental values."
"In my turn, I welcome the European Ombudsman's communication strategy and I emphasize the need to consolidate it."
"The current statistics regarding the complaints that continue to exceed the Ombudsman's competence are a sad finding of the unsatisfactory information level of the citizens, as well as of their understanding and knowledge of the Ombudsman's and other institutions' scope of competence."
"(PL) Madam President, Mr Ombudsman, first of all I would like to congratulate the Professor on his excellent achievements and his work for democracy and the observance of citizens' rights in the European Union."
"The European Ombudsman is one of the principal bodies in the democratic life of the European Union."
"He should guard the democratic equality of all European citizens and act as a mediator between citizens and the Community's organs of public administration, which, for various reasons, do not comply with the standards that have been set."
"It is encouraging to see the information presented in the report on the Ombudsman's activities in 2006, showing his dynamic involvement in the public life of the Community and his active cooperation with both EU citizens and the administrative bodies of the European Union."
"To improve the effectiveness of the Ombudsman's activities it would be worth considering the possibility of preparing lists of best administrative practice, with exemplary or exceptional cases in which the Ombudsman was involved in any given year, as well as a list of the cases where the actions of institutions were less appropriate."
"In addition, in order to ensure that the Ombudsman is fully and decisively involved, support should be given to the idea that the Ombudsman should also carry out investigations in the so-called third pillar, that is, Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters, which would also extend to the activities of Europol."
"Ombudsman. - Madam President, first of all I wish to thank Ms Sbarbati, the rapporteur for my Annual Report for 2006 at this year's plenary."
"I also wish to thank the very large number of Members who, in fact, took the time to comment on my report."
"I am deeply grateful for the interest that this expresses and the guidance that it contains."
"With respect to Ms Sbarbati, let me just say that I of course worked very closely and intend to continue to work very closely with the Petitions Committee, with which I have excellent relations."
"The Petitions Committee and the Ombudsman will continue to be the major instrument through which this august body will also be able to deal with citizens' approaches to the European institutions."
"I take note of your remarks."
"I can tell you that I have already launched an own-initiative inquiry concerning EPSO, as you know, but I want to announce it to this body."
"I also have taken a strong interest and continue to monitor very carefully developments in the European schools."
"I wish to thank Ms Wallström for her remarks."
"I note that she has recorded the increase in the number of cases where the Commission apologises for instances in which its services have not abided by best practice."
"I am very grateful to her for acknowledging that."
"I will be meeting with Ms Wallström in the near future, and I will also be meeting with the Directors-General of the Commission and the coordinators of all the services dealing with the Ombudsman, precisely in order to be able to bring about better coordination and better results."
"This is an indication of how closely I am working with the Commission, and I hope to be able to elicit better results to report to you next year, and of course to report to citizens."
"That includes the infringement, and I will be dealing with that as well."
"On a more general point, let me just say that I am very grateful to you for your general support on broad issues like the culture of service, which is very central to my concerns; for your references to the need for more resources for the Ombudsman; for your support on the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and of the Statute; and for your call for greater accountability, which for me of course is extraordinarily important."
"I can also let you know that I have launched, as of this year, a concerted effort to reach out to business associations as opposed to individuals, with an eye to better informing them of their rights as well."
"Because of the pressure of time, allow me not to switch languages, but first of all to say to Ms McGuinness and also to Ms Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, that I manage to help 70% of the 70% that are outside my mandate."
"Therefore, my work involves not only the percentage that is within my mandate, but on top of that there is a great deal of effort being expended by my staff to be able to help every single citizen who comes to us whose concern is outside the mandate, by referring to the appropriate institution, be it at European or national level."
"Therefore, this covers 3 830 cases, not 885."
"Allow me now to switch languages."
"Ombudsman."
"(EL) Mrs Panayiotopoulos, I want to assure you that the European Ombudsman is fully aware of his obligation to work within the legal limits."
"He will, of course, always work according to the basic principle of accountability to Parliament and to you, and at all times he will be acutely aware of his responsibility."
"Lastly, I am doing all I can to promote the creation of a national ombudsman in Italy."
"I have been there four or five times and I will continue to do so, hoping that we will be able to welcome an Italian national ombudsman into our midst in the near future."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to respond to two direct questions."
"The first concerns the reform of the Statute of the Ombudsman."
"I can tell you that, very early on, the Ombudsman kept us informed about the work on the new Statute, and we have been in constant touch about this."
"Of course, there are some things we could easily approve, but others are more complicated."
"The Commission will formally give its opinion only after Parliament makes its proposals."
"We have also met with Ms Jäätteenmäki, and we are looking forward to her report with interest."
"The other direct question was from Ms McGuinness about the carrot-and-stick approach and whether we applied it."
"No, not enough, I would say - or not yet."
"But what we have been doing over the last period of time is to create more of a visibility of these issues and also create an ownership within the Commission for every directorate-general and through all the hierarchical levels in the Commission."
"I think that creating that sense of responsibility and visibility will help us to encourage and also sometimes to make it known when we are not pleased with how individual officials are dealing with cases."
"I think it is rather rarely the case of an individual official making a mistake; it is more about the culture."
"This is what we have in the walls, and this is what we have to change now."
"I think the reforms we have taken will move us in the right direction."
"Let me just finally mention one thing that I hope will be welcomed by the Commission as well as the European Parliament: we are working with citizens' summaries on our proposals."
"Again, to come closer to citizens, we also have to express ourselves not in EU jargon but in plain language, and I hope this will help."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) Mrs Sbarbati's report on the European Ombudsman's activities is evidence of her regard for this institution, which was set up under the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 to defend European citizens in the event of maladministration by Community institutions."
"The report rightly emphasises certain priorities for the Ombudsman in the future: the importance of cooperating with ombudsmen in the Member States, for example, and the proposal for better internal supervision of how EU bodies are managed."
"It also raises two questions, however, which we omit from the European debate at our peril."
"On the one hand, the Ombudsman's activities must entail a review of the institution's profile and accessibility throughout Europe."
"There is, in fact, a downward trend in the number of cases referred to the Ombudsman (3 830 in 2006, a decrease of 2% from 2005), and complaints tend to come from Member States that already have a culture of encouraging people to raise issues with the relevant national institutions."
"On the other hand, the report considers the question of extending the Ombudsman's powers (with regard to accessing documents and the unconditional hearing of witnesses)."
"No amendment to the Statute of the Ombudsman must be allowed to obscure the major role played by Parliament's Committee on Petitions, which draws its legitimacy directly from the ballot box."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 and resumed at 11.30)"
"Origin marking (written declaration): see Minutes"
"Announcement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has taken a unanimous decision, which I am relaying to you, addressing myself in particular to the Council."
"In the context of its deliberations on the Commission's proposal for the amendment of the Regulation on the funding of European political parties, the Committee of Permanent Representatives decided yesterday to split the Commission's proposal in two and to adopt the necessary amendments to the Financial Regulation in a separate legislative instrument, to be created on the legal basis that applies to amendments to the Financial Regulation."
"This would mean that key elements of this legislative process would be taken out of the sphere of parliamentary codecision and that the Commission, contrary to its own convictions, would have to present a new proposal, while it would also be essential, or at least advisable, to consult the Court of Auditors."
"The European Parliament calls on the Council to reconsider its decision."
"The amendments to the Political Parties Regulation proposed by the Commission are necessary to overcome practical difficulties that have arisen in its application."
"They would also make it possible to continue supporting the development at the European level of political foundations, which play an important part in opening political processes to public scrutiny."
"For these reasons, it is imperative that the proposed regulation should enter into force very soon."
"On 22 October, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted a report expressing willingness to compromise with the Council to pave the way for the rapid adoption of the proposed regulation."
"The splitting of this instrument by the Permanent Representatives has thwarted these efforts."
"It is legally unnecessary, undermines the Commission's right of initiative, curtails the rights of Parliament, and is likely to cause significant delays."
"On behalf of the Conference of Presidents I call on the Council to overturn at ministerial level the decision of the Permanent Representatives."
"I have been asked for leave to speak, but there will be no debate thereafter."
"Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (DE) I am extremely grateful to you for this statement, Mr President, and also to the Conference of Presidents."
"It is a serious matter when the European Parliament - the chamber of the people at the European level - is excluded from the legislative process relating to a regulation on European political parties."
"That is truly a subject that concerns all of us here, whatever our party affiliation."
"It is unthinkable that the bureaucracies in some finance ministries and then their governments should decide on this issue rather than the people's representative assembly of the EU."
"We should not stand for that!"
"With regard to the budget for 2008, let me say that the national governments have wishes which they can only fulfil together with us."
"When dealing with the 2008 budget, this Parliament should remember what the Council decided yesterday with regard to this Regulation on the European political parties."
"Thank you for your statement."
"We have not seen the end of this issue."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, as this House will have understood from what you said, Coreper decided to split the Commission's proposal into two legal instruments: one regulation under Article 199, to which codecision applies, to cover political foundations and campaigning, and another regulation under Article 279, which means simple consultation of Parliament and the Court of Auditors to cover the financial derogations."
"The Commission opposed that splitting of its proposal for sound legal reasons, but also for political reasons."
"The decision introduces uncertainty as regards timing, when we want the proposal to enter into force before the end of this year so that the foundations can be fully functional before 2009."
"That was the whole idea behind the proposal."
"We also think that the whole proposal should be approved by codecision, under Article 199 of the Treaty."
"We regret, therefore, that Coreper decided, against the Commission's will, to reduce Parliament's role in an issue intimately related to Parliament's business, namely the financing of the political parties."
"Just 36 hours after the Committee on Constitutional Affairs approved by a very large majority the Commission's proposal, Coreper decided to follow a route which departed from that of the Commission and of Parliament."
"However, our destination, I hope, remains the same: approval of the substance of our proposal before the end of this year."
"(Applause)"
"2007 Sakharov Prize (announcement of winner)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have another announcement to make before we move on to the budget."
"At its meeting this morning - Thursday, 25 October - the Conference of Presidents unanimously chose the winner of the Sakharov Prize."
"For his commitment to the all-too-long-forgotten victims in Darfur, the Conference decided that the prize would be awarded to Salih Mahmoud Osman."
"(Applause)"
"For more than 20 years, Mr Osman, a human-rights lawyer and member of the Sudanese Organisation against Torture, has been defending countless victims of the conflict in Darfur who have been arbitrarily imprisoned, driven from their homes and tortured or who face the death penalty."
"His seat in the Sudanese Parliament now enables him to bring their cause to the attention of the international community, though sometimes at great personal sacrifice."
"Mr Osman champions the cause of dialogue and justice against violence and tyranny."
"Without democracy there can be no justice."
"By awarding the Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman, the European Parliament would like to support the work of this courageous man who has become the voice of Darfur and, through him, to support the establishment of the rule of law in Sudan."
"The formal presentation of the prize will take place in Strasbourg on Tuesday, 11 December."
"In addition, I should like to inform you that the Conference of Presidents was also unanimous in its view that we should consider an appropriate way to honour the murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, and ..."
"(Applause)"
"... the Conference of Presidents will decide at its next meeting what form that tribute will take."
"Welcome"
"It gives me great pleasure to welcome a delegation of Members of the Majlisi Oli, the Parliament of the Republic of Tajikistan, who have taken their seats in the official gallery."
"(Applause)"
"The members of the delegation have come to Strasbourg for talks with their European counterparts in the framework of the third interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the Majlisi Oli."
"This is the first time that the interparliamentary meeting has taken place here in Strasbourg."
"Mr Makhkamboy Azimovich Makhmudov, who is leading the delegation, is accompanied by Mr Nosir Yusupovich Salimov and Mr Gulkhoja Gangibekov."
"I hope that the delegation will continue to enjoy a pleasant and successful stay in the European Union."
"(Applause)"

"Draft general budget of the European Union - Financial year 2008 (vote)"
"- Before the vote"
"Mr President, before the beginning of the vote, I want to make the following statement."
"As you know, the Committee on Budgets voted on more than 1 600 amendments to the 2008 draft budget."
"Inevitably, there are a small number of technical adjustments that I hereby request to be put to the vote in plenary."
"After the vote, the Committee on Budgets issued a request to retable the following four amendments:"
"Amendment 990: + EUR 1.53m on line 16 03 04, commitment appropriations only;"
"Amendment 24: on line 15 05 55, commitment appropriations only, reserve and remarks as in Amendment 938;"
"Amendment 989: + EUR 1 million on line 16 03 02, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations;"
"Amendment 1043: + EUR 1 million on line 15 06 06, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations, plus additional remarks from Amendment 25, with the figure EUR 1 million instead of EUR 1.5 million."
"These technical changes and specifications were dealt with and approved at the meeting of Committee on Budgets of 11 October 2007."
"As regards Frontex, a technical error was identified subsequent to the vote in committee concerning the remarks."
"The correct modification to the remarks is contained in Amendment 1133, which is annexed to the voting list."
"Finally, the remarks adopted in Amendment 634 do not appear in Amendments 1018 on budget line 15 02 02 05; 934 on budget line 09 06 01; 938 on budget line 15 05 55, and 940 on budget line 17 02 02."
"And, on budget line 09 03 03, the right figure for commitment appropriations should be 5 and payment appropriations 4.85."
"I ask the Sittings Service to make the necessary corrections in the Minutes."
"On top of that, we held a discussion at the coordinators' meeting yesterday and, according to their decisions, I recommend rejecting Amendment 752 and voting in favour of Amendment 610 on line 16 02 02 (multimedia actions), but taking the reserve from Amendment 752, and rejecting Amendment 1044 and voting in favour of Amendment 32 on line 16 02 03."
"- After the vote on Amendment 878"
"(FI) Mr President, regarding Amendment 878, it has to do with the pilot projects and has been accepted."
"There was broad consensus in the Committee that we should add the changes in Amendment 822 to the justifications."
"They are otherwise identical, but a minor change has been made to Amendment 822 compared with the justifications for the previous amendment, and I propose that we could vote just on the justifications in the case of Amendment 822."
"Thank you, Mr Virrankoski."
"I am told that is indeed the intention, but Mrs De Keyser has again asked to speak."
"(FR) Mr President, I am somewhat anxious because I see that in Amendment 231 we have voted for a European foundation for the improvement 'of loving and working conditions'."
"Surely some explanation is in order!"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 996"
"Mr President, I want to propose that we vote only on reserves, and I am in favour of lifting the reserve, because we have got all the information for which we have asked."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 21"
"Mr President, I would just like to remind the House that this is the amendment concerning the Unified Sports Programme for the Special Olympics."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 938"
"Mr President, line 15 05 55 is, I think, covered by my earlier statement, so we do not have to vote on it."
"There remains, however, the question of the reserve, Mr Virrankoski."
"We do not have to vote on the first part, but a vote must be taken on the second part, that is to say the reserve."
"Mr President, in my statement I said 'reserve and remarks as in Amendment 938'."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 1043"
"Mr President, this is also covered by my earlier statement."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 752"
"Mr President, concerning the line 16 02 02, I recommend rejection of Amendment 752 and approval of Amendment 610, but that we take over the reserve from Amendment 752."
"I would therefore ask that we vote first on Amendment 610, and then on the reserve from Amendment 752."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 990"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I think this is covered by my earlier statement."
"- After the vote on block 6"
"Mr President, in Amendment 951, the German text is the correct one."
"Some of the other languages contain mistakes, so please follow the German text."
"- Before the vote on block 8"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, before starting to vote on the budgetary amendments, I would like to inform you of a limited number of technical adjustments that need to be made."
"First, concerning Section I, in Amendment 1094, only the budget line 20 26 will be voted on."
"Concerning Chapter 101, Plenary should vote only on the final amount in Amendment 1004, which is EUR 5 million."
"Concerning Sections VI and VII: in Amendment 1013, the second and third paragraphs of the justification to the amendment should replace the respective paragraphs in the justification in Amendment 1001, and the second paragraph in Amendments 986, 1007 and 999."

"Today there seem to be a reciprocal action between new objectives for the Union and demands on financing by the EU."
"This means new demands on payments from the Member States, but also that new funds are being transferred to a system which is bureaucratic, inefficient and complex."
"Today there is also too large a focus on industrial agriculture and foreign policy and military projects, and not enough on the environment and social projects."
"However, there are many desirable initiatives being financed via the budget, and we support reasonable changes to existing means."

"in writing. - (SV) I have chosen to vote to the fullest possible extent in favour of the Council's draft budget for 2008, and therefore against all increases in expenditure proposed by the European Parliament."
"It is extremely unfortunate that Parliament wishes to finance Galileo through the Community budget."
"If it transpires that the private operators back out owing to profitability problems, the EU should take the consequences and discontinue the project or allow interested Member States to join in, as happened with Boeing."
"I have also been involved in the issue of the abolition of subsidies for tobacco producers and support for wine production, and can only regret that Parliament is not prepared to support those proposals."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Of course no budget is perfect, but we must nevertheless strive to spend common funds in a just and future-oriented manner."
"Unfortunately, most of the European Union budget continues to be spent on preserving the conditions of the past."
"This is why it is important to ensure that some money goes towards the future, towards research, development and science."
"The financing of the European Institute of Technology still needs to be resolved, because the Commission has proposed a bridging solution of a maximum amount of EUR 308 million."
"Budapest would be an ideal location for the European Institute of Technology, owing to its excellent research results and the scientific expertise it has gathered in combating climate change."
"This is another reason why I am keen to see a resolution to the issue of financing."
"We Hungarians are able to provide an appropriate location for an Institute that is modest in size, economical, but all the more rigorous in terms of its intellectual basis."
"(LT) Today we have completed the first reading of the EU budget for 2008 and have voted in favour of it."
"According to the budget, more than EUR 129 billion will be allocated for commitments and more than EUR 124 billion for payments in 2008."
"In comparison to the European Commission's proposal we would like to increase the allocation of payments for the next year from 0.97 to 0.99% of the European Union's gross national income."
"I would like to point out that this increase is fully justified and is related to the development of important projects such as the Galileo satellite navigation system and the European Institute of Technology project."
"In my opinion, the allocation of additional funds for our commitments in Kosovo and Palestine - that is, for the implementation of the fourth category, 'The EU as a global player' - is very important."
"in writing. - (NL) Both rapporteurs on the EU budget, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, have rightly taken a somewhat critical line on the increase in the amounts for 2008."
"I should like to express my views on that."
"Unfortunately the European Parliament is opting in too many cases today to spend more money."
"That is why I have a problem with paragraphs 2 and 4 in the Virrankoski report."
"That is not appropriate in a European Union that wishes to concentrate on the areas where there is a benefit, the core tasks."
"Finally, an additional problem that makes it more difficult to approve the Virrankoski report is Amendment 2 by the Socialist Group."
"That amendment proposes that sexual and reproductive rights be included in the position of Parliament."
"However, these do not exclude abortus provocatus."
"The term 'sexual and reproductive rights' is therefore inappropriate."
"in writing. - (SV) Today we Swedish Social Democrats voted on the 2008 EU budget."
"We think that the adopted proposal was a good compromise and, even though we lost out in some respects, we fully support the proposal."
"We voted in favour of reducing export subsidies in agriculture, but think that it is unreasonable to vote in favour of a complete and immediate withdrawal of aid."
"We also voted against continued subsidies for tobacco producers and in favour of limiting the number of Parliament sessions in Strasbourg."
"As regards Daphne (protection of children, women and young people against violence), we voted in favour of increasing the appropriation up to the level of the Commission's proposal."
"However, we had been prepared to vote in favour of further funding, but were given no opportunity to do so because the amendment never went to vote."
"In the resolution from Mr Virrankoski, we Swedish Social Democrats voted against an amendment which, among other things, called on the Commission to ensure that no farmers would receive more than EUR 50 000 per year in direct aid from the EU."
"This is a discussion which is ongoing, so we agree with the spirit of the proposal, but do not consider it appropriate to set either an exact sum or specific conditions right now."
"in writing. - (PT) As we have pointed out, although it contains aspects that improve the proposal of the Council and the Commission, in the end the draft general budget for 2008, approved at first reading by the EP, does not comply with what was agreed for 2008 in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013."
"At the same time as restrictions are imposed on the EU budget, its priorities are defined as competition policy (an example of which is the gradual distortion of structural policy, placing it at the service of the Lisbon Strategy), and the communitisation of 'internal security and immigration control' and the EU's external policy, which promotes intervention and the militarisation of international relations."
"Hence our vote against."
"The approval of proposals we tabled should, however, be noted, such as:"
"increase in sums for the Structural Funds, POSEI (Azores and Madeira) and PROGRESS (equality between men and women);"
"support for cooperation among farmers' associations and other rural activities, and small-scale and family farming;"
"an increase of EUR 2 million for the programme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the outermost regions, which means an increase of EUR 570 000 for the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores."
"in writing. - (RO) I support the European Union's Budget, in its current form, for several reasons."
"The 553 million euro cut-back in agriculture, operated by the Council, was mainly reestablished, and the reserve created on the Commission's administrative funds is justified by the delays recorded in approving the Sectorial Operational Programmes and Rural Development Programmes."
"At the second reading of the European budget, the Council of Ministers should not perform additional reductions in the agriculture funds or structural funds."
"The amendment submitted in the plenum for limiting the farmers' income to maximum 50,000 euros per year is unjustified."
"Such an artificial barrier would prevent the best farmers from developing their work profitably."
"Moreover, this restriction will contribute to breaking down the agricultural works and to the decline of European agricultural competitiveness."
"For this reason, I rejected the amendment providing for this measure."
"The 2008 budget, in the form we adopt today, is a budget that makes the European Union institutions accountable."
"I support the proposal to transfer 49 million euros from the funds allocated to the Commission to reserves until it submits a clear report on its human resources policy, especially as regards the recruitment of new employees from the countries that have recently joined the European Union - Romania and Bulgaria."
"in writing. - I voted for this part of the 2008 Budget, while supporting the UK Government's position on a range of issues."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of Parliament's 2008 budget motion because it proposes distinct improvements to the draft budget put forward by the Council."
"A balance has been struck for 2008 between financing, on the one hand, for external policies such as support for Kosovo and Palestine and, on the other, for Galileo, a project that binds the Member States closer together."
"The European Socialists' priorities are thus well reflected in Parliament's position on the EU budget for 2008 at first reading."
"I would point out, however, what a modest budget this is: it currently represents no more than 0.99% of the Union's GDP."
"This is the first time that the budget has dropped below 1% of GDP."
"Yet the Union cannot act in the interests of its citizens if it lacks the resources to do so."
"It is time that the Member States shouldered their responsibilities here."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say that I was very sorry that we have decided again not to receive travel expenses."
"I would suggest to Parliament that, possibly, if they split the price of tickets from mileage, there might be more support in the future."
"I think citizens will watch this vote and will again be disappointed."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament has defended its priorities well at this first-reading stage of the 2008 budget, and I support what the two rapporteurs have achieved, particularly in relation to cohesion and sustainable growth."
"Let us not forget, however, that because the financial perspective for 2007-2013 was pitched too low it will be a poor annual budget - representing just 0.99% of gross national income. Like my political group, I deplore this situation, for it will not allow us to meet the expectations of all Parliament's committees or to devote adequate financing to major forward-looking European Union projects such as Galileo."
"We have agreed, however, to support the main thrust of the information and communications policy: we will thus be able to focus on local media, which play such a significant role in conveying information to all the people of Europe."
"This is particularly important given the pending question of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and preparations for the European election in 2009."
"As the standing rapporteur on information policy in the Budgets Committee, I welcome the possibilities that the new budget affords in this respect."
"in writing. - (PT) Of the many aspects of this draft budget for 2008 that could be highlighted, we would like to stress two:"
"First, how much we regret the inconsistency of this Parliament, which claims that it recognises and preserves the linguistic diversity of Members of the European Parliament, but at the same time refuses to accept the inclusion of a clear reference that it is mandatory for all the official languages of the EU to be available during its meetings, as we have proposed for some years."
"Hence the Committee on Budgets' incomprehensible and unacceptable rejection of our proposal that sought to ensure, for example, that Portuguese should be one of the working languages in EU-ACP Parliamentary Assembly meetings, particularly considering the Members of Parliament of various countries represented on the Committee whose official language is Portuguese."
"Secondly, the worrying and growing tendency to reinforce appropriations for a 'strong information policy' in the context of the (re)'launch' of the 'reform' Treaty and the next elections to the EP in 2009."
"To understand what is really going on, it will suffice to follow the discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the review of the European Political Parties Regulation to understand what is really going on."
"in writing. - (RO) The current system of proceedings for the plenary sessions at the headquarters of the Strasbourg Parliament and the committee or group sessions in Brussels is inefficient and uneconomical."
"It is estimated that over 200 million euros would be saved annually from the European tax payer's money if it was decided to establish the Parliament's headquarters in Brussels, not only due to the inherent cost reduction, but also by facilitating interinstitutional work."
"At the same time, groups from the civil society have drawn attention to the serious environmental consequences of the frequent transportation of the European Members of Parliament and civil servants from city to city for the proceedings of the European legislative activity."
"For these reasons, I consider that the idea to maintain two annual plenary sessions at the Strasbourg headquarters is unjustified."
"This would aggravate the situation of the administration costs, since payments will be made throughout the entire year to prepare such sessions, as regards costs related both to the premises, and to the personnel."
"Numerous civic initiatives, of which at least one benefits from over one million signatures from most Member States, request the elimination of the duality of the European Parliament's headquarters."
"It is time for this situation to be discussed by the management of the Parliament and the Council in order to establish a single headquarters of our institution."
"in writing. - (DA) We members of the Danish Liberal Party (Venstre) in the European Parliament have voted to reject Amendment 8 by Mr Schlyter and Mr Jens-Peter Bonde of the Independence and Democracy Group."
"Venstre supports a reform of travel reimbursement so that all reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded."
"However, this has already been decided by the new Members' Statute, which will be implemented from 2009."
"Mr Bonde's proposal has not been thought through and is in breach of the current statute."
"in writing. - I voted for these sections of the 2008 Budget."
"in writing. - I voted for the reports in respect of the 2008 draft budget, but I did so heavy in heart because it would appear that the expensive circus that is our regular visits to Strasbourg looks set to continue."
"It is particularly poignant that we are voting to carry on meeting in Strasbourg on the same day that Air France has decided to leave some of our number stranded, or certainly inconvenienced, because of industrial action by some of its staff."
"Martin Luther King once said ""I have a dream”."
"I too have a dream; and that dream is that one day this Parliament has a single seat from which to operate and the Strasbourg circus will come to an end."
"in writing. - (PT) A joint effort must be made to try to improve quality standards and the effectiveness of justice."
"This is a very sensitive and diverse area, however, which highlights the need to reinforce confidence in order to allow mutual recognition of judicial decisions, thereby contributing towards the gradual development of a European judicial culture."
"I support Mrs Esteves' excellent report, the objective of which, in connection with reinforcing the principle of mutual recognition of decisions, is to enhance the prospects of the sentenced person being reintegrated into society, while seeking to improve the protection of victims and prevent recidivism."
"This Framework Decision seeks to lay down the rules under which a Member State, within the limits of its competence, must monitor and supervise non-custodial measures (decisions related to the execution of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and additional sentences) imposed by judgments passed in other Member States."
"I hope that under the Portuguese Presidency the outstanding questions can be resolved, and that a general agreement can be reached by the end of the year."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which sets out ways to help a sentenced person's reintegration into society, provide better protection for victims and help with the enforcement of appropriate sentences where offenders are not resident."
"in writing. - (FR) If ever there was a sensitive subject, it is surely the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters."
"The fact is that criminal law in Europe today is not standard - indeed far from it."
"Different countries have not only different legal traditions and values but also different criminal laws."
"The Member States' criminal law systems reflect their respective identities."
"Examples of disparity in criminal law at national level are many and varied."
"For example, the protection of freedom of expression and the definition of what constitutes a violation of freedom of expression differ markedly from one country to another."
"It would therefore be very dangerous to insist that a penalty handed down in one country should automatically be applied in another: dangerous not only for those who come before the law, but also for the rule of law generally."
"So we need to tread very warily indeed here, because it is currently impossible to ensure the application of certain common basic standards in the law of criminal procedure."
"I am thinking particularly of respect for the principle of double jeopardy, of the right to a genuine, rather than a merely formal, defence and, indeed, of victims' rights."
"There are two fundamental principles that must always be followed and observed - otherwise the rule of law will cease to exist. They are the principles of legality and legal certainty."
"in writing. - (PT) As the report states, the 1999 Tampere European Council endorsed the principle of mutual recognition as 'the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters within the Union'."
"A year later the Council approved a programme of measures focusing on this principle, so as to adapt the mechanisms of mutual recognition of final sentences and extend the application of the principle of transferring sentenced persons to cover persons resident in a Member State."
"The Hague Programme subsequently set new targets, particularly in connection with the 'fight against terrorism', to make progress in the communitisation of this area, which lies at the heart of the Member States' sovereignty."
"In the light of this proposal and as our Parliamentary group has stressed, it is worrying that the report establishes that 'notwithstanding the necessity of providing the sentenced person with adequate safeguards, his or her involvement in the proceedings should no longer be dominant by requiring in all cases his or her consent to the forwarding of a judgment to another Member State for the purpose of its recognition and enforcement of the sentence imposed', particularly since we fail to see how not ensuring this principle is consistent with the aim of the Framework Decision: to help to rehabilitate the person sentenced."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament voted in favour of the report."
"The agreement is a step in the right direction."
"Higher demands are placed on monitoring the consequences of the agreement for fish stocks and living conditions for local people."
"It is now important to monitor the effects of the agreement properly."
"However, we voted against Amendment 7."
"We fully support the intention of contributing to sustainable development of fisheries, which is also the aim of the new fisheries agreement."
"The agreement must not entail detrimental consequences for fisheries and the population in Madagascar either."
"On the other hand, we cannot support the agreement being immediately repealed if it entails detrimental consequences."
"We consider that the joint committee that will be formed to oversee the agreement is a better solution for ensuring that the agreement is complied with and that it benefits both parties and the environment."
"The agreement will be renegotiated if it transpires that it entails detrimental consequences."
"We are in favour of the fact that a larger proportion of the costs will be financed from the European vessels supported by the agreement."
"However, we consider that the aim must be for the whole agreement to be self-financed."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which endorsed the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Madagascar."
"It is a tuna agreement which allocates fishing opportunities, according to three categories of vessel, to Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom."
"It provides fishery resources for EU vessels, whilst enabling Madagascar to receive income for stocks which the country would not have the technical capacity to exploit."
"in writing. - (PT) We voted against the report as a protest against the way in which the Commission proposes to share fishing opportunities among the Member States under this agreement."
"Contrary to what has always happened in this type of agreement, the Commission is proposing to violate a basic principle that has been a fundamental tool for ensuring justice and equality between Member States and, in practice, a tacit agreement between them."
"We consider the failure to apply this principle in this case to be incomprehensible and unacceptable."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament voted in favour of the report."
"The agreement is a step in the right direction."
"Higher demands are placed on monitoring the consequences of the agreement for fish stocks and living conditions for local people."
"It is now important to monitor the effects of the agreement properly."
"However, we voted against Amendment 8."
"We fully support the intention of contributing to sustainable development of fisheries, which is also the aim of the new fisheries agreement."
"The agreement must not entail detrimental consequences for the fisheries and the population in Mozambique either."
"On the other hand, we cannot support the agreement being immediately repealed if it entails detrimental consequences."
"We consider that the joint committee that will be formed to oversee the agreement is a better solution for ensuring that the agreement is complied with and that it benefits both parties and the environment."
"The agreement will be renegotiated if it transpires that it entails detrimental consequences."
"We are in favour of the fact that a larger proportion of the costs will be financed from the European vessels supported by the agreement."
"However, we consider that the aim must be for the whole agreement to be self-financed."
"in writing. - (PT) I abstained from voting on my report because, although I recognise the urgency of concluding the agreement and consider this proposal to be positive in part as regards the distribution of fishing licences, and given that it is not feasible to amend it, which is the responsibility of the Council and the Commission, I strongly disagree with the failure to observe the principle of relative stability that has always prevailed in previous agreements."
"I am also sorry that, owing to possible legal considerations, it is not possible to table various draft legislative amendments to the provisions of the agreement, seeking on the one hand to reinforce civil society in Mozambique, with the fishermen's active participation in preparing future agreements, and, on the other, to optimise international rules on the occupational categories concerned, namely as regards fixing minimum wage rules for ACP seamen."
"I felt that the European Parliament's political mandate was restricted in this area, and therefore tabled other proposals for amendments - considered legally admissible - seeking to improve the information forwarded to Parliament and requiring Parliament and the Council to submit a report on the application of the agreement during the final year of the protocol's validity, and before another agreement is concluded on its renewal."
"in writing. - (PT) We cannot vote in favour of this fishing agreement, because we believe the sharing of fishing opportunities it establishes among the various Member States is disproportionate and inadequate, since it does not safeguard Portugal's legitimate interests."
"This Partnership Agreement between the EC and Mozambique came into force on 1 January 2007 for a period of five years, and, compared with the previous agreement, it provides for an increase of 2 000 tonnes in the Community fishing quota for tuna or tuna-like species."
"In the previous agreement, the extent to which Portugal used its entitlement to fishing opportunities (five) was rather high, which is why Portugal asked for nine licences for surface longliners, plus continuation of the opportunities in demersal freezer trawlers fishing for deep-water shrimp."
"However, it was only awarded seven licences for tuna fishing."
"Bearing in mind the previous distribution of licences and (non-)respect for the principle of relative stability in the light of the increase in fishing opportunities, this new agreement therefore involves a marked imbalance: Portugal only gains two more licences, while the other Member States gain a further 16 (France) and 13 (Spain)."
"If decisions in the Council required unanimity, that would not happen."
"Hence our vote against."
"in writing. - I voted for this uncontroversial report, which endorses the proposal for a regulation on the conclusion of a new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mozambique."
"The agreement has been signed for a period of five years (renewable) from its entry into force, and it grants fishing opportunities to vessels from Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom."
"in writing. - (PT) The purpose of the regulation on business registers (Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93), which compiles statistics on businesses operating in the European Union, namely their number, type, size structure and other characteristics, was to provide reliable statistical data for EU policy-makers."
"On 1 June 2006, the European Parliament supported the essential aspects of the Commission's proposal at first reading, subject to 22 amendments focusing on the issue of the administrative burden, a clarification of the terms and conditions under which confidential data can be transmitted, and, finally, a series of amendments of a technical and editorial nature."
"In its Common Position of 21 May 2007, the Council endorsed all 22 Parliament amendments."
"New red tape has subsequently created additional difficulties in the process, however, which has therefore dragged on until this time, involving great cost, something the rapporteur has rightly condemned."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which helps improve those parts of the EU's statistical system that involve registers of information about businesses operating in the Union."
"in writing. - (DA) The Danish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have voted in favour of Parliament's resolution on rising feed and food prices."
"It is the delegation's belief that it is necessary to focus on rising feed and food prices."
"However, the delegation does not share the belief that it is a good thing that the EU's agricultural ministers recently decided to suspend the obligations for removal in 2008."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to abstain in our vote on Resolution RC B6-400/2007 further to Question for Oral Answer B6-0321/2007 on rising feed and food prices, as we think that the resolution gives rise to doubts concerning the economic situation for farmers in the EU."
"The increased prices for cereals and food benefit farmers and can provide a better opportunity to restructure the agricultural sector in the EU."
"Furthermore, agriculture, just like other sectors, must deal with certain changes in demand."
"On the other hand, we share the view taken in the resolution on biofuels, the large food price increases in the distribution sector, and food insecurity in the world."
"in writing. - (PT) The recent rise in food prices is due largely to successive reforms in the CAP, the abandonment of production thereby promoted, and the resulting disappearance of many small and medium-sized farms."
"Ignoring the specific reality of Member States to take greater account of the interests of the large agri-industrial enterprises, multinational food distributors and negotiations to liberalise trade within the WTO has helped to change the basis of agricultural activity, leading to a fall in output."
"Meanwhile, the use of agricultural products for non-food purposes, particularly for producing biofuels, which they seek to prioritise, will not help to develop agricultural activity and may, on the contrary, replace the production of food products, thereby having a negative impact on the protection of food sovereignty."
"We therefore believe it is essential to reappraise the objectives of the common agricultural policy in order to increase food product output, support small and medium-sized agricultural and livestock holdings and moderate consumer prices, reinforcing intervention mechanisms and ensuring appropriate intervention prices."
"in writing. - I supported the joint motion for a resolution on rising feed and food prices which addresses the significant shift in commodity prices in the EU and globally."
"I also voted in favour of amendments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, which deal with the issue of GM in feed ingredients."
"These amendments highlight the realities of the marketplace and merely point out the fact that significant quantities of maize and soya, already being used to produce animal feed in the EU, are of GM origin."
"The amendments also address the difficulties in relation to the authorisation of GM animal feed ingredients."
"This situation is having an impact on the competitiveness of EU livestock farmers and leads to the paradoxical situation where EU consumers buy meat and livestock products from third countries that use GM feed."
"These amendments are necessary to highlight the inconsistency of the EU's attitude to GM and the need for a more open debate about this subject."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favor of this report hoping that it will have a crucial impact on Serbia's decision to continue the democratic reform and its connection to the European standards, especially in the field of respect for the rights of minorities."
"Although the report welcomes the relative improvement of the situation, the latter has still not provided the necessary conditions for true interethnic living together and mutual respect and cases of flagrant infringement of the rights of minorities are still numerous and serious."
"Here I refer to a concrete example - that of neglecting the rights of the Romanian community and the Romanian language speakers in Serbia, especially in Valea Timocului and Vojvodina."
"Today, I can only find, with regret, that their linguistic rights are refused and ignored, whether we speak of education or religious practice in the Romanian language."
"A clear message should be sent to Serbia in this respect: only a truly multiethnic Serbia, which ensures understanding between communities and mutual tolerance, can be considered really European."
"(NL) Mr President, I voted against the Martens report."
"I have to admit that there are quite a number of sensible points in the report, but to my mind it does not touch on the main cause of Africa's problems, and also it does not send the right signals on the problem of the future, the challenge of the future, which is the flood of immigrants."
"Why is it not even possible in a European Parliament report to refer to the main cause of the poverty, hunger, lack of security, social and economic problems in Africa?"
"The main cause is the bad governments on the continent."
"It is the corrupt rulers who do not care about good governance, democracy or human rights, but who in their own countries, with money they steal from their citizens, spend more on arms every year than they receive in development aid."
"That is a scandal."
"The signal on immigration is also totally inadequate."
"Firstly, Europe cannot take any more immigration and, secondly, immigration to Europe by highly educated people from poor countries is a tragedy for the countries of origin themselves."
"in writing. (SV) - We Swedish Social Democrats supported the report, which is good."
"There is a need for a partnership between the EU and Africa in order to meet the challenges of the future."
"We voted in favour of paragraph 61 because we support free trade."
"However, we wish to point out that we cannot create growth through free trade if we do not at the same time invest in education, health and other long-term investments, which also emerges from other parts of the report."
"in writing. - (SV) It is clear that sexual and reproductive health is an extremely important issue."
"Therefore, the welfare of women and children should not be exploited by the European Parliament in its attempt to expand its authority, as in paragraph 77 of the report."
"Moreover, a competent, legitimate UN body is already working on these issues now."
"In the light of the unpleasant currents that exist in this Chamber, where many Members actively oppose sexual and reproductive health, both within the Union and elsewhere, it would be a great tragedy if the European Parliament were to be given more power with regard to this issue."
"in writing. - (PT) Though it includes aspects we consider to be positive, this report fails to examine the real core of EU-Africa relations, omitting or shirking its key responsibilities and strategic objectives."
"The most striking example is perhaps its silence on NATO/USA/EU initiatives in relation to Africa, such as the creation of specific military commands (USA/AFRICOM), the holding of military manoeuvres (NATO), or the growing military presence of the major EU powers ('peace support mechanisms', military missions)."
"The report also contains aspects that open the doors to intervention - disguised as 'humanitarian', 'conflict management' or 'good governance' - and does not object to the increasing subordination of development policy to 'security' strategies, favouring 'development aid' provided by soldiers or the use of its funds for purposes that have nothing to do with such aid, allocating it in accordance with the major powers' strategic objectives, namely control of Africa's huge natural resources, including oil."
"Finally, ascribing value to the constraints it advocates for the 'Economic Partnership Agreements', the report reaffirms the 'dogma' of trade liberalisation as a basis for development."
"In support of the EU/Africa Summit, we reject such policies."
"in writing. - (PL) Mrs Martens is right to note that the basis for developing cooperation between Africa and Europe should be developing democracy and a partnership based on mutual respect."
"It was also right to point out that the partners are equal as regards their rights and responsibilities, but not as regards their level of integration or access to and level of development of financial, technical and human resources."
"I would agree that our common responsibility and the primary aim of cooperation between the EU and Africa has to be the elimination of poverty, and that peace is of key significance as a first step towards development."
"I believe that, in the spirit of the report, it is important to take into account the real needs of the African population: to ensure proper remuneration for small farmers, increase local production, ensure food safety and the safety of livelihoods, as well as the creation of local and regional markets."
"in writing. - (DE) Besides the important discussion of unfair trade policies, the report on the state of relations between the EU and Africa also deals with the prevention and resolution of conflicts."
"In this context I should like to refer to the last colony in the world, the last colony in Africa, namely the Western Sahara, which has been occupied by Morocco for more than 30 years."
"This occupation infringes international law and is accompanied by flagrant violations of human rights."
"When we champion the human rights of the Saharawi people and their right of self-determination, we often hear that we are adopting a pro-Saharawi stance."
"That is an appalling attitude, for our sole aim is to uphold human rights and international law."
"All European institutions should be devoted to this cause and not merely pursue the economic interests of the Member States."
"Europe needs to adopt a credible stance against dictatorships."
"Wagging our finger at a few selected dictatorships damages the credibility of the Union as a peace broker, and damages those who suffer oppression and are subjected daily to gross violations of their human rights."
"in writing. - (PL) I would like to vote in favour of Mrs Martens' report on EU-Africa relations."
"A joint strategy should be developed for cooperation between the European Union and African countries, which should be based on mutual respect and on joint, clearly defined principles and values."
"We must take the standpoint of the African party into consideration and focus particularly on the issue of development, as well as achieving the Millennium Development Goals, such as stable growth and development, the eradication of poverty, and assistance in providing access to education and health protection measures."
"in writing. (SV) - We Swedish Social Democrats supported the report, which is good."
"However, we voted against Amendment 1, which referred to the use of cluster munitions in two specific conflicts."
"We chose to vote against it because we condemn the use of cluster munitions in all conflicts, and not just in specific cases."
"in writing. - (SV) There is no doubt that cluster munitions are very cruel weapons systems which cause great suffering to civilians."
"It is therefore distressing that the European Parliament is using such an important issue in its efforts to hasten the creation of a United States of Europe."
"A ban on this kind of weapon must be implemented globally, through the UN and on the initiative of the nation states, not by the European Parliament."
"We therefore voted against the resolution in the vote today."
"in writing. - (PT) On 17 September last, the United Nations called on its Member States to take immediate measures to address the dreadful effects of the use of cluster munitions, calling for the conclusion of a legally binding instrument of international humanitarian law that prohibits the use, development, production, stockpiling and transfer of such munitions."
"The United Nations requires the destruction of current stockpiles of those munitions, asks for risk mitigation and victim assistance activities, and until such an instrument is adopted, calls on Member States to freeze the use and transfer of such weapons."
"As this resolution states, it has been documented that 98% of the victims of these bombs are civilians, causing a high and brutal rate of fatalities and injuries, especially amongst children."
"However, the majority of the EP voted against specifying that cluster munitions have been used by the so-called coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and by Israeli forces in the Lebanon."
"The arms race must be brought to a halt as a matter of urgency."
"Weapons of mass destruction, cluster munitions, depleted uranium weapons and phosphorus shells must be prohibited as a matter of urgency."
"We therefore support this resolution."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution, which reaffirms the need to strengthen international humanitarian law (IHL) as it applies to cluster munitions and speedily to adopt at international level a comprehensive ban on the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions."
"The House also noted it strongly supports the Oslo Process launched in February 2007."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to explain my voting on Mr Cappato's report, and also to clarify why the Union for Europe of the Nations Group abstained from voting."
"I voted against, as I believe this to be a very controversial idea."
"Narcotics are the principal business in Afghanistan and to try to control even some part of the production for medical purposes seems to be more than questionable."
"For this reason I voted against this proposal."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Cappato has proposed, and achieved, with this report is to make it known that the European Parliament is in favour of experiments to transform the production of opium in Afghanistan for criminal uses into the production of opium for medicinal uses to treat patients."
"I have to say that I voted against, because the worker growing poppies in the field is the real starting point for the deaths and crimes brought about by those who have fallen, consciously or unconsciously, into the net of this terrible scourge of humanity."
"In my view, those who have voted for this report are deluding themselves that something that is carried on illegally at present, that is opium poppy growing in Afghanistan, can be eradicated simply by allowing and authorising its use for beneficial purposes."
"in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party could not support this resolution, as at its core is a proposal to encourage opium growing in Afghanistan."
"This runs contrary to efforts being put in place by the Government of Afghanistan with the support of the international community, and also runs contrary to the wishes of 80% of the Afghan people - the opium industry feeds the Taliban insurgency."
"We note that the number of opium-free provinces in Afghanistan has more than doubled this year."
"We voted against the original texts in Paragraph 1(a) and 1(b) as we feel strongly that there is no role for the European Parliament in promoting any projects which encourage the production of opium in Afghanistan."
"We voted against the report for the reasons above, and also because this proposal is based on a factually incorrect presumption of a global shortage of opiates for medicinal use."
"The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has stated that an overproduction in licit opiates since 2000 has led to stockpiles in producing countries 'that could cover demand for two years'."
"in writing. - I voted against this report."
"There is no shortage of opium available for medical use in the world, and the security situation in Afghanistan does not seem likely to lend itself to secure production and collection of opium for medical purposes."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report."
"Attachment is a process by which a creditor can apply to a court to freeze a bank account in order to prevent someone disposing of claimed monies."
"It strikes a balance between the rights of creditors to recover debts and the provision of adequate protection for defendants."
"It does not conflict with national laws, and should make a common standard procedure available across the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) Information from the register of activities shows that the Ombudsman received 3 830 complaints in 2006."
"The Ombudsman, however, felt that only 21.5% of these cases fell within his remit, of which 258 led to an inquiry."
"In 2006 the Ombudsman carried out 582 inquiries in total, of which 315 were already under way in 2005 and nine were launched on the Ombudsman's own initiative."
"Interestingly, as in previous years the institutional body which was the subject of most inquiries was the Commission, which accounted for 66% of the total (387). This was followed by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which accounted for 13%, and then the European Parliament, which accounted for 8%."
"The most common complaint was lack of transparency, including refusal of information (25%), followed by unfairness or abuse of power and a variety of other types of maladministration."
"However, as stated by the Ombudsman himself, there are many cases in which his critical remarks clearly have no effect, but they are without doubt a warning that problems exist, and Parliament should therefore pay them due attention."

"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Communication of Council common positions: see Minutes"

"Company law (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on company law."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the European private company statute has regularly been on the agenda of the European Parliament and also, as you know, on that of its Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Various arguments presented during these debates have demonstrated that a statute for European private companies may bring benefits to small and medium-sized companies, and there has also been support for the idea of a stakeholder consultation."
"The Commission recognises that the regulatory framework needs to be adapted to allow SMEs to make the most of increasingly integrated European markets."
"We need to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium-sized companies to conduct cross-border business."
"It is important to take action that will help those firms to fully reap the benefits of the single market."
"The growth of small and medium-sized businesses is crucial, as we all know, for the competitiveness of the European economy, and the Commission can see that a European private company statute could facilitate the expansion of small businesses beyond national borders."
"Therefore, by providing an option, it would create more choice for companies, without imposing any additional burdens."
"It could well reduce the compliance costs for firms that wish to operate in several Member States."
"If this can be achieved, SMEs could have easier access to new markets."
"The Commission is therefore aware of the importance of the European private company statute to the Member States of the European Union and to European businesses."
"I can assure you that my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy, will proceed with a legislative proposal for a European private company statute, as he declared to the Legal Affairs Committee on 3 October 2007."
"This proposal should be ready by mid-2008 at the latest."
"As you know, we are currently conducting further consultations on the exact form and content of the proposal, the results of which will then be incorporated into the impact assessment to be completed in the first months of next year."
"My colleague Mr McCreevy will be very happy to have a continued dialogue with you once this proposal is on the table."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by thanking you sincerely for your remarks, which bring me neatly to my first point, namely the European private-company statute."
"I may say we are delighted that, after protracted difficulties, the Commission has finally been convinced of the need for this legislative draft, and that we can now expect to receive it."
"It is to the credit of Parliament that this was made possible by the heavy pressure we exerted."
"Be that as it may, we can only rejoice wholeheartedly at the outcome."
"I do, however, intend to address a second point to which today's resolution also refers, and on which we are not satisfied with the way things have developed."
"I refer here to the 14th Company Law Directive on the transfer of the company's registered office, the place where companies are registered."
"For many years the European Commission has had plans to close this loophole in company law."
"We have now learned that this has been more or less deleted from the legislative programme, at least as far as the European Commission is concerned, and that the loophole will therefore remain open."
"May I emphasise at this point that my political group at least - and, I believe, an overwhelming majority of the Legal Affairs Committee, to judge by the tenor of its deliberations in recent years, and of this House as a whole - has always taken the view that this loophole needs to be closed and that the 14th Company Law Directive is a necessity."
"This is not a matter of additional bureaucracy and new corporate obligations. It is simply about giving companies the opportunity promised them in the Treaty to move freely within the European Union and establish themselves in any Member State."
"We have heard that one of the reasons why the European Commission felt unable to move forward on this issue and to present a proposal was its view that the existing merger regulations and other provisions were adequate to guarantee corporate mobility."
"I can only say that, if a company cannot move its registered office within the single market unless it founds a new company in another country and then merges with it, the present rules are scarcely exemplary as a means of avoiding red tape or minimising costs."
"The ideal would be a sound piece of secondary legislation that guaranteed the right of companies to exercise in practice the freedom that the single market offers them in theory."
"One of the arguments advanced for the status quo is that past rulings of the European Court of Justice have greatly liberalised company law in any case."
"That is undoubtedly true, but the European Court delivers these rulings for the sole purpose of promoting the full application of primary law, simply because the legislative bodies responsible for the adoption of secondary law, namely Parliament and the Council - though we depend on the European Commission - are not able to enact sound secondary legislation that would actually guarantee the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty provisions establishing the single market."
"That is why Parliament is adhering to its position that the Commission's monopoly on the right of initiative binds it to present a proposal for a 14th Company Law Directive in due course."
"We ask the Commission to reconsider whether the 14th Directive, which is already on file in the Commission's offices, can be incorporated into the legislative programme in the coming years."
"If that does not happen, Parliament reserves the right - as our resolution expressly states - to invoke Article 192 of the Treaty and table a report on its own initiative with a view to requesting a legislative proposal."
"And while we are on the subject of company law, let me take this convenient opportunity to say a brief word about the Commission's latest communication on the simplification of company law."
"The resolution does not deal directly with that communication, but there is a thematic connection between the two."
"I believe we in Parliament agree that we do not support any erosion of the substance of established Community law and practice - the acquis communautaire - as a consequence of simplification measures."
"In other words, there can be no question, in my view, of deleting entire directives."
"What we can support are measures designed to unburden companies, to minimise bureaucratic and statistical obligations, to relieve companies of the requirement to publish all the bits and pieces which appear in their balance sheets but which may actually be quite unimportant."
"I believe there is scope here to cooperate closely with the Commission in order to improve company law."
"One other thing that struck me when I read the Commission's documentation on this subject was that there are certain laws we have enacted - one example being the Transparency Directive, adopted in the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act - which contain some provisions that now beg the question of why they are not being reviewed as part of a simplification drive."
"I should also welcome further consideration of this matter by the Commission, since such a review would likewise help to improve company law."
"on behalf of the PSE. - (ES) Mr President, Mr Lehne has in essence given the view held by the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"He has done so on behalf of the European People's Party Group, and I shall do so on behalf of the Party of European Socialists."
"Our concern at present is, as Mr Lehne has said, that we are relying too heavily on judicial development of the law, in other words, on development through the case-law of the Court of Justice."
"The case-law of the Court of Justice fills in the gaps left by the secondary law of the European Union, but we do not have secondary law."
"The Treaties are very general in nature and provide for certain fields and give rise to various interpretations and do not at present facilitate the establishment of the internal market."
"Our proposals are bi-directional, as Mr Lehne has pointed out, firstly they support the offer made by the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the European private company which would clearly do a great deal to help establish free movement within the European Union, and secondly to try to continue pushing in the field of company law by pressing for a new directive, the fourteenth, which could ultimately supplement those provisions."
"I share Mr Lehne's concern that, if we do not adopt provisions on the transfer of company head offices, then we would in fact be leaving a legal loophole open because mergers are a different matter and do not fall fully into this category."
"We hope the Commission can include this type of activities in its work programme."
"First, I hope that during 2008 and, if possible, before 30 June, the proposal for a directive, the Directive on the European private company statute, will be on the table, and, secondly, it is to be hoped that the Commission does not give up on the idea of continuing to develop company law in fields such as freedom of establishment and change of domicile for companies."
"That is the end of my speech."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me answer both questions."
"In answer to the first, I think it is clear."
"In answer to the second, concerning the 14th company law directive, we had suggested that a further means of improving mobility might be a directive stipulating the conditions for the transfer of registered offices in the European Union."
"The results of the economic analysis of the possible added value of a directive were inconclusive; companies already have the legal means to effect cross-border transfer."
"Several companies have already transferred their registered office using the possibilities offered by the European Company Statute."
"Soon, the Cross-Border Mergers Directive, which will enter into force in December, will give all limited liability companies, including SMEs, the option to transfer their registered office."
"They could do so by setting up a subsidiary in the Member State to which they want to move and then merging the existing company into this subsidiary."
"In the Commission's view, it is only if this framework is found wanting that future legislative action in the shape of a 14th company law directive can be justified."
"Therefore, Mr McCreevy has decided for the moment not to proceed with this 14th company law directive, but I will certainly communicate your concerns again."
"I have received a motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly, during voting time."
"1."
"Iran"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Iran."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, once again we are talking about Iran."
"I am the co-author of a resolution prepared by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"The situation in Iran is a never-ending story of breaches of human rights."
"The European Parliament returns to this issue very regularly, giving the names of more victims and more examples of breaches of human rights."
"I have to say with some regret that some of the politicians in the European Union and some governments apply double standards, in that much more is said about human rights in the countries with which there is no trade, where one cannot do business."
"In the case of countries with which economic ties are maintained, even unofficially, without saying anything, but making money, people seem to speak about human rights more quietly, in a whisper."
"It is very good that the European Parliament is not whispering when it comes to Iran."
"In the joint resolution that we are proposing, what I would like to emphasise over and above political divisions, is that we list new, specific and tragic facts that illustrate the drama that is taking place before our eyes in that country."
"The attention of the world's public opinion is focused on something else, on certain attempts to create a nuclear power in that country or on the clearly anti-Semitic statements of the President of Iran."
"Unfortunately we do not notice the breaches of human rights in that country, so it is good that the European Parliament is considering this issue today."
"author. - Mr President, this is not the first time, and I fear that it will not be the last, that this House is called upon to deal with the situation in Iran."
"That country, which has all the natural resources for achieving an envious standard of living for its people, is unfortunately sinking deeper into the abyss of dark ages-like totalitarian governance, with the resulting gross violations of the human rights of its citizens, and with Iran becoming more and more isolated from the rest of the world."
"The continued practice of barbaric acts such as the stoning to death of citizens, including women and children, and the non-recognition of the quality of the rights of women and of political opponents, is a stigma to civilised living."
"Every day, reports reach us of even more cases of arrests, torture and killings of innocent civilians by the authorities of Iran."
"(The President asked the speaker to slow down)"
"I hope that will not cost me time, Mr President."
"Incidentally, that is why I speak in English - so that people can understand me without the need for interpretation."
"(Applause from certain quarters)"
"Thank you, Mr Tannock."
"Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is pretty much non-existent in that country, and all this at the same time as the secretive work to produce nuclear weapons is going ahead against all common sense and in spite of international outcry."
"The Iranian regime, blinded by short-sighted nationalism and extreme religious fanaticism, is following a road that can only lead to confrontation and consequent suffering, mainly to its own people."
"Let us once again, on the occasion of voting for this resolution, send a message of support to those Iranians fighting for freedom and democracy, and let us again make clear to the extremist rulers of Iran that our patience is running out fast owing to their foolishly dangerous behaviour."
"Can I conclude by informing colleagues of some good news from the United States which I have just received, which is that the US Administration has decided to put the Revolutionary Guards on the terrorist list."
"author. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week we had the pleasure of hearing the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Doris Lessing, who as we know is of Iranian descent, saying what we all think: 'I hate the Iranian government."
"It's a cruel and evil government'."
"Doris Lessing also said that the reason nobody dares to criticise the Iranian government is because of oil."
"I think she could not have been more accurate and could not have put it better."
"This policy of appeasement is lethal, not only for the interests of the Iranian people, but also for everyone who wants peace."
"The continuation of this policy and the fuelling of the Iranian regime's expansionist and fanatical instincts will be the greatest tragedy we will face in the near future. I believe we must all be aware of that fact and must reverse this policy."
"If we do not, the future will be very bleak, and I would just like to say, Mr President, that this House should send a very special greeting to the Nobel Prize winner for her very judicious words."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, in assessing what is happening in and around Iran at the moment, there are four issues to be considered."
"Firstly, the appalling human rights situation that has developed as a result of a regime based not on democracy and human equality, but on its own interpretation of the will of God, which gives it the right to imprison, torture and murder others."
"Secondly, the attempt by the regime to win mass support, despite its role as a violent minority."
"It is artificially attempting to appeal to national pride."
"The reason for that pride is the possession of nuclear energy and possibly even nuclear weapons, just like India, Pakistan and Israel, which have not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"Thirdly, opposition to the regime."
"Both the moderate opposition, which wants a slightly less strict system, as was the case under the previous president, and the real democratic opposition amongst workers and students in Iran, and also amongst intellectuals who have fled abroad."
"Fourthly, the American threat to use the same model in Iran as in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a military invasion or at least bombing."
"Such an attack by foreign opponents would be counter-productive."
"That would encourage patriotic feeling on the part of the Iranians, and they would rally to the support of the hated regime and its nuclear weapons, if any."
"My group is not in favour of a military invasion against the regime, or of seeking friendship with that regime out of self-interest."
"We should show solidarity with the victims and the opposition."
"The regime must not in any way be given the impression that it is possible to negotiate restrictions on the rights of the opposition in exile in Europe, and must not be allowed to spread propaganda by claiming that democratic countries support its misrule."
"The European Court of Justice's decision to remove the People's Mujahidin organisation from the list of terrorist organisations should be fully complied with, so that that organisation and other opposition groups do not face any legal or financial obstacles."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, I believe there are three elements - at least three - justifying this urgency."
"First, as has already been noted, the growing deterioration in the human rights situation."
"Secondly, the record figures for executions, not only in numerical terms but also in the brutality with which they are being carried out."
"Today we have more executions than there were in the whole of 2007 - 244 in 2007 and 177 in 2006."
"The third element is the persecution to which organisations for human rights activists are being subjected, especially those organisations which defend women's rights."
"I believe that all this justifies not only this resolution but also, as the resolution states, urging the United Nations General Assembly to vote on a resolution explicitly and unreservedly condemning the violation of fundamental rights in Iran."
"This is something we have been asking for for a long time."
"We do not understand why there is this reticence about it and I hope that this resolution will at least help to change some minds."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, the Koran, the sacred book of Muslims, is considered by outstanding specialists to be a book of love."
"But what is happening in those countries that call themselves Islamic countries?"
"They are governed by extreme radicals."
"The only message that comes out of these countries is one of hatred of the outside world, of fellow Muslims and of their own citizens."
"What is happening in present-day Iran is absolutely unacceptable."
"On many occasions we have already talked in this Chamber of the need to apply radical measures in order to prevent various types of breaches of human rights in Iran."
"What is particularly horrifying is the way that the death penalty is carried out."
"Carrying out the death penalty by stoning is uncivilised, inhumane, and completely unacceptable to any democracy."
"Carrying out the death penalty on minors, which is prohibited in the whole of the democratic and civilised world, continues in Iran, despite the promises of the Iranian government and parliament."
"Further acts of hatred are aimed at any opposition - both the very small internal opposition from individual citizens, and the much larger and more organised opposition both within the country and from beyond its borders."
"Arrests of journalists, lack of freedom of speech, bans on printing or even speaking under threat of imprisonment or even death, this is a situation that we cannot in any way accept."
"Today, any appeals seem almost to be too late."
"We should think about more specific restrictions that would force the Iranian government to change its behaviour."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, we in the Commission welcome this new joint motion for a resolution by the European Parliament."
"I can tell you that we have all repeatedly expressed our great concerns about the human rights situation in Iran - I, myself, very recently during the UN General Assembly, on the margins of which I met the Iranian Foreign Minister, where, again, I very strongly emphasised all the facts that are there."
"I must say that the respect for basic human rights in Iran has continued to deteriorate seriously over the past year and, for this reason, we will also support the new UN General Assembly resolution on the human rights situation in Iran, as we do each year, which Canada is likely to table."
"There is a continuous clampdown on freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and political dissent."
"There have been new cases of torture and executions of people who were minors at the time of the alleged crime."
"There has also been an increasing number of public executions, as Mr Romeva i Rueda said, including in one case through stoning, despite assurances by the Iranian side that stoning was forbidden under existing decrees."
"I also very specifically mentioned this case when I met the Iranian Foreign Minister."
"Iran has carried out at least 250 executions so far this year - the second highest number of executions worldwide."
"We also note, of course, the continuous discrimination against minorities, increasing harassment and the closure of independent non-governmental organisations."
"The documented intimidation and persecution of human rights defenders from all sectors of Iranian society has grown, as has the repression of intellectuals, teachers, students, women activists and trade unions."
"Only recently, one of Iran's best-known human rights defenders, Mr Emaddedin Baghi, was once again imprisoned under the charge of propaganda against the Government."
"And, since July, Mr Mansour Osanlou, President of the Iranian Bus Drivers' Union and the embodiment of an independent trade union movement in Iran, has been under arrest."
"Mr Osanlou is in need of urgent medical treatment, which, we have reason to believe, he has still not received."
"But we are not remaining silent about such developments."
"We have taken numerous steps and repeatedly issued public statements denouncing the ongoing violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran, as well as the country's persistent failure to uphold international standards on the administration of justice."
"Once more, I call upon the Iranian Government to fully respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in line with Iran's obligations under international law and the conventions it has ratified."
"I would also like to reiterate our concern about Iran's refusal to resume the bilateral dialogue on human rights it suspended in 2004, which the European Union continues to ask for."
"For our part, we remain ready to do so, as we believe in the importance of such a dialogue and engagement."
"In conclusion, the Commission is, speaking quite unequivocally, in full agreement with Parliament, whatever the developments on the nuclear issue or on other issues of concern to the European Union."
"And we have this double-track approach, which, at this moment, Javier Solana and his new counterpart are working on, and, at the same time, we are also working in the United Nations Security Council with regard to maybe a further strengthening of sanctions."
"At this moment, there can be no real progress in the relationship with Iran without a serious improvement in the human rights situation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly, during voting time."
"2."
"Pakistan"
"The next item is four motions for resolutions on Pakistan."
"author. - Mr President, let me start by expressing my sympathy to the victims of the horrific bomb attack in Karachi."
"Our thoughts go out to all of those who were affected by that dramatic action."
"Pakistan is a nation which we in Europe should care deeply about."
"It is a great trading nation, it is an exporter of people, not least to this continent, and it is a vital ally in the fight against terrorism."
"It is a matter, therefore, of great sadness that, in its 60-year history, Pakistan has failed to become a true democracy; but, on the other hand, we should be encouraged by the fact that it has not become a theocracy or even a permanent military dictatorship."
"Once again in Pakistan, the window is opening for democracy."
"We await the outcome of the court ruling on the legality of the President's election."
"We call on President Musharraf to accept the outcome if it goes against him, but I also call on people in Pakistan and throughout the world to accept the ruling of the Court if it rules in favour of the President."
"I think it is the only basis on which we can move forward in the country."
"In relation to the election in January, I hope that the Government will pursue and continue to prepare for that election, and will make it possible for Ms Benazir Bhutto to campaign in a secure fashion."
"In saying that, I know we imply that the Government was behind the bombing;"
"I do not believe that, but we need to make sure that the security of all the candidates is guaranteed and the Government does its best to protect Ms Benazir Bhutto."
"I also believe that Mr Sharif should be allowed to return to the country and campaign if he so wishes, and again have his security guaranteed."
"The military should stand back during the whole period of the election campaign, and I hope, before January - and, indeed, before campaigning begins - that the President will get himself out of uniform and turn his country into a true civilian government."
"That is the best hope for the future of Pakistan, and it is the best hope for relations between Europe and Pakistan: that we get a democratically elected parliament in January, with the President out of uniform, in 'civvies'."
"author. - (SV) Thank you Mr President."
"First of all, I must say with a heavy heart that month after month here in Parliament we have to decide on different resolutions because such large parts of the world around us fail to respect civil liberties and rights and violate fundamental human rights."
"I must say this because I think it is so terrible that it just goes on and on."
"We talk about it here in Parliament, we talk about it in so many different contexts, and still it goes on."
"As regards Pakistan, which is the subject of the resolution we are now discussing, I want to say that the GUE/NGL Group supports the resolution in its entirety."
"The resolution makes a large number of very justified demands on the government in Pakistan."
"We in the world around it cannot keep silent about the influence and decision-making power of the military regime in all areas of society."
"Power must be transferred to a civilian democratic government."
"We must support all voluntary organisations, everyone working for democratic liberties and rights."
"I particularly want to stress the importance of paragraph 16 of the resolution."
"In that point Parliament expresses its great concern at the fact that a large proportion of Pakistani women are not able to participate in the democratic process."
"People are being oppressed in Pakistan by the military regime on the grounds of religion, but we must not forget the oppression to which a large proportion of Pakistani women are exposed."
"Our Group wishes strongly to support the entire resolution. Thank you."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, I also wish to say that despite the fact that logically the main responsibility for resolving the situation lies with the Pakistani authorities, that should not allow us forget that the European Union has, and we member countries above all, we Member States, have an enormous responsibility at least not to aggravate the situation."
"It is related to the practice, which is also incomprehensible because of its incompatibility with the will to resolve the situation, of continuing to export or seeking to export arms to Pakistan."
"To give but three examples: in 2006 the Government of the United Kingdom authorised the export of 15 000 rifles to the region, including Pakistan;"
"France continues to seek to sell Pakistan missiles and radars to build a combat aircraft which Pakistan is allegedly developing with China; and Germany has also been responsible for exporting significant quantities of munitions, arms and other types of military equipment."
"I believe that to that end the desire to resolve the situation in Pakistan is incompatible with supplying it under those policies."
"I therefore suggest and ask my colleagues to support the amendment seeking the suspension of all types of exports of arms and military equipment until such time as it can be guaranteed that they will not be used to violate human rights."
"author. - Mr President, last week's suicide bomb blast in Karachi reminded us of just how perilously close Pakistan has come to anarchy."
"The prospect of a nuclear-armed Pakistan becoming a rogue state controlled by Islamist fanatics is, quite frankly, terrifying."
"I am not especially a fan of Benazir Bhutto, whose period in office as Prime Minister was marked by widespread corruption, but, ultimately, a democratic and secular-leaning government under civilian control is always preferable to a military dictatorship, compromised in this case by its links to Islamist parties and the Afghan Taliban."
"President Musharraf is supposed to be our ally in the war on terror; sometimes I wonder how committed he is to rooting out terrorism in his own country."
"Hopefully, Ms Bhutto's return to Pakistan may be a fillip for human rights now."
"One major concern is the ongoing repression of religious minorities, including Christians, Hindus and Ahmadi Muslims."
"If she is to be taken seriously as a progressive leader of a more modern Pakistan, she must make sure that Pakistan respects its international obligations under human rights conventions."
"But, while Pakistan faces many challenges, we should recognise that some progress is being made in some areas."
"The economy continues to grow, and Pakistan has also engaged in confidence-building measures with India with regard to the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir."
"One question which remains totally unanswered is how, legally, the Pakistani Government, in spite of a Supreme Court judgment permitting former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to return from exile to Pakistan, deported him immediately to Saudi Arabia."
"How, in international law, can a government deport one of its own citizens?"
"Nawaz Sharif may yet have a vital role to play in re-establishing multiparty civilian democratic politics in Pakistan."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we must take a very discerning view of Pakistan."
"It is a large and important country with a troubled history."
"The State of Pakistan was artificially created as a home for the Muslim inhabitants of India, and it therefore has an Islamic identity, which is something we cannot now hold against it."
"That was more or less its original raison d'être."
"This does not mean that we should not battle against Islamic extremism, and indeed the Pakistanis themselves are devoting considerable efforts to that very struggle."
"Pakistan was an important ally in the face of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, in dealings with Communist China, and in the context of long-running Soviet attempts to gain influence in India."
"It was an important strategic factor for the West."
"On the other hand, it goes without saying that Pakistan has internal difficulties, of which we must be aware: a complex and heterogeneous population structure in ethnic and religious terms, widespread poverty and, of course, the need to strengthen democracy and the rule of law."
"We must clearly lend the country a very great deal of support in establishing free elections and a stronger independent judiciary, and must encourage the military command to hand over power gradually to elected politicians. Above all, as Charles Tannock said, we must encourage Pakistan to keep pursuing the confidence-building process with neighbouring India."
"In this respect there have been encouraging signs, and the purpose of a balanced policy on Pakistan is to reinforce those signs while expressing any necessary criticism."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Pakistani people do not deserve military dictatorship, violence and lawlessness."
"Therefore, one of key articles in this resolution is the one which reaffirms our solidarity with the people of Pakistan, who share the objectives of democratic governance and transparent, accountable rule, and who act with courage and determination in the face of terrorist and criminal violence."
"That is, of course, why we put the stress on the need for a return to democracy and civilian government with free and fair elections in January as being the only way to answer the challenges of Pakistani society."
"At the same time, we also stress the need to remove the militarisation of Pakistani society and deplore the failure of President Musharraf to stand down as army chief, as he promised he would."
"The rule of law is extremely uneven in Pakistan."
"There have been some encouraging developments at times, but these are also accompanied by some very repressive judgments."
"This falls particularly hard on minorities, religious and otherwise, as well as on women."
"We rightly call for improvement in that area."
"This as well, of course, as deploring the suicide bombing and the 140 victims and 500 injured last week. I fear that these could become a pretext for restricting political activity, because already there has been an announcement by the Government that political parties will only be allowed to hold meetings in well-secured parks and public grounds rather than organise processions."
"One could see how that might be made a pretext."
"Finally, one of the more close-to-home reasons for my wanting Pakistan to fight both extremism and militarisation, and to return to the rule of law, is the impact on British people of Pakistani origin, with the calls, for instance, for profiling or for visa requirements for the United States."
"It would remove that threat to people like my constituents if Pakistan were to be a democratic society."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, today on the television yet another bulletin about yet another attack in Pakistan, about fatalities."
"This, too, is a never-ending story."
"Why do we spend time on this, especially as we are acting on behalf of European taxpayers?"
"We should remember that the European Union sends significant amounts of money to Pakistan for health care, for the eradication of poverty and for education."
"For this reason we have a right to be interested in what is happening in that country, which is, in part, supported by money from our electors."
"I would like to draw your attention to issues that have not been discussed here."
"First of all to the fact that religious minorities are persecuted and discriminated against in Pakistan. This applies to Christians, but also to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists."
"I believe that it is worth focusing on this issue. It is something that disappears from view in the light of these attacks and tragic deaths, but it is a constant feature."
"I would also like to point out, and this issue has already been raised, that there is discrimination against women."
"There are special hudud decrees for this purpose."
"This too should be condemned and I am pleased that we are doing so quite independently of our political divisions."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, we have, of course, all expressed our horror at the shocking attacks in Pakistan last week, which, as the previous speaker said, are a never-ending story."
"That should not, however, prevent us from pointing out the essential fact that Pakistan is of course a military dictatorship, that in the official Pakistan there are large-scale violations of human rights and the leader is still above the law."
"Pakistan is also, however, a strict Islamic state in which there is no place for people of other faiths or religious minorities and, as has been said, the country has nuclear weapons."
"Perhaps - but perhaps this cannot be said - Islamabad is in fact a greater threat than Teheran."
"I do not know."
"I also have a slight feeling of déjà vu with Pakistan, because just as in other Islamic countries, for instance Algeria at the time, military dictatorships or regimes where the army plays a dominant role prevent Islamic fundamentalists from taking power."
"Unfortunately, more democracy often means more Islamic fundamentalism and, paradoxically, less democracy."
"This is a dilemma that we cannot solve just like that."
"Mr President, the murderous attack on unsuspecting supporters welcoming back Ms Benazir Bhutto in Karachi on 18 October has been another callous terrorist act against the prospects of bringing about democratic change in Pakistan."
"The international community watched in horror as more innocent civilians were sacrificed in a nation where the dictatorial regime of General Musharraf is dragging the country into a state of fear and breakdown of law and order."
"This brutal individual, with his corrupt governing group of associates, is a cancerous infliction on the people of Pakistan."
"Regrettably, he is still in power, largely because he is supported by the West, especially the USA, but certainly also by one or two EU Member States."
"The time has now come when the West must immediately pull the carpet from under Mr Musharraf's feet and provide support, not for him, but for the democratic reform forces in Pakistan."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as Pakistan prepares for important parliamentary elections, the situation is, as we all know, very difficult and preoccupying, and I, also, like many of you, have to express that I was deeply shocked by the heinous bomb attack and assassination attempt in Karachi, when Ms Benazir Bhutto returned to the country last week, and also by the terrible loss of life, which has affected so many innocent people."
"We would like to extend our full sympathy to the families of the victims, and we also appeal to the Pakistani authorities to bring those responsible to justice."
"This attack on a peaceful gathering has clearly demonstrated, once again, all the dangers of terrorism and fundamentalism to the people of Pakistan."
"Ms Bhutto was right in describing this horrible event as a blow against democracy, particularly in the present electoral context of the country."
"Parliament's wish to express solidarity with the people of Pakistan is both very relevant and timely."
"We in Europe should encourage a more open, democratic society and, of course, a strong civil society in Pakistan."
"It is also of fundamental importance that the elections should then provide maximum democratic legitimacy to the incoming assemblies, and the vote must be democratic, transparent and giving equal opportunities to all the political contestants."
"As you are well aware, it is one of those countries where we might envisage a possible election observation mission."
"In this context, my services carried out an exploratory mission in June, and they identified, I have to say, important shortcomings in the framework and the conditions for elections, including concerns about the independence of the Election Commission, the completeness and the accuracy of the voter register, restrictive candidature provisions, as well as lack of transparency in the results process."
"However, with urgent political will, there is still time to improve a number of these problematic areas and, therefore, I have not yet taken a full decision on whether we will deploy a fully-fledged election observation mission."
"I really have to see the aforementioned elements."
"I believe that the majority of people in Pakistan would like to see a moderate, stable and democratic Pakistan, and we should support them in achieving this aim."
"We are doing a lot, for instance, on the trade side, in order to help people to get out of poverty, but we also do a lot on the education side, in order not to have pupils and young children being educated in the madrasahs and being educated towards extremism and fundamentalism."
"But we should also support this because it is of crucial importance, as has been said, for the whole region, including neighbouring countries like important Afghanistan."
"Therefore, we have every reason to stay engaged."
"This is what we are trying to do and, therefore, this debate is a very timely one."
"The debate is closed."
"We will vote on this subject shortly, after the debates."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, I would like first to thank everyone for their support in making Pakistan the subject of a written resolution."
"A show of popularity for democratic forces and a clear emphasis on human rights, and not an army, are the biggest barriers to the rise to power of radical groups."
"That is why these are things which now require our support, as do religious minorities."
"Experience of human rights work shows that freedom of religion is an important indicator of the situation with respect to human rights; it is a kind of litmus test."
"The problems are visible first in the status of religious groups and as flaws in the system of freedom of speech and right of assembly."
"There is a correlation between the state of play of democracy and the status of minorities: wherever the opportunities the people have to participate are poor, minorities also suffer."
"We might say that Pakistan's particular problem is the misuse of the law on blasphemy with regard to religious minorities."
"There should be a system of the protection of religious values, not active persecution of people of other faiths."
"Although the law is not targeted at any particular religious groups in terms of its content, the everyday reality is otherwise."
"Death sentences are handed down mainly in respect of minorities."
"Legal reform is crucial."
"Only democracy will make this possible."
"The unfortunate decision by Musharraf to keep his position as army chief has had an impact on Pakistan's social development these last few years, and has weakened it."
"The gradual militarisation of society has been regrettable."
"On the other hand, we express our support for Pakistan in its fight against Talibanisation."
"We feel solidarity with those Pakistanis who are affected by last week's devastating bomb attack."
"Last month I had the chance to familiarise myself personally with the political situation in Pakistan."
"I had the honour of meeting representatives of different political parties, senators and members of parliament."
"I especially want to mention, however, the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, whose important work as the representative of many minority groups deserves the attention and support of the outside world."
"3."
"Sudan: Killing of African Union peace-keeping soldiers"
"The next item is six motions for resolutions on Sudan and particularly the killing of African Union peacekeeping soldiers."
"author. - Mr President, this House has repeatedly been dealing with the dire situation in Darfur, the last resolution having been adopted only in mid-September this year."
"The news that, at the end of September, a murderous attack took place against an African Union base in south Darfur, resulting in the death of 10 peacekeepers, the serious injury of eight other personnel, and the apparent taking hostage of approximately 40 people more, has come as a grim reminder that, despite our efforts, much remains to be done in order to secure peace and stability in this sad corner of the world."
"We should, of course, recollect that at least 200 000 people have died in Darfur during the four-year conflict, and more than two million people have been forced from their homes."
"The September attack on African Union peacekeepers must force the EU and the UN to make sure that peacekeepers in Darfur are adequate in numbers and training, that they are properly and fully equipped and that they are given adequate logistical and other necessary support in order to fulfil their task safely and effectively."
"Merely sending poorly trained and ill-equipped AU civilians into highly hazardous situations does not, as has been demonstrated in this case, serve any useful purpose other than to reduce the cost in terms of money but increase the cost in terms of human lives."
"An urgent rethink and replanning by the international community is essential."
"Last but not least, we must not forget those 40 people still missing and thought to have been taken hostage."
"Every effort must be made to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their loved ones."
"author. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, after losing ten men in the raid at Haskanita, the head of the African Union mission in Darfur, General Martin Luther Agwai, sounded an alarm call, highlighting the fact that his forces were ill-equipped and too few in number, and that they could be defeated in a very short time."
"There has, as yet, been no change in the situation, and further attacks like that of 29 September remain possible."
"The General's alarm call must be heeded by the international community and particularly by the European Union, which could surely issue a powerful appeal for effective joint action by all the Member States involved in providing the promised EU support."
"In two days' time, important talks are to take place in Libya between the Sudanese Government and various rebel forces."
"It is still unclear whether Abdel el-Nur - the founder of the Sudan Liberation Army, now exiled in France - will take part in these talks."
"Indeed, there is just as much uncertainty about other figures representing the array of rebel forces, for their numbers change from one day to the next."
"Be that as it may, we have to prioritise these discussions, which have the potential to produce a ceasefire."
"So once again we would ask the European Union authorities to spread the word as widely as possible about the importance of the meeting and about Europe's intention to support any positive developments that may come out of it, both militarily and in relation to improving conditions for aid workers, who are operating in a particularly difficult situation."
"I would also remind you that the Government in Khartoum, through its actions thus far, bears a huge share of responsibility for today's tragic situation - and not only because it has supported the Janjaweed militias bringing death and terror to black African communities."
"It was also the Government that categorically refused, for months, to accept the presence of a Western force in Sudan."
"It was also the Government that made it impossible for journalists and foreign observers to gain access to the most troubled regions, even though their work there could make a major contribution to the ongoing mobilisation of international public opinion."
"That mobilisation is clearly needed if we are to ensure that all of us in Europe shoulder our responsibilities in combating what must be recognised as nothing short of genocide."
"Another important point is that the new European force, due to deploy in eastern Chad and the north of the Central African Republic, will make it harder for the rebels to move freely across the borders with those countries and to pursue their policy of recruiting fighters, willing or otherwise, from refugees' and displaced persons' camps."
"Anticipating this obstacle to their activities, some armed groups are already turning their attention to the other side of Darfur, to the neighbouring region of Kordofan, to which Haskanita is a gateway."
"Here too, the support the European Union has undertaken to provide may prove very useful, although within a short time it may also prove quite inadequate."
"It is thus part of our task to continue doggedly doing what we can to bring about political conditions in which European intervention will be effective."
"Surely we have seen enough violence and heartbreak in this region of the world?"
"Not only have hundreds of thousands of lives already been lost, but the social fabric of Darfur is also being utterly devastated, so the task of reconstruction becomes more problematic from day to day."
"I do realise that we have a little more time this afternoon, but let us not get entirely carried away, please!"
"author. - (DE) Madam President, the attack to which this resolution relates was targeted against a diplomatic solution to the situation in Sudan."
"The context is quite important, because the attack occurred shortly before Desmond Tutu was due to conduct meaningful talks in Darfur."
"It seems obvious that the attack was deliberately timed to thwart the quest for a diplomatic solution, which is so desperately needed in that region."
"There followed lengthy speculation, of course, as to the identity of the rebel group that had carried out the attack, which claimed the lives of ten soldiers from the AU peacekeeping force."
"The signs seem to indicate that the most likely perpetrators were a pro-Western rebel group."
"When we deal with the Darfur issue, it is important not to focus too narrowly, but to remember that the most widely diverse rebel groups from the Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic are operating there in addition to the local armed forces on both sides."
"I find it very revealing that the attempt made by the European Union to act on the Darfur conflict through the Chad mission is effectively in a sorry state at the present time."
"At the start, the talk was about sending an EU force there."
"In fact, a French force with a few additional troops has been sent there under the EU banner."
"I have not yet been able to obtain any proper information about that force's actual area of operation."
"Although we are still being told that the force is essentially there to protect refugees, most of the refugees are to be found in the border area, which is precisely where the Government of Chad does not want the EU force deployed."
"Perhaps the Commissioner can assist again with some information."
"What the EU is doing at the moment is definitely not what is needed to defuse the present situation We have to say very clearly that the very thing Desmond Tutu wanted, namely a diplomatic solution, is what we ought to be supporting here."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, following its independence in 1956, Sudan, which is the largest country in Africa in terms of surface area, was supposed to be a home for everyone, for the Arab north and the Black south, for Muslims, Christians and animists."
"However, the civil war that has continued for almost 50 years has claimed at least two million victims in that country."
"Over 4.5 million people have been forced to leave their homes."
"In Darfur, where the conflict broke out at the beginning of 2003, about 200 000 have died and nearly two million have been driven from their homes."
"This is the result of terrible battles, purges and terror."
"This is currently the most tragic humanitarian crisis in the world, and it is further aggravated by hunger and the lack of water."
"One should therefore be grateful to all those who undertake peace initiatives in this tortured land."
"We should address such thanks to the African Union, which sent a 7 000-strong peace mission there."
"The most recent attack on this mission, which took place in Haskanita, aroused strong objections."
"At least ten dead and about 50 lost or kidnapped."
"This is a clear breach of existing agreements as well as of United Nations resolutions."
"I would like to express my sympathy to the families of these persons."
"We should, acting as the European Union, demand that those responsible be punished and that the peace process be reinstated."
"The planned forces of the UN mission together with the African Union will number about twenty thousand more soldiers."
"However, they must have some possibility to neutralise the armed conflict and help bring stability to this explosive corner of Africa."
"I hope that the European Parliament's decision to award the Sakharov prize to the Sudanese lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman will be helpful in making a breakthrough in the Sudanese drama."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, I naturally wish to add my voice to the vigorous condemnation of the killing of the members of the peace-keeping forces."
"At the same time, however, I also wish to remember all the civilians who were victims, and who are victims in the situation in Darfur, with particular reference to the brutality with which certain assaults with clear sexual overtones are being carried out and serious violations are taking place in terms of the way women are used on a variety of fronts, including sexually."
"I believe that all of this requires not only actions and declarations but a solid investigation which should be carried out not only by the people on the ground but also by the International Criminal Court."
"That, for me, is one of the fundamental aspects of this debate."
"Secondly, I also wish to note that we should welcome the fact that there is currently permission - to give it some kind of name, from the Government of Sudan to accept UNAMID troops but at the same time we should also note that on other occasions they have broken this commitment, broken this promise and therefore we should maintain a degree of caution."
"I believe, naturally, that it is necessary to continue to insist, while at the same time, as Mr Pflüger said, ensuring that the forces which go, go with a broad United Nations mandate, and not only to back the interests of one country in particular."
"Thirdly, I believe it is also essential and necessary to recall that all aid must be made available, whether political, financial or technical as may be required to perform the duties that that mission will have to face on the ground."
"It is not possible to send a mission into the field without its having guarantees that it will be able to fulfil its mandate."
"Finally, and again very significantly, I would like to note, and here I undoubtedly go beyond the words of the Resolution, which urges the government of Sudan to follow the demands of the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, to arrest Ahmed Haroun, Sudan's Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, specifically so that he can be held accountable for the displacement of two million people in Darfur, thereby instigating an international trial which should have begun some time ago."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the facts are known: there was an attack on the AU peacekeeping force on 30 September; ten soldiers lost their lives, eight were seriously injured, and forty are still missing."
"I was in Darfur with a delegation from our Parliament in July."
"During our visit we met representatives of AMIS, the African Union Mission in Sudan."
"It was, and still is, an incredibly difficult mission, as we heard from some of these AMIS representatives."
"For example, one of the commanders, a Nigerian general, told us that he felt as though he were a priest rather than a soldier."
"All he could do, he said, was appeal to people to refrain from evil acts; he had no real mandate to act, and so it is hardly surprising that rebel factions have exploited this weakness."
"The West is not focusing sharply enough on Africa."
"There is an imbalance between the extent of the tragedy in Darfur and the level of attention we devote to it."
"Military operations in Africa are all very well, but there is a danger of Africa becoming a testing ground for that type of mission."
"When the EU conducts operations there, its forces must be armed with a robust mandate, appropriate equipment and sufficient manpower."
"The duration of the mission must also depend on its objectives."
"We must not hide behind others, but must fulfil our own obligations."
"This applies to the funding of AMIS and to support ranging from logistics and military equipment to personnel."
"Above all, however, we need the political will of everyone, and it is my opinion that peace in Darfur and the whole of Sudan can be achieved only in cooperation with China."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I will read from the press: 'Just after the evening meal to break the Ramadan fast on 29 September, around 30 vehicles loaded with several hundred Sudanese rebels ripped through the perimeter of an African Union peacekeepers' base on the edge of Haskanita, a small town in southern Darfur, the embattled province in western Sudan where at least 200 000 people and perhaps as many as 300 000 have been killed since the rebellion began in 2003.'"
"The units of about 100 troops, most of them Nigerian, fought off the first attack before falling back to trenches, firing through the night until their ammunition ran out."
"Then, ten were killed."
"At least 40 fled into the bush."
"The attackers looted the compound before Sudanese troops rescued the survivors."
"A week later, Haskanita itself was razed."
"When the UN inspected the damage, only the school and the mosque were still standing."
"About 7 000 people are thought to have fled."
"Then, on 8 October, fighting erupted in the town of Muhajiriya, controlled by a Darfuri rebel faction."
"Scores were killed."
"No one is sure who the attackers were."
"Even the Government of Omar El Bashir came under suspicion."
"But it could be the rebels."
"What we know is that these things will continue to go on until there are international forces with an effective mandate and with effective means there."
"Everybody knows that, and it is time to stop this game of hide-and-seek with the Government of Khartoum."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the appalling attack by rebel forces in Haskanita against the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) was followed by a series of other revenge attacks by Government forces against all villages supposed to shelter rebels with tremendous civilian casualties."
"We must realise that this suits the genocidal strategy of the Bashir clique in Khartoum to divide and destroy the Darfur communities and the rebel groups in order to make peace negotiations, such as the ones that are supposed to start this weekend in Libya, go nowhere."
"That appalling attack and the violence which followed also demonstrate the fundamental limitations of an all-African force in Darfur such as AMIS."
"It is, therefore, crucial that the African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID), which is to be deployed by early January, will actually be duly equipped in full force and capacity to operate by then."
"In this context, it is very disturbing that the Chairman of the African Union Commission, Mr Konaré, has been insisting on an all-African force, even rejecting the integration of units offered by Uruguay, Thailand and Norway into UNAMID, in contradiction with the UN Security Council decision and, in this way, echoing the manoeuvres of the clique in Khartoum."
"It is also disturbing that the European Union, the US and other rich countries have been failing to provide the speedy and full support that they should give to the deployment of that mission, namely by not providing it with a financial airlift and other logistical and military capacities that it needs to operate."
"Even the Chad mission is very much delayed, and that was supposed to be 'urgent'."
"Finally, Mr Bashir is going to be given a red carpet welcome in Lisbon: it is not only Mr Mugabe."
"I hope that the European Union authorities, the Commission and the Presidency and the Member States will not fail to take that opportunity to actually confront him with this tremendous responsibility that, one day, will bring him to The Hague."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) First of all, our thoughts go out to the sons, brothers and loved ones who are now missing following the brutal attack on the AMIS force."
"These people died trying to help their fellow humans in a neighbouring country."
"Many have been affected by violence, rape, murder and extreme poverty here."
"How many times have we stood here and talked about it?"
"How many times have we demanded that the government or others take action?"
"Let me remind you that the central task of any government is to protect the human rights of its civilian population."
"This government has never attempted or tried to do this in its entire career."
"However, we must still be patient in our frustration, as it is only through long-term economic and political support for those who are endeavouring to resolve the conflict that we can do it."
"We must not altogether ignore our own economic interests."
"Sometimes it is our own oil companies that are actually supporting certain groups, indirectly or directly."
"We must address this too."
"A heavy responsibility rests with the government, and we must make further demands."
"I agree completely with my colleague Raül Romeva that the International Criminal Court must be given full access rights and a full right to investigate, so that the people in this stricken country can see justice in due course. Thank you."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, as Irish soldiers leave for Chad to protect refugees from neighbouring Sudan, I am again painfully reminded that this tragedy of genocide in Sudan continues day in and day out, without any end in sight."
"I congratulate this motion for deploring violence, for its support of the UN and AU missions to Sudan."
"'We must show a united front', the motion suggests; and, whilst I applaud the notion, I fail to see how this can come to pass. You see, the UN itself is implicitly divided on the issue."
"Efforts can only go so far while China, a deciding member, continues to sustain and prolong the conflict by supplying the region with arms."
"Once again, we must point the finger at China as the main supporter of the Government in Khartoum."
"China exchanges Chinese weapons for Sudanese oil, and it is not rocket science to see that this is one of the most important ways in which the ongoing conflict is being sustained."
"We should not accept that the Chinese policy of exporting arms remain shrouded in secrecy."
"Beijing does not publish any information about arms transfers abroad and has not submitted any data to the UN Register on Conventional Arms in the last eight years."
"With Chinese arms exports - some of them in the attack that was described a minute ago - estimated to be in excess of USD 2 billion a year, the irresponsibility with which they act has to be called into question."
"If this issue remains unaddressed, it is not just Sudan that will suffer."
"Weapons from China can be found as far as Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, South Africa; regular shipments are sent to Burma and Nepal."
"So, finally, I implore Parliament to act to condemn China for its role in underwriting the genocide of the Sudanese people."
"For it is all very well to support peace and the role of the UN, but we must do this actively - if not, we risk contributing to the suffering of the Sudanese people."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, of course the death of ten soldiers in the African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur is yet another tragic event."
"For years this Parliament has been expressing concern about the region."
"I do regret, though, that once more we have missed an opportunity to raise the matter of the responsibility and disastrous role of China in this conflict, because it has to be said again that, in seeking influence in Africa, China is playing a pernicious role in war-ravaged Sudan."
"It is doing so on the backs of the victims killed in Darfur, and now indirectly too, with the blood of soldiers who are helping to stabilise the situation."
"With their dubious investments, the Chinese have made an enormous contribution to the war efforts of the regime there."
"Europe just has to realise that the stronger the Chinese become in Africa, the less powerful is our Western message of democracy, freedom and good governance."
"However, China is too important a trading partner for Europe, and talk of human rights and democracy is all too often pushed into the background when Realpolitik comes into the picture."
"Madam President, I strongly deplore the killing of 10 African Union peacekeepers on 30 September 2007 by unidentified forces in Haskanita in south Darfur."
"At least eight other personnel from the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) were also seriously injured and another 40 remain missing."
"I urge the Sudanese Government to cooperate fully with an independent investigation into the attack and to bring all those responsible to justice."
"These deaths are a reminder of the gravity of the security situation in this region."
"Unfortunately, there is no peace to keep at the moment but, nevertheless, the international community, including the UN and the European Union, have a responsibility to try to help secure this region as soon as possible so that peace can be realised in the future."
"The European Union mission to the Chad, Central African Republic and Darfur border must also be mindful of the danger of incurring casualties."
"No one said this was going to be an easy undertaking."
"It is crucial that EU Member States mobilise political, financial, logistical and technical support for the Irish, French, Belgian, Polish and other troops forming part of this mission."
"We cannot have our troops ill-equipped, like the beleaguered AMIS."
"If we are putting our troops in a volatile environment, we must give them the means to protect themselves."
"This EU mission will have a robust use-of-force mandate, with reference to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and troops should be encouraged to invoke it."
"Peacekeeping is one of the noblest professions and it is tragic when a peacekeeper loses his or her life whilst protecting the lives of others."
"That is why we need to maintain pressure on the various parties involved ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) The conflict that has been ongoing in Darfur since 2003 is acknowledged as the greatest humanitarian catastrophe of our time."
"Two hundred thousand people have lost their lives as a result of ethnic cleansing and pogroms, and a further two and a half million have been displaced."
"Millions of refugees live in fear of what the next day will bring, and they have a force of just seven thousand poorly equipped soldiers from the African Union's peace force, which, increasingly, is becoming the focus of bloody attacks, such as the attack in Haskanita in September of last year."
"The situation in this region is dramatically worsening, and representatives of humanitarian peace organisations are falling victim to kidnappings."
"In this situation it is important to act as quickly as possible to put into motion the joint UN and African Union mission, which, now that it has the agreement of the Sudanese government, must also have a strong mandate allowing it to provide full protection to the civilian population."
"The mission must have the appropriate number of soldiers and the appropriate quantity of equipment and funds."
"The European Union, the UN and the African Union must make joint efforts to renew the peace process in Darfur and to help to find a just and lasting agreement that is signed by all interested parties."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, we as the European Commission join with the European Parliament in strongly condemning the killing of the African Union peacekeepers in Haskanita, and in other incidents over the past year, and, of course, the fact that many others are still missing."
"We should not pretend that even the larger peacekeeping force due to take over from the current African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) will be able to protect itself easily to ensure the vast humanitarian operation supported by the European Commission and so many other donors and to keep the peace if there is no peace to keep."
"This is the question."
"We acknowledge the acceptance by the Government of Sudan of the presence of the UN peacekeeping force on Sudanese soil."
"Along with the rest of the international community, we intend to keep the Government to its word."
"We welcome the intention of the Government to declare a cessation of hostilities when negotiations commence in Libya on 27 October, yet the Government needs to go further."
"The European Commission also calls upon the Government of Sudan to engage meaningfully in negotiations intended to result in the equitable sharing of power and of wealth in Darfur."
"We join with the rest of the European Union in calling upon the rebel movements themselves to declare an end to the killings and banditry that sully their cause."
"We also call upon them to participate wholeheartedly in the talks in Sirte."
"On top of that, as you know, UN Security Council Resolution 1778, adopted on 25 September, mandates an international multidimensional force to contribute to the stabilisation of eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic and thus also guarantee the security of the local civilian population, refugees and displaced people and stabilise the situation in Sudan."
"On this basis, the General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council on 15 October decided to send an interim and multidimensional European force of 3 000 troops, EUFOR Chad, as we call it, to support and complement in the short term the deployment of the UN contingent."
"Taking into account the regional dimension of the Darfur crisis, the deployment of this new EUFOR Chad mission and of a UN police mission in parallel with UNAMID in Sudan is, I think, a crucial step towards facilitating a durable solution of the conflict in Darfur and, ultimately, also towards the voluntary return of the Sudanese refugees who have settled in Chad."
"I can tell you that, at this very moment, an Irish General is there exploring the situation and exploring where exactly EUFOR should be deployed."
"But coming back to the question of Sudan itself, let me say that we firmly believe that the future of Sudan lies in the sharing of wealth and power, in a federal government and a federal arrangement."
"This is what the Government and the rebels agreed in Naivasha in January 2005, when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, ending decades of civil war between the north and the south."
"The international community must stand firm behind this Comprehensive Peace Agreement."
"For if this agreement can be made to hold - yes, it is at present in difficulty, but these difficulties need not be terminal - this will demonstrate powerfully that similar arrangements can surely be extended to Darfur."
"So through the support extended also under the European Development Fund for the recovery and rehabilitation of southern Sudan and for the long-term equitable and sustainable development of the whole of the country, we are standing firmly behind the Comprehensive Peace Agreement."
"We also back the efforts of the EU Special Representative to Sudan to facilitate peace in Darfur and, along with other donors, we stand ready to ensure that the peace dividend, in the shape of the rehabilitation and recovery of Darfur, follows closely on the heels of a renewed peace agreement."
"We think it is in the interest of all the parties - the Government, the Darfur rebels, the countries of the Horn of Africa region and the international community - that Sudan stays together."
"However long and arduous, and at times discouraging, the Sirte talks might turn out to be, I think we must be steadfast for peace in Sudan."
"The unity of this country remains within our grasp."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debates, during voting time - which is, in fact, the next item."

"Madam President, I ask for your leniency, and that of my colleagues, in submitting a last-minute oral amendment on account of the fact that we have just been informed of the arrest of a prominent human rights defender in Iran."
"The amendment is to add to paragraph 15 the following sentence: 'Condemns the arrest and imprisonment of human rights defender Dr Sohrab Razzaghi on 24 October 2007 and calls for his immediate and unconditional release;'"
"I have already spoken with most of the other political groups, and they are in agreement."

"Statements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it was with deep sadness that we heard of the tragic event in Finland, in which eight people - pupils and teachers - were killed."
"On behalf of the House, I should like to express our deepest sympathy to their families and the Finnish nation."
"The groups have requested me to make a statement regarding the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (Ottawa Convention)."
"The 10th anniversary of the signing of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction is coming up in just a few weeks."
"On 3 and 4 December 1997, 122 states signed this historic treaty in Ottawa."
"Anti-personnel mines make no distinction between civilian and military victims."
"They are directed against people, with the aim of killing or maiming them."
"Effecting their prohibition by means of the Ottawa Convention is a victory for humanity."
"The Convention is also a success for internationally linked civil society."
"In a process that had never been seen before, a coalition of non-governmental organisations, together with committed governments and parliaments outside the usual diplomatic forums, managed to get an international treaty signed."
"The International Campaign to Ban Landmines was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 to acknowledge this achievement."
"The European Parliament supported the campaign to outlaw landmines from the very beginning."
"After the signing of the Convention in Ottawa, the European Parliament campaigned using resolutions, hearings and opinions to ensure that it would be implemented effectively."
"Today it is clear that the international campaign has been extremely successful."
"More than three quarters of all states have ratified the Ottawa Convention."
"The use of anti-personnel mines has decreased drastically, as has the number of countries that produce landmines."
"Despite these successes, there are more than 69 countries that have not yet abolished landmines."
"It has become apparent that this goal cannot be reached everywhere unless additional financial assistance is provided."
"Europe has made an important contribution to implementation of the Ottawa Convention over recent years."
"From 1997 to 2004, the European Union invested more than a billion euros in the battle against landmines."
"The European Commission's anti-mines strategy is numbered among the most successful elements in the development of European external relations."
"This is not only an expression of our humanitarian obligations, but also a worthwhile investment in sustainable development and human safety."
"The Council of the European Union is about to adopt a new joint action on landmines within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"We welcome the intention of working towards universal ratification of the Ottawa Convention and an effective Review Conference in 2009."
"We look forward to close cooperation with the Council and the Commission in implementing this joint action."
"I hope that we shall soon have an opportunity to discuss with the Council and the Commission their respective initiatives on the topic of landmines and how they are coordinating with each other."
"The final goal that we all have in common is a world without landmines; to achieve this, the European Union must have a coherent common policy."

"The final draft of the agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 November pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed to you."
"The following amendments have been requested to this draft agenda:"
"Tuesday:"
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the shipping accidents in the Black Sea be placed on the agenda for Tuesday afternoon, after Mr Leinen's report, with a corresponding extension of the afternoon sitting until 6.30 p.m."
"This would mean that questions to the Commission would not commence until 6.30 p.m. and would thus be half an hour shorter."
"Who would like to justify the motion?"
"If there is nobody to speak for or against this motion, that is the end of the matter."
"(The motion lapsed)"
"Wednesday:"
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance requests that a statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Georgia be included and dealt with in a joint debate with the report by Mr Obiols i Germà and Mr Tannock, and that the afternoon sitting therefore be extended to 6.30 p.m. and questions to the Council shortened by half an hour."
"They also request that the debate on Georgia be concluded with the tabling of motions for resolutions and that voting on the matter be carried out during the November part-session in Brussels."
"Who would like to justify the motion?"
"(DE) Mr President, there is not much for me to justify: it is obvious to all what is happening in Georgia, and it is clear that we should include Georgia when we are discussing neighbourhood policy."
"This should be laid down, so that the Council knows what is what."
"Then we should quietly proceed with preparing a resolution, for I believe it is important that the European Parliament formulate a clear resolution on the events in Georgia."
"This should then be adopted in Brussels."
"That is the correct formal procedure and I hope that all Members will agree to it, so that we can proceed in this way."
"That was the justification."
"Who is speaking in favour of the motion?"
"(DE) Mr President, we wish to support this for a very important reason."
"The Rose Revolution in Georgia brought many positive elements with it, especially after the Shevardnadze regime."
"Now there is a great danger that the undoubted successes will be destroyed if the opposition's criticisms are not addressed."
"An initiative by the European Parliament could help President Saakashvili to get back on the right track; that is, to begin dialogue with the opposition."
"I should also like to ask you, Mr President, to maintain contact with the Speaker of Parliament, who is also very active there, and to try to convince her, too, to follow the path of dialogue."
"That is the point of this debate and also of the resolution, and I therefore support it wholeheartedly."
"(Parliament adopted the motion)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must apologise."
"I asked to speak earlier and, despite the fact that I stood up and signalled several times, I was not given the opportunity to speak."
"I would just like to understand something."
"I intended, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to request a statement from the Council and Commission on the Black Sea disaster."
"Without hearing who was in favour and who was against, I am not sure what was decided."
"As I said, this was my intention, and I signalled this request."
"It was my intention to direct this request to the President: that there should be a statement by the Council and the Commission on the Black Sea disaster."
"I am simply asking for clarification on what Parliament has decided to do."
"Mr Andria, please bear with me."
"I called very clearly for Members who wanted to justify the motion. There was no response."
"Nor were those responsible for managing the procedure in the room at that point."
"I looked around very carefully, and there was no contribution to be heard at all, either to justify or to support the motion, and so the House agreed that it was not necessary for anyone to speak against it if it was not justified."
"Those of us up here agreed, as did the plenary, that this motion thus lapsed and is no longer on the agenda."
"Therefore I ask that we now proceed as has just been decided."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to explain."
"I stood up and signalled, even verbally, but the President indicated that I should stop."
"I stood up several times."
"I would ask you to include this initiative on the agenda and to ensure that the Council and Commission issue a statement."
"In any case, at the start of the session, the President said that there was a request from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"I do not see why we cannot have a debate simply because a request was accidentally missed."
"I asked to speak, no one noticed, I even stood up."
"Nobody here in plenary noticed, and that is why I told you that."
"However, if you feel it is necessary, we shall be happy to vote on it."
"The Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wishes to speak."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"(HU) Last week, for the third time, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences organised the World Science Forum in cooperation with the EU, UNESCO and the International Council for Science."
"Scientists and decision-makers from more than 60 countries participated in the World Science Forum, including four Heads of State, the Director-General of UNESCO and the Commission's Environment [...] (interjection: I am sorry, Mr President, but I cannot carry on like this!)."
"As László Sólyom, President of the Republic of Hungary, recommended the creation of a world environment organisation in his address, the leaders of the United Nations Environment Programme announced the formation of a new international organisation."
"It was recommended at the World Forum that the parliaments of as many countries as possible should establish the institution of a commissioner responsible for future generations."
"The main message of the World Forum is that science and politics must act together to halt climate change and the destruction of the environment."
"According to the participants, a 'scientific Davos' has been created in Budapest, in other words, Budapest is now for science what Davos is for economic issues."
"The next event in the series will be in 2009, when it is intended to host the world's science, education and finance ministers in Budapest, as the main event of the Year of Creativity."
"I would like to ask the Commission and you to support the event and the concept behind it, that is to say, we must defend ourselves and future generations as well as the environment and sustainability."
"Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"Mr President, one of the greatest problems in relation to EU policy is implementation."
"This is particularly true in relation to directives relating to Lisbon and climate change."
"On 4 January 2006 the energy performance of the Buildings Directive should have been implemented in all Member States."
"This would have led to massive energy savings."
"The problem is that only eight countries communicated full transposition on time."
"That means that all of the following countries have failed to implement the laws that they themselves signed up to: France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the UK, Spain, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Greece, Cyprus and Malta."
"The EU will lose credibility and its attempts to reduce carbon emissions will not be taken seriously unless its laws are respected on time."
"I urge you to write to the Member States I have just mentioned, to speed up implementation of this important directive."
"(RO) The safety of Italian citizens on the territory of Italy comes within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Italian Government."
"The Government of Romania cannot intervene in any way."
"The thing that the Government of Romania can do, and it has done it, is to cooperate and provide all necessary information in order to prevent possible crimes committed by Romanian citizens."
"Up to now, the Italian Government has had no strategy to improve the situation of Roma on its territory."
"The best proof is the fact that the Italian Government has made no request to receive European funds for the integration of Roma, although it was obvious that the Roma had started to represent a problem that required an approach for several years."
"The European Union Member States have the right to expel citizens who commit crimes, but no country of the European Union can have the right to expel European citizens who might be criminals, without having committed a blamable act."
"Directive 38 of 2004 clearly explains these situations and the Italian Government Decree exceeds the spirit of the European Directive."
"The European Parliament and the European officials should take a stand regarding Decree 181 of 1 November 2007 and ask the Italian Parliament for the final form of the law to comply with the letter and spirit of the European Directive."
"- (PL) Mr President, recently Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, former President of France and the main architect of the Constitutional Treaty that was rejected in the French and Dutch referendums, stated that the EU Reform Treaty adopted in Lisbon was no more than a revised version of the Constitutional Treaty, from which references to the Constitution had deliberately been removed."
"Let me quote his words: 'above all to head off any threat of referenda by avoiding any form of constitutional vocabulary' - end of quote."
"That is how EU citizens learned that a referendum on the Reform Treaty is a threat to Europe, and the authors of this Treaty concede that manipulations are deliberately being practised to deceive the peoples of Europe."
"This outrageous utterance shows that referendums on the Treaty are needed, but before they are held an honest debate is required, not least in the forum of the European Parliament."
"Our electorate must be made aware of what this document really is."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, during a recent meeting with Czech citizens I was informed that there are still people there who are experiencing difficulties with the still pending harmonisation of EU legislation on concessions for disabled people travelling outside their home country."
"I have already spoken this year in Parliament about the fact that harmonisation of EU legislation, which would enable people with different degrees of mental and physical disability to obtain a single document entitling them to concessions throughout the EU, would allow them to exercise their right to free movement, and as such it would enable them to participate more fully in our society."
"Another issue voiced by the citizens that merits our attention concerns the deadline for calls for submissions of projects for financing under the European Social Fund."
"I appreciate that the funds are directed to the citizens in need."
"However, drawing up and submitting projects in the period between the launch of the call and the deadline for submission is, according to disability organisations, at times a superhuman achievement even for a completely healthy person."
"I know that the Reform Treaty gives greater consideration to people with disabilities but it will not resolve everything."
"We must therefore look at whether we need to pay more attention to people with disabilities."
"Where are the boundaries between the able-bodied and the disabled?"
"As far as assistance goes, who is the giver and who is on the receiving end?"
"Any one of us might one day find ourselves on the other side of this equation."
"- (PL) Mr President, the Polish press has reported that the names of two Polish women have been left off the memorial in Madrid commemorating the victims of the terrorist attack on 11 March 2004."
"The missing names are those of Danuta Teresa Szpila and Alina Maria Bryk."
"Their families are offended."
"The memorial was unveiled eight months ago."
"The names of immigrants from Morocco and Romania have also been omitted."
"I am therefore asking my fellow Members from Spain: has this error been put right yet?"
"Why were these names not included on the memorial?"
"I would also ask, Mr President, that you show an interest and intervene in this matter."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the final decision on the entry of nine EU Member States into the Schengen area was welcomed with enthusiasm by the citizens of the Czech Republic."
"It will imply formal changes to the security system and protection of national borders and facilitate the free movement of goods and people, but it will also have some surprising complications."
"At the recent meeting of local authorities from South Bohemia, Bavaria and Upper Austria, some experts mentioned that the new obstacle along the former national borders could be the so-called 'non-interference zone' of the Šumava National Park."
"Some tourist routes from Bavaria border the non-interference zone and the strict environmental laws do not allow these routes to cross Czech territory."
"Not so long ago there was an Iron Curtain along the Czech-Austrian and Czech-German borders, which cut off the former East Germany and Czechoslovakia, ruled by a totalitarian communist regime, from the democratic world."
"We might live to experience a situation whereby the people in these regions are divided not by an iron but by a green curtain."
"(DE) Mr President, I beg your pardon, but in the second-to-last intervention the German translation by our otherwise extremely capable interpreter stated that Mr Söder was Bulgaria's Minister for Europe."
"I think it is important to point out, however, that he is in fact Bavaria's Minister for Europe, and this shows how important it is that we receive written minutes again, and not only audiovisual recordings."
"We shall note that."
"Mr Dîncu now has the floor."
"Is he absent?"
"Mr President, this is a 'catch-the-eye' debate."
"How did that Member manage to catch your eye without being here?"
"I understand that you have an interest in promoting 'catch-the-eye', so you have succeeded!"
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the increasing activity of far-right extremist forces, which sometimes we tend to forget and even to forgive."
"In less than a month we have faced a number of worrying events."
"In October a group of young Italians outraged the memory of the Holocaust, shouting in favour of Hitler in the Dachau concentration camp."
"Spain has witnessed racist attacks against immigrants in Barcelona and Madrid."
"The paramilitary Hungarian Guard has shown its violent face in Budapest."
"In recent days we have seen far-right ideas which are contrary to the very basic values of our European project infecting political life in Belgium and Italy and influencing political decisions and actions."
"Special attention should be given to last week's far-right rally in Prague, which attempted to celebrate the 1938 anti-Jewish purge known as the Kristallnacht on 9 November."
"All these events are becoming part of our daily life."
"It is time to wake up."
"We, the European parliamentarians, should lead the battle for the principles which brought us into this House: peace, democracy, tolerance, justice and solidarity."
"Let me underline that the existence of a far-right political group in this Parliament is encouraging extremists across Europe."
"My only hope is that this abuse of democracy will soon be brought to an end."
"Mr President, it is almost certain that the foot-and-mouth disease virus that caused enormous damage to the British economy last summer escaped from the Pirbright Laboratory in Surrey."
"This establishment is an EU reference laboratory which is supposed to protect our animals from contagious diseases and not to cause epidemics through incompetence."
"In the last two weeks the same laboratory has been the protagonist in what appears to be another fiasco."
"It has been issuing scores of confusing and sometimes contradictory results, with respect to foot-and-mouth disease, on animal samples sent from Cyprus."
"This apparent irresponsible behaviour has had severe effects on hundreds of farmers on the island."
"The Cyprus authorities blame all the confusion on the European Commission, and the citizens are understandably rather upset."
"Before Pirbright causes another dangerous blunder, could you please ask the Commission to take this laboratory off the list of animal testing reference laboratories and replace it with a more trustworthy facility, for agriculture's sake?"
"- (PL) Mr President, I would like to raise an issue that was bothering us all not so long ago; namely the change from summer to winter time (and back again in March)."
"It is said that this brings considerable savings in electricity consumption."
"It seems to me that this is not so, as the amount of daylight does not change in any way."
"Nor does electricity consumption for street lighting, as this is regulated automatically, depending on the amount of natural light available."
"Electricity consumption at industrial plants does not change."
"The only minor savings are in household electricity consumption, but new timetables are printed, trains are stopped, there is disruption for the elderly and also for children, and there is disruption to information systems."
"I would be glad, Mr President, if Parliament were to hear authoritative information from the Commission concerning the gains and losses brought about by the time change."
"Mr President, I would like to bring to the attention of the House a proposal by FIFA, the governing body of football, allowing players born in Northern Ireland to represent the Republic of Ireland."
"The Northern Ireland football team has a very proud history going back many decades and has produced many great football teams over the years, defeating many of the large nations in Europe."
"Over those years, Northern Ireland has had many difficulties, as it has over the past 30 years, but during all that time, soccer was able to bring the people together."
"So I say clearly to FIFA: you are wrong to go down this road, and it would certainly not help Northern Ireland's chances of developing totally in the future, especially at a time when we believed we were returning to normality."
"Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of Cadbury Schweppes, which has just announced in my own constituency that it is going to close its factory in Keynsham with the loss of 500 jobs and move production to Poland."
"This has been opposed by the British and Polish trade unions as they believe that this is an attempt by Cadbury Schweppes to race to the bottom, with people prepared to take the lowest wages being taken on board."
"Chocolate has been produced in Keynsham for 250 years, and for nearly 100 years by Cadbury Schweppes."
"It is going to create 500 job losses there and the total, with the knock-on effects for subcontractors, will be something like 1 500."
"It is hoping to get European money to help pay for moving this production."
"I am fully in favour of European job-creation projects, and I hope that the Commission will continue them - whether in the United Kingdom, Poland or elsewhere - but money from the European Union is for job creation and not job relocation."
"I hope the point will be made very clearly to the Commission that we do not expect it to pay for these job losses."
"- (PL) Mr President, EU integration is passing through a series of phases."
"As a result of implementation of the Schengen Agreement, another group of states will enter the area which border restrictions and controls have been lifted."
"We welcome this, as a considerable proportion of Poland's eastern border is also an EU border."
"The entry into force of the Schengen provisions has obliged on Poland to carry out extra controls on this border."
"I am thinking particularly of the border with Ukraine, a state that is becoming an important EU partner since its democratic and economic transition."
"Poland and Ukraine are linked by centuries of history as neighbours."
"Today we need especially close contacts and cooperation between our citizens and our peoples."
"We must therefore create good conditions and make it convenient for people crossing the Ukrainian-Polish, border - that is, the Ukrainian-EU border - while keeping unnecessary administrative requirements and costs to a minimum."
"This should not be a border of division, but one of neighbourly cooperation - a border that in future will persist only formally, on paper, when Ukraine becomes integrated into the EU - and let us hope that it will."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak about the situation that has developed in connection with that of the Romanian Roma in Italy."
"I feel it is regrettable that such a tragedy had to occur in order for the Italian decision, which everyone has interpreted differently, to shed light on the real problem, which I have represented at every forum for as long as I can remember."
"In this very Chamber I always mentioned the lack of a Roma integration policy during the accession discussions for Romania and Bulgaria."
"If minority groups leave their homeland in the hope of a better life, that is also a problem."
"But it is also an enormous problem that there are discriminatory situations within the borders of the European Union and certain minority groups are forced to leave the land of their birth."
"The time has come to create the comprehensive strategy that we voted for in our decision of April 2005 - this Parliament voted for it - in which we asked the Commission to urge the Member States to create the strategy."
"Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia have already created the strategy and are participating in the Decade of Roma Inclusion programme."
"If the 2005 guidelines and Parliamentary decision were not satisfactory for the Commission or for the other Member States, the matter must be taken up again."
"We not only need to create a comprehensive Roma strategy but, with regard to urging the creation of the strategy and to its seriousness, we also need to create a so-called EU fund as soon as possible in the interests of fully integrating the Roma, especially in order to stop educational segregation."
"- (PL) Mr President, I was really supposed to be speaking today about the situation in Burma, but information I have received obliges me to draw your attention once again to Russia."
"While preparations for the European Union summit were taking place in Mafra, in the Russian city of Kazan, 720 kilometres from Moscow, another round in the long-running battle between the authorities and the media was being played out."
"This time the part of victim was played by Natalia Petrova, a maker of documentary films about, among other subjects, Chechnya."
"The role of the torturers was played by plain-clothes officers from the local police."
"They arrested Ms Petrova at her home in front of her parents and two small children."
"During her arrest she lost consciousness, was struck several times and was burned with cigarettes."
"She came round at police headquarters, from where she was released after a few hours."
"One of the journalist's daughters also suffered injuries, as did her mother."
"Are these the standards of police behaviour in a democratic state that is a member of the Council of Europe?"
"Are these events to be robustly exposed in this forum in order to make Europe aware of what is really happening in Russia?"
"(PT) I should like to use the opening of the plenary session of the European Parliament to express our solidarity with the Gestnave and Erecta workers who are doggedly and courageously continuing to fight for integration into Lisnave."
"That integration, if they achieve it, is merely the implementation of what is stipulated in the agreement signed 10 years ago between the Portuguese State and the Mello Group within the framework of the restructuring of the Setúbal peninsula shipbuilding industry, but also of what is enshrined in the Portuguese Labour Code."
"Finally, I should like to express our full support for the innumerable initiatives which the Gestnave, Erecta and Lisnave workers have taken over the years to enforce the law and bring justice for the workers and the future of the shipbuilding and repair industry in Portugal."
"Mr President, a recent poll in Ireland showed support for the Reform Treaty to be at alarmingly low levels of just under 25% saying yes and over 62% undecided."
"Yet this week the Commission's draft legislative work programme for 2008 states that 'work will also be continued in order to allow companies to choose an EU-wide tax base'."
"Dr Sean Barrett, a senior lecturer in economics at Trinity College Dublin, has today described the reduction of the corporation tax rate in Ireland from 50% in the 1980s to 12½% a decade later as 'the most important policy measure that achieved the transformation of Ireland'."
"The concept of an EU-wide tax base with the dangerous option to collect corporation tax on sales based on the rate in each country undermines trust, contributes to rising Euro-scepticism in Ireland and is extremely misplaced in the context of the ratification of the Reform Treaty."
"I therefore ask that this matter be raised urgently with the Commission."
"Our focus should be on the important elements of the proposed Treaty and the real obstacles in the internal market, not jeopardising emerging markets, inward investment and the future ratification of the Treaty by working on an unwise, distrusted and thus unacceptable common tax-base proposal."
"Commissioner Figeľ is here, so I am sure that he has taken careful note of that."
"(SK) This coming 17 November is for the Czech and Slovak people as symbolically important as the fall of the Berlin Wall was for the Germans."
"Eighteen years ago a barbarian totalitarian regime came to an end in these countries."
"Subsequently, the Czech and Slovak people once more became part of Europe."
"Because of this event, 17 November is an anniversary that is alive, a symbol of something important to be remembered."
"The united Europe is founded on the defeat not just of Nazism but also of Communism."
"Just as not dealing with the Nazi crimes and criminals has been a threat to Europe, the same applies to the crimes of the Communist regime."
"I would like to recall here the legacy of Pope John Paul II, whose famous words 'do not be afraid' were an important display of solidarity for Slovak dissent."
"I would also like to mention President Reagan, whose words about the 'Evil Empire' turned him into our President, even though we did not vote for him."
"Communism was defeated by the courage of men and women; injustice made way for justice."
"Freedom is a great gift, and I am pleased to be able that today as a Member of the European Parliament."
"(HU) A decisive majority of the European Parliament has rightly been disgusted with events in Italy, but there is extraordinarily great hypocrisy in this, ladies and gentlemen."
"As if we didn't know that there are 3-4 million Roma living in difficult circumstances in Romania; as if we didn't know that there are 12 million Roma living in Europe."
"This also demonstrates that the European Union does not have a minorities policy, not for indigenous minorities, not for the Roma, nor for migrant minorities."
"I am pleased and proud that the European Socialists have condemned the principle of collective guilt in Italy, and I would also have been pleased if my own group had done the same with regard to the collective branding of the Hungarian minority living in Slovakia."
"Mr President, I would very much like to ask that during this parliamentary session there should at last be a person responsible for minority matters in the European Parliament, the Subcommittee on Human Rights should finally be a proper committee, and there should finally be some monitoring, since our President is a truly 'minority-friendly' President."
"Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, we saw only recently the fourth anniversary of the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, who has heart problems and is suffering from hepatitis."
"It is unacceptable that these two men remain in prison in the Siberian city of Chita, in violation of Russian law."
"For spurious reasons, their applications for early release, which is possible under Russian law, were overruled, despite good behaviour."
"This was clearly a step designed to keep opposition to a minimum before next year's election."
"When our group visited Moscow two weeks ago, I met with Mr Khodorkovsky's lawyer, Mr Yuri Schmidt."
"We also met with various other representatives of Memorial, with Garry Kasparov and Grigory Yavlinsky, all of whom confirmed that the Yukos problem is very much a political one."
"I therefore call upon the EU to address human rights violations more intensively and clearly in its dialogue with Russia."
"What matters here is not retribution, but humanity and justice."
"- (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the tragic political situation in Lebanon and the role that the EU is urgently called upon to play."
"Today is all too typical of this crisis, because once again the election of the President of the Republic has been postponed."
"Regional power squabbles affecting Lebanon have deepened the rift between political groups."
"As a result, the people are being held hostage, there is a risk of civil war and the whole area is unstable."
"The EU, which is in partnership with Lebanon, is following an action plan determined by its Neighbourhood Policy."
"The EU and its Member States contribute 40% of international development aid."
"The Union has met its responsibilities in the strengthened peacekeeping force."
"Yet all this is useless unless a national agreement is reached to avert the crisis."
"The way ahead is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the failure of the presidential election."
"The Union must play its part as an effective negotiator and initiate real dialogue."
"We have no time to dither; we cannot just wait and see."
"Mr President, the European Court of Human Rights recently made a ruling with far-reaching implications."
"The case in question was that of the Amalgamated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen versus the UK."
"It concerned Mr Jay Lee, who had been a member of ASLEF and the British National Party."
"Mr Lee was expelled by ASLEF because of his BNP membership."
"The Court upheld this action."
"The BNP is a political party with its roots in neo-Nazism."
"Nevertheless, under UK law, membership is perfectly legal."
"The British Government has conceded that trade union law must now be amended so that unions can expel members whose political views they do not like."
"The role of trade unions is to collectively represent the material interests of their members in the workplace, not to decide what political views are acceptable or unacceptable."
"The Court's decision is yet another European nail in the coffin of British liberties."
"Mr President, we were shocked at last week's violent clashes between protestors and police in Tbilisi, Georgia."
"The fact that President Mikhail Saakashvili declared a state of emergency to overcome the riots and conducted a violent crackdown is highly alarming."
"According to statements from the participants, the riots had nothing to do with external influences, but were the expression of severe displeasure with the Government."
"President Saakashvili overreacted, since violence is not an appropriate solution when addressing the justified concerns of the opposition."
"Furthermore, President Saakashvili declared that there would be presidential elections in Georgia in January 2008."
"We should not overlook the disturbances."
"The EU has provided Georgia, as a European Neighbourhood Policy country of destination, with advice on carrying out its regime transition."
"We should ask ourselves whether we have done our best to avoid such a crisis from occurring and, moreover, whether we can be sure that this will not reoccur in some other destination country."
"Mr President, at the recent Mafra summit, the Russian side proposed founding an institute to monitor the human rights situation in the EU countries."
"The Russian representatives commend this initiative as a political measure to counterbalance continued EU criticism of the worsening human rights situation in Russia."
"The institute in question will be financed by Russia."
"In my opinion, the EU leaders should in principle avoid such attempts to politicise human rights issues."
"It is true that there exist adequate human rights dialogue mechanisms between the EU and Russia."
"These mechanisms unfortunately have not been adequately used, due mainly to the lack of Russian response to the problems raised by the EU."
"Following this idea, one could imagine that, next, President Ahmadinejad will insist on establishing on EU territory an Iranian-financed institute on human rights and Holocaust studies."
"I am convinced that initiatives like this can only discredit the noble cause of defending human rights."
"The role of sport in education (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Pál Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the role of sport in education."
"rapporteur. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to express my thanks for the numerous remarks and recommended improvements that have been sent for my report."
"My objective was to talk about strengthening the role of school PE and sport in education."
"Nearly a quarter of the children living in the European Union are overweight, and 50% of them only participate in sports activities during school PE classes, whilst the number of PE classes is continuously falling."
"As a result of this dangerous process, diabetes, high blood pressure, diseases of the heart and nervous system, spinal and vascular ailments are spreading throughout Europe and will significantly increase the health care expenditure of individual Member States in the future."
"We cannot allow ourselves to compensate for the inactive lifestyle and sedentary everyday life typical of European adolescents by neglecting such a simple yet effective tool as the PE class."
"As a one-time Olympian, a practising sports director and naturally as an MEP, it is my obligation and my responsibility to find a way for the Union to do its share in the fight against obesity in pupils, in supporting a healthy, active lifestyle, in establishing the health of European adolescents and in the process of education through sport."
"Allow me to congratulate the heads of the Member States on their wise decision not to forget sport at the latest Lisbon summit and to give the Union the right of initiative in sport after approving the Reform Treaty."
"The Commission has prepared numerous programmes for promoting a healthy lifestyle, and in the field of healthy nutrition, but there is not enough coordination among these programmes."
"Sports experts, PE teachers and trainers must be given a greater role and respect in their implementation."
"It must be said that the White Paper on Sport published by the Commission in July, and the Action Plan relating to it, are a step in the right direction."
"We are also counting on the cooperation of the Commission in promoting research that is important for sports experts, and in gathering statistical data to measure the sporting activities of pupils and their physical condition."
"I feel it is important that, using lifelong learning and the framework of the Bologna process, we can promote mobility and continued training for trainers and PE teachers, we can mutually recognise the degrees that attest to their qualifications, and we can assist with more effective cooperation among organisations of sports experts."
"In addition to physical exercise, PE in schools develops such important qualities as persistence, team spirit, willpower and fair play, which the young people entrusted to us will be able to benefit from throughout their lives."
"School sports facilities and gymnasia in the Member States are often extraordinarily neglected, and they are poorly maintained and shabby."
"Another great problem is the lack of qualified PE teachers, that is, the disorganised state of further professional training and the fact that the content of the PE curriculum is out of date."
"Unfortunately, PE in schools has lost its importance, although it is the basis for both physical and mental development."
"Delicate and rough movements, which can be well developed through sport and popular games or any activity involving movement, are also essential in the study of reading and writing."
"It is no accident that dyslexic and dysgraphic children are also treated using movement therapy."
"PE is the only subject in the curriculum that focuses not only on mental development but also on physical development, the development of an active culture and hygiene."
"It is a joint task for PE teachers and parents to teach and encourage children to have a healthy lifestyle and to take regular exercise, and to draw their attention to the harmful physical and mental effects of prohibited performance-enhancing drugs, alcohol and other drugs."
"In order to improve the state of health and physical condition of children of school age, we recommend that PE in schools be made compulsory in primary and secondary schools, and that there be an opportunity for children to exercise at least three times a week as part of the curriculum."
"Sport has a prominent role in promoting social integration and reinforcing social cohesion, in so far as sport is an important tool for socialisation and intercultural dialogue."
"The issue of gender equality has been given a big role in the report."
"I also feel it is important that those who live with a disability should also participate in regular PE at school that corresponds to their needs and is increasingly integrated."
"In my report, I also mention that PE and organised sports at school play a prominent role, not only physically but also mentally, in the healthy development of children and, at the same time, a level of socialisation."
"I recommend in my report that the regions that have been left behind in this field should be able to compete for funding for sports investment from the Structural Funds."
"Finally, I would like to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their valuable contributions to the report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I respectfully ask you to support my report."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(DE) Madam President, I asked for the floor before the report was announced."
"The President in the chair before you called upon a large number of Members - as part of the catch-the-eye procedure - who were not even present in the House."
"For that, he was reprimanded by the Rules of Procedure incarnate, Mr Corbett."
"I tried to speak dozens of times, and also handed in my request, but was ignored."
"I believe that what the President in the chair before you has just done is contrary to the rules of this House and unworthy of this Parliament."
"Mr Martin, there were far too many one-minute speeches."
"Normally it lasts half an hour."
"It has overrun that by quite a lot, so I am sorry."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all my congratulations to Mr Schmitt and the committee on the own-initiative report."
"This report is timely and very inspirational."
"We used this report in drafting our White Paper as one of the contributions that I think important in a common strategy towards sport in Europe and I am happy that there is a lot of concrete convergence between the White Paper adopted in July and this report."
"In general this report and our White Paper agree that the general orientation of physical education does not necessarily correspond to today's societal needs."
"The subject is increasingly marginalised within school curricula programmes, so that is why we need to improve."
"I would like to mention some of the issues or areas in the report and in the White Paper."
"Both documents recommend enhanced cooperation between the health, education and sport sectors to define and implement strategies to reduce health risks such as being overweight."
"Regarding the time devoted to physical education, we will build this into a set of physical activity guidelines."
"We should develop this with Member States by the end of next year, 2008."
"We are also considering introducing the award of a European label to schools which are actively involved in supporting and promoting physical activities in a school environment."
"Concerning research, the White Paper proposes mobilising the seventh Research Framework Programme to support multidisciplinary research in this area, mainly on lifestyle aspects of health."
"We also recommend considering the role of sport in the field of social inclusion, social integration and equal opportunities in the programming of Structural Funds."
"Concerning investment, as far as top class sport is concerned, we have launched a study on the training of young top-level sportsmen and sportswomen in Europe."
"This should enable us to identify the right instruments to develop sports training and education for young persons, and also ensure higher quality and quality more generally."
"In the mean time, we are supporting sport and physical activity through the Lifelong Learning programme, the Youth in Action programme and the Europe for Citizens programme."
"Let me underline at this moment that the general call for proposals for 2008, 2009 and 2010 in the framework of the Lifelong Learning Programme has included physical education and sport among its priorities, and this will open new funding opportunities for this education area."
"To conclude, we are looking forward, as Mr Schmitt mentioned, to the ratification and entry into force of the Reform Treaty because this will open up new possibilities."
"Our experience with the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan and your own report will help us to shape those possibilities better to support Member States' efforts to promote the role of sport in education in the coming years."
"I thank you again for your contribution."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, in sport - and we are talking about fairness here - no distinctions can be made between the sexes; women must be treated equally."
"This begins during the school years, during PE classes, and extends right through to high-performance training in top-class sport, for here far too little consideration is given to female traits and female biological requirements."
"More attention needs to be directed to this."
"In top-class sport, the same applies to the public and to attention from the media, which has an effect on funding."
"Women are greatly disadvantaged in top-class sport, and it is high time that we made sure that fair play applies to everyone in this regard, too."
"We also need to ensure that the integration of girls from different cultural groups into school sporting activities works better, and must try to involve everybody, despite religious and cultural differences."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to congratulate our fellow Member Mr Schmitt, who has brought his experience to bear in his report."
"I stress that sport and children's participation in sports activities are very necessary today in view of the changes that have taken place in our everyday lives."
"Children these days spend much of their time in front of the television, video games and computers."
"Their diet is anything but healthy."
"Child obesity has become an increasingly serious problem inevitably entailing serious health hazards."
"For children sport is not only a way of exercising and developing new group skills; it is also recreational and teaches teamwork."
"The physical exercise involved in doing sport has a beneficial effect on young people's physical health."
"Commissioner, children are not eating more, but they are less active and get less exercise."
"A sedentary life and obesity often cause high blood pressure and diabetes, which affect a steadily increasing proportion of the EU's population."
"Member States today must promote physical exercise as a school subject in order to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle."
"Member States and the competent authorities must ensure that greater emphasis is placed on the promotion of health in the curriculum, and that physical education is given equal status with other subjects on the timetable."
"Member States must also lay down a minimum requirement for the number of physical education lessons in schools."
"Lastly, the Member States must actively support all forms of physical education and promote dialogue between parents, PE teachers and sports associations outside school."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Schmitt for his good report and for his constructive collaboration during the preparation of this."
"The role of sport generally and specifically within education is an incredibly important issue."
"Commissioner Kyprianou said less than a month ago that he believed that the greatest threat to the health of EU citizens was obesity."
"Unfortunately, I think that he is right, and therefore it is crucial that we focus on the problem and on what we can do to solve it."
"We have an important obligation to our children, particularly those who do not form good eating and sports habits at home for social or family-related reasons."
"Therefore, the focus on the role of sport in education is important."
"School can and should play a major role in providing children with good habits, as children spend a large proportion of their day there."
"As pointed out in the report, it is therefore not necessary to discuss whether sport is essential within education. However, it is important that we discuss how we can ensure that there is more sport in school."
"It is also important that children develop good exercise habits as early on as possible."
"This is obvious for health reasons but, at the same time, as Mr Schmitt has also said, we know that exercise and sport can develop social relationships among children and young people and create social integration irrespective of ethnicity and social class."
"This is why sport is such an important tool."
"What can we do, therefore?"
"We must ensure that children have the opportunity to do more exercise than is the case today."
"Sport should not just be something for affluent children."
"Sport should be a natural part of every child's life."
"At this juncture, it is also necessary to ensure that sport does not only mean competitive sport, but something that everyone can participate in, and that is why it is important that sport be integrated within education."
"There is therefore a general need for individual Member States to prioritise sport as a part of education much more than is the case today, and as part of this to ensure that the correct facilities are available and also qualified teachers, for example."
"It is therefore clearly a key responsibility for the Member States, but with this report we want to help focus on the problem and the possible solutions, and naturally also highlight what the EU can do in connection with this."
"In addition, there are three things that are required. We need teachers to have a greater insight into the reasons for the barriers to children participating in sport."
"A better relationship between sport at school and sport in leisure time also needs to be created."
"In addition, as has been mentioned previously, we need to prioritise resources, time and sports facilities."
"I am very pleased with the report; it is a good report and sets out the conditions that are required in order for sport to help improve the health of children."
"Therefore, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports the report, but we feel that it is important that it be only the first step towards a major initiative to deal with the problem of obesity."
"We believe that it is necessary for us to both use more resources and take more time in this area."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, for this report."
"It has to be said that this is an excellent and timely topic."
"It raises the issue of physical education and the role of sport in schools."
"If we look back these 20 to 30 years, as Europeans we know that this is one area of school education that we have neglected."
"This is conspicuous everywhere in Europe in the shape of a decline in general fitness."
"It is also conspicuous as a range of side-effects."
"Fort example, there has been a noticeable increase in obesity."
"Diabetes has also become a commoner phenomenon, as has cardiovascular disease."
"Mental health problems have also become commoner."
"We might also suggest, as has already been said here, and as said earlier on by Mr Mavrommatis, who is from the land we know as Ancient Greece, that in olden times it was said that a healthy soul in a healthy body is the very best situation, and this is what we should be aiming for once again in Europe."
"We should also understand that exercise is vitally important for a person's general wellbeing."
"We live in what we call the information society in Europe, but I hope the information society might become something more."
"It could be an education society, which also extends to body education and exercise."
"In Finland our Olympic winner Tapio Korjus is now heading a body education project, which is an attempt to promote the view that healthy physical education has an effect on a person's general wellbeing."
"We are inclined to think that good results are expected to appear on the horizon."
"The core issue, however, is teacher training and schools, with physical exercise actually becoming a priority in teacher training."
"This should also be required of teachers because there are special problems with many children in remote areas."
"I really hope that improvements will be made to physical education, that schools and fitness organisations will find one another more easily, and that all children and young people can experience the delights of physical education in their own lives and build their future upon it."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, physical activity is indisputably an important factor in the life of every person."
"It could be said to improve the state of our health and of our souls."
"According to numerous studies and statistics, the state of health of EU citizens is deteriorating year on year as a result of a lifestyle that is getting faster and faster and is causing us to devote less and less time to sporting pursuits and recreation."
"If we add poor diet to this, for example the inclusion of fast foods in the daily menu, we could say that a healthy lifestyle has been abandoned."
"What is worse, we are responsible for the health of children and young people who are suffering increasingly from obesity and coronary diseases."
"The lifestyle we impose on children is one of travelling to school by car, inadequate physical education at school, returning home by car and, once home, computers and television, which is not the best of lifestyles."
"This is why now is the time to take stock and to support all useful initiatives aimed at creating an active lifestyle."
"It is time to pass resolutions on the role of sport in education along with the comments and proposals announced by Mr Schmitt."
"It is time we took the subject seriously."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, on behalf of my group, I would like to first of all congratulate Mr Schmitt on this report, and also stress the importance of increasing the number of hours of teaching of physical education in schools."
"Adequate time spent doing the right physical activity is the best possible way to complement all-round personal development, from both a mental and a physical point of view."
"Balancing time dedicated to study with the time needed for sport is a challenge that we need to meet for our children as soon as possible, as it will enable us to ensure that they have a good quality of life in the future."
"It should also be taken into account that this is a key time for acquiring habits, which means that physical education is vital."
"I would also like to highlight the need to introduce campaigns aimed at children, and this is a request to the Commission."
"These campaigns and programmes need to be aimed at children and their parents so that they adopt healthy lifestyles that include physical activity and exclude habits such as smoking, which continues to be one of the blots on health in Europe."
"To conclude, I think that all the speakers so far have mentioned improving training for physical education teachers, as, at the end of the day, this programme cannot go ahead without them."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, this report on the role of sport in education deals in detail with the question of how Member States shall organise the subject of physical education in school."
"It is another example of how the EU's politicians and officials go into any area and at any level of detail they choose in their zeal to centralise political power here."
"Subsidiarity is embraced in speeches, but is never respected in political practice."
"This sets a new record for absurdly detailed regulation."
"Let me give some examples."
"Paragraph 10 says that the Member States shall be called on to make PE compulsory in primary and secondary schools and that at least three PE lessons per week should be guaranteed."
"Paragraph 24 talks about the importance of offering sports coeducation for children at nursery and primary schools."
"This is the kind of thing people are getting up to."
"It is a brazen and ridiculous attempt to promote the position of the EU in an area which should be decided upon by the peoples of Europe themselves."
"on behalf of the ITS Group - (BG) Mme Chairperson, Colleagues, It is gratifying to note that such a famous and prominent name in world sports as Pál Schmitt has contriubuted his authority to raise a very important issue for the future of Europeans before the European Parliament."
"For the attitude to sports is, in fact, attitude to the health of people in united Europe."
"I feel honoured and proud to speak on his report as an athlete, as a representative of an ancient people with immense sport spirit, and also as a person concerned with the future of children in united Europe, the future of our children."
"In my opinion, things are crystal clear: more sports at school, less drugs at school; more spending for sports at school, less spending for healthcare because it is perfectly obvious that it is ten times better for our children to be happy than to be better cured; more sports competition at the earliest age, less aggression in the other spheres of life; more international sporets races involving school children, less inter-ethnic and inter-state tensions in the European Union and in the world at large."
"Therefore, bacause of the time constraint, I would like to highlight those aspects that need further development on the basis of the report by the champion and highly respected athlete and politician Pál Schmitt."
"I would like to see a recommendation of the European Parliament to all Member States to increase the number of sports classes at school to five hours a week."
"I suggest that the European Parliament think seriously and include in its future budget a proposal to organise international competitions under its auspices for schoolchildren in some sports that are most useful to adolescents."
"The report points out that sports at school is unattractive."
"Have you ever thought why football is attractive?"
"Because football players are stars."
"Let us have Europe single out its school sport stars in various areas!"
"Thus will shall give much more publicity to sports at school that a directive or a recommendation could possibly give."
"They will be European school champions in athletics, football and basketball, martial arts or swimming."
"In this way, we might not be able to restore the Spartan ideal of a healthy spirit in a healthy body, mens sana in corporare sano, in its authentic meaning, but we shall contribute much more than a report could contribute."
"The decision to hold youth Olympics in 2010 follows these lines but the Olympic spirit cannot prevail in school sports if we rely only on the four-year Olympic cycle."
"We should use time in between more intensively by offering a meaningful sports calendar for school children."
"The European Parliament should make special efforts to prevent the spread of drugs through sports at school."
"In closing, I believe that the uderstanding of this Parliament about sports at the earliest age bodes well for the future..."
"(The Chairperson iterrupts the speaker)"
"(SL) The importance of physical exercise to the development and health of young people is well known."
"However, we also know that present-day lifestyles mean that many children spend a great deal of time indoors and in front of computers."
"Therefore, Mr Schmitt's report, which aims to encourage the Member States and all of us to rethink the role of sport in education, is very important."
"I would like to point out two aspects which are also referred to fleetingly in the report."
"Firstly, the importance of sports education to children with special needs."
"There is a tendency for as many of such children as possible to be integrated into mainstream schools."
"However, because of the different needs of these children and young people it is not always possible to provide appropriate equipment and treatment in a mainstream school."
"On the other hand, precisely these children require special attention and physical activity since movement-impaired children, for example, spend a great deal of time in a sedentary position and therefore need even greater opportunities for exercise."
"Consequently, where they are included in mainstream schools, appropriate conditions for physical activity adapted to them should be provided."
"The second aspect I would like to point out is the role of sports clubs and the impact of sports coaches on the development of young people."
"It is not only sporting achievements that are important but also health and educational work with young people, to which coaches in clubs should also devote a great deal of attention."
"Parents want to entrust their children to someone who will not only strive for the best possible sporting achievement but also look after their health and act as an educator and a role model in all respects."
"Only in these terms can we speak of the positive role of sport in the lives of young people."
"(DE) Madam President, there was of course the European Year of Education through Sport, and I think that we can and should go back to many of the conclusions that Year brought us in the way of insights."
"We have already adopted some resolutions on various matters."
"There is still much on the agenda, including the report by Mr Schmitt, and I think we have a great deal of material to hand in order to illustrate and confirm everything that is now being discussed; that is, how important sport is and what we should learn and take from it."
"But not enough is happening in sport - I mean, not enough is happening for sport."
"People are more aware of health, but obesity and diabetes are on the increase, especially amongst children."
"We have spoken a great deal about teacher training, and I think that we have to begin with primary school."
"There are no specialist PE teachers in primary schools - at least I know that is true of my country - instead, teachers with general training are used to teach PE as well."
"Specially trained teachers are needed here as well, so as to begin as early as possible."
"I believe that cooperation between associations, schools and public authorities is very important."
"Associations do a lot in the way of education and training work with children, and receive far too little support."
"They all struggle financially with too little money, while in fact their services are invaluable."
"I am proud of the project currently operating in Austria in which sporting administrators have managed to get into schools and increase the physical education offered, in cooperation with teachers and each state's school organisations. There is a particular focus on the children's aptitudes and abilities."
"I believe it is very important to involve the parents."
"We cannot and must not leave everything to public bodies; instead we must also make people aware that nutrition and physical activity are important for children."
"It is important to start with the parents here, too."
"(DE) Madam President, congratulations to Mr Schmitt on his own-initiative report."
"I hold the opposing view to Mr Lundgren."
"Unfortunately, in school matters, the European Union is being restrained by the Member States, for any objective analysis of the problem quickly reveals how vital it is that the approach to different aspects of schooling be harmonised."
"PE is part of this, in the same way as training in creative thinking or social involvement."
"Mr Schmitt's report concentrates on PE."
"While in the USA only very sporty students who also have excellent grades get a place at a good university, in Europe it is exactly the other way around."
"The higher the level of schooling, the less time there is for young people to be involved in sport."
"PE has a lowly status in the world of school."
"Sport is regarded as being only a leisure activity, and that is a mistake."
"Sport enables people to overcome mental limits, and that is exactly what we need in Europe."
"These days, people often manage to have a career in sport despite school, and not because of school."
"That is an error in our system, one that the present report brings to our notice."
"Finally, I should like to speak up for a community that cannot do so here for itself."
"Due to the political situation in their country, young sportspeople in the Turkish part of Cyprus cannot take part in international competitions."
"They hope that the European Union will bring an end to their isolation."
"By now, more than three years since Cyprus joined the European Union, if a solution is not already in place, at least a proposal for one should be under consideration."
"- (PL) Madam President, we take care of the balanced development of our economy, but often we neglect the need for balanced development of our children - not only their intellectual development, but also their physical development."
"The school years are a period of dynamic growth in children and young people and of rapid biological development and maturation."
"Physical movement and the exercise of various muscle groups is particularly important for health during this period."
"Young people spend a lot of time in front of television screens or computer monitors."
"This may help intellectual development, but it has a negative impact on physical development. It causes curvature of the spine."
"This may be avoided through regular involvement in sport."
"Meanwhile, school sports facilities are often not accessible after lessons, and young people are unable to make use of them."
"I support the report."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's White Paper and Mr Schmitt's excellent report feature both the educative function of PE in schools and the role of sport in social integration and fostering good health."
"Awareness of all aspects of this in society should now be increased."
"Alongside what we have learned from the European Year of Education through Sport and from the Lifelong Learning, Youth and Europe for Citizens programmes, it is now time to devise initiatives to make the most, in our times, of the various forms of physical activity comprising sport, both in schools, clubs and associations, and as spontaneous, informal physical activity."
"In an era when we do very little physical activity, sport has much greater significance for us than it did for our parents and grandparents."
"In a time when children prefer to play computer games, there is a growing need to promote active, healthy lifestyles for children and young people."
"Unfortunately, there are many signs that, in many schools, even the time available for PE often fails to correspond to the reality on the ground - that is, implementation sometimes fails to meet with legal obligations."
"It seems that a reality check is necessary in many schools in this regard."
"I also support the rapporteur when he calls on the Commission to draw up guidelines on the application of the State aid rules to public sports facilities - naturally, fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity - together with the national and European umbrella organisations for sports."
"We need clarity on what type of state support is regarded as acceptable and lawful and which aspects can be integrated with one another, possibly including the strengthening of investment in physical education, and with regard to the financing, if necessary with assistance from European funds within the framework of the Structural Funds, of the modernisation and provision of schools."
"- (PL) Madam President, I fully support the draft resolution, and I thank the rapporteur for the very good drafting of this text."
"For me there is no doubt: in my youth - and the same will be true of most of you - school and youth sport affected a much larger percentage of young people."
"Now the number of hours of PE at school has fallen."
"Of course this has an impact on young people's health, as Mrs Tomaszewska has said."
"Involvement in sport must be given due prestige."
"One way of doing this may be to include sport in the scope of application of the European transfer of credit points in schooling and vocational training."
"Mutual recognition of diplomas and licences conferring a right to provide services in the sports sector throughout the European Union will certainly help to guarantee the free flow of students, sports people and employees in Europe and will improve the opportunities for people in this industry to find good jobs."
"Emphasis should also be placed on the social and cultural aspect of the existence of clubs and sports associations for local people and national communities."
"(RO) Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I welcome and support Mr. Pál Schmitt's report on the role of sport in education because it offers us, one more time, the possibility to get actively involved in improving the life of our fellow citizens."
"Supporting physical education and sport, the European Parliament gives a signal not only for a healthier life, but also for the promotion of the common European values that we all inherited from Greece and Ancient Rome."
"We have to give more substance to the dictum mens sana in corpore sano via concrete actions which are often conditioned by financial aspects."
"For this reason, we ask the Commission, the Council and the Member States to find the adequate instruments to increase investments in the field of school infrastructure and equipment."
"One extremely efficient way to achieve this consists in the European funds for disadvantaged regions, especially in the new Member States, which need to be supported in order to increase their capacity of absorption."
"Moreover, I believe that the European Union should initiate a sustained media campaign, especially in the TV children and youth programmes, in order to encourage them to practice sport so as to reduce obesity, smoking and drug consumption, as well as to promote correctness, team spirit, discipline, solidarity, tolerance and to combat discrimination."
"As regards us, many Members of the European Parliament have practiced sport."
"I believe we should establish a way to annually reward the best initiatives for promoting physical education and sport, by offering a prize, for instance."
"(NL) Madam President, congratulations to Mr Schmitt on this excellent report, and also once more to Commissioner Figeľ on the White Paper on Sport."
"I should like to reiterate that clearly, as this represents a very important step forward, particularly in view of the section on sport contained in the EU Reform Treaty."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's involvement with sport is not evident to everyone; however, whether we like it or not, a number of aspects of sport must be examined from a European angle."
"I shall select one such aspect: the plea in Mr Schmitt's report for extra financial support for sports clubs that actively collaborate with schools."
"This can be fitted perfectly into the 'open sports ground policy', including in the case of professional sports clubs."
"Besides, ladies and gentlemen, sport is an excellent instrument to restore enthusiasm for school and education among socially disadvantaged groups of young people."
"I think that this aspect of sport, too, deserves maximum support."
"Then there is of course the obesity problem."
"This needs to be addressed urgently."
"As we read in the Schmitt report, ever more young people are having to deal with this."
"In the EU-27, one in four children is now overweight, not because they eat too much, or have a poor diet, but chiefly owing to insufficient physical activity."
"Hence the report's appeal to the Member States and the regions to allocate a minimum of three hours a week to sport and include this in the timetable of primary and secondary schools."
"This appeal comes not a minute too soon."
"We cannot impose this at European level - nor do we want to, of course - but we can mark defaulting Member States and regions as being bottom of the class."
"Indeed, this is also an economic necessity, for - as we know - childhood obesity is one of the causes of cardiovascular disease, including in later life."
"Thus, we have every interest in investing more time and energy in school sports facilities."
"Member of the Commission. ?"
"(SK) I welcome the very encouraging atmosphere during this debate, which confirms that sport and physical education certainly have an effect on health, but also on certain values held by young people and our entire society."
"I think we are all in agreement on the very practical arguments that have been put forward about the preventive role of physical education."
"It is appropriate and timely to invest more resources in this direction."
"Sport also encourages values such as fair play, team spirit, discipline, an understanding of rules, acceptance of others and solidarity."
"That is why sport is a great instrument for integration, whether it be social integration, at a local level or a European level, which does not mean assimilating or absorbing other groups, but encouraging participation within agreed rules."
"Therefore, the more education and the more sport in education, the better our coexistence."
"As many of you stated, there is consensus on this."
"However, what do we need to do now to accomplish more: it is one thing to agree but we must act, too."
"I think that there are some elements that show a certain amount of maturity and readiness, and I mentioned one at the beginning."
"In the Lifelong Learning Programme 2008-2010 sport and physical education have been prioritised in calls for individual projects for mobility, curricular collaboration and school partnership."
"It is an invitation, an offer of space."
"The same can be said for the Structural Funds and the modernisation of our schools."
"The White Paper is a very comprehensive document."
"In 50 years these issues had never been formulated like this because we evolved from steel and coal to issues that are today more inclined towards the knowledge society."
"In this context, sport is a very popular and important activity, which is why this contribution today is very important and has come at the right time."
"It includes 53 activities for the years ahead, many of which have the aspect of education through sport as a common feature."
"I will conclude by saying that Article 149, which refers to education and youth, for the first time also includes a section on sport."
"I believe that in the ratification process, which will start after the signing of the Treaty, support for sport will be demonstrated in this dimension, too, and that in a few years, with the gradual developments, the EU might even be able to establish a sports programme, based, of course, on the principle of subsidiarity, as stipulated in the Treaty."
"That is part and parcel of this debate, but also of decisions that might be made as part of similar discussions."
"I would like once again to thank Mr Schmitt and all those who contributed to this inspiring report, and I look forward to further collaboration."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 13 November 2007."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) Sport is now far more than a leisure activity: it interweaves all of the economy and society."
"Sport is the perfect tool for education: it teaches us about social coexistence and that if an individual is integrated into any group, he can become a useful member."
"Through sport, we attain respect for companions, opponents and rules, and we attain solidarity, an enterprising spirit and collective discipline."
"Its key role in the world enjoys general recognition everywhere, and sport has become an important player in disseminating positive values and messages and in building socially and environmentally sustainable economies."
"The surge in sedentary occupations, the increase in cars, the reduction in exercise and the increasing consumption of food and drink with high energy content are causing significant health problems for our citizens."
"Therefore, people must now be persuaded from an early age to live a healthier life - in which exercise is one of the main components - and obviously the proper infrastructure and sports opportunities must be ensured for them."
"This concerns a wide, distinct range of branches and activities that are based on institutions, social factors, widespread communication, the expansion of services and political responsibility."
"In order for European citizens to change their exercise and healthy lifestyle habits, joint efforts by the public and private sectors will be necessary to change ways of thinking, increase awareness, create specific, practical initiatives and develop infrastructure, and local governments will have a special role to play in this."
"in writing. - Mr President, as a former javelin thrower and current President of the Estonian Ski Association, I am sincerely glad that Pál Schmitt has come up with a report on the role of sport in education."
"In Europe there is a great variability in popular sports in different Member States - from skiing in Finland to soccer in the UK, from hockey in the Czech Republic to cycling in the Netherlands."
"Altogether we have got many talented trainers who could be more involved in professional exchange to promote diverse sports across Europe and to provide students of all ages with more versatile possibilities."
"I fully support Article 50 of the report, which calls on the Commission to promote the European mobility of physical education teachers and trainers."
"The European Union stands united in diversity and we should take stock of our extensive expertise in the field of sports."
"Another article that I consider immensely significant is Article 10, which calls on the Member States to make physical education compulsory in primary and secondary schools and guarantee at least three lessons of physical education a week, even better one lesson a day, which promotes a healthy lifestyle among European youth."
"Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Romana Jordan Cizelj, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency - C6-0131/2007 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report."
"Nuclear energy is an important component of a European energy policy mix, and today we are witnessing a renewed interest in nuclear energy, both at European and international level."
"The Euratom Supply Agency has, during its more than 45 years of existence, helped to ensure the supply of nuclear fuels for the benefit of Community users."
"The Supply Agency is a body which was established by the Euratom Treaty, meaning it stems directly from a primary law instrument."
"It aims at the long-term security of supply through reasonable diversification of supply sources for nuclear fuels."
"Equal access to sources of supply is an important element of the Euratom Treaty, and this is ensured by the Supply Agency."
"Today, the Supply Agency operates on statutes from 1958, when the Community consisted of six Member States."
"The enlargement of the European Union calls for the modernisation of these statutes."
"This is the purpose of our proposal; this is also why the Supply Agency cannot be considered a new agency within the meaning of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission."
"The European Parliament has long called for the role of the Agency to be revived and for the powers contained in the Euratom Treaty to be used in full."
"I would, in particular, mention the Maldeikis report on the 50th anniversary of the Euratom Treaty, which this House adopted earlier this year."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission welcomes most of the amendments proposed."
"I share your view that the role of the advisory committee needs to be strengthened."
"I also agree that it should contribute more to the preparation of the market surveys of the Agency."
"In conclusion, I welcome the support that the European Parliament is giving in order to reinforce the role of the Euratom Supply Agency."
"I look forward to the discussion."
"rapporteur. - (SL) The role of nuclear energy is becoming increasingly evident, not only in Europe but also globally."
"Reliability of supply, energy market competitiveness, and minimisation of the environmental impact of the production and use of energy form the bases of European Union energy policy."
"At the same time, sustainable energy development is also having a positive effect on the development of technology, economic growth and employment."
"All this points to achievement of the Lisbon strategy objectives."
"A balanced energy mix is one of the conditions necessary for sustainable development, combating global warming and climate change, reducing reliance on imports, and ensuring secure energy supplies."
"In the European Union, nuclear energy also forms a component part of that mix."
"We must therefore ensure that we have a secure and reliable supply of nuclear material and competitive, properly functioning energy markets on which we can rely."
"The Euratom Supply Agency was set up for this reason."
"Its role needs to be strengthened further in the light of the changing conditions on the world energy markets."
"Naturally, I also agree with the Commission that the enlargement of the European Union to 27 Member States and the financial regulation adopted for the Agency demand new, modernised and improved statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency."
"I have also emphasised the Agency's increased role in my report."
"We need a strong body which will, in addition to its basic role of monitoring supply and demand for nuclear material and services, provide and regularly carry out studies of the risk on the market and of long-term price movement on the market in nuclear materials."
"It must have control over the conclusion of long-term nuclear fuel contracts and provide a framework for investment, etc."
"In order for all these tasks to be performed successfully, I have proposed a greater role for the Advisory Committee, which I see primarily as an expert body."
"On account of its diverse expertise it is able to lend the Agency unique support for the tasks entrusted to it by the Euratom Treaty."
"I therefore believe that the number of members of the Advisory Committee should be increased, primarily in terms of experts."
"I believe that the Member States which have nuclear fuel cycle activities and also contribute the most funds are entitled to an additional member on the Advisory Committee."
"In order to ensure consistency in the work of the Committee and enable it to develop high-level expertise, I propose setting up a Bureau or body of executive officers and that that body be composed of a Chair, two Vice-chairs and two advisors."
"Consistency can be provided only by means of a simple structure and a clearly defined role for the executive officers of the Advisory Committee, who form a link between the Advisory Committee and the Agency's Director General."
"They must coordinate the activities of the Advisory Committee, in particular those which relate to the drawing up, assessment and review of its reports and the expansion of expertise."
"Without investment in knowledge and human resources the set objectives for a competitive and technologically advanced Europe will hardly be met."
"I would like to emphasise further the need for transparency, which is largely a matter for the Agency's annual report."
"I believe that the European Parliament should also be informed of every major Agency project."
"Its role in the Agency's budget procedure must be defined more clearly."
"The Agency's annual report, the results of studies and other relevant texts should be received not only by the European Parliament but also by the Council, the Court of Auditors and the Member States."
"Only with a good flow of information and the establishment of good practice can we improve the Agency's performance."
"The method of financing the Agency, which until now has been rather complicated and unclear on account of the Agency's specific nature, can also help provide transparency."
"I would like to simplify this method and therefore support the Agency operating in the same way as other European agencies."
"Nuclear energy forms part of the energy mix and I would like it to operate under the same conditions as those which apply to other sources of energy."
"In order to make the situation simpler, more transparent and consistent with the provisions of the Euratom Treaty, I propose that the Supply Agency have its own budget line which will be separate from the budget of the Commission departments and in which administrative expenditure will be clearly separated from the Agency's operational expenditure."
"This would allow the European Parliament, as a branch of budgetary authority, to acquire control of the Agency's budget, thereby also contributing to a more transparent and democratic Europe."
"Whether we agree with the increasing role of nuclear energy or not, its existence is a present-day reality."
"We certainly want secure supplies and functioning markets, but this can be provided only by a long-term vision and a powerful body with sufficient powers and democratic control."
"The new Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency seek to attain these objectives."
"Finally, I would like to thank the Commission for its cooperation and for answering rather difficult questions on the Statutes."
"I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their constructive cooperation in drawing up and adopting the report."
"I would also ask you to support it in the vote at the plenary session and would be pleased to hear the comments of fellow members."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, first of all may I join in congratulating Mrs Jordan Cizelj on her report."
"She has put a lot of work into making many serious and sensible improvements to this proposal."
"I have to say that I hope very much that the Council will take them on board."
"I am aware that we are only in consultation on this."
"I welcome the emphasis in the report on openness - openness as to the functioning of the Agency - and the emphasis on the role that this Parliament should play in the work of the Agency."
"In that vein I support the amendments from the Committee on Budgets, which exercises our authority as part of the budgetary authority."
"I also welcome the proposals that Mrs Jordan Cizelj has put in for clarification of the role of the Agency, in particular the role of its committee."
"Although I might not personally be quite so enthusiastic about an increase in numbers, nevertheless, I think it is extremely helpful to be more open and specific about the role of the committee."
"By way of contrast, I have to express my regret at one or two wrecking amendments, particularly Amendment 39, which I think, rather mischievously - but perhaps deliberately - goes in exactly the opposite direction from the intention and role of the Agency and the whole Euratom Treaty."
"But there we are."
"Perhaps it is not such a surprise, coming from the Verts/ALE Group."
"But, finally, I would like to welcome the renaissance of nuclear energy - as the Commissioner has said, at both European and international level - because of the vital role it will have to play in dealing with climate change."
"on behalf of the PSE Group - (BG) Dear colleagues, on behalf of the Socialists, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mme Cizelj for the thorough work and the good cooperation within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in the preparation of the report."
"I believe that the adoption of new Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency should reflect not only the new number of Member States but also the modern financial rules."
"First and foremost, the Statutues should provide the groundwork for strengthening the role of the Agency and ensuring regular supplies under the most favourable terms and conditions for the supply of raw materials and nuclear materielle."
"In this connection, I support the proposal for the Agency to reinforce its analytical functions with regard to the development of the market for nuclear materials, and to conduct regular reviews, including market risk analysis."
"The prestige of the Agency and the expertise in its work will be enhanced by the proposals to specify and foster the role of the Advisory Board at the Agewncy."
"Special attention should also be paid to the proposals to promote transparency in the activities of the Agency."
"From the perspective of the role of the European Parliament, it would be appropriate to make changes along two lines: clearer definition of the role of the European Parliament in the budgetary procedure and submission to the European Parliament of the work programme, the annual reports and the studies of the Agency with a view to providing regular and detailed information on its activities."
"I am confident that the adoption of the European Parliament's proposals by the Council could provide the foundations to promote the authority of the Agency so that to become a leading initiator of the implementation of the European Parliament's address to the international community in point 9 of its resolution of 14 March 2007 concerning non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, appealing for support to initiatives for multilateral international uranium enrichmnet centres under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"As Javier Solana pointed out in Lisbon on 6 November at the Euromed meeting, this issue has become particularly topical now, when countries like Morocco, Egypt and Jordan have announced ambitious programmes for the development of nuclear energy."
"In closing, I would like to express my confidence that the adoption of the new Statutes for the Euroatom Supply Agency will contribute to the fostering of the role of the European Union in the application of stringent rules for non-proliferation and nuclear safety."
"(The speaker continues his speech in English)"
"I would like especially to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, for his support for the proposals made by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and for his statement that the Agency should become a viable body of the European Union in the light of the revival of the role of nuclear energy and a new, more balanced attitude to it."
"ALDE Group. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur for the excellent result, a well-balanced report."
"The main role of Euratom Supply Agency is to ensure equal access to and security of nuclear energy supply for all users within the European Union."
"Today, the Supply Agency operates on the basis of statutes adopted nearly 50 years ago."
"The challenges of life alongside the enlargement of the European Union, as well as the necessity for the Agency to adopt a modern financial attitude, have called for new statutes."
"The financial attitude of the new statutes is in compliance with the European Community's general financial framework and is also in line with the enlargement of the European Union."
"The discussions on the new statutes have not been easy in view of the composite nature of the Agency."
"It is obvious that the agency has actually acted as a Commission body, although, according to the Euratom Agreement, it was established as an agency with legal status and considerable financial independence."
"Otherwise it would not have needed statutes, which Commission bodies do not usually have."
"It is of great importance to certain Member States because of the type of activities it was expected to carry out."
"That is why it does not constitute a typical decentralised agency in an EU sense."
"I would like to express my joy at the fact that a consensus has been reached within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the number of members of the Agency's Advisory Committee."
"With due respect for the Commission, I would like to point out that the suggestion on limiting the Committee's influence and cutting the number of Committee members down to 42 was not very good, especially in view of the Commission's recommendations to establish such instruments, structures, as the Office of the Energy Observatory, with a view to creating efficient European Energy policy."
"The Committee shall assist the Agency in carrying out its tasks by giving opinions and providing information."
"It shall act as a link between the Agency and both producers and users in the nuclear industry."
"Because of its varied expertise the Committee could provide the Agency with unique support in the tasks assigned to it by the Treaty."
"I am in favour of not limiting the terms of office of members of the Advisory Committee."
"That way we will be able to achieve stability in the Committee and consistency in its competence."
"This amendment is of great importance to small countries, and here I am thinking of my country, Lithuania, and certain others, so I am in favour of it and welcome it."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I fully recognise that energy choices are matters to be decided by individual governments in Europe."
"However, I believe that the time has now come for the European Union, possibly via the Euratom Treaty, to set up an independent nuclear inspectorate in Europe, which would have the power to fully investigate safety standards at nuclear plants in Europe."
"That said, the British Government should map out a timetable for the orderly closure of the Sellafield nuclear plant, because of the history of serious safety deficiencies and system failures at this facility."
"The notorious B30 pond has been home to vast quantities of untreated radioactive materials since 1959, at the Sellafield nuclear plant."
"Even the British decommissioning authority is not aware as to the exact levels of untreated radioactive materials at this B30 plant."
"The British Government must spell out a detailed plan as to how it is going to decommission this radioactive dump, known as the B30 pond."
"Eighty-three thousand litres of radioactive materials which leaked from the THORP nuclear reprocessing facility in April 2005 has ensured that this plant has remained closed since that date."
"The British Government should now state that, due to the well-documented safety problems at the THORP plant, this facility should never be reopened."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, may thanks go to the rapporteur for a serious survey of this issue, although my Group disagrees with many aspects of the matter."
"For the Greens the entire Euratom Treaty is the bane of our lives, because it favours nuclear power over safer forms of energy."
"We could nevertheless accept the Statutes for the Euratom Supply Agency if they met three conditions: transparency, self-funding and independence of monitoring."
"Unfortunately, that is not the case."
"First of all the Supply Agency is financed by the taxpayer."
"This means hidden subsidies for nuclear power."
"Article 54 of the Euratom Treaty allows the Agency to collect funds when nuclear material is being sold by means of a charge."
"The Greens believe that self-funding should be made compulsory under the law."
"Secondly, independence of monitoring should be guaranteed."
"This proposal would result in a situation where the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport is both promoting the use of nuclear energy and monitoring it, which is not right, especially as at international level the International Atomic Energy Agency also has an inconsistent role as a monitoring body for nuclear safety and one that promotes nuclear power."
"Thirdly, the structure of the Supply Agency's Advisory Committee is distorted, having a disproportionately large share of countries producing nuclear power on it, something which will be made worse by the amendment adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"Because of these drawbacks we unfortunately cannot support this proposal."
"(SK) I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Cizelj, for her excellent and inspiring report."
"The adverse energy situation in the world, the EU's high dependence on energy imports and the rise in greenhouse gas emissions all mean that nuclear energy, despite its many ideological opponents, is receiving more attention at EU level and has already become an integral part of the energy mix of some European countries."
"In this context the Euratom Supply Agency has to face these challenges with a view to offering its customers comprehensive and effective services with a high degree of flexibility and access to supply sources."
"Allow me to touch briefly on three aspects that are fundamental to the fulfilment of this Agency's mandate."
"First of all, I would like to mention the Agency's tasks."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur that its tasks should be more clearly defined, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the objectives of a common policy on security of supply of nuclear materials in a renewed energy context."
"My second point relates to the Agency itself."
"The new Agency Statutes proposed by the Commission seem at first glance to be sufficiently effective with regard to both the organisational structure, for example the reduction in the number of members of the Advisory Committee, and the budget."
"Taking into account, however, the Agency's overall role, it should maintain a high level of competences in order to perform its mission in monitoring evaluations, proposing recommendations and conducting specific market studies."
"The Agency should have staff with a high level of expertise from the industry at its disposal, with broad experience of the market and fuel cycle operations."
"In the area of inter-institutional relationships the European Parliament should receive on a regular basis any important reports from the Agency, which would also increase the transparency of its activities and budget."
"The third point concerns the transparency surrounding the financing of the Agency."
"Despite the fact that the Agency was established on the basis of the Euratom Treaty, as a legal entity with a high degree of financial autonomy, its relationship to the Commission creates a complex and opaque financial mechanism, allowing only limited access to financial information."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, once again I would like to thank the rapporteur for the useful work done."
"I also thank you all for the debate, which shows and confirms that there is a need for the modernisation of the Statues of the Euratom Supply Agency."
"We adopted the proposal on the Statutes of the Agency in the spring of this year."
"Your report will enrich the initial proposal of the Commission."
"For this reason, I can assure you that, during the final discussion in the Council, the Commission will support most of the amendments tabled by Parliament."
"Once again, I thank you for your support and your attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their families to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the Application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their families to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, we followed very closely the evolution of the situation in Italy."
"We are worried about the growing street crime and wish to express, first of all, our sympathy to the families of individuals who have been victims of criminal activities."
"We welcome the bilateral cooperation measures announced last week by the prime ministers of Italy and Romania."
"We will ensure that the rights of Romanians are respected, as all citizens' rights should be."
"Under the transitional arrangements to the complete opening of labour markets, Romanian nationals must apply for job permits in certain Member States."
"We will make sure that Member States observe the principle of non-discrimination in their national legislation and administrative practice."
"The Free Movement Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC, allows for the expulsion of European citizens when an individual represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society."
"This is a decision to be made on a case-by-case basis and in the full respect of the guarantees of substance and procedure."
"In cases of immediate expulsion, the urgency must be duly justified."
"Under the Directive, the host Member State may expel European citizens also if they no longer fulfil the conditions attached to their right of residence."
"Inactive Union citizens may be expelled if they become an unreasonable burden on its social assistance system; in other words, if they do not have legal financial means to guarantee proper daily living conditions."
"In this case, expulsion shall be based on objective elements and a ban on re-entry cannot be imposed."
"Expelling European citizens is an extreme measure."
"It is a limitation of one of the basic freedoms of the Treaty."
"Measures should be taken to strike the right balance between the right to free movement and the duty of each Member State to react in the interests of honest citizens when the legal conditions to stay are not fulfilled."
"The Italian authorities officially notified the Commission of the text of the decree on 7 November 2007."
"The decree must be adopted by the Italian Parliament within 60 days."
"As you know, the Italian Parliament has the power to change the text of the decree."
"The position of the Commission on the Italian legislation transposing Directive 2004/38/EC will, of course, depend on the final version of the law as it emerges from the Italian Parliament."
"The decree entered into force immediately, but the Directive is sufficiently precise in its terms to be directly applicable by national courts."
"This means that if a Union citizen considers that the individual expulsion measure taken against him or her does not respect the guarantees laid down in the Directive, he or she can appeal before the national courts."
"In case of doubt on the application of European law, as you know perfectly well, national courts are obliged to refer the issue to the European Court of Justice."
"We will continue to monitor the situation, pending the examination of the decree by the Italian Parliament."
"We are also worried about some racist and xenophobic demonstrations that have accompanied the introduction of the decree in Italy."
"Roma groups are the largest minority in Europe."
"Roma communities throughout Europe face difficult conditions."
"There is a long past of persecution."
"This situation leads to human suffering and social tension."
"Inclusion requires efforts by everyone concerned, including the Roma themselves."
"Specific protection must be given to individuals, children and women especially."
"Criminals of whatever nationality very often exploit particularly vulnerable people such as children."
"Roma children face double discrimination."
"Firstly, they are victims of stereotypes and prejudice."
"But also they may face violations of their fundamental rights, even from within their communities."
"We see, too often, neglected Roma children on our streets or living in poor, often tolerated conditions in modern European favelas."
"Children may be brought into a life of crime or forced to beg."
"Roma schoolchildren tend to leave school early without qualifications for the future or skills to care for themselves and their families."
"If we only look at a group when we consider how to protect fundamental rights, then we risk missing the protection of individuals within that group and we miss the opportunity to break the circle of wrongdoing and fear."
"We are ready to assist Italy and Romania in making the best possible use of all possibilities already existing under European law and under European funds."
"It should be also stressed that Roma communities live in many other Member States such as France, Ireland, Spain, Slovakia, the Czech Republic or Hungary."
"The social inclusion of Roma communities can also be further improved in these Member States, notably through the structural funds, which can be quite helpful."
"European funding, specifically targeted at the needs of Roma communities, is already available in areas such as social inclusion, the fight against discrimination, regional development and education."
"In the previous programming period, the structural funds made available more than EUR 275 million for Roma-related projects."
"An additional EUR 60 million was made available to Romania and Bulgaria between 2004 and 2006, under the pre-accession instruments."
"The funding of Roma-related projects will continue in the structural fund programming period 2007-2013."
"The European Racial Equality Directive (2000/43/EC), which covers Roma people, provides for protection against discrimination in employment, education, social security, health care, goods and services, and housing."
"We are actively ensuring that this legislation is applied across the EU."
"Finally, as much as the Commission is not prepared to tolerate any form of discrimination or intolerance of its citizens, we equally will support Member States who lawfully protect their citizens from criminality, whether they are nationals or citizens of the Union in general."
"After all, freedom, justice and security go hand in hand."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Frattini on his comprehensive report and on the proposals, ideas, content and values defended in his speech."
"Certainly the reunification of Europe has led to the growing movement of citizens within the Union, which in some cases has transformed into a real migratory phenomenon."
"This is the case in Italy, where today there are around half a million Romanian citizens."
"The EU has tried, with Directive 2004/38/EC, to guarantee respect for both the rights of Community citizens who emigrate from one country to another, and the right of the Member States to expel EU citizens who do not obey certain rules: I am referring to the ability to support themselves and to the risks to public policy and safety."
"The result? A failure to expel many citizens who, if deported, perhaps would not have committed crimes in Italy."
"Unfortunately, crimes have been committed which have shaken public opinion, committed by people with a European passport."
"The reaction has been one of unacceptable xenophobic violence."
"The violence and murders committed in Italy must be strongly condemned and solidarity shown for the victims' families."
"The violent and xenophobic reaction must also be condemned, although unfortunately, when the rules are not applied, when the laws are not enforced, citizens risk dispensing justice themselves, and this is quite frankly unacceptable."
"Member States have very clear responsibilities, as do local authorities."
"In Rome, despite numerous reports, unfortunately no action has been taken in response to certain social situations, such as the slums inhabited by Roma citizens."
"These are situations where quick action should have been taken."
"Sometimes belated measures do nothing to solve problems that have blown up."
"We are not in favour of mass expulsions."
"Every citizen who commits a crime is personally accountable."
"It is not a question of nationality or of belonging to a particular ethnic group."
"Further collaboration between Romania and Italy would of course be useful."
"It is no accident that the PPE text was signed by me and by my colleague Mr Marinescu."
"This is a question that specifically concerns the Roma people."
"It does not concern Romanian citizens and this is why we are asking for a specific agency be set up for the social integration of the Roma communities, a European agency to show that Europe is doing its part to solve a problem that otherwise risks instigating even greater social panic."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in a very difficult situation."
"It is difficult because the events that have transpired in Rome merely bring to the surface something that we have not seen until now, or did not wish to see."
"The murder that occurred there was a profoundly condemnable, abhorrent act."
"The reactions unleashed by this murder are alarming."
"However, the fact that a single offender who commits a criminal act is embedded in his judgment as part of a large group of people who, so to speak, are held collectively responsible for the acts of one individual, is nothing new in the history of humanity - it has always occurred - but it is always equally condemnable."
"Therefore, the first thing we must do is to differentiate."
"We must look very carefully."
"It is all true: integration of the Roma into our society has not been working for a very long time."
"This is also linked to the fact that there is very little commitment to integrating the Roma into our society."
"They are a difficult people, with their own autonomous culture, and it requires a great deal of effort to integrate them, but it can be done."
"It can be done if we respect them and their culture."
"Nevertheless, it must be made clear that a state under the rule of law must be able to ensure its survival by all constitutional means."
"A state under the rule of law must use every means at its disposal to maintain public safety and preserve order."
"What is the best way to do this?"
"The best way is not to generalise but to assess each individual case, and that is exactly what must happen in Europe."
"When it comes to freedom of movement, we have to check, in each individual case, what right a citizen of the Union has gained and, when he moves from one country to another, what rights form the basis of the way he should be treated."
"In the European Union, we guarantee freedom of movement."
"All citizens of European states - at least, those which are part of the Schengen area - enjoy this integral freedom of movement."
"This does not mean that they can do what they like when they move from one state to another."
"They must respect the rights and laws there; but, conversely, the state that belongs to the Schengen area must also respect the rights of the citizen of the Union on its territory."
"It is not possible to say in a general way' 'it is this group's fault, and this group has to go, because none of its members have work permits, or because they do not fit in with our idea of our culture, or because they are all unemployed, or because they are begging'."
"Instead, in each and every case, we must ascertain what rights a citizen has, just as in each and every case it is ascertained what rights he has violated."
"This is precisely the task that the Italian and Romanian Governments are now undertaking, and that the Commission must also undertake."
"Here I must say, Commissioner Frattini, that you are not doing justice to your role."
"I was extremely surprised to read your remarks in Il Messaggero."
"Until then, I had the impression that you were a very moderate Commissioner."
"You won the respect of my group because you had hitherto worked very sensitively in what is a sensitive area of politics."
"However, the remarks that you made in Il Messaggero regarding work permits and people's income structure - suggesting that it was possible simply to go into a camp, ask someone how they earned a living and, if they could not explain on the spot what they lived off, deport them - are reminiscent of a totally arbitrary state."
"We do not live in such a state, however."
"It is your task, Commissioner Frattini - especially as the Commissioner responsible for human rights - to defend the principles of the European Union and not to promote yourself again as a minister in a future Italian Government when required."
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, most of us recognise the benefits of migration."
"The Member States which have opened their borders to migrants from other Member States have not seen a rise in unemployment; rather, they have seen a growth in productivity, a rise in economic growth and the creation of new jobs."
"It is the old, old story."
"The incomers do jobs that the natives do not want to do, they work hard, they cost little and they bring new ideas."
"But it is important to recognise that some people cross borders not wishing to work - or at least not wishing to work legally."
"European Union law recognises this, as you have laid out, Commissioner."
"While giving the right to reside in other Member States, it allows the host state to limit the right of residence to three months if there is no means of subsistence and to terminate that right if there is a threat to public order."
"One of the great successes of our Union has been this right to move freely, now enjoyed by millions of citizens in their studies, in their working lives, in retirement."
"It is not without its challenges and, just as the Jews, a people lacking a homeland, were often unwelcome in ages past, so today the Roma, some nine million people, are discriminated against in many host countries."
"Yet to equate the Roma people with the country of Romania, even if many of them are Romanian citizens, is to misunderstand the nature of both."
"You might as well equate them with the city of Roma."
"European Union funds have been made available for the integration of the Roma."
"We are working with George Soros and his Decade of Roma Inclusion."
"But we need all Member States to sign up to that and a common Community framework strategy for Roma inclusion if this is to work."
"It is a pity that Italy did not draw down any of these funds."
"Spain drew down some EUR 52 million and Poland some EUR 8 million."
"But it is not only a lack of foresight on the part of the Italian Government; it is also matched by a lack of foresight on the part of the Commission."
"I think Mr Barroso was wrong when he said in his interview in La Repubblica yesterday that it is inconceivable that European Union authorities should promote integration on the ground."
"It should not be inconceivable."
"I share, Mr Frattini, the views of Mr Schulz."
"You should not be playing party politics in this matter."
"This House demands that you concentrate on your current responsibilities, not on your possible future career."
"Italians know as well as others the vulnerability of migrant communities."
"In 1893, at Aigues-Mortes in France, Italian salt workers in the Peccais were lynched in xenophobic attacks about the protection of local jobs."
"But one of the great achievements of the Union is that such pogroms are a piece of the past."
"Too often, nonetheless, democracies are run by crisis management."
"It is, perhaps, more evident in Italy than elsewhere."
"But if there are problems in Italy, there will be problems in other countries too."
"If the right of residence abroad is an EU right, we cannot allow Member States to rewrite the exceptional provisions, as the Italian Government has done in its decree."
"There is nothing to stop a country giving powers to prefects to deal with it as long as there is a right of appeal."
"An appeal to a justice of the peace who is not a legal expert is insufficient, just as is the use only of Italian or English in legal documents."
"But I trust the Italian Parliament will correct these provisions and ensure consistency of the national legislation with EU provisions."
"For us, this is the first real case of the European Parliament overseeing the application of justice and home affairs legislation, together with national parliaments."
"We need to look not only at what does not work, but at what does work, and we need your active commitment, Commissioner, in that task."
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Commissioner Frattini for his detailed report this afternoon."
"In my opinion, Directive 2004/38/EC is a valid point of reference, guaranteeing full affirmation of the right of movement of EU citizens, avoiding any form of discrimination and establishing the principle of full integration."
"This directive is essentially concerned with protecting the rights of someone residing in a Member State, as well as the rights of citizens of that Member State, in keeping with the principle of reciprocity."
"It offers maximum protection for people working, studying and wanting to become integrated, but comes down hard on those people who break the rules."
"It is on this latter point that Parliament must have a real discussion."
"Not only are there rights, there are also duties and rules which must be respected."
"We cannot continue to ignore the fact that there is a percentage - no doubt an absolute minority, but this percentage does exist - of people who travel to other Member States and who have no intention of reporting their presence to the host Member States, simply because they do not want to be officially recognised, because they have no intention of abiding by the laws and working legally."
"We need to address properly the problem of who moves to and who enters a Member State, intent on remaining on the fringes of society."
"No doubt the tools can be improved, but some of them are already available to the Member States under Directive 2004/38/EC."
"This is why first we must call for the prompt, full, thorough and concrete application of the Directive in each Member State."
"Perhaps it might also be worth refining the Directive, not only imposing an obligation on visitors to declare their presence in the territory of the host Member State on certain terms, but an obligation on the Member State to impose sanctions on anyone who does not abide by the rules."
"In Italy for example, the decree implementing the directive sets forth certain terms and conditions, but it does not provide any sanctions, so the law is in fact completely ineffectual."
"Above all, we need to make sure that immigrants are escorted back to their own country, obviously in cases where there are genuine reasons for doing so."
"However, I should point out that anyone who commits a crime, anyone who violates human rights, because this is also important, who exploits children, who exploits women or who represents a threat to public safety, must be removed and returned in no uncertain terms to the authorities in his or her country of origin."
"We also need laws for people who do not work, for people who have a hand-to-mouth existence and who can thus represent an excessive burden for the community of the host Member State."
"I would like to finish by mentioning the Roma children and making the case for Italy."
"There are around 50,000 children, or rather at least 50,000 exploited children in Italy."
"They are of Roma origin, they are forced to beg, they are not vaccinated, they do not go to school and they live in absolutely deplorable sanitary conditions."
"I would like to remind everyone that around a week before Mrs Reggiani was killed in Rome, in the same shanty town as the one in which Mrs Reggiani's killer lived, a two-month-old Roma child died of cold."
"This was in Rome, one of Europe's foremost capital cities."
"Therefore, I will finish by asking, is this truly integration?"
"Is this respect for human rights?"
"We have a duty to ask serious questions without hypocrisy and we have a duty to say that everyone is equal before the law."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 2 November Mr Frattini said that 'What has to be done is simple: go into a travellers' camp in Rome for example, and ask them: 'Can you tell me where you live?'"
"If they say they do not know, take them and send them home to Romania'."
"That is how the European directive works, plain and simple, and we need to pull down the travellers' camps immediately."
"You also said that the UK, France and Germany habitually expel citizens who are out of work, that Italy does not do this and that therefore it has failed to implement Directive 2004/38/EC properly."
"I am speaking to you as Co-president of a European political group and I am addressing you as a European Commissioner, therefore we must absolutely leave aside the fact that in Italy, we probably campaign in different coalitions, but here we are acting and should act as Europeans."
"I think that the statements you made to Il Messaggero are unacceptable and furthermore are in complete contradiction with what you said here to us last night."
"Which of the two Frattinis is the real one?"
"The one who said that we needed to pull down Roma camps or the one who said, as the directive quite rightly says, that citizens can be expelled based on precise rules and even more precise guarantees?"
"I would really appreciate an answer to this question."
"With regard to the question of other European Member States, I would be grateful if you could explain the situation to me."
"We have made a few inquiries and have discovered that none of the countries mentioned - the UK, France or Germany - has ever deported European citizens for economic reasons, which in any case is prohibited by the directive, and that no citizen has ever been found to be an excessive burden for the economy of the countries of residence."
"Therefore, I would like to know whether you knew about this, because it seems to be crucial information."
"I fully support the fact that this directive provides a precise framework."
"However, I think that it could have been even more precise and better done, and I am even of the opinion that the case or cases that we are discussing today are symbolic of the way in which the directive must be applied and how the Member States perceive and see enlargement and freedom of movement, which is an absolute priority for us."
"May I just say, Mr President, Mr Tajani and Mrs Angelilli, that a country where the mafia has a business of around EUR 90 billion and where events take place such as those of recent days can teach us very little on the subject of immigration."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our discussion here is not about Italy or Romania, it is about Europe and the life of its citizens: a woman was killed, and our thoughts and sympathies must go to her family;"
"These tragedies have taught us the importance of laws that sanction rights: there is no safety without the law."
"This is how important our laws are, our treaties are, even our economic regulations, which sanction the value and right of mobility and residence, which are the legitimate rights of European citizens, and not concessions, which can be regulated but not denied."
"European laws are clear: everyone has the right to mobility and residence, with removal only in extreme cases where national security is at stake."
"Expulsion is strictly individual and never collective, and is accompanied by the guaranteed right to a defence."
"These are proportional measures that always allow for the continued right of mobility, a right that will never be denied for economic reasons, because poverty cannot be a stigma or a reason to discriminate against citizens."
"This is what Article 27 of the directive says, it is the law."
"It is all the more sacred because it concerns rights."
"The law applies to everyone, not least of all to Commissioners - and I must say Mr Frattini that in your numerous statements here in Parliament, I have had great trouble in finding the spirit and the letter of the law, in fact I cannot seem to find either of these - and to the Member States, who must transpose their membership of Europe and its directives for all of us."
"There are still too many people dying in Europe today."
"In Italy, a woman died from a violent attack by a Romanian man."
"This is extremely distressing to me."
"Anyone guilty of murder has to pay the price, but that has nothing to do with Roma or Romanian citizens, who have seen some of their own people unfairly attacked."
"Blame is individual, never collective."
"So many migrants die trying to get to Europe."
"These people are overwhelmed and are calling on us to act."
"This suffering is why we must make Europe a land of the law and of rights, of sacred laws, particularly when we talk about reception."
"These laws form the basis of security."
"We want this to be solemnly reaffirmed in Parliament with a vote so that there can be no more misinterpretation of our European laws."
"In accordance with our rules of procedure, I would like to ask Members who are speaking not to quote other Members, for the simple reason that under the rules they could ask to speak later."
"Therefore, to allow the debate to run smoothly, I would ask everyone to address Parliament in general, citing the facts; clearly this does not apply to the Commissioner, who will be fully entitled to explain his reasons at the end of the debate."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, my friends in the new NIP Party in Romania were furious when they learned about the expulsion of thousands of Romanians from Italy."
"I understand them fully."
"I phoned Commissioner Frattini, who assured me that no Romanian would be expelled without having met a judge."
"There was a derogation, however: when people, after staying for three months, have no money to live on, they can be expelled without a decision from a judge."
"I agree with this procedure if it is administered in good faith."
"Free movement does not include a right to receive financial support from the state you visit."
"You should be able to live on your own budget or have a job."
"Criminals may also be expelled if it is decided by a judge, but it is not up to the police to decide who are criminals."
"For such decisions, we must have independent judges."
"I hope my friends in the Italian Government agree with this fundamental principle of the European Union."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Frattini for being here again, for his commitment and for making himself available to us."
"You are an asset to your country."
"It is a shame that I cannot say the same of other Italian representatives and I do not like this."
"We have discussed - and are still discussing - the Schengen Agreement."
"Despite all the social unrest that the free movement of citizens within the EU is undoubtedly causing in Italy, Mr Amato has decided that it would be a good idea to focus on other issues."
"Something needs to be done to prevent this social unrest from reaching the levels witnessed in our country."
"However, it does not appear that anything is being done, given the rising crime rate at all levels in Italy, ranging from anti-social behaviour to organised crime, not to mention the steady inflow of illegal immigrants into our country, and above all the fact that some people who come to Italy with study, work or tourist visas are not returning to their own countries when these expire."
"This last point has not been widely covered by the media."
"Furthermore, the current Italian administration and the Minister of the Interior seem to be unaware of the crime committed in Italy largely by foreigners, some of whom are European citizens, travellers or people who call themselves this."
"This was highlighted a few months ago in the report by the Italian Prefect Mr Serra to the Italian Parliament."
"The Italian government is becoming an embarrassment to an increasingly tired nation, and they are not alone."
"This government, which is as incapable of understanding social unrest as it is of preventing it, cannot conceive of addressing the problem."
"It does not occur to it - and one wonders how it could - to admit the failings of current migration policies or the lack of application of European directives, in this case Directive 2004/38/EC."
"On this subject, the Italian government complains of having difficulty in identifying the exact date of entry."
"It is clear that under the Schengen Agreement, these difficulties are growing out of all proportion. It is also obvious that my party and I would like to revoke the Schengen Agreement."
"Even the repeated acts of political hooliganism in Italy in recent months, suffered in many cases by my party, perpetrated by the followers of anarchic and boorish communism protected by representatives of the institutional left, are still being ignored by Mr Amato."
"Unfortunately, Mr Amato and President Prodi, like so many mayors, not least of all Rome's, do not live in working-class areas, they have no contact with travellers' camps - legal or otherwise - and they do not use public transport or experience the bullying, violence and prevarication that even EU visitors face in Italy on a regular basis."
"These irresponsible politicians talk about solidarity, in whose name an entire population is made to suffer their foolish decisions."
"The European Union, rather than lament the fact that Italy has not asked for funding, should take note of what President Barroso said, in other words that if a Member State allows slums to develop on its territory, what can it expect the Commission to do?"
"Mr Amato chooses to be absent from meetings on the subject."
"Meanwhile, Italians would like to do the only right thing: start voting and tell the government to go to hell."
"(RO) The European Union is a community of values in which respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms prevails and its policies include the security of citizens and the fight against criminality, as well as the protection of children and the fight against instigation to violence."
"I firmly condemn violence and offences and I deeply regret what happened in Italy!"
"But I believe that the abuses and injustice committed in the name of the law are unacceptable, induce fear and humiliation and may instigate hatred within human communities."
"I have discovered a tendency to escalate this situation unjustifiably, also fueled by political and xenophobic statements uttered by certain politicians."
"I am worried by the fact that, according to the information published so far, only Romanian citizens have been expelled from Italy."
"All the Member States have the right and obligation to draw up legislative acts that would ensure and consolidate public order and safety."
"All the European citizens, whatever their nationality, have the obligation to comply with the law and its provisions, wherever they are on the territory of the European Union."
"Yet, at the same time, we have to condemn intolerance and xenophobia and, especially, the unjustified expansion of hard feelings and stigmatization from a few individuals, who are on bad terms with the law, to an entire ethnic group or, more seriously, to an entire nation."
"I believe the Italian State, just like all the other Member States of the European Union, has the duty to protect the rights and liberties of the European citizens residing on its territory, who integrate into the community and obey the laws."
"A common European approach of the policies of immigration and integration of minorities is required."
"The issue of minorities and, especially, of the Roma minority, is a European issue and it should be approached in a coherent and unitary manner, not only in moments of crisis."
"All the relevant bodies should cooperate, first of all the European Commission and the Agency for Fundamental Rights, as well as the relevant institutions in the Member States."
"I call upon the European Commission to review the priorities and mechanisms of the European Social Fund in order to extend the financing of common actions, which would contribute to the social inclusion of the Roma minority."
"At the same time, I ask the European Commission to urgently examine compliance of the decree law, issued by the Italian authorities, with the European legislation and to give assurance that the implementation of any provisions of this type shall not lead to abuses against honest people, irrespective of their nationality."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is right that our Parliament should send the family of Mrs Reggiani a message of condolence."
"I would also like to censure the recent statements by Mr Frattini, who in interviews referred to earlier confused his role as representative of the Commission with that of a member of the opposition, denying Mr Tajani this pleasure, when he would have been better to use his prestigious role to brighten the national political climate."
"It pains me to say it, because we have often supported Mr Frattini's proposals and initiatives."
"Mr Frattini knows only too well that, as pointed out by some of my fellow Members, there is no European text that makes provision for the automatic expulsion of citizens from other Member States on economic grounds."
"The recent provisions of the Italian government are in line with the European directive, respecting its spirit and strengthening certain aspects considered important in light of the situation in Italy."
"All Italian institutions - and I say this to Mr Tajani, to Mrs Angelilli and to other members of the opposition - from the City of Rome to regional authorities, right down to the smallest local council, are committed to this."
"It is undignified to sling mud at the degree of civilisation and integration that our country has achieved over the years."
"I hope that the European Parliament will reaffirm its refusal of the principle of collective responsibility, which is used to incite hatred and violence in the heart of Europe."
"What we need to affirm instead is the need to combat any form of racism and xenophobia, and any discrimination based on nationality and ethnic background."
"We have a road map for this: the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is important that we do our best, as the Italian and Romanian Prime Ministers have asked, to ensure better social integration of disadvantaged peoples and cooperation between Member States, both in terms of managing the movements of our own migratory flows and through social development and welfare programmes financed by the Structural Funds."
"What we need to do in future is simple: none of us must forget that immigration is a resource, it is part of our future, but it must be governed."
"I therefore propose that the Member States act now to establish closer European coordination to regulate migratory movements in the European Union."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for addressing Parliament on this very important issue."
"There has been a lot of emotion in Italy following the murder of an Italian woman by a Romanian citizen."
"There has equally been a lot of emotion in Romania following reprisals against Romanian citizens by Italian gangs."
"However, when we put away emotions, we get back to our basic values and principles: freedom of movement for all citizens, the rule of law and its conformity with European law."
"Let me remind you, should it be necessary, that freedom of movement for European citizens is a fundamental right enshrined in the founding Treaties."
"Unfortunately, these recent events have shown us that we need to make more effort to consolidate these rights and ensure they are enforced adequately throughout Europe."
"In today's Europe we cannot accept irresponsible authorities pointing fingers at specific nationalities or ethnic groups."
"Neither can we accept the claim that the free movement of workers might be a route to increasing criminality, because crime has neither nationality nor ethnicity."
"This attitude can only lead to dangerous developments and more xenophobia."
"On the contrary, I believe we must continue to encourage mobility of people and give workers the same opportunities all over Europe, to reinforce a strong European identity."
"This was the founding fathers' genuine wish for the creation of the European Union."
"While I reiterate that the European Union must ensure all its citizens live in an area of freedom, security and justice, I believe we should also pay more attention to integration and freedom of movement."
"The answer to crime is not closing borders."
"The answer to crime is not encouraging xenophobia, discrimination and stigmatisation of nationalities or ethnic origins."
"The answer, in a modern Europe, is more police and judicial cooperation, more integration policies, more resources for those called to serve and protect all our citizens, whatever their nationality."
"I would like to see a Europe where all citizens can live, work and circulate freely."
"The European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, must now ensure that these basic rights are correctly implemented and enforced."
"I call on the Commission to stand firm on these principles."
"Mr President, the situation of the Roma in Europe is getting worse."
"The developments in Italy prove that to us."
"We have all seen that unchallenged xenophobic and racist hysteria can overcome common sense."
"The crime of one single person has fuelled an unprecedented media lynching."
"This moved us towards restrictions on the fundamental rights of European citizens based on popular racist and xenophobic hysteria."
"We must not let that happen."
"Criminal issues are for the judges to deal with, not for politicians or civilians."
"However horrible and condemnable the crime that took place in Rome is, it should not lead us to collective responsibility of a whole nation."
"The events in Italy did uncover the reality of the campo nomadi, in which so many Roma live."
"The fact that tensions and instability arise from such situations is not questionable."
"That is why we must act."
"My first assistant is a Roma."
"Integration can proceed quickly."
"In 2005 we adopted a resolution that asked for concerted EU and national action for speeding up the inclusion of Roma."
"Therefore, I propose that we, as MEPs, show that we care, and urge decision-makers to join us."
"I propose that the EP establish a permanent European Parliament rapporteur on Roma issues, who would monitor the situation of the Roma in Europe and come annually with recommendations to the Commission and governments."
"In addition, we should call upon the Commission to establish an EU Roma inclusion fund, together with an EU strategy for Roma inclusion and a Roma unit within the European Commission."
"This will ensure proper management of the EU Roma inclusion policies."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of the brutal murder by a Romanian citizen of Giovanna Reggiani, whose family is offered our heartfelt condolences, many political groups in Italy have pointed the finger at Europe."
"However, what happened is not due to enlargement, Schengen or other European directives on free movement within the European Union."
"These are age-old problems that deserve a less superficial approach and which cannot be addressed with a decree rushed through Parliament to satisfy public opinion."
"For this very reason, we need to be more attentive and re-examine the entire matter within a framework of legality, unfettered by emotions or urgent demands."
"The rule of law requires that criminal responsibility should be individual and not collective."
"To deviate from this principle would set a dangerous precedent that could lead to the criminalisation of certain migrant nationalities."
"The potential effects that this might have are worrying."
"In Italy, we have seen a witch-hunt culture emerge towards Romanian and Roma citizens, with many punitive expeditions: even children in schools have been the subject of scorn and mistreatment."
"The issue of security is clearly legitimate, but we cannot fall into the trap of polemics and exploitation deliberately designed to fuel hatred and xenophobia merely for partisan reasons."
"If objectivity could be restored to Italian politics, the public would learn that Italy was not overcrowded with delinquent migrants."
"Immigration is certainly a subject that requires European coordination, but we cannot use Europe simply to limit the freedom of movement of migrants."
"Mr Frattini's actions should be condemned."
"He has used this opportunity to join the national polemic expressing opinions contrary to European directives."
"It would have been better if the Commissioner had proposed a series of integration policies, for example based on the increased resources from the Integration Funds and the need to free national reception policies from the constraints of the Stability Pact, as has already been done for security policy."
"It is also important that we insist on coordination and reinforcement of judicial instruments and police powers to tackle organised crime and trafficking, an odious crime which has now reached the transnational level."
"The discussion of the application of Directive 2004/38/EC is the right sphere in which to have a debate on the expulsion of Romanian citizens in its proper legislative setting; it is an opportunity to confirm how the free movement of Romanian citizens is an inalienable right of European citizenship."
"The directive is clear: people cannot be removed as a preventive measure, but personal accountability must be assessed, and this information should be used as a starting point so that government decrees can remain in line with the pro-European tradition of our country."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the courage and consistency that brooks no hypocrisy, which unfortunately often prevails in our institutions and which to a certain extent we have also heard here today."
"Mr Guidoni, the decree you are attacking is a decree of your own government, so we need some clarification here."
"The distressing events in Italy, and in Rome in particular, are only the latest in a series of incidents that have often gone unheeded or have been ignored."
"Europe is founded on the principles of freedom and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms."
"The Italian people have always shown that they support inalienable values such as non-discrimination, equality between peoples and democracy."
"However, I believe it is only right to add, using the information from the official Caritas report produced in cooperation with the Italian Ministry of the Interior and which paints a fairly serious picture, that this has been happening since 1 January 2007, following the migration of Romanian citizens to Italy on an unprecedented scale in the EU."
"I hate to say it, but we only need to run through a few of the figures to see the absurdity of the situation."
"In 2006 alone, 17,900 Romanians were arrested in Italy."
"This is not the fault of an entire people, it is the fault of individuals."
"However, we need to reflect and the question automatically arises: why did the Italian government not ratify the decree transposing Directive 2004/38/EC sooner?"
"Furthermore, why does the decree not implement the provisions of the directive relating to residence after a period of three months?"
"Why did the Ministry of the Interior fail to provide adequate measures for application in relation to the conditions and requirements to be satisfied and the checks and controls and possible repatriation of EU citizens guilty of not respecting the imperative conditions provided by the directive?"
"This laxity has caused a culture of permissiveness which is beyond understanding."
"It has resulted in the indiscriminate arrival of indigent people, fuelling each day the sense of despair that exists and leading people to the inevitable short cut of breaking the law."
"For example, the Mayor of Rome tolerated the establishment of around a hundred Roma camps and shanty towns, where the most elementary human rights were compromised and where hygiene and personal dignity were completely ignored, before then deciding to dismantle them."
"It was an act of thoughtlessness for which we are still paying today."
"We are in favour of solidarity and reception, but this has to be in accordance with the law, guided by the certainty of the law and public policy."
"Mr President, today I will try to forget that I am a Romanian."
"I will try to forget, even if people are deported, attacked and killed within the borders of the European Union, simply because they are guilty of being Romanian either ethnically or by citizenship."
"Today, I shall try to think as an Italian and as a European."
"If I were Italian, I would think that I should have the right to feel secure in the country of my ancestors."
"I would have been outraged by the miserable camps of miserable people around my country's wonderful towns."
"I would have been disgusted to see an increasing number of criminals threatening the peaceful life of my compatriots."
"But, while looking for my security, I would realise that this is consolidated daily by the creative work of more than one million immigrants who are producing Italian goods, offering services in areas left by Italian labour, buying Italian merchandise and paying taxes to the Italian authorities."
"On the contrary, I would feel that my security would be weakened if those non-Italian residents left my country, if their human rights were violated and if they became the subject of xenophobic practices."
"If the basic rights of a single human being are violated by my country's authorities, who try to hide their weaknesses by intensifying the law behind racist concepts, xenophobic excuses and discriminatory measures, my own rights - and, moreover, everybody's rights - are in jeopardy."
"It is not the first time that security has been set against democratic and humanitarian values, when some believe that fewer human and civil rights mean more security, when insecure people look for refuge within their national community, wrongly thinking that ethnic similarity brings better protection."
"This is false."
"An ordinary crime has one or several victims."
"Racism is also a crime, but it is an extraordinary crime and everybody, including the criminal, is a victim of racism and xenophobia."
"Racism and racial rule are therefore sources of insecurity."
"As a European democrat, I cannot possibly accept that diversity means more insecurity or that some criminals should be socially integrated while others should be excluded."
"Some have the right to defence and others do not."
"Some are given the benefit of the doubt and others are not, depending on their national or ethnic origin."
"As a European, I would not allow one of the Member States - say, Romania - to become a ghetto for the Roma or a European Union Siberia where undesirable European citizens are deported."
"I can understand that the extreme right is xenophobic, but I cannot understand when the democrats resort to xenophobic and racist speech."
"I cannot understand the weaknesses and demagogical racist speech of the democrats, and I condemn them more than the extreme right for xenophobia."
"For all those reasons, we should now take alarm and mobilise."
"I hope that the European Parliament motion for a resolution to be adopted on this issue will bring us together in defending European values and the future of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the government of each Member State has the right and duty to clamp down on crime to ensure the safety of its citizens and of anyone living and working in the country."
"The debate that we are engaged in today must avoid the twofold temptation of emotiveness and instrumental political reaction."
"The preparation of a bill under the name of a 'security package' had been in the pipeline for some time in Italy."
"The dramatic events of last October persuaded the government to convert it into a decree-law, which immediately began to have an effect."
"There was nothing hasty or improvised about it, and in any case amendments will be tabled before Parliament, as we know."
"Let us look at the substance of the question and we will understand that the content of the decree is absolutely fair: it is a case of targeting those who threaten law and order with their conduct, comprising public safety and harming all those who come to Italy to improve their lives by working."
"This decree does not target everybody, but is in favour of people who come to Italy to be integrated in complete accordance with our laws and who in any case represent the vast majority."
"The presence in Italy, as in any other country, of people who do not abide by the rules, makes integration more difficult for others."
"What I mean is that a rejection mentality emerges which makes the integration process harder."
"Hence the prompt response of the Italian government, which has also been quick to avoid any instrumental political positions and dangerous signals, such as punitive expeditions or patrols that would send out a misleading or even perverse message to the public."
"Mr President, according to the Directive, and in compliance with the principle of non-discrimination, all Union citizens and their family members residing in a Member State should enjoy equal treatment."
"Alongside the right of freedom of movement, they are entitled to take up employment in the country of residence - regarded as related rights in Article 23 of the Directive."
"In this sense, the freedom of movement of workers is a fundamental right, complying with the idea of a united Europe, whose citizens can be freely employed everywhere."
"Unfortunately, this is not the case with the citizens of most of the new Member States, including Bulgaria and Romania, who are facing restrictions."
"After a public debate on whether Bulgaria will or will not apply the Community law in this field, and whether to undertake a reciprocal approach, it was decided not to do so and to abide by the common Community goals, so that the European Union could respond adequately to the contemporary global challenges."
"While saluting those Member States that have taken the same position so far, I call upon the other Member States to join in and take into consideration the fact that the transitional periods are obstacles to the development of a single European labour market and hamper its competitiveness."
"The analyses point out that the old Member States that have opened up their markets have received much more benefits than problems with the workers received."
"On the other hand, the new Member States already face serious shortages of qualified workers."
"The recent Eurostat survey published today indicates that there has not been large-scale migration of Bulgarians and Romanians after accession."
"The survey also shows that 80% of Bulgarians abroad are working, which is undoubtedly an employment quota a number of EU countries can only dream about."
"Despite the progress achieved so far, the freedom to move still lags far behind other European freedoms."
"The idea of EU citizenship is also distorted by creating first-, second- or third-class citizens, as we are witnessing in our debate today."
"A real transition from EU common market citizens to EU citizens with full rights and responsibilities should effectively take place as soon as possible, for the benefit of all of us."
"(HU) Thank you very much."
"Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, there are officially 560 thousand Romanian citizens living on the territory of Italy, but according to some estimates the number exceeds 1 million."
"A large part of them live in settlements on the outskirts of Rome, Turin, Milan and Naples."
"There are no excuses for the murder in Rome: if someone has committed a crime, he should answer to the court for his actions."
"However, as a liberal, I do not and cannot accept that a criminal of any nationality, belonging to any ethnic group, should serve as the basis for passing judgment on the whole of the given group, making room for violent acts of extreme force, the targets and victims of which are innocent people, as is demonstrated by the regrettable events that followed the murder."
"I would like to remind you that I spoke to Mr Rehn, the Commissioner for Enlargement, many times about the fact that the post-accession migration of people living in poor social conditions and in abject poverty in settlements in the two countries that acceded on 1 January 2007 might emerge as a serious problem in the Member States of the EU, precisely because of the lack of integration."
"The warning was not followed by serious measures during the accession negotiations."
"I would not even dare to estimate the number of Roma in Europe who are escaping from the new Member States to the Member States of Western and Northern Europe in the hope of a better life, expressing their dissatisfaction with the integration policy of the country they left."
"Similarly, in the period before the accession of these two countries, I raised the importance of preparing for migration problems related to this, and many of my fellow members rejected it, viewing it as a restriction of the freedom of movement."
"Our response to this might be: are we creating a government decree at an extraordinary session that forms a legal basis for expulsion?"
"Some serious concerns have emerged in connection with the constitutionality of the government decree and its relationship with international and EU law."
"I am also thinking of infringements of the Free Movement Directive and the Racial Equality Directive."
"Is this really how to face up to real problems?"
"The 27 countries of the EU cannot fall into a situation where we transfer the problems from one country to another within its borders."
"Allow me to read out just a few pieces of data that I read in a report by the European Commission and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"In 2002-2003, more than half the pupils in special schools in Slovakia were Roma."
"In Germany, only half of Roma children went to school, and 80% of those went to special institutions."
"In Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Bulgaria and Slovenia, Roma children are the majority of those attending special schools."
"In 2003, 80% of Roma in Slovakia did not have a registered place of work, 80% of them in Romania and Bulgaria have incomes below the national poverty threshold, and I could list ... (the President cut off the speaker) I could list more of these cases. Thank you."
"(NL) Mr President, I believe we readily agree that an effective approach to crime deserves our support, and of course there is never any excuse for murder, but I believe we also agree that the right to reside in the Schengen area is a great asset and is tangible proof of European citizenship."
"Anyone seeking to curtail it must be able to present very good arguments."
"In particular, we must also beware of collective arrangements in this context, as when one talks about collective arrangements, one soon finds oneself talking about one group, and at this time we happen to be talking about the Roma. I think this very unfortunate."
"I am pleased with Commissioner Frattini's remarks about the Roma and about the fact that the European Union could do more for this group, but I remain unhappy, of course, with his earlier remark about the Roma in connection with events in Italy."
"There is a good deal of talk today about the consequences of the migration that has been taking place since the enlargement of the European Union and that also took place previously within the enlarged Union, and of course there are consequences to contend with. I believe we must also look to some degree at the causes, however, and at ways in which we, the European Union, can do more for people travelling into the EU, as they are simply seeking better living conditions, employment, and better conditions for their families and children."
"I am very much in favour of making better use of European funds in order to do more for the Roma, particularly in the new Member States, but I should like to reiterate that in the past this Parliament has already called for recognition of the Roma as a European minority - that is, a very special group, not comparable with other minorities."
"Making the Roma a European minority would directly open up many more opportunities for the Union to do something about the problems."
"I would reiterate our appeal to give a single Member of the Commission responsibility for Roma policy, rather than the current situation, where various Commissioners deal with this area, with one coordinating."
"Competence must rest in one pair of hands."
"Finally, as far as discrimination and social exclusion are concerned, these have been priorities of this Parliament, including during negotiations with the new Member States."
"I am pointing the finger at the new Member States, but we know that there are also problems in the older ones."
"At that time, all kinds of agreements were made with the governments of the new Member States, but these are being implemented unsatisfactorily or not at all."
"I think that the European Union, the European Commission, must also play its part by revisiting the agreements made at the time of accession, particularly those concerning improving the situation of the Roma."
"The issues concerned here are discrimination and social exclusion."
"Hence our group's appeal to discuss this once more with these new Member States."
"We shall certainly be doing this ourselves, but this is also an appeal to the Council and particularly to the Commission: not only Commissioner Frattini, but also his colleagues."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that even on this occasion, I must use the customary sincerity and frankness in addressing this Parliament, towards which I harbour the utmost respect, although this does not preclude me from replying to statements and considerations which I do not share."
"I did not just start taking action and speaking out on this issue a few days ago."
"Many of you have recalled one or two lines from an interview I gave - one of many - on 2 November."
"I started taking a real interest in this question months and months ago."
"This was at the request of Italian mayors, who as we know belong to different political parties, most of them in the centre-left."
"At the conference of Italian mayors on 19 May, an important meeting which took place months ago - and considering how often I am quoted, I too keep a record - Italian mayors raised the issue of security in their cities with the Italian Minister of the Interior, blaming it on Europe."
"At the end of that meeting, Mr Amato said that it was a grave mistake to think that the issue of security was exclusively the problem of the wealthy who had something to protect, and that it was a phenomenon which, unless addressed, would turn neighbours into enemies."
"This led to the appeal to the European Commission issued that same day."
"On 23 June, at the General Assembly of the ANCI - which as Italian MEPs will know, is the Italian local authority association, presided over by the Mayor of Florence - the Roma reception plan was unveiled following a meeting which had taken place a few days before between local authority representatives and myself."
"At that meeting, which took place in Bari, the reception plan for the Roma people was unveiled and a request issued for European funding - which until then had not been requested by Italy - to cover the costs of the plan."
"Italian mayors agreed that the integration system should be based on values of reciprocity, arguing that we had a duty to welcome and integrate immigrants provided that they accepted the rules of our country."
"This was the position I adopted for months and months, ever since the start of the summer in fact, until an event promoted by the Mayors of Bologna and Florence led to a national campaign against people who clean car windscreens."
"The Mayor of Florence - who clearly you know, he is not someone who can be suspected of having racist sympathies - even proposed criminalising homeless people who clean car windscreens."
"I met with the mayors again, and then on 25 October, a few weeks ago, a memo from an Italian agency, after yet another meeting, said that 'the mayors do not agree, they want new laws immediately and are claiming that people do not understand the divisions that are forming within the majority."
"These statements included an appeal from Italian mayors and from the Italian Minister of the Interior to me, because at that time no one thought that Europe had any tools like those subsequently adopted with the decree-law to tackle situations where there was a clear violation of Directive 2004/38/EC."
"This is why I started taking an interest in this subject, and to all those who took the floor to criticise me, I say this: I do not think that you will find a single time when I did not make a positive and honest contribution and cooperate with Mr Amato, who is responsible for this matter in Italy."
"I challenge you to prove otherwise, that I refused to collaborate when asked to do so by Mr Amato and that I did not respond to requests that the Italian government legitimately made to Europe, as happened a few days ago."
"A few weeks after these events, the first figures were released - I remember it well because, as a member of the European Commission, I received protests from Bucharest - by the Mayor of Rome, claiming that Romanians were responsible for 75% of crimes committed in Italy, when in actual fact it was 75% of crimes committed by foreigners, and so a much lower percentage."
"Many of you will remember that people took to the streets in Bucharest to protest against these statements, yet despite this, I was still holding talks with the Mayor of Rome, offering him the resources of the European Social Fund."
"He sent me a letter, which is clearly on the record, asking for help and support from Europe in the form of integration measures."
"I considered that this was my duty and I did this."
"To conclude, I do not think that anyone in Parliament can be in any doubt over the fact that, apart from what some of you have decided to raise here today, which is just one aspect of a particular interview, I trust that none of you can overlook what I have achieved over the years."
"I have worked and I still am working to ensure that the Schengen area is extended before Christmas to include the nine new Member States."
"What is this if it does not make freedom of movement more effective?"
"If this happens, it will be partly down to my efforts."
"I have been working on this for the past two and a half years and have never been afraid to say that the right of free movement is one of the pillars of the European Union."
"I cannot believe that anyone can criticise me for being someone who does not want this right to be recognised."
"A final word on the subject of Romania: I have listened to the Romanian MPs."
"They more than anyone else know what I personally have done to help Romania join the EU, with reports, with advice, with the visits I have made."
"Well, I do not think that anyone in Parliament can suspect even for a moment that I do not have, for Romania and for the Romanian people - not Romanian criminals, who I regard in the same way as Italian criminals - the utmost respect and deepest friendship, or I would not have done everything I have done over the last two years."
"I do not think that extrapolating a single sentence from an interview can change these facts."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) International public opinion has been shaken by the recent tragic events in Rome."
"I think it is unfortunate that some political groups are clumsily trying to exploit this situation for political ends, sometimes by evoking a dangerous and counter-productive return to the past."
"European legislation establishes certain benchmarks that must be respected in all 27 Member States, bearing in mind that some countries, for geographical and logistical reasons, are easier to get to."
"A system is needed that places rights above everything else, but which does not ignore the duties of the individual; it is the very synthesis of these two aspects that determines the efficiency of policies in this sector."
"A fundamental approach must also be adopted which on the one hand obliges Member States to integrate law-abiding European citizens and on the other allows them to expel those who break the rules."
"This is a challenge in which Europe has a fundamental role."
"in writing. - (RO) Criminality has no nationality."
"I regret and condemn any criminal act, wherever it happens, and justice should do its duty."
"Yet, one cannot stigmatize an entire people or ethnic group for a crime committed by one of its members."
"Fighting criminality should not infringe upon the free movement of persons, a fundamental principle of the European construction."
"European citizens have the right to live and travel freely, without fear of being persecuted or subject to acts of violence in the Member States."
"I ask the European Commission to examine the decree recently approved in Italy, which allows expulsions without granting any legal guarantees to the persons expelled, especially if they are citizens of the European Union."
"This decree has allowed abuses that certain Romanian citizens have already suffered."
"I ask the Italian State to take actions in order to stop the abuses."
"I believe this situation should be urgently solved in order not to allow European Union citizens to be discriminated against, regardless of whether they are Romanian, Italian, German, Spanish or French."
"I don't want this decree to become a dangerous precedent that would question the very respect of the Union's fundamental principles."
"This might affect the internal credibility of the European Union, as well as its credibility as a world player."
"Protection of soil - Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the protection of soil and amending Directive 2004/35/EC - C6-0307/2006 -, and"
"the report by Vittorio Prodi on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection."
"(DE) Madam President, I would not have asked for the floor again had not the Commissioner tried to play the victim in his closing remarks."
"Commissioner, you must come to terms with the fact that you are in a European forum in which you have a specific obligation to be very careful about what you say, and what you said in the Il Messaggero interview was factually incorrect."
"No authority in Europe has the right to go into some camp, ask a person 'How do you make your living?' and deport the person if they cannot answer immediately."
"That is completely and utterly wrong, but that is what you said in the interview with Il Messaggero, so do not get into a huff when it is pointed out to you."
"In any case the debate is closed."
"I am sorry, but it is not possible."
"I thought that you wanted to put an item on the agenda."
"The debate is closed."
"Let us proceed. ..."
"I am opposed to this intervention."
"We cannot go any further with this, I thought that Mr Schulz wanted to add an item to the agenda."
"Madam President, let me start by thanking the European Parliament and especially the rapporteurs, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and Mr Prodi, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the other committees, for their contribution during first reading."
"The Commission's proposal for a thematic strategy for soil protection arises from work begun in 1998 on the initiative of the German Ministry of the Environment."
"As a result of lengthy consultations with interested parties and the Member States, soil was recognised as a valuable natural resource and its degradation in Europe is becoming problematic."
"The Commission has subsequently collaborated with the parties involved, above all with Parliament and the Council, so that soil protection issues can be better understood and a consensus can be reached in this area."
"Τhe Parliament resolution on the 2002 Communication on soil protection made important recommendations to the Commission about the direction it must take to ensure proper soil protection in Europe."
"With the conclusions approved in Majorca in 2002, the European Council asked the Commission to propose a comprehensive, far-reaching strategy on soil protection embracing general principles, appropriate quantitative and qualitative targets, and schedules for gauging and evaluating the planned measures."
"Let me turn to some more specific issues."
"I find it very satisfying that soil degradation is recognised as a grave problem that must be overcome."
"In view of the present Parliament's keen interest in desertification, for example, it is important that here in Europe we should openly declare our commitment to dealing with the causes of this problem, both in Europe and around the world."
"Climate change and certain unsuitable soil management practices are putting our soil at risk."
"Determining the extent of degradation and then developing methods to ensure that soil is used sustainably represents a direct application of the knowledge-based approach that Parliament rightly values."
"Thus efforts will be guaranteed to be more focused and resources will be used more effectively to serve our purposes."
"Businesses are entitled to expect consistent application of Community legislation by Member States."
"In the environmental impact analysis prepared by the Commission, it is estimated that there are about 3.5 million sites in the EU likely to have become contaminated."
"A proportion of these, perhaps 15%, have definitely been contaminated."
"It is therefore vital that businesses should be confident that similar procedures will be adopted for the designation of contaminated sites, thus allowing for planned investments."
"We must also bear in mind that there is a direct relationship between climate change and soil."
"For example, according to a recent research article published in the authoritative international scientific journal Nature, over the past 25 years in the United Kingdom alone, the soil has been releasing 13 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year - as much as would be given off by an additional 5 million cars each year."
"It is also worth noting that the soil's ability to absorb carbon and convert it into useful humus has not yet been fully exploited."
"In the light of this, allow me to summarise the basic aims of the measures proposed by the Commission:"
"Firstly, a highly flexible, but consistent and comprehensive European soil policy must be developed."
"With the creation of a framework for sustainable soil use, and with the adoption of measures at source, this policy will prevent further degradation of the soil, whose vitally important social, environmental and economic functions will be preserved."
"Secondly, the necessary information on the condition of soil in Europe must be gathered so that we can make knowledge-based policy decisions and focus our efforts where the most serious degradation has been noted."
"Thirdly, degraded soils should where possible be restored on the basis of an analysis of soil condition, to be carried out by the Member States."
"The aim of the restoration should be to achieve soil quality consistent at least with the current and intended use of the land."
"Fourthly, minimum common rules should be adopted for the EU as a whole to ensure a consistent approach among the Member States on matters of soil protection."
"These common rules will help establish transparency and avoid distortion of the internal market."
"The aim of the strategy and the directive is to launch a long-term policy on soil protection in Europe, so that in a few years, time all the Member States will have made considerable progress in this area."
"I should like to draw your attention to certain key aspects of the framework directive on soil protection:"
"Firstly, the document produced after the codecision process has to be unambiguous and provide legal clarity for the interested parties affected by this legislative process."
"We must avoid introducing amendments with legal loopholes, unnecessarily restricting the scope of the directive."
"Secondly, the proposal already contains a high degree of subsidiarity and flexibility."
"I understand that certain amendments are being proposed to increase still further the degree of subsidiarity."
"However, you must be sure that these amendments will not create difficulties in the application of the directive by all Member States."
"This applies especially to the amendments concerning programmes of measures in the priority areas specified in the directive."
"Thirdly, in order to achieve a high degree of environmental protection, we must agree on a consistent approach to be followed by all Member States for the identification of contaminated soils."
"The proposed deletion of Annex II would prevent us from achieving our aim."
"To conclude, let me state that from now on the Commission will follow developments during the discussion of its proposal in the Council and in the European Parliament."
"It will then define its position accordingly."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you and extend my thanks again to the rapporteur Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines."
"It was a task that we worked on together and I hope that this has helped to improve the text."
"The directive under discussion today is aimed at protecting European soil from phenomena such as desertification, erosion and salinisation, increasingly linked with climate change and specific soil pollution."
"Paradoxically, despite the numerous regulations on the use and release into the environment of pollutants, there was no directive that made provision for any obligation to identify and certify soil that had been seriously polluted before improving it."
"However, this seems to bother some people in Parliament and elsewhere, who are critical of what they call an attack on subsidiarity and the suffocating presence of the European institutions, which are using measures such as the Soil Framework Directive to harass groups of farmers or businesses, with unfair laws, unjust provisions and new administrative and/or financial burdens."
"What are we talking about?"
"We are talking about the same directive that gives the Member States a period of some 25 years just to identify all areas in the national territory that might be considered seriously polluted, and thus compromised for various uses, both public and private, and all areas at serious risk in fact of desertification, erosion, salinisation and loss of compaction."
"We are talking about guidelines for organising a systematic improvement scheme, where necessary, in the collective interest."
"We are talking about the protection of human health alongside the protection of the environment."
"We are talking about a framework directive that not only respects the autonomy of the Member States, but contains no onerous provisions."
"I ask you then why this aversion on the part of certain Member States and Parliament - the usual suspects - to accepting a list of activities and sites that must undergo comprehensive investigation by the national authorities?"
"What do they have to hide?"
"Why so much aversion, when their representatives on the Council have already accepted the binding nature of the investigation into all sites proposed by the Commission in Annex II, and the principle of transparency which must prevail in soil-related transactions?"
"In addition, there is added value in a Europe-wide approach towards soil monitoring, which will improve the ability of the Member States to learn about their soil."
"In any case reports to the Commission will be practically automatic, since they will be based on satellite surveys."
"It is not common knowledge perhaps that a project of this type has already been carried out by the Commission, resulting in the Soil Atlas of Europe, which is a good example of what can be achieved if we work together."
"However, there is another argument for a Community-based approach towards soil protection, which is climate change, a challenge facing all of Europe."
"This challenge will consist of extreme climatic events: more rainfall, longer droughts, less snowfall and an increase in sea levels."
"This means that we have a duty to manage the soil, precisely to combat these challenges, to increase water retention times across the entire territory to prevent flooding and encourage groundwater absorption, particularly along the coasts, and prevent saltwater infiltration, most likely due to rising sea levels."
"Forestry management to control the risk of forest fires, since increased droughts will mean a greater risk of desertification in case of fire."
"Incidentally, this type of land management will encourage the use of renewable energy such as hydro-energy and biomass."
"Finally, we should not forget the part the soil plays in balancing greenhouse gases."
"During the vote on Wednesday, I would ask you to consider that what we need more than anything is a strategy and a directive that can guarantee future generations the use and enjoyment of the soil that we now have in our safekeeping, bearing in mind that each Member State faces the same threats and the same environmental risks."
"The soil is a resource, a resource that is scarce in Europe, and we must maximise its availability."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) Thank you, Madam President, and thank you also to Commissioner Dimas for his decisive support for this directive."
"We would like to welcome the Commission's proposal, as of course it aims to protect the soil and preserve its capacity to continue to carry out its environmental, economic, social and cultural functions, all of which are of course essential to human activity."
"Moreover, as the Commissioner rightly said, it proposes flexible rules, which are ambitious in their objectives and not excessively prescriptive in their content."
"Within a common framework, a minimum common denominator, the Member States are going to define their own level of intervention, enabling more efficient use of administrative capacity at national level."
"Despite the exaggerated resistance to this directive from some sectors, it is evident that soil is a vital resource that is essentially non-renewable, which is suffering under growing environmental pressure for which human activity has significant responsibility."
"According to the reports that have been discussed here, it has been calculated that the cost of soil degradation is approximately EUR 40 000 million per year, a cost that is borne by society in the form of damage to infrastructure, increases in the cost of healthcare and many other factors."
"This directive is of course based on the precautionary and preventive action principles, and on the principle that environmental damage must be rectified at its origin and that the polluter pays."
"This legislation will mitigate the cross-border effects of soil degradation, which do also exist, and it will help to ensure equal conditions in the internal market."
"I would like to highlight this aspect, because the different obligations that economic operators may impose, in line with different national soil protection legislation, could distort competition."
"To conclude, the soil protection directive is a step forward that will enable competition with greater transparency and will protect areas of common interest such as water, food safety and human health."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Madam President, I would really much prefer that this directive was not coming before us."
"I would be supporting a rejection of it - not because I do not want to see soil protected, because it is in all our interests that it should be."
"But is the directive the right way forward?"
"Commissioner Dimas, you said yourself that, at the moment, only nine Member States have legislation in place to protect soil."
"I would suggest that it is up to the other 18 Member States to put legislation in place to protect the soil and we should not necessarily bring forward another directive."
"We already have a Groundwater Directive and a Nitrates Directive."
"As far as agriculture is concerned, we have got a lot of cross compliance legislation that deals with the soil and soil compaction."
"I know the rapporteur is doing her very best to bring agriculture out of the proposal but I rather fear that what we will see is yet more bureaucracy and yet more difficulties for farmers."
"The Commissioner also stated that there are 300 types of soil throughout the European Union."
"It is very difficult to have one general directive to cover all these positions."
"You only have to consider agriculture in a year like this, where in some Member States there have been droughts and others have had very wet weather, very heavy rainfall."
"If you dig potatoes in many of the northern Member States this year, where there has been lots of rain, then of course you will cause compaction."
"It is necessary to do that in order to get the crop."
"That can be rectified the following year by subsoiling and repairing the damage to the soil."
"We need flexibility in all this."
"I really do think that the idea of having yet another directive in order to put more regulation upon our farmers and upon our industry is the wrong way to go."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Soil Protection Directive and the Soil Framework Directive, together with the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection, rank among the key topics in this part-session, as of course they have done in recent weeks and months in the committees."
"Normally a strategy - in this case about soil - is dealt with before the relevant directive, for good reason."
"The advantage of proceeding in stages is usually that interests are discussed openly early on, so that the newly gained points of view can be taken into account as the directive is formulated."
"With regard to the strong criticism that has been directed at the Commission proposal on the Soil Protection Directive, prior discussion about the topic would undoubtedly have been helpful, including to calm tempers all round."
"In contrast to the normal nature of a framework directive, the Commission proposal - and I share this opinion - includes very rigid, detailed regulations, and commits the Member States to numerous examinations and reports that would result in a considerable administrative load."
"This is unacceptable."
"The new Member States already have national soil protection legislation that functions well."
"For them, the Commission proposal would in some cases require their systems to be completely restructured: a high level of regulatory duplication and additional bureaucratic burden."
"Therefore, numerous Member States are sceptical about this Directive, as has already been stated."
"Nevertheless, in the last few months I have been heavily involved in transforming the Commission proposal, rewriting it."
"Essentially, it was a matter of allowing the Member States more scope within which to operate, while still pursuing the goal of curbing the growing deterioration of the soil at European level."
"I hope that, in the end, together with our friend Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, we arrived at a sensible result, including with regard to the significance of the overall topic of soil protection, a result that can be a model worldwide as well as in Europe."
"May I therefore express my warm thanks to the rapporteur once again for offering a solution that enabled a compromise to be found."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in European legislation important natural resources (water, air, species, the habitats of flora and fauna) have specific Community legislation, while soil as a resource does not have any."
"It is time to resolve this imbalance, and I therefore thank the Commission for its proposal, and also thank the rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, for the work that she has done."
"As many of us have said, soil is a non-renewable and therefore limited natural resource that carries out many important ecological and economic functions, and it is the basis of almost all human activities."
"There is no doubt that the involvement of the European institutional legislative system in this area will provide an impetus for the improvement of legislation that is being put in place in many countries, by giving it a coherent framework that is supported by European regulation, and possibly European resources."
"With regard to the immovable nature of soil, which appears to be cited as proof by some in order to justify their preferences for national or subsidiary treatment rather than a European policy, the European Commission's communication gives a sufficient argument as to why there needs to be a strategy at European level, and some colleagues, such as Mr Calabuig Rull, have mentioned this."
"There are some Member States that are not very eager for the standardisation of soil protection at European level, and we therefore think that both the strategy and the directive are being given the right focus in terms of being a flexible legal instrument that is ambitious and not excessively prescriptive."
"This means that each Member State can adapt it to its needs and to its social and economic situation, as a framework has been set out and long-term goals have been set."
"In short, I think that the methodology of the proposal for a directive, based on prevention, raising awareness among citizens, providing information, identifying priority areas of degradation and making inventories of contaminated soil along with programmes of national measures and rehabilitation strategies is a coherent, efficient and flexible approach to dealing with the problem of soil degradation in Europe, while respecting the diversity of national situations and options."
"I therefore ask this House, first of all, for a resounding 'no' to the outright rejection that this proposal has received in some sectors, and to support the compromise amendments, which we arrived at following lengthy negotiations."
"Perhaps this is not the directive that everyone would like, but precisely because we are all in some way against this directive, it may be able to serve us for the future."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, first of all, I too should like to convey my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, who has expended a great deal of energy in the last few months acting as a broker between proponents and opponents of a directive and who, in the end, managed to prepare the basis of a workable compromise."
"Nevertheless, I am, as I always have been, of the same opinion as the Members of this House who want to reject the Commission proposal."
"Let there be no mistake: our soils are the basis of our existence."
"Without healthy soil there is no agriculture, no natural cycle of nutrients and, in the long term, no life."
"We are responsible for protecting our soils from harmful effects where possible, and keeping them in good condition."
"However, this Directive is not the right way to achieve this."
"I do not believe that the question here is whether we wish to protect our soils better or not; instead, at the European level the question as I see it is: is this within our jurisdiction or not?"
"I believe that it is not."
"Obviously, many Member States have developed their own functioning soil protection legislation, with more concern for and better solutions to local problems than would be possible with centralised regulation from Brussels."
"Therefore I would ask the House to support the amendments that retain operational scope for the Member States."
"Apart from that, we are about to create vast amounts of new bureaucracy and expense for administrative bodies and businesses."
"There are amendments that would use the mere establishment of an industrial business as a reason to require detailed examinations and reports."
"Let me quickly give you just one example, that of the building of industrial gas plants."
"These separate normal air, which is a mixture of gases, into its components -which does not harm the soil at all."
"We should not be worrying about things like that, but only about things where there is justified concern that they may contaminate the soil."
"I believe that it is high time we refrained from the preparation and publishing of soil status reports."
"That is an encroachment on freedom of contract."
"The sale of land is covered by civil law, with good reason, and it should stay this way."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that, in the end, we shall achieve a Directive that really does guarantee protection of the soil and does not primarily increase administrative load."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, there is a saying that is well known in many countries: 'better late than never'."
"We are coming late to soil protection, after many decades of devastation, as is most evident in industrial regions, but it is good that we have come to realise that the soil feeds us and we must not destroy it."
"We must not treat it like a commercial item and operate a policy under which the biggest business is the purchase of agricultural land and its alienation from agricultural production for other purposes."
"This policy is already coming home to roost. It is good that we can finally see this and begin to protect the soil, our provider."
"May I remind you of the thought to be found in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that one condition for effective soil protection is the maintenance and development of agriculture."
"Soil nurtured by farmers retains its fertility, but when it is deprived of this care it turns into a desert."
"On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I support the reports by Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and Mr Prodi."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we stand for a definite 'yes' to EU-wide soil protection."
"We have heard that soil is our most important non-renewable resource."
"Soil deterioration costs the EU more than EUR 38 billion every year."
"In Germany, only 2% of the soil is still in its natural condition."
"Twelve per cent of soils in the EU are affected by erosion."
"Soil deterioration does not respect national borders."
"Thus we are in the process of pulling the rug out from under our own feet by the way we are currently using our soils."
"The EU proposal was good; it went in the right direction, and we should have liked to improve it."
"I know that the rapporteur fought for it, but unfortunately the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety watered down and further spoiled a great many points of the proposal under pressure from the conservatives and the agricultural lobby."
"I cannot understand why we in the Committee on the Environment have agreed to maintain secrecy about soil containing inherited contamination."
"I hope we shall still be able to correct this tomorrow."
"It runs counter to transparency and also to the Aarhus Convention."
"We also know that climate change and good-quality soil go hand in hand, that soil is an important carbon dioxide pool and is continually losing this ability to bind CO2."
"Because of the watering down that has happened in the Committee on the Environment, I fear that an ambitious Soil Protection Directive is, unfortunately, impossible."
"However, we need effective soil protection with a shared timeframe and common criteria."
"In short, we need effective, specific goals to put a stop to the deterioration of soils in the European Union."
"We must not give up on creating something that is legally binding because of this so-called compromise."
"Only legally binding measures will enable us to set an ambitious soil strategy in motion."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a very important and positive directive."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner, Mr Dimas, who handled this."
"I say so myself, as a member of a group that often criticises directives and the Commission: this is not the case here."
"This directive will be a huge step forward for Europe, both from the point of view of the quality of its policies and its effectiveness."
"With the completion of the framework directives on the natural elements, the soil will be considered as a key part of the biosphere, a fundamental element of the environmental and climatic balance and not just a platform on which to build."
"The soil is living, it absorbs CO2, it produces biomass: it must be safeguarded, it must even be improved, because European soil is particularly polluted."
"Europe understands this."
"We had a long and difficult discussion in the Committee, and I would like to thank Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines for being so passionate about the subject."
"However, there is the risk that Parliament will interfere with the Commission's text."
"I never like to see this happen, I always prefer it when Parliament is more advanced than the Commission."
"Someone has even recommended that the directive should be rejected, but this would be a serious mistake."
"Europe must look to the future."
"The soil beneath us is soil that we all share, it is part of our planet."
"It is the only soil we have and we must look after it."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I can see some of the logic in EU-level legislation regulating water and air quality."
"We share these in the EU and, indeed, globally."
"However, I find the logic fails with the protection of soils."
"Soils are much less mobile and, other than the setting of reasonable standards of protection, should be the competence of Member States and, within them, the local authorities."
"Before the EU takes too much control of soils maybe we need to do a bit of soul-searching."
"In Ireland, some of the problematic policies in terms of soil degradation have come top-down from Europe."
"For example, the EU sugar reform removed beet from the wheat rotation."
"The insertion of beet conditioned the soil and made it more suitable for cereals."
"Also, the EU forest grants over the years have resulted in unsuitable spruce plantations that, in growth, have made the soil more acidic and, in harvesting, have in some cases compacted the soil, rendering it infertile, whilst in others have loosened it from the hills, from which it has been washed into rivers and lakes."
"Soil varies enormously but it should be living and renewing."
"The EU should ban soil destruction but leave its care and management to the people who understand its composition in each area."
"(SK) Before looking at the actual wording of the proposed framework directive on soil protection, we should consider whether EU legislation in this area is actually needed."
"The opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs should be taken into consideration."
"It clearly rejected the need for soil protection legislation in the EU on the basis that soil does not have any cross-border implications and is therefore a regional issue."
"Despite the fact that other committees, in their respective opinions, were essentially in favour of EU legislation in this matter, certain factions are somewhat hesitant."
"For example, the amendment to Article 5 in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development clearly indicates that the degradation of the soil has local or regional causes and effects and it is therefore essential to adopt national as opposed to European measures."
"This appears to be in conflict with the remainder of the text, which is clearly in favour of the framework directive."
"Similar wording can be found in the amendment by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to Article 2."
"On the other hand, it is important to recognise that the degradation of soil, as a non-renewable resource, has significant consequences on other aspects, for which legislation already exists, such as water quality, food safety, climate change, etc."
"Even if both sides were partly right with regards to the need for a framework directive, I believe that the decision to adopt or reject the European framework will be a political one."
"I would like to comment on the change in the character of the report from negative to positive."
"One example is the replacement of the term 'risk area' with 'priority area'."
"I believe that for areas where soil degradation needs to be stopped urgently we must use urgent terminology; soil at risk must be indicated with a negative term to underscore the seriousness of the situation."
"(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work on the proposal in question."
"Unfortunately, however, I must endorse the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which calls on the committee responsible to propose rejection of the Commission proposal."
"The reasons cited by the committee are valid and remain so in spite of the substantial changes made to the proposal in the last few months."
"Soil really does not have any cross-border implications and should therefore remain a competence of the Member States."
"Therefore, despite the positive changes, this proposal continues to represent a breach of the principle of subsidiarity."
"As far as proportionality is concerned, adopting such legislation could be seen as a waste of resources."
"Moreover, it is important to remember that within the EU there are many different soil types, which are used in a variety of ways."
"It is true that the Directive in question has become what could be described as a flexible framework directive."
"In addition, as a result of our new philosophy, the Directive is binding as far as the results are concerned, but leaves the decision on the form and method up to the Member States."
"It is very positive that the existing Member State legislation covering these objectives does not need to be revised."
"As such, we are genuinely moving towards the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"A positive side effect of this legislation would be the pressure that would be brought to bear on Member States with inadequate soil protection legislation at present, but I am not sure if this is the best way to put pressure on them."
"After having weighed up all the pros and cons, I believe that it is not necessary to adopt the proposed directive."
"The Member States can protect their soil on their own."
"To conclude, I would like to reiterate the words of the French philosopher who said that if a law is not essential it must not be written."
"(DE) Madam President, I am another representative who believes that soil protection is very definitely a task for the European Union, and that the European Parliament should therefore adopt this Framework Directive."
"Nor, to be honest, do I understand the comments that have been made about how the different soil types in our Member States have not been taken into account."
"I am going to read this Directive through again and try to see what the other Members are referring to, for I did not notice these inflexible measures and proposals."
"I should also like to mention the role of agriculture, for, in my view, the compromise amendment by the various parties is very important."
"It requires the Member States, when using soil for agricultural purposes, to encourage crops and afforestation methods that could have a beneficial effect on soil organic matter and soil fertility and thus prevent landslides and desertification."
"Likewise, agricultural methods that prevent the compaction and erosion of soils should also be supported."
"We know that very often agriculture causes problems for soil quality, and I believe that this clarification is absolutely vital."
"I do not believe that the 'support for agriculture, no matter what' formula is sufficient to protect soils at regional, national, or even European level."
"- (PL) Madam President, a framework directive on soil protection will in my view be an instrument that promotes the production of foodstuffs and adequate supplies of clean water for subsequent generations of EU citizens."
"The soil also performs many other important functions: it is a substrate for human activities, along with towns and infrastructure, and also for nature and valuable landscapes."
"Protection of the soil is essential for the maintenance of our natural heritage and raw materials."
"In view of this situation, a flexible framework directive recognising the principle of subsidiarity will be an instrument that encourages Member States to protect their soils."
"A directive couched in such terms is binding for Member States in respect of the results that may be achieved in the area of soil protection, but leaves Member States the choice of the forms and methods used to achieve such protection."
"The proposals contained in the directive whereby Member States are to draw up lists of contaminated areas, including on a regional scale, to be published and updated every five years, are worthy of note."
"This is important information for the protection of the life and health of EU citizens."
"(FR) Madam President, I would also first like to congratulate our rapporteurs and applaud the difficult job Mrs Gutiérrez has accomplished in producing a result to protect our soil."
"Unlike other fellow Members, I believe a more restrictive legislative approach would have provided better protection."
"I also think it is a pity that our fellow Members whose countries have stricter regulation than that proposed here are still trying to water down this report with amendments that I would urge you very strongly to reject tomorrow."
"Our agricultural and industrial activities and transport plans have drastically affected the quality of our soil."
"However, this same soil is the foundation of biodiversity and our food."
"It filters and stores organic matter and minerals, and also helps us to access water."
"It plays a prominent role in the fight against climate change."
"Furthermore, faced with growing demand for food and energy production, it is essential that we safeguard and restore the quality of our soil and prevent desertification."
"Without legislation at European level, we cannot hope for results."
"(NL) Madam President, I am speaking here on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland."
"This debate is a further demonstration that the proposed soil policy is very controversial."
"Now that there are two proposals - the strategy and the Directive - it seems as though a new branch of environmental policy is being introduced."
"I say 'seems', as nothing could be further from the truth."
"Sustainable management of soil use already comes to the fore in 33 European directives, such as the Water Framework Directive."
"Why, then, are we presenting overlapping legislation, entailing yet more burdens, particularly for Member States that already have a well-functioning soil policy?"
"I shall be supporting Mr Prodi's Thematic Strategy."
"In my opinion, Member States who have yet to develop a soil policy must do so on the basis of the strategy."
"The framework directive, on the other hand, is disproportionate and also, in my view, contravenes the principle of subsidiarity."
"Unlike air and water, soil does not have a cross-border dimension, and policy is often implemented on a regional or local scale."
"This is also the reason that I - that is, Mr Blokland - have joined in signing the amendment rejecting the Commission proposal."
"Madam President, we are familiar with the idea that a land grab is the unwarranted appropriation of property belonging to another."
"It seems to me that this soil directive amounts to an unwarranted power grab by Brussels, and of course brings with it an inevitable layer of fresh bureaucracy."
"Soil, as has been said in this debate, unlike air and water, does not flow from state to state."
"It has no cross-border dimension."
"Thus policy on soil is and should remain a Member State issue."
"IPPC, cross-compliance obligations, the Landfill Directive and the Nitrates Directive all give us more than enough EU involvement."
"Hence I have no apology for favouring total rejection of this power-hungry proposal."
"But, if, true to form, the EU nonetheless decides to meddle in this national issue, then one initiative it could consider is to introduce a payment to farmers in return for providing carbon sequestration in soil management and farming practices."
"(FR) Madam President, my first thought on this proposal for a directive was to reject the text."
"I also think that a framework directive was perhaps not an appropriate solution."
"Why have another text on the protection of soil when we already have a whole raft of regulations on soil, waste, pesticides and the protection of nature?"
"Within the framework of better lawmaking, I was thinking that we should not appear to be going through the European Commission mill again."
"I was putting myself in the shoes particularly of the mayors of our municipalities, who would find themselves with another text to dissect."
"However, the reality is this: human practices have not respected the soil."
"We have worn out the soil with intensive production."
"In addition to this there is climate change and desertification."
"Our urban planning policies have mineralised the soil, degraded it, and our fellow citizens are now surprised when they experience catastrophic flooding because the soil no longer absorbs the rain."
"Who has not seen the open wounds in the landscape caused by the quarries that supply us with such valuable materials?"
"Impoverished, dried out, degraded, polluted and bruised soil - that is what has become of this land, which previous generations spoke about with veneration because the land was everything to them: their work, their food, their life and, for many, their only property."
"What was once our mother Earth we now regard with suspicion."
"What will be the consequences of this degradation, this pollution, for our environment and health?"
"Mrs Gutiérrez has done a remarkable job in trying to find an acceptable approach, in trying to bring closer together those who did not want this directive and those who did."
"She has listened to Parliament."
"She has found balanced positions that respect the need for subsidiarity in the choice of methods, because there is enormous disparity between the Member States."
"The final text has evolved a great deal."
"It avoids increasing the burden of administrative costs by encouraging us to put right the mistakes of the past, our agricultural, industrial and urban practices that did not respect the soil."
"This report, completely remodelled by Mrs Gutiérrez, is satisfactory."
"There is such soil diversity in the European Union that the subsidiarity guarantee is essential, while ensuring the protection and sustainable use of the soil."
"(HU) It is our fundamental goal to guarantee a healthy environment for our citizens, and there is stringent Union legislation for most elements of our environment."
"Soil is the only element of the environment that we have not yet been able to regulate, so there is currently no Union instrument to halt the pollution of soil and the erosion of its quality, even though this causes many tens of millions of euros' worth of damage for all of us."
"According to the current legislation, it is only compulsory to act against soil pollution when the pollution enters other elements of the environment: groundwater, fresh water, agricultural products, or when it is too late to act in practice."
"I would welcome the adoption of this new Directive by the European Union, and I am pleased that a compromise package has been created that is even more acceptable from the perspective of environmental protection."
"It is also important from a Hungarian perspective that, as many of us have proposed, the legislation should also deal with tackling soil acidification."
"This is a serious threat to agricultural production, so it must be fought using Union instruments for this reason too."
"Recognition of the polluted areas will encourage remediation, so we can prevent the pollution of water tables for drinking water, and naturally the cultivation of polluted plants."
"Soil regulation is therefore in the interests of farmers."
"I therefore hope that certain MEPs from the right, including, surprisingly, some Hungarian MEPs, will not succeed in their endeavour to prevent the creation of a Directive to protect the interests of Hungarian agriculture and the environment."
"In the spirit of the Directive, the rehabilitation of the polluted or soil-degraded areas uncovered will be a task for the Union, for which resources will need to be found in future Community budgets."
"Madam President, this proposal for a directive on soil protection has huge credibility gaps."
"Firstly, soil contents and qualities in different parts of an individual country vary considerably."
"How much more variance will there be between the soils of 27 different countries with vastly differing climates?"
"It is absurd to suggest that the EU can introduce a one-size-fits-all directive on soil from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia."
"Now a word on behalf of our already hard-pressed farmers, many of whom have written to my constituency office to strongly question the need for a directive on soil protection."
"They have quite rightly pointed out that they have a vested interest in protecting the soil, because it is their livelihood."
"They also suggest that it would place another onerous burden upon them because of the failure to give enough recognition to existing national legislation."
"The second large credibility gap is provided by the EU's short-sighted open border policy, which has encouraged mass immigration from Eastern Europe to my country."
"This has generated the need for a correspondingly huge programme of house building on every square inch of land available - some three million new homes by 2020, we are told."
"Even the green belt is under threat."
"Burying vast acreages under solid concrete is not my idea of the best way to protect soil."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, I support the soil strategy elaborated in the Prodi report, but oppose the Directive on soil."
"I do so quite clearly on the basis of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"Therefore, I have tabled an amendment rejecting it, but also one opting for another instrument, namely open coordination."
"The objectives can be achieved in full by this means."
"After all, it is abundantly clear that this all centres on stimulation, knowledge sharing and monitoring."
"Everything is possible, including financial support from the Union."
"The risk of duplication remains: once again, priority areas are designated, and even the sea bed has been drawn back into the debate."
"The citizens of my country, the Netherlands, do not understand the reason for unnecessary legislation from above, from European level."
"As has been said, there are already more than 30 directives concerning soil quality, either directly or indirectly."
"What is the point of central legislation when a decentralised approach is also possible?"
"Nevertheless, I do appreciate Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines's attempts to steer the rules more in the direction of subsidiarity."
"Finally, I have submitted many more proposals, with 40 signatures: amendments aiming to further increase the emphasis on quality and soil protection and to respond to new challenges such as climate change."
"No legislation should be adopted at European level, however."
"I appeal to my fellow Members to support my amendments in this regard."
"(NL) Madam President, my thanks to Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, but I must say that, unfortunately, we do not agree with her."
"There are a great many places in Europe with soil pollution or other soil problems such as erosion."
"These problems must be solved as quickly as possible."
"I assume that everyone agrees with this."
"The Commission is proposing to solve soil problems at European level - and, as far as I am concerned, there lies the problem."
"After all, soil problems are often local, and only in specific cases do they have a real cross-border impact."
"European cooperation is desirable in the case of soil problems with a cross-border impact, and in that instance solidarity and cooperation are important."
"In the case of local and national soil problems, however, European policy is completely unnecessary."
"Many Member States already have a good national policy for solving and preventing soil problems."
"Their policy offers a level of protection that is at least as high as the one now on the table."
"The Directive on soil should take these Member States into consideration - they should be exempt from European obligations - and therefore we plan to vote against this Directive."
"Madam President, I came to this debate from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, where we rejected the proposal for a directive."
"I favour the Prodi strategy with some reservations."
"All of us want our soils protected, but I think those of us who are concerned about this directive believe that it is not necessary to do it in this way."
"Mr van Nistelrooij pointed out a much better way of doing it, through open coordination."
"The difficulty that I see in terms of soil protection is that we are not doing enough research on how to protect soils and that a great many researchers and advisers in the agricultural area are involved in form filling - forms that are created here in the European Union and which take them from their jobs of being involved with farmers in best practice in terms of soil protection."
"It is very difficult for farmers to come to terms with more bureaucracy."
"They are dealing with this every day, with cross compliance."
"I believe that soils are being protected through good agricultural practice."
"It is a Member State issue."
"I had hoped that the debate here tonight would convince me that we need a directive but so far I have not been convinced of that."
"I accept the work done by the rapporteur, and certainly she has taken out a great many of the concerns we would have, but it does leave me wondering why we need this at all."
"I think that Irish farmers, who are in large measure now worried about the Reform Treaty, will see this as another attempt to stifle them in their everyday activities, unless we can convince them that is not the case."
"I repeat the point that my concern is that the research and advisory work is, in fact, almost being destroyed by the levels of bureaucracy that the EU has created."
"Yes, we need to deal with soils that are contaminated, but we have directives that already do that; they are in place."
"I am not convinced, from today's debate, that we need such a directive."
"I will remain open-minded until the end of this debate and see if I am thus convinced, but, so far, I am afraid not."
"Yes to the strategy, but no to the directive."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez on having spent a great deal of time and energy compiling a draft text that has actually managed to come for plenary debate and voting despite the resistance that can be experienced in the Parliament."
"Today, when the extreme weather conditions caused by climate change and civilisation mean an increasing burden on soil and thereby on the whole living world, this legislation is of particularly great importance."
"For my part, the Directive is one of the most important statements on the importance of agricultural activity, and the undying merit of the people who work to maintain, protect and improve the soil."
"Without them, we would not only be deprived of food, but the environment around us would also suffer serious damage."
"Sustainable agriculture implemented with knowledge is one of the mainstays of environmental protection."
"However, one of the most important conditions for this is information. Information about the condition of the soil that is accessible to the public would be one of the fruits of the new legislation, which would finally protect people and farmers instead of polluters."
"In my homeland of Hungary, the picture is typically two-fold: on the one hand, there is land of excellent quality and a high degree of legislative protection but, on the other hand, there is industrial pollution caused by forty years of Communism, and cleaning it up will take at least another forty years and EUR 4 billion."
"Right now we are spending Union money on remedying this, but we would like to speed this process up in future, and this legislation would be a great help."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting the Soil Protection Directive we are completing a process in the theological sense too."
"We have already regulated all the elements that created the world: air, water, fire - meaning energy - and their importance is thoroughly and appropriately protected by the Union, so now it is the turn of the fourth element, earth, thus completing the circle."
"(NL) Mr President, Secretary, I should like to start by expressing my sincere congratulations to our rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, and by thanking her for her enormous efforts to strike a balance between supporters and opponents of this Directive, in what is after all a very difficult dossier."
"Personally, I am firmly convinced that a European Directive on soil protection is necessary, for various reasons."
"I hope that there is still a chance of my convincing Mrs McGuinness."
"Some MEPs reject the framework directive because their country already has far-reaching legislation on soil."
"My region - Flanders - has also been conducting a progressive soil policy for some years."
"For example, a system of compulsory soil certificates in the case of property transfers - even now inconceivable in many Member States - has been in place for a long time."
"I should like to turn the reasoning of these Members around."
"This flexible Directive not only provides a framework for those Member States that do not yet have a soil policy but is also clearly capable of preventing the undermining of the competitive position of the countries and regions that are already making an effort."
"For this reason, it is very important that all Member States take the measures presented in the report."
"There is certainly a cross-border impact in a great many places: for example, erosion in Flanders could generate sludge in the Netherlands and vice versa."
"The Directive also provides a coherent framework for existing legislation on soil protection."
"I could give more reasons but, because of time constraints, I shall conclude by saying that the report under discussion today fills all the aforementioned needs much better than the original Commission proposal."
"I myself have also tabled many amendments and am very pleased with the result."
"The proposal provides the Member States with sufficient elbow room, creates no additional administrative burdens or duplication, and also explicitly recognises the role of regional authorities."
"I therefore hope for strong support from my fellow Members in tomorrow's vote."
"Mr President, may I first of all congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines."
"I think she has done an absolutely fantastic job on a report which is not needed or wanted by most of us and, Commissioner Dimas, in my opinion brings this House and the Commission into total disrepute."
"You are bringing out legislation which is totally and utterly unnecessary."
"What you should be doing is enforcing the legislation that we have."
"The Commission usually fails totally in enforcing legislation which is already there."
"I can give you a number of cases, but I do not wish to do it just now."
"If I were to look, for example, at your colleague, Mr Kyprianou: we have just had yet another outbreak of foot-and-mouth in the United Kingdom; we have got bluetongue; today it was announced that we have avian flu."
"He promised to stop all this."
"He was going to do everything to stop it."
"I believed him."
"I believe the Commission when it says something, and yet what happens is that it does not enforce the legislation that is in place to stop these sorts of things coming in."
"I call on this House to totally reject this piece of legislation."
"I think Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines has done an absolutely fantastic job and I will support her totally if this House decides not to reject it, but I shall briefly mention something that Mrs Scheele and Mrs Corbey said on erosion."
"I totally agree with them."
"Erosion is a big problem, but not necessarily in the European Union."
"It is a problem where we have deforestation, and that is something that we could do something about."
"I thought Mr Allister's points were absolutely correct."
"I think the Commission is failing us."
"It fails to enforce regulations."
"I will leave you with one last thought."
"As a farmer, the soil is my life."
"I will protect it to the very best of my ability."
"Do not put more legislation in place."
"Allow me to get on with protecting the soil, which provides the food, which provides the income for the people who live in the rural communities."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what the Commission states - that soil is the crucial basis for the long-term, sustainable production of food, feed and biomass - is true."
"It is also true that we cannot be satisfied with the state of the soils in the European Union, but to draw from that the conclusion that we need a directive at European level is to head off in the wrong direction."
"Why is that?"
"We are not taking account of the fact that there are already numerous regulations within the European Union that apply to soil and that we could use effectively."
"Examples are the Habitats Directive, the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control, the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Directive, and the rules on cross-compliance: with these, we can have a financial influence on the improvement of the situation in individual countries."
"These are all existing measures, and if we add the Soil Protection Directive to them it will create regulatory duplication - parallel legislation - that really only creates more bureaucracy."
"We say we want to reduce bureaucracy by 25% by 2010, but this will only achieve the very opposite!"
"It will achieve a 25% increase."
"In the Treaty, we undertook to regulate locally the things that could best be regulated at that level, and that is what we must do, and we must accelerate this."
"The claim that the deterioration of soil is causing climate change is, however, unacceptable."
"Scientists are unanimous that this deterioration is a result of climate change, and not the reason for it."
"The rapporteur has certainly put a lot of work into this, but when we see that rules that are implemented by other directives have priority, that is unacceptable: we do not have top-priority directives and then lower-priority directives."
"If we really want to achieve something, let us stick to the method of open coordination, transferring expertise from country to country."
"That is the right approach and it will surely bring a result."
"This Directive, on the other hand, brings only bureaucracy and confusing legislation."
"(DE) Mr President, where is the added value?"
"Where is the justification for European regulations on soil protection?"
"The Commission's arguments concerning cross-border effects are rather artificial - at least from the ecological point of view."
"Nor can I accept the argument that the internal market is distorted by different national soil protection legislation."
"If the Commission really meant that, it would not present us with a framework directive, which accords the Member States the greatest possible self-determination in the definition of goals for soil protection."
"That would increase the differences in soil protection legislation more than it would even them out."
"Does not this approach reveal that the Commission is unsure as to how it should proceed in terms of subsidiarity when it comes to legislation for soil in specific locations?"
"In such a case, where we all wish for better soil protection, but national legislation differs, should we not first use the instrument of open coordination?"
"I believe so."
"The Framework Directive takes the second step before the first."
"We are missing out on the opportunity for countries without legislation to learn from countries with excellent soil-protection practices."
"We shall also experience bureaucracy, particularly in those countries that already have tough legislation."
"Why should they have to examine their entire country and define risk areas, even though they already have exemplary legislation?"
"We do not need this bureaucracy, nor do we need the gilt-edged soil-protection system that Europe is now demanding from us."
"In closing, a comment on the argument that Parliament itself asked for this Directive years ago."
"Yes, that was the case five years and more ago."
"However, in the meantime we have had experience of the Habitats Directive, the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control, the Water Framework Directive and many more."
"As well, unlike the Commissioners, we are held accountable locally."
"Therefore we do not hold fast to five-year and ten-year plans when businesses and local authorities on the ground are telling us that it is too much of a good thing."
"I acknowledge the efforts of the rapporteur to make the Directive less stringent, but bureaucracy is best avoided at source."
"We still have the opportunity to do that by rejecting the Directive."
"I hope that we give the Council a strong signal that it cannot expect its nations to accept this wave of bureaucracy."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the speakers in this debate for their positive contributions and I would like to outline the Commission's view on a number of key issues raised by Parliament."
"Let me state that the Commission will follow the development of its proposal in the Council and in Parliament and consider its position under the light of these developments."
"I will start with those aspects of the thematic strategy which appear in the report of the Committee on the Environment and which are not covered in the directive."
"I welcome the support given in the report to tackling soil protection at a European level and the crucial links between soil protection and any strategy to combat climate change, biodiversity loss and desertification."
"I also agree on the fact of reviewing existing environmental legislation to fully exploit and further strengthen the potential synergies with soil protection."
"Finally, the resolution you have approved proposes a number of recommendations as regards a new directive on biowaste and a communication on desertification."
"The Commission will take these recommendations into account when developing further measures implementing the thematic strategy."
"Let me now turn to the soil framework directive and outline the Commission's current thinking regarding the issues raised."
"Many of the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment provide useful clarifications to the proposal."
"I am referring in particular to a better clarification of the objective of the legislation and the role played by soil functions in ensuring sustainable use of soil in Article 1, pursuant to Amendment 36."
"In addition, elements such as the introduction of voluntary codes of good practice or of a non-binding annex on possible measures to combat soil degradation can be supported in Articles 4 and 8, pursuant in part to Amendments 58 and 65."
"The addition of acidification to the list of soil degradation processes that need to be tackled in order to consider the different soil conditions that apply in some new Member States."
"The Commission also considers the clarification introduced in the provision dealing with the identification of contaminated sites in Article 10, pursuant to Amendment 74, as an improvement to the text."
"However, there are also a number of amendments which raise concerns for the Commission."
"Firstly, Amendment 38 on Article 1, to make the soil framework directive subsidiary to other European Union legislation so that soil protection provisions contained in other Community legislation would take precedence over the provisions of this directive."
"Secondly, it is clear that there must be a date by which the programmes of measures for tackling agricultural threats should be drawn up."
"Thirdly, some amendments, such as Amendment 77 concerning Article 12, eliminate the provisions concerning the information on soil contamination to be provided for certain land transactions."
"The soil status report is a very important part of the Commission's proposal."
"It will increase the level of transparency in land transactions, assist the competent authorities in identifying contaminated sites and speed up the establishment of the inventory."
"The costs involved in producing this report are negligible compared to the amounts of land transactions of such industrial sites."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of keeping a common list of activities in Annex 2."
"This annex is of fundamental importance if a meaningful, enforceable, systematic and cost-effective inventory of contaminated sites is to be achieved."
"Many Member States and regions already use a very similar list to carry out their investigations."
"It is very important to have a common list to ensure harmonised implementation and to avoid a distortion of the internal market for the different sectors."
"Thus we will provide investors, economic operators, public authorities and society at large with legal certainty and a common ground to assess the progress in identifying contaminated sites."
"I shall provide a complete list of the Commission's current position on the amendments to Parliament's secretariat."
"As I have already mentioned, I can assure you that the Commission will follow the development of its proposal in the Council and Parliament and consider its position in this light."
"Once again I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their efforts."
"Commission's position on amendments by Parliament"
"Gutiérrez-Cortines report"
"The Commission will follow the development of its proposal in the Council and in the Parliament and consider its position in the light of this development."
"The Commission's current position on the proposed amendments is that there are 50 amendments which the Commission can accept fully, in part, or in principle."
"These are amendments: 1, 7, 12, 13, 15, 20, 22, 30, 36, 41, 42, 45, 47, 49, 53, 55, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 69, 73, 74, 79, 80, 83, 86, 89, 90, 92, 96, 98, 99, 103, 104, 108, 115, 117, 137, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148 and 150."
"It cannot accept 111 amendments: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44, 46, 48, 50, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 60, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 75, 76, 77, 78, 81, 82, 84, 85, 87, 88, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 100, 101, 102, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 116, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 138, 139, 140, 141, 149, 151."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the Gutiérrez-Cortines report will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon and the vote on the Prodi report on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (DE) In the light of the recent agreement on the Reform Treaty, the European Parliament, and with it the whole EU, must support and strengthen this renewed confirmation of a spirit of closeness to citizens and of the protection of subsidiarity, starting with the current initiatives."
"The present proposal on the Soil Protection Framework Directive does not do justice to this intention."
"The bureaucracy required in connection with it bears no relation to the actual usefulness of the Directive, and there is no way it can be justified to the citizens of Europe."
"Quite the contrary, it runs counter to the decision of the European Council to reduce bureaucracy at EU level by 25% by 2012."
"Soil is first and foremost a local resource."
"Effective soil protection must, therefore, be carried out at the most suitable levels - at the regional or local level."
"Only at these levels can the very wide range of soil characteristics be dealt with comprehensively."
"Despite the extensive improvements made by the rapporteur, I reject this proposal, because it infringes the principle of subsidiarity."
"Some Member States already have extremely good regulations, which could even be weakened by this Directive."
"If necessary, the open-coordination method could provide a solution."
"- (PL) Soil degradation is a fact."
"One factor causing of this state of affairs is ... the common agricultural policy."
"Self-sufficiency in foodstuffs has been achieved at the cost of the intensification of agriculture and degradation of the soil."
"An increase in economic efficiency leads to the elimination of small and medium-sized farmers, the vast majority of whom are more environmentally friendly than large profit-oriented agricultural businesses."
"This is the final call to slow down the process of abandoning farming and return to a rational and balanced agricultural model that protects the soil."
"The current distribution of agricultural subsidies is, however, in conflict with this model."
"Subsidies are directed above all to agricultural concerns and large intensive farms - 1.39% of beneficiaries receive almost 30% of subsidies!"
"The CAP must be amended."
"Its main aim should be the production of healthy foods, not increased competitiveness."
"Good soil should be a key element in this new policy."
"That is why I support all actions that serve to protect the soil and restore its fertility."
"Let us not compete with products originating from monocultures and intensive livestock rearing."
"Let us say NO to cheap meat crammed with hormones."
"Let us not compete with fruit that has little nutritional value, with cheap, low-quality wine or with GM foods, whose consequences we still know little about."
"The European agricultural model should genuinely make us stand out in the world and be an example to it."
"Amendment of Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Peter Liese, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community - C6-0011/2007 -"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me particular satisfaction to open today's discussion on the proposal to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, known as the ETS, within the Community."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Liese, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their efforts to date."
"I should also like to thank the other three committees for their participation and their contribution to the discussion."
"It has already become widely accepted that climate change is taking place and is being caused by human activity."
"The measures we take over the next 10 years will determine whether we manage to bring the situation under control or let climate change reach levels so dangerous that it threatens the wellbeing and stability of our societies."
"The EU has the capability, the resources and the will to lead the global effort to combat climate change."
"This is the clear message that we will be delivering in a few weeks' time in Bali, where the Future International Action on Climate Change Network is to be discussed."
"This opportunity has allowed all three bodies, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, to set ambitious and binding targets for reducing emissions."
"To achieve these targets, all sectors, including that of international air transport, must take their share of responsibility."
"Until now, international air transport has been relatively favourably treated compared with other branches of the transport sector."
"In terms of taxation and VAT, international air transport continues to enjoy privileges enjoyed when it was still a small, emerging economic sector after the Second World War."
"In negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol in the 1990s, air and sea transport were exempted from targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"These targets affect only internal flights."
"Now air transport has grown considerably, and it has become the cornerstone of globalisation, as it brings peoples and economies closer together."
"The Commission fully recognises the importance of air transport for international trade and economic development."
"On the other hand, the negative impact of air transport on the environment has begun to make itself felt, the dramatic increase in greenhouse gas emissions being a palpable example of this."
"The contribution of air transport to global emissions of greenhouse gases is equivalent to the total emissions of the UK or Canada."
"In the EU, CO2 emissions from aircraft are nearly double their 1990 total, and the forecast is for 150% growth by 2012."
"We cannot of course allow this situation to continue without taking measures to combat it."
"The air transport sector must also contribute to the fight against climate change, otherwise we shall be seeing air transport favoured over other branches of the economy which are already making significant efforts to reduce their emissions."
"This is precisely why the Commission proposed in its communication in September 2005an overall approach to combating the impact of air transport on climate."
"Our strategy is based on policies already applied by the Community, but it also strengthens and extends them."
"Our current policies include research into new, cleaner technologies and further improvement in the air traffic management system in Europe through the Single European Sky and Clean Sky programmes."
"Yet these measures alone are not enough; further action is needed, and for this reason, in December 2006, the Commission proposed that air transport should be included in the Community system for emission allowance trading."
"This is the proposal we are discussing here today."
"The Commission's approach is in two stages."
"Firstly, from 2011, all flights within the EU will be included in the system."
"In stage two, from 2012, all flights to and from EU airports will be covered."
"We are starting with internal flights: this shows our willingness internationally to take the lead in this effort."
"At the same time, we are exhorting our international partners to join the common endeavour."
"At the last conference of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in September, we faced strong opposition from many third countries regarding our plans to include all aircraft in the trading system, regardless of nationality."
"The reasons vary from country to country, but it became clear that the developing countries in particular believed we should begin at home before also applying the system to flights to and from their countries, and to their airlines."
"As a result, we must show greater determination."
"One of the main points of the proposal is that it must be applied to all airlines operating on the routes covered by the system, irrespective of their nationality, in order to avoid discrimination."
"The proposal is in line with the Chicago Convention and the bilateral aviation agreements."
"This position was supported by all 42 European states at the ICAO Conference."
"Europe registered a formal reservation on this issue, thus allowing us room for manoeuvre."
"The ambitiousness of the Commission's proposal can be gauged by its call to stabilise emissions at the 2004-2006 average."
"Given the forecasts of rapid growth in air transport, this will have a considerable environmental effect."
"In 2020 we will be saving a total of 183 million tonnes of CO2 a year, equivalent to twice Austria's current annual greenhouse gas emissions from all sources."
"This means a 46% reduction in emissions compared with a situation whereby air transport would not have been included in the Community trading system."
"As regards the allocation of emission rights to airlines, we propose a simple approach."
"In the period before 2013, a percentage of the air transport emission rights will be made available by auction, in line with the percentage auctioned to other sectors."
"The remainder will be distributed free of charge according to a benchmark, rewarding high-performance airlines."
"From 2013, the proportion of allowances made available by auction must be in line with the proportion agreed in the general review of the ETS."
"Lastly, the same harmonised benchmark methodology will continue to be applied to the distribution of the remainder."
"Ladies and gentlemen, combating climate change is now the EU's highest priority."
"The proposal under consideration concerns one of the most rapidly increasing sources of greenhouse gas emissions."
"It therefore symbolises the Union's resoluteness on this issue."
"Through specific measures it seeks to control a difficult problem in a branch of the economy where effective policies have not hitherto been successfully developed."
"Europe has a duty to play a leading role, but must do so in a way that does not provoke its international partners."
"In view of the serious doubts expressed by many of them, we must both show our determination and adopt a sensible position."
"The Commission firmly believes that the proposal we are considering tonight corresponds precisely to this need."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few months, almost everyone has realised that we must do something to prevent dramatic climate change."
"Reports by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and by the former chief economist of the World Bank, Sir Nicholas Stern, have made it clear that the cost of doing nothing is very much greater than the cost of doing something."
"Sir Nicholas even said that, if climate change continues unchecked, this could have the same negative effects in economic terms as the two World Wars."
"This example makes it clear that this is not a trivial matter or some line dreamt up by the Greens, but a matter of tangible economic interests and something that truly affects every individual."
"It was, therefore, logical that the summit of EU Heads of State or Government in March decided that the European Union would reduce its emissions by at least 20% by 2020 and, if we reach an international agreement - which we do want to do - by 30%."
"It is therefore inconsistent for a major area of the economy not to reduce emissions at all and instead let them continue to increase unchecked."
"As the Commissioner said, aviation emissions have doubled since 1990."
"It is a good thing, then, that the Commission has made a proposal to reduce CO2 emissions in the aviation sector."
"However, this proposal also has flaws, and I am certain that the European Parliament will address these tomorrow with numerous amendments."
"I should like to thank all those who have made it possible for us to come to what I believe will be a satisfactory result tomorrow, especially the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, who was involved in the Hughes procedure, and all the participants from the other committees that provided an opinion."
"Although some positions diverged, I think that we were agreed on many important points, and shall agree tomorrow when it comes to the vote."
"We are agreed that we want one single starting date."
"Both flights within Europe and intercontinental flights that take off or land in Europe should be included in the system on the same day."
"This is essential for reasons of competitive neutrality, and also because two thirds of CO2 emissions come from intercontinental flights rather than flights within Europe."
"Naturally, we must also speak with third countries, so the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety also adopted a motion that the Commission should continue to negotiate with third countries."
"If we can then agree on common goals and a common approach that achieves just as much as the Commission proposal, then we should also enter into negotiations with third countries."
"We are agreed - this is a second point that I should like to highlight - that we wish to auction a much larger proportion of allowances."
"This is important for newcomers, but mainly to lessen the 'windfall profits' that are so prominent in the electricity sector."
"Electricity prices have risen even though the allowances were distributed at no cost."
"This is why a larger proportion must be auctioned off and the revenues given back to citizens in the form of lower taxes and charges on environmentally friendly transport; this is also what the committee decided."
"We are agreed that the upper limit for emissions should be below 100%, because this is about reducing and not just stabilising CO2 levels."
"In addition, the Committee on the Environment has decided to introduce a multiplier of two, in order to take nitrogen oxide emissions into account."
"If the Commission makes a proposal - which is then adopted - as to an alternative way to deal with nitrogen oxides, then this multiplier can be dropped, but for now, we need it."
"Furthermore, it is also very important to bring in an efficiency clause, and the Committee on the Environment has also decided on this."
"The goals that the airlines set themselves for improving efficiency must be achieved, and the aviation industry must not be able to simply buy its way out."
"Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow there will be some very close voting in some areas."
"There are some points on which we do not all agree."
"On behalf of my group - not as the rapporteur - I can say that the Committee on the Environment has gone too far at some points."
"For example, we shall not support a cap of 75%, and we should still like to obtain relief for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of the report in any case, and I believe that Parliament as a whole will give a clear signal to the Council."
"We should not be satisfied with merely formulating general goals to tackle climate change, but should also implement specific legislation."
"We shall note with great interest whether the Council puts its words into action or whether it falls short of its own targets or even weakens the Commission proposal."
"The European Parliament will not accept that."
"(Applause)"
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would first like to offer my warmest thanks to the Commission for having dared to break the aviation taboo, without waiting for the IATA decisions, and I congratulate the rapporteur for having supported this."
"As draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I will concentrate on just one point: the issue of competition."
"You mentioned, Commissioner, that this directive removes an error in the regulations that favours other modes of transport over aviation."
"That is an excellent point."
"It should not be the case that the way it is applied ends up favouring certain companies over others."
"Practically every one of us has, at least once this year, flown with an airline that did not exist three years ago."
"We cannot therefore guarantee an income to the existing companies."
"The greater the share allocated for distribution by auction, the better the competition will be."
"Rapporteur for endorsement Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (RO) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioners, dear colleagues, as rapporteur for the ITRE opinion, I can tell you that the directive has been intensively debated in our committee as well."
"We have tried to find a balance, as correct as possible, between the necessary environmental protection actions, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the necessary actions to assure the competitiveness of the European air industry and to establish equal treatment for all the airlines in the European Union."
"I am glad to find proposals also made by the Committee on Industry in Mr. Liese's report, especially regarding the simultaneous inclusion into the trading system of greenhouse gas emission shares of all arrival and departure flights in the Community and the provision of access on the market for all newly-established airplane operators."
"At the same time, I have to say that I regret the solution found for establishing the total quantity of shares to be periodically distributed to airplane operators."
"The 2004-2006 reporting period, accompanied by the continuous periodic decrease of the total quantity of share, does not take into consideration the fact that the aviation sector is under full development in the new Member States, thus disadvantaging the airline operators in these countries and, at the same time, it could prevent a competitive development of the European aviation sector, according to the transport requirements brought about by the economic and social development of the European Union."
"I appreciate that the variant voted by the ITRE Committee, which proposes 2008-2010 as a reference period, with the possibility to change the total quantity of shares in order to take into consideration the future developments in the sector, either increasing or decreasing, better defines the necessary framework for a correct competition between the airplane operators in the European Union and for the competitiveness of the overall European economy."
"I hope the vote to take place this week will be as close as possible to the line adopted by the ITRE Committee."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the committees are unanimously of the opinion that the starting date for European airlines and airlines from other countries that fly into our region must be the same, for we must consider the competitiveness of our airlines."
"Nevertheless, at the ICAO Conference we saw that the other countries opposed this."
"In this respect, there is no point in having a double deadline."
"In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, however, we believe that the deadline should be 2012."
"Commissioner, you quite rightly pointed out that aviation was excluded according under the Kyoto Protocol."
"In this respect, 2012 is the correct year, because this allows the best chance of convincing third countries to participate after all."
"It provides enough time for them to join our system or to set up an equivalent system."
"We cannot accept your leading role and that of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which goes even further and wants to see 2010, because this completely overlooks the global dimension of aviation, the nature of the competition between airlines."
"We cannot disadvantage our airports, our airlines and employees in this area."
"Therefore, the best acceptable time would be 2011, but the date must apply to all airlines."
"Furthermore, we must strike a balance."
"We want to reduce the effects on the climate of aviation, but we must also keep in mind the competitiveness of our airlines, and consider the airports and passengers - especially those from remote areas - and keep prices affordable for them."
"We therefore advocate achieving a reference period soon, and having a sensible percentage for the allocation of allowances - the Committee on Transport was in favour of 110, but just under 100 would also be feasible - and a sensible percentage for the auction."
"There is one thing we must not do: we must not make it too expensive for our passengers in Europe from more remote areas to travel by air - so, please, let us have a gentle introduction to emissions trading."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Mr Liese has produced an excellent report."
"Nevertheless, as PPE-DE Group shadow on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I support my group's amendments, which seek what we think is a better balance between wish and reality."
"In my view, the emissions trading scheme is the most cost-efficient, demand-sensitive and objective market-based instrument available for reaching Europe's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 20% by 2020."
"The aviation sector's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is growing fast, and I therefore fully support its inclusion in the emissions trading scheme."
"We must have a single start date."
"I think 2011 is a reasonable compromise between the different dates we have before us."
"And with this, Europe will lead the way strongly for the rest of the world."
"The amount of allowances allocated by auctioning should be set at a reasonably high and increasing level, in order to avoid the disadvantages for competition which are associated with grandfathering and benchmarking."
"Auctioning is much more economically efficient; it encourages new entrants, innovation, and the reduction of emissions through technological and operational improvements."
"The revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances should be reinvested in R&D in the aviation industry."
"There is much potential for technological innovation, to reduce the sector's CO2 emissions."
"Furthermore, the single European sky, which the Commission mentioned, when fully implemented will reduce CO2 emissions by up to 12%, and this should be put into operation with urgency."
"In our amendments we have highlighted the importance of giving special consideration to remote and isolated regions."
"Now we can only hope that the Council will respond positively to Parliament's insistent wake-up call."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his fair and constructive cooperation over the last few months."
"The inclusion of aviation in emissions trading is the first legislative procedure after the Spring Summit, at which the Heads of State or Government set some ambitious goals."
"We in the European Parliament have also put the topic right at the top of our political agenda by setting up the Temporary Committee on Climate Change."
"Experts and climate researchers have reminded us in hearings in the Committee on Climate Change that we must reverse the trend in CO2 emissions in the next 8 to 10 years."
"After that, emissions must not increase any further; instead, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced so that global warming can be kept to less than two degrees."
"The starting date of 1 January 2010 that was voted on in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has central significance."
"We need to have 2010 as the starting date because there is no time to waste in combating climate change and the 'braking distance' in climate change matters is very long and increases with the passing of time."
"As far as the Commission draft is concerned, that is, the distinction between flights within Europe and intercontinental flights, I must say that I am very glad - Mr Jarzembowski mentioned this - that we in Parliament are agreed that we want one single starting date."
"As well as the time-related components, the upper limit for the emissions allowances to be issued is very significant."
"Here we need to proceed realistically and be ambitious."
"Capping emissions from aviation at 80% of the 2004-2006 figure is a good and fair approach."
"This capping is necessary so that the 87% increase from aviation between 1990 and 2004 does not undermine the reduction in other industrial sectors."
"To ensure that allowances fetch an appropriate price so that the emissions trading scheme can be effective, the proportion of allowances to be auctioned off must be much higher than the Commission has proposed."
"Therefore, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament suggests increasing the proportion of emissions allowances to be auctioned to 25%."
"As far as revenues from auctioning off the allowances are concerned, the Member States should use these for measures to adjust to climate change and for the fight against climate change, both within and outside the European Union."
"Another important matter: all aircraft upwards of a take-off weight of 5.7 tonnes must be included in the emissions trading scheme."
"Tomorrow we shall vote on an amendment that provides for only aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of more than 20 tonnes to be included."
"Our aim must not be to leave business jets out of the emissions trading scheme while fully including aircraft carrying holidaymakers."
"I should like to think that tomorrow we shall be bold in moving towards more climate protection, and I hope that tomorrow we shall set it in motion."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my thanks in the first instance to the two rapporteurs on this topic, Mr Liese and Mr Jarzembowski, who evidently did not always have a smooth ride together on this topic."
"Together with investment in new technologies and the creation of further infrastructure, emissions trading can make an important contribution to the reduction of CO2 emissions in aviation."
"In doing so, emissions trading must allow growth rather than hindering it."
"It should provide incentives to renew fleets and create more efficient, more modern aircraft."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is making the case for including all airlines in a single starting date of 2011."
"In our view, the emissions from 2004-2006 should serve as a basis."
"This rewards those airlines that have updated and modernised their fleet in the past."
"My group proposes setting the cap at 90%."
"This is ambitious, more ambitious than the Commission's proposal, but not excessive."
"A maximum of 30% of the allowances should be auctioned off, in our opinion, to make it easier for new operators to enter the market."
"The revenues from the auction should primarily be used by the aviation sector to reduce emissions."
"We are also in favour of increasing the take-off weight to 20 tonnes, because we want to keep the bureaucratic hurdles for small operators to a minimum."
"I make the case for including aviation in a trading system that is as open and efficient as possible."
"Limiting how credits can be used makes no sense ecologically."
"Just as every gram of CO2 emitted must be regarded in the same way, the reduction of emissions, too, has the same effect everywhere."
"There are good economic reasons for unlimited, flexible access to credits if emissions can be reduced elsewhere less expensively."
"Aviation is vitally important to Europe's economic growth."
"Globalisation is unthinkable without airlines that are competitive."
"In future, people will want to fly more, not less, not only in Europe but also, in particular, to other parts of the world; we have to acknowledge this."
"The EU is single-handedly deciding to include aviation in emissions trading and is making both friends and enemies internationally in the process."
"If we Europeans want to lead the way in climate politics, we have to ask ourselves not only how far we should go but also how we can take everyone else with us. This question will come up again in Bali."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to distance ourselves from insular EU solutions in climate policy."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Thank you, Mr President."
"Greenhouse gas emission trading is the correct response for reducing gas emissions in aviation."
"However we need to carefully evaluate the terms for introducing quotas in order to avoid distortion of competition for the Member States' aviation companies and EU residents' travel opportunities."
"The majority of air carriers in the new EU Member States are lagging far behind the aviation companies in the older Member States, in terms of both the number of passengers carried and greenhouse gas emission volumes per capita."
"It is difficult to evaluate the extent of the future growth of air carriers in the new EU Member States, but I am in no doubt that in order to balance the mobility indicators for residents of the Member States, transport volumes in the newer Member States must grow significantly."
"It will hamper the equalisation of EU residents' mobility if terms are not laid down in the rules for greenhouse gas emission trading to specify how rapidly growing aviation companies will be able to continue their growth, so that the resources spent on the acquisition of emission quotas do not act as a brake on their development."
"Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has supported the proposal to create a reserve for new aircraft operators, and this is the right approach."
"However, in order to ensure that aircraft operators with varying initial positions and growth trends, are treated equally, we ought to reserve part of the quotas for aircraft operators with rapidly growing capacity."
"Growth that exceeds the average EU annual rate of growth in passenger numbers by a factor of at least two could be taken as an indicator of rapid growth in capacity."
"Both of these proposals are vital for fostering competition in the EU air carrier industry. Thank you."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Liese for his excellent cooperation and congratulate him on his work."
"However, I have to say that I appreciated his work a lot more before he had to seek compromises within his political group, which, if adopted, would substantially weaken the position taken by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety just last month."
"That matters, because we have to substantially strengthen the Commission's original proposal if we are to have any real chance of seriously reducing the impact of aviation on our climate."
"According to the Commission's own figures, all its proposals are currently going to achieve is that, by 2020, instead of aviation emissions growing by 83% under a do-nothing scenario, they would grow instead by 78%."
"That reduction is the equivalent of less than one year's growth in air travel."
"That is not serious, it is not ambitious, it is not global leadership."
"To achieve emission reductions via trading relies crucially on scarcity of permits."
"Since aviation emissions have already doubled since 1990, to call for an initial allocation equivalent to average emissions over the period 2004-2006, or even 80-90% of that, is simply too generous."
"I therefore urge you to support my Group's amendments for an initial allocation that is 50% of that amount."
"We also need 100% auctioning so that there are no windfall profits at the expense of the passenger."
"Finally, I urge you to vote against the ALDE Group's frankly scandalous amendment, which seeks to remove the restrictions on access to clean development mechanism and joint implementation project credits, not just for aviation but for all sectors in the ETS."
"Removing such limits provides an open invitation to business as usual."
"Aviation and the other industries will be able to continue to increase their emissions without constraint by merely buying up the supposed reductions made elsewhere, and, considering recent reports that up to half of reductions from CDM and JI projects are questionable, this will fundamentally undermine the integrity of the entire scheme."
"Tomorrow the European Parliament faces a serious test of whether it really wants to take real action on climate change, and, if it is going to show genuine leadership, then it needs to support the Green amendments."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (GA) As the shadow rapporteur for the GUE/NGL Group, Jens Holm, is absent, please accept his apologies for the fact that he cannot be here with us for tonight's debate."
"It now falls to me to outline the GUE/NGL view."
"It is time for airlines to become involved in the efforts to combat climate change."
"Greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation have doubled since 1990 and account for between 5% and 12% of carbon dioxide emissions in the EU as a whole."
"The EU's leaders committed themselves in March of this year to achieving a 20% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions - compared with the 1990 level - by 2020."
"We now have an opportunity to show the wider world that we will meet those targets."
"The Commission proposal recommends that the aviation sector should not have to comply with the average for the years 2004 to 2006."
"That is more than 90% above the 1990 level."
"The Commission is also recommending that auctioning should account for no more than about 3% of the allowances."
"Airlines will have no incentive to lower their levels themselves if they can get their carbon emission permits free of charge."
"The auction percentage should be 100% - as we ourselves as well as the Greens are advocating - since this would be consistent with the 'polluter pays' principle."
"The GUE/NGL Group believes that the proportion of allowances to be allocated should be 20% of the average for the years 2004 to 2006; this would limit the amount of allowances that the aviation sector could buy from other sectors or under the ETS scheme; and the auction rate could rise to 100%."
"Airlines are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and throughout the world."
"It is time to put an end to special treatment and take into account the impact on the environment and on climate change."
"Mr President, climate change is a transboundary environmental problem and the EU is an important actor in the global climate work."
"Emissions are rising globally and time is short."
"The Swedish June List therefore supports the main thrust of the proposal we are debating this evening."
"Integrating aviation into the EU's emissions trading scheme is an obvious and cost-effective step in the climate work."
"However, it is not the trading in itself that leads to reduced emissions, but the total emissions ceiling which we choose to establish."
"The scheme needs to be broadened to include other climate-impacting sectors in order to achieve the climate goals we have set ourselves."
"We are in favour of the Committee's proposal of a single start date for the Directive."
"It is unacceptable that the Commission has allowed itself to be influenced by international political pressure aimed at delaying the climate work and distorting competition."
"The Directive should also apply to everyone."
"We cannot allow exceptions for particular persons or events."
"Our Heads of State must pay for their costs like the rest of us."
"Anything else would be unreasonable."
"Finally, I would like to point out that common environmental goals should not be used as a means to introduce a common tax policy."
"The revenues from the action should not be transferred to the EU as proposed by Amendment 14."
"Each Member State must be allowed to decide for itself how to use the revenues from the sale of emission allowances."
"Mr President, we propose to bring a new industry, aviation, into the European emissions trading system (ETS), yet that system is spectacularly failing."
"It has not reduced carbon emissions at all, yet it has created a whole new stratum of bureaucracy, administration and expense for industry."
"It has transferred large sums of money from countries which have been responsible with initial allocations to those which have been profligate, notably from Britain to France and Germany."
"Within Britain it has had the perverse effect of transferring funds from hospitals to big oil companies."
"The ETS has created a complex web of politically influential vested interests and rent seekers who have lobbied to manipulate the system for their own ends."
"The Commission's plans to get tough over allocations will simply move the problem on."
"With lax limits on allocations bought in from outside Europe, EU funds will flow to countries like China, where regulation is minimal and records may not be accurate."
"So big foreign polluters will make vast profits for little effort, great damage will be done to European economies and CO2 emissions will continue unchecked."
"Mr President, it is quite simply scandalous that we propose to bring a new industry into this failing system."
"I say to you that you must put your own house in order before you think of extending it."
"(DE) Mr President, it is always interesting to hear how some Members refuse to accept reality."
"I find the Commission proposal good."
"I also believe that Mr Liese has further improved it."
"This is a classic case of the internalising of external costs."
"Markets can function only if we create the right framework conditions."
"We have all undertaken to apply the 'polluter pays' principle, but this also means that those who bring the costs into being must also pay the price."
"This means including all costs, and that includes the environmental costs brought about by the CO2 emissions of aircraft."
"I also believe that we must bring more courage and ambition to this matter."
"We all know that for all of us, including many people in the United Kingdom, doing nothing in this case would be much more expensive than taking this step."
"However, we must also be fair."
"All sectors must contribute to this system."
"We know that CO2 emissions at a great height have a much more damaging effect than CO2 emissions on the ground."
"This must also be taken into account when we are talking about including these aircraft emissions."
"In addition, this is a sector that is characterised by very high growth rates."
"Secondly, we must also say that we have the potential to introduce various management measures to further limit these CO2 emissions."
"That must also be taken into account."
"The Community has an obligation to function as a role model in the international arena."
"We cannot expect other countries to get on board if we are not setting a good example."
"I also believe that we have significant opportunities here to build on the competitive advantage in this particular sector that we already have to some degree, so we should provide innovative companies, in particular, with the support they require."
"(NL) Mr President, first of all, my compliments to Mr Liese, who has prepared a superb report."
"My compliments also to our shadow rapporteur, Mr Groote."
"Aviation, like other sectors, must make a contribution to the fight against climate change."
"We cannot achieve the climate objective of a 20 or 30% reduction by 2020 unless everyone makes a contribution."
"The aviation industry is utterly opposed to receiving excessively tough action, but we hear this from all sectors, and if we appease everyone, absolutely nothing will come of our climate policy."
"Thus, it is a good thing that the Commission wants to bring aviation within the ETS, but it has been rather too generous in terms of the number of emission allowances it plans to allocate to the sector."
"In my opinion, 80% of emissions should really be the upper limit."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety rightly wants to see a gradual decrease in this ceiling, in line with the European climate objective of a 20 or 30% reduction."
"Aircraft operators have promised a 50% increase in the efficiency of aircraft engines."
"The Committee on the Environment intends to hold them to this, and that is a good thing: the more economical the better."
"A third important point concerns the auctioning of allowances."
"In my view, as many as possible should be auctioned: 25% is really the minimum."
"The proceeds of the auction must go towards combating climate change and, in particular, to adapting developing countries to climate change."
"The least developed countries make hardly any contribution to climate change but have to suffer its gravest consequences."
"This legislation enables us to do something about this."
"Mr President, I have here a letter from General Motors complaining about Parliament's position on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from cars."
"I have another letter from British Airways - another bit of special pleading - complaining about this measure and how the extra costs will mean it will be more difficult for them to invest in the lower carbon technology in planes that they wish to have."
"I do not believe a word of these letters!"
"Just special pleading from one industry after another."
"Have none of these executives read the United Nations report?"
"This report says that, within 20 years, up to two billion people will face severe water scarcity, partly because of climate change."
"We have to do something about this."
"Michael O'Leary of Ryanair may be the unacceptable face of public relations for the airline industry, but he speaks a lot of truth when he says, very clearly, that he does not give a toss for the environment so long as he can stuff his pockets and those of his company full of gold."
"Well, we have to provide some balance."
"We have to ensure and facilitate the position of our constituents who enjoy travel, but we also have to make sure that the concerns for the environment are properly addressed."
"Now, this measure here goes a small way towards slowing the spectacular growth of the airline industry."
"It will encourage the industry to invest in abatement measures."
"It will ensure that at least the basic principle that the polluter pays should be incorporated into our approach."
"But above all we have to ensure that we have a cap which encourages measures to be taken, a cap which, I think, must be at least a little bit more ambitious than that currently proposed by the Commission."
"- (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, may I thank all the rapporteurs."
"We are faced with a complex problem."
"On the one hand we have environmental considerations relating to our atmosphere, while on the other we have to contend with the development of air travel, an important source of economic activity, embracing transport and tourism and operated in a very competitive market."
"Decisions on this matter must be prudent and unambiguous, but in no case should they discriminate against European carriers, including those from the new Member States."
"This could be very damaging to European aviation without achieving the goal of a reduction in harmful gas emissions."
"It is obvious that the earth's atmosphere knows no borders."
"Inclusion of carbon dioxide emissions from civil aviation in the EU scheme must therefore be recognised as legitimate."
"In addition, I am of the opinion that we should take account of emissions of other gases too, such as toxic oxides of nitrogen."
"I feel that the most important actions are those that will effectively restrict harmful gas emissions through the use of innovative solutions in the aircraft engine sphere, the design of aircraft with better aerodynamic parameters, and a radical improvement in air traffic control that limits unnecessary time spent airborne."
"I see emissions trading at this time as something of a substitute."
"I would see it as sensible today to accept a baseline period of 2007-2009, to set an emissions ceiling at a level of between 5 to 10% over 100% in view of the rising interest in flying, and to include in addition non-EU carriers operating within the EU."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is one of the most serious problems we face."
"If we want to safeguard our future, we can no longer ignore the environmental question and we must be ready to change our lifestyles, particularly in terms of mobility."
"Transport is one of the sectors that contributes most to energy consumption and the one that relies most on the use of fossil fuels."
"Within this sector, aviation is playing an increasing role."
"In 2004, greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the EU rose by 87% compared with 1990."
"Europe is responsible for around half of CO2 emissions from aviation."
"This trend is no longer sustainable and it is essential that we take proper measures, for example by cancelling the tax benefits for this industry."
"I believe that the Commission's proposal for a directive on emissions quotas for aviation is a vital tool for tackling head-on the problems relating to climate change and we welcome the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that reinforces the original directive."
"However, and it is important to underline this, we need to maintain some qualifying points in the debate and vote that will be held tomorrow."
"Of these, I think the Community emissions trading system should apply to all flights, both to and from the EU."
"This cannot be put off until after 2010."
"It is also important that a significant proportion of quotas are allocated by auction and the proceeds of these must be used to subsidise the cleanest forms of transport, for example by abolishing taxes on environmentally-friendly transport, in order to create low-cost tourism that uses less polluting forms of transport such as trains."
"We also need to encourage research into more efficient aircraft engines and more effective air traffic management."
"I hope Parliament will not devalue the compromise put forward, which will allow Europe to become a leader in the fight against climate change."
"(NL) Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland."
"The proposal to incorporate aviation into the emissions trading scheme should be a clear signal from the European Union of the need to contribute to the ambitious reduction targets agreed at the start of this year."
"In the light of this, the parliamentary committee responsible has endorsed the Commission proposal and even pushed for it to be tightened up."
"Last week it seemed we were on course to reach an agreement at first reading."
"This hope was reinforced by the Council Presidency but proved to be unfounded, as no mandate could be obtained from the Council."
"This week it is important, in my opinion, that we do not settle for a dilution of the Commission proposal but strive for a proposal with clear ambitions in order to be consistent with the course charted this spring with regard to emission reduction."
"Thus, I wholeheartedly support the course charted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"(DE) Mr President, I agree with the points that almost all the other Members made."
"I say 'almost' all the Members, and will concentrate, therefore, on three formal aspects."
"Point 1: We do it over and over again in this Parliament, and today we are doing it again: we relegate important legislative proposals to the evening sitting."
"That way, we ensure that as few people as possible are listening and that, with only a very few exceptions, there is nobody sitting in the visitors' gallery, and we ensure that journalists, who should be reporting all this, are most likely already giving their attention to other things in the evening."
"Secondly, we are always hearing, and we have heard in this debate too, that we, the European Parliament, have to stick our necks out at first reading and take particularly demanding positions, as the Council will subsequently put the brakes on anyway, and in the end we shall not get where we want to go."
"I caution against this position: it was true for a long time but is increasingly no longer the case."
"We saw it in relation to the air-quality regulations, for example, where there have been and still are initiatives where the Heads of State or Government, and even the Ministers for the Environment, have gone a long way with us even at first reading."
"With the results we have decided upon, that will mean that in 10 to 15 years, in Central Europe, we shall have to cordon off all cities between Nuremberg and Bologna because we cannot keep within the values that have been set."
"Thirdly, here in the European Parliament, we must implement a viable working relationship to achieve sensible joint solutions."
"In what has occurred in relation to this Directive over the past weeks and months, I see a successful path and a successful attempt to do that."
"Environmental, transport, economic and industrial matters are not yet included in a wise compromise, but they will be, I believe, after the result of tomorrow's vote."
"Now all we have to do is persuade the rest of the world to join in and do something for the environment."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that it is lovely it is to see Mr Dimas back."
"It is pretty much accepted that the carbon emissions in relation to aviation are currently a very small proportion of the overall carbon emissions of the EU."
"But you would have to be a fool not to see the incredible growth in the sector in recent years and to recognise that the industry's own plans for expansion are enormous."
"Currently, the technology for alternative, less polluting fuels are limited in relation to aviation."
"This is why it makes absolute sense to accept that aviation is likely to continue to grow, but we need to ensure that this growth is offset in other sectors of the economy which do have alternatives in terms of reducing carbon emissions."
"That is why it is essential that aviation is brought into the emissions trading scheme (ETS)."
"I would also like to underline the point that the EU has a principle that it is the polluter who should pay."
"Under the current ETS, far from the polluter paying, we have seen many polluters making windfall profits thanks to the ETS."
"This has to stop."
"It is right, therefore, that many of these carbon creators should be auctioned, especially when the wholesale reform happens."
"Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of this debate is the question of where ETS auction money should be spent."
"In the forthcoming ETS review, there is potentially EUR 200 billion which could be raised if we went for full auctioning."
"I am sure many of us could think of countless ways to spend that kind of money, but I believe it would be sensible if we could steer this money via the EU budget, if possible, to spend on climate change initiatives which could include transfers of finance to the developing world including, for example, to pay for reforestation in developing or emerging countries."
"But, also, there needs to be recognition that even in our own Member States we are likely to see a huge increase in terms of energy poverty."
"Perhaps we should think about steering the money in this direction as well."
"So the decisions we make tomorrow will give an indication of where we should go, in terms of the ETS reform as a whole."
"(NL) Mr President, instead of all manner of ineffectual taxes and charges, the Commission is proposing the present market-based instrument; a choice I endorse wholeheartedly."
"It is environmentally effective, economically efficient and eminently suitable for broader application; at least, it has the potential to be all of these things."
"It became clear quite early on that opinions in this House are somewhat divided."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety ended up diametrically opposed to the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"My colleague Mr Krahmer has said all that needs to be said about that."
"Compromise amendments have now been drawn up, and tomorrow's vote will show whether or not emotion leads the way."
"Climate issues are hot, and voting Green is extremely sexy."
"There is not so much wrong with that in itself, but as I see it, a stranglehold on the European aviation sector and the associated employment cannot be the intention."
"I consider it counterproductive to attempt to artificially diminish one particular mode of transport, in this case aviation, in favour of another."
"All the evidence suggests that demand for high-speed transport outstrips supply."
"We need all modes of transport; we really cannot manage with trains and buses alone."
"The aim was to develop a model that was as workable as possible and could be extended and/or copied worldwide - and, yes, if we really want to be environmentally effective, the latter is of vital importance."
"If not, our efforts will remain just a tiny drop in the proverbial ocean, and that is what I should like to avoid."
"Mr Rack put it so aptly when he said just now that, to be effective, we have to persuade the rest of the world, as only then will our action be of any use."
"(PT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member elected for one of the seven outermost regions, I must inform this House of the immense concern in those regions regarding the implementation of the directive under discussion."
"That is for one simple reason: the outermost regions are almost exclusively dependent on air transport and any increase in the price of that service, which would inevitably arise from the implementation of the directive, will make access more difficult, increasing their isolation, which was a determining factor in granting the outermost regions special status at European level, as enshrined in Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty."
"On the other hand, the increase in air transport costs will result in an even greater competitive disadvantage for those regions, penalising tourism, the main economic activity for the majority of them."
"We can expect a reduction in the number of tourists and/or in the amount each of them spends, which could lead to a drop of at least 2% in GDP according to studies carried out by the Government of the Canary Islands."
"Yet improving the accessibility of outermost regions to reduce their isolation, and promoting their competitiveness, are two of the three major EU policy priorities for the outermost regions set out in the Commission communication, 'A stronger partnership for the outermost regions', which Parliament fully supported."
"We have to highlight how contrary to and inconsistent with those priorities the implementation of this directive will be."
"I think that, for the first time we have before us an EU legislative act which would have the effect of increasing the isolation of these regions."
"Certainly Amendments 5 and 6 tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats following a compromise between the rapporteur, Mr Liese - whom I must congratulate on his excellent work - and Mr Jarzembowski and Mrs De Veyrac, do to some extent offset the effects of the directive, but they are not enough."
"I therefore call on the three institutions to try to find better solutions, in the next stages of the legislative process, to lessen the impact of this directive on the outermost regions."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapidly growing aviation sector must be integrated into the emissions trading scheme as quickly as possible."
"That will mean that this form of transport also starts making a contribution to the reduction of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect."
"From the point of view of transport policy, our legislative task now is to refine the framework conditions."
"These framework conditions must be defined in such a way that the possible impetus for savings is provided via an appropriate price per tonne of CO2, without drastically limiting the number of flights."
"To achieve this, when the airlines are first issued with allowances, for example, this must be done in such a way that the lack of such allowances can be realistically balanced out on the market, otherwise flights would have to be cancelled, and I do not know how much of that we and our society could cope with."
"Even if airlines were issued with 100% allowances upon entering the scheme - and none of us is asking for that - an annual growth in aviation of 5% would require an equally high volume of savings in terms of CO2 emissions."
"That is no small challenge."
"The greatest potential for reduction is in the realisation of the Single European Sky, which means that it depends on the political will of the Member States."
"The airlines' only option for the time being, therefore, is to update their fleets, if there is sufficient capital left over for this purpose after the planned auction sums are taken into account."
"That will hardly be the case for regional airlines."
"Mr President, bearing in mind that politics is the art of the possible and that sometimes the best can be the enemy of the good, I would like to thank my colleague Mr Liese for the tremendous effort he has put in to reach a position - an agreement - not least amongst all of us in the PPE-DE Group but also with colleagues across this House."
"International aviation is outside Kyoto obligations, and the complete lack of progress in ICAO over the 10 years that they have been mandated to address emissions makes it important that the EU takes the lead."
"The proposed emissions trading scheme should apply to all flights, including from third countries, from a common start date for competitiveness reasons."
"I would now like to concentrate the remainder of my two minutes on one point that I do not think any other colleague has raised."
"It is a point that is a very serious national problem for Ireland."
"Under the proposal, fungibility or convertibility of aviation allowances to Kyoto allowances free of charge is proposed."
"An airline may demand conversion of its aviation allowances to these Kyoto-backed allowances, and the issuing Member State must comply."
"This is a huge problem for us in Ireland, because, if airlines were to convert free of charge, we would have to replace these Kyoto allowances by those that the Irish state would have to buy on the market at full market price."
"The Irish registry will carry a disproportionate share of flights on our books due to the size and geographic spread of some airlines, as the airlines, particularly Ryanair, are registered with the Irish Aviation Authority for all of their EU operations."
"The success of Ryanair means that they have 20 operational bases across the EU serving almost 130 destinations and, yes, increasing."
"But they operate only a small proportion of those flights in Ireland."
"I would like the Commission specifically to say whether it will accept Amendment 47, which deletes those particularly difficult sentences."
"The polluter-pays principle cannot be interpreted to mean that the Irish taxpayer pays for pollution in our fellow EU Member States."
"(FI) Mr President, urgent action is needed to fight climate change and, just as has been said here, all industries that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere have to be involved in that action."
"Aviation cannot be given a free ride."
"The greenhouse gases from air traffic are increasing fast."
"This is important to remember, as it is often said that air traffic only accounts for two or three per cent of greenhouse gas emissions."
"As said before, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation have increased by as much as a half since 1990."
"The idea now to include air traffic in emissions trading is specifically an EU proposal."
"The purpose is also to establish a global system over the longer term, one where air traffic also shares the burden."
"We might now learn a lesson from the drawbacks of the general emissions trading directive and increase the proportion of auctioned allowances in the initial allocation of rights."
"The initial allocation, and the system as a whole, must encourage a reduction in emissions, so that short air journeys are replaced with train journeys, and that would suit especially well those regions with a dense urban network and population."
"On the other hand, we have problems in areas where there are fewer inhabitants and which are a long way from urban centres, and it is important that the European system should take account of remote areas in a balanced way."
"(NL) Mr President, by introducing emissions trading into aviation, Europe shows ambition, the ambition to tackle CO2 emissions and combat climate change."
"After all, nowhere in the world to date - not even in California - has such an ambitious approach been proposed."
"Even compared to the emissions trading scheme for industry, this is a very ambitious plan."
"However, what did our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety do?"
"It tightened up this proposal considerably on the key points, and thus we have flown past our objective."
"Europe must show leadership, but leadership means not only taking the lead, but also persuading others, winning them over - and this in the extremely competitive environment of international aviation."
"Therefore, the new regime should on no account lead to high costs and bureaucracy, particularly for Europe's airlines, but there must be a gain for the climate."
"A net climate benefit must emerge, preferably worldwide."
"I am pleased, therefore, that amendments have now been tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and also by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which I expect to steer us onto a realistic course tomorrow."
"This is necessary in order to promote cleaner flying in practice, too, as having to go through the bureaucratic mill of an auction - even with clean aircraft - is hardly salutary."
"As regards the number of available allowances, too, I look forward to a more realistic outcome tomorrow."
"However, this proposal alone will certainly not suffice."
"The Commission and the European Parliament must stand shoulder to shoulder to bring about the Single European Sky, as five times more environmental gain is to be achieved from that."
"Mr President, I hope that we can step up the pressure on Member States in this regard, too, as only then can we make a real difference to the climate."
"Mr President, tonight, for once, Parliament really can lead the way in protecting the environment."
"I think, as Mr Belder said, the Commission was really a bit timid in its original proposal."
"The European public, I think, will be looking to this Parliament to set the highest standards and ambitious targets."
"As a member of the Committee on Transport, and along with my colleagues in the PSE Group, I did not support Mr Jarzembowski's line that was pushed through with, I regret to say, the support of the Liberal Group, the ALDE Group."
"We wanted to strengthen the original proposal, not to water it down."
"So I say congratulations to Mr Liese for his report, and I quote, 'we do not just inherit this planet from our ancestors, our parents, we borrow it from our children'."
"And, like Ms Lucas, I appeal to all the groups in this Parliament to think about how they vote tomorrow; be prepared to compromise, be sensible, be realistic, but above all, be positive, because Parliament has a chance to be at the forefront of protecting the environment for 500 million citizens and their descendants."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, many thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Liese, for his good report, and to Mr Jarzembowski."
"I believe that, overall, the compromises are very workable."
"Politics often depends on symbols, and we are sending a clear signal here: it is the first legislative proposal since the Spring Summit."
"Thus we are beginning actively to implement climate protection."
"The seven key points of this report - the commencement of emissions trading, the reference period, the number of permits, the use of the proceeds, exceptions for smaller aircraft and the method of calculation - have, in my view, been sufficiently and reliably addressed in the compromises."
"I do not wish for any derogations, although I do believe a special additional arrangement for the outermost regions is required, so that these areas are not disadvantaged."
"I believe that the proposal is very good and that competition has been sufficiently acknowledged."
"We should not forget: even if 100% of the allowances are auctioned - purely theoretically, as we have just heard - that is a sum of EUR 2 billion, definitely a manageable sum for the airlines, which will, no doubt, have an effect on the setting of prices."
"However, I do not envisage any problems with this, including in connection with the large number of flights."
"I should like to see the EU push further ahead with this in the context of climate protection, and I hope that we can convince all the other major competing airlines to join this agreement."
"Mr President, civil aviation seemed to be a luxury in the past, when mostly the rich and the so-called jet society used the advantages of quick flights."
"Nowadays, at least in the European Union, civil aviation is a necessary part of our life, without which the Parliament and the Council simply could not work."
"If the distance from Brussels is more than 1 000 km, there is no realistic alternative to flights in the absence of rapid trains."
"With the accession of the new Member States and the boom in low-fare airlines, we have two or three times more flights than before the enlargement of the EU."
"International aviation is not yet covered by the Kyoto Protocol."
"However, direct emissions from aviation account for about 3% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions, and this is increasing fast."
"I think that the quantity of the three allowances should have been based on the emission rate per capita of greenhouse gases in the different Member States, as there are large differences between them."
"I feel that it is unfair that western European countries have the right to emit around three times more greenhouse gas from aviation as Hungary and other new Member States."
"I think this principle should be applied in other environmental policies requiring a total amount of decrease instead of a percentage decrease."
"Otherwise, those who polluted less in the past will be punished."
"- (SV) Aviation must pay for its environmental costs, and therefore this proposal is good."
"Aviation cannot be exempt from environmental costs which other means of transport pay."
"But I have a problem with the frenzy against aviation permeating this debate as if it were the greatest environmental villain and the best thing would be if we stopped flying completely."
"That is quite simply not true."
"Aviation accounts for five per cent of carbon dioxide emissions."
"A full aircraft uses less fuel per passenger kilometre than a car."
"It can and must be made even better, but through us making tough demands on the aviation industry which drive developments forward, not through us stopping flying."
"Travelling and meeting people from other parts of the world is important."
"I am convinced that Ryanair has done more for understanding among the peoples of Europe that the EU's cultural projects together."
"Less travel must therefore not be an end in itself."
"Isolating people takes us back in history to a dark period."
"The Commission's proposal is heading in the right direction, but it has a cynical perspective - that it is someone else who should fly less."
"An attempt has been made to exempt flights by Heads of State or Government, while at the same time citizens are required to act responsibly."
"Proposals like this cause politicians to be held in well-deserved contempt, and I am glad that we on the Committee on the Environment have removed these particular formulations."
"Equally cynical is how a number of Left colleagues are demanding that we reduce aviation by more than half in only a matter of years."
"Those who make such proposals are unlikely themselves to take the train from, for example, Stockholm to Brussels."
"It is as if their own journeys are invaluable but others travel just for fun."
"With that kind of irresponsible proposal it will be ordinary people who are forced to pay, not politicians and corporate executives, where someone else picks up the bill."
"It will be students who can no longer afford to study abroad in order to go out and see the world."
"It will be grandmothers up in Norrland who will not be able to see their grandchildren in the city so often."
"It takes us back to a time in the 1980s when an SAS cabin consisted only of corporate executives, politicians and union bosses."
"Instead we shall vote tomorrow for tough but realistic demands on the aviation industry which force them to pay for their environmental costs, which force the development of better and more environmentally friendly aircraft technology, but which above all make it possible to prioritise, to compare aviation with the real carbon dioxide villains, like coal-fired power stations."
"The important thing is that emissions are reduced, not flying."
"- (PT) Mr President, whilst agreeing with the Commission's and the rapporteur's proposal, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that it is not in line with Parliament's objectives set out specifically in the report on reducing the climate change impact of aviation;"
"I would draw attention especially to the situation of the most isolated territories which are particularly dependent on air transport, especially the outermost regions."
"Nor does it follow the line of the question raised by the Commission itself in its communication of last September on a 'Strategy for the Outermost Regions'. I quote: 'What measures are needed to prevent the aim of reducing emissions from adversely affecting the accessibility, economy and citizens of the ORs?'"
"In voting for Amendments 99 and 100 supported by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Parliament will be addressing the issues raised through possibly setting up an impact assessment and suitable mediating measures to ensure that the outermost regions are included in the emissions trading scheme in the future - a necessary step that must be done in an appropriate way and guarantee environmental and economic sustainability and mobility in those regions, which are totally dependent on air transport due to their geographical situation."
"- (PL) Mr President, today we are discussing a draft resolution on the inclusion of European civil aviation in the EU's emissions trading scheme."
"In my view, this very important draft was drawn up in haste, without proper consultation with the aviation industry, especially representatives of the new Member States, and without analysis of the economic and social consequences of its introduction, as well as from the aspect of environmental protection and of the consequences for civil aviation and the threat to Europe's economic development, for example in the sphere of tourism, which is the main source of income for very many regions."
"The draft also constitutes a threat to the competitiveness of airlines and may cause a radical deterioration in the already difficult financial situation of many European aviation companies."
"I therefore think that the earliest start time for inclusion of the aviation sector in the scheme for all communications is 2012."
"I definitely support the scheme's so-called broad geographical scope, in other words the inclusion of all flights from and to the EU, regardless of the national attribution of the carrier."
"This is the only solution that guarantees that the required environmental effect is achieved and that does not expose European carriers to a drastic fall in competitiveness."
"In my view, the total number of allowances allocated to the aviation sector should be set at Community level by reference to mean emission levels arising from aviation, at least for the years 2005-2007, while the emissions limit should be set at a level of 100%."
"Bearing in mind the diverse positions presented during the course of our discussion and the fact that this project relates both to the environment and to the economies of all EU states, as well as to our citizens, we should take decisions that are both measured and good."
"Mr President, I guess I come from one of those ultra-peripheral regions, in this case called Finland."
"If I was not able to fly here, it would probably take me two days to get here."
"This is not by bike: it is by boat, car and train."
"That is just by way of introduction."
"I think there are really six points here, and I would like to focus on one - but I will go through all six."
"Point number one: entry into force - I would go for the EPP-ED compromise, in other words, 2011."
"Caps on emission rights: for me, 95%."
"Reference, yes, for me: 2005-2007; auction, for me: 25%; profits: partly back to the airlines, and then partly to other good climate change causes."
"But for me the big issue is number 6: the allocation basis; in other words, ATK versus RTK."
"Now, I realise that this is a difficult issue for many, but for me it is not an environmental issue in that sense."
"Really, the cap has already been set."
"What we are talking about with ATK and RTK is the allocation between the different airlines."
"Neither system is perfect, but we cannot be in a situation where airlines coming from the more peripheral areas will be punished and unequally treated in comparison to those airlines which might be based in Frankfurt, Berlin, London, Brussels or Paris."
"Train is not an option for us: it is that simple."
"The way in which climate change is going, I am afraid the only place where we are going to have snow in the winter in the future is going to be Lapland."
"I know that those flights might be full going up there, but they may not always be full coming down, so we have to be very careful that we do not make this into a race to the bottom."
"So I would urge all of my friends and colleagues tomorrow to vote on ATK rather than RTK."
"It is a life and death issue for the peripheral areas, but I know it is not a life and death issue for those coming from the middle."
"It remains to be seen whether Father Christmas's sleigh will be included in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community."
"- (PL) Mr President, I fly here from Kraków, where it was white over yesterday and snow had covered the entire city, so it is not so bad yet."
"Protection of the natural environment and countering negative climate changes have become a challenge for the whole of humankind."
"As an EU citizen, I highly value involvement in the protection of the European Union's environment."
"However, we should never forget the impact of legislation in this area on the European economy."
"In discussing the directive on CO2 emissions in aviation today we have run up against this problem."
"Air transport is currently experiencing a sharp increase."
"This concerns the new Member States in particular, where this market is developing exceptionally rapidly, providing an increasing number of jobs."
"On the macro scale, this is leading to a rise in GDP."
"It is consequently my view that the new Member States should have the opportunity to adapt the level of development of aviation to that of the old Member States, which could be achieved by having a very long introductory period for the directive."
"The new directive in its proposed form may hinder the development of this sector, which would be contrary to the policy of creating a level playing field in the Community."
"A further hazard is a loss of competitiveness among European companies compared with third countries, so it is a matter of importance that the new regulations are accepted globally, not just by the European Union."
"I would like to avail myself of the opinion held by scientists and comment that no development of new technologies capable of effectively reducing CO2 emission levels in aviation is anticipated."
"It is therefore of exceptional importance to seek restrictions on gas emissions wherever this is feasible."
"One effective tool is the modernisation of air traffic control, where, according to analysts, fuel consumption savings of between 6 and 12% may be achieved."
"To conclude, I would like to emphasise that in conducting a pro-environment policy we should bear in mind its impact on each Member State."
"The baseline period should therefore, in my opinion, cover as far-reaching a period as possible, in other words the years 2007-2009."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all the speakers in tonight's debate for their positive contributions and I would like to turn to the details of some of the amendments."
"There are many amendments that are acceptable, at least in part or in principle."
"For example, the Commission accepts that it would be useful to require aircraft operators to develop monitoring and reporting plans."
"Operators in the current scheme must also do this to obtain a greenhouse gas permit."
"This will facilitate credible verification and thus safeguard the environmental integrity of the scheme by preventing fraud."
"Other examples include the exemption of certain activities such as humanitarian or firefighting flights."
"However, while I fully agree that we need to get started as soon as possible, a 2010 start date would be very challenging."
"There would be insufficient time to complete the preparatory work and, in particular, to complete the allocation process which requires more lead time than the process used in the current system."
"Regarding the scope, I have already explained why the Commission still believes a two-step approach would be helpful to convince third countries that the European Union is ready to take the lead, consistent with our special obligations as a region of developed countries."
"Regarding the call for more auctioning, I am well aware that this is in line with the growing consensus about the advantages of auctioning and I expect we will soon discuss this a lot more in the context of the general ETS review."
"However, in the period before 2013, aviation should be treated as much as possible like other sectors."
"The share of allowances auctioned should therefore be the average percentage of auctioning applicable to other sectors, as laid down in the national allocation plans for 2008-2012."
"What happens after 2012 should depend on the general review of the ETS."
"Finally, I will share with you some concerns we have regarding amendments that relate to limits on the use of non-aviation credits, to the use of a multiplier for non-carbon dioxide effects and to an additional energy efficiency factor."
"These amendments all have the effect of limiting the possibility of aviation operators to use allowances, other than aviation allowances, to cover their emissions."
"This is not consistent with the fundamental idea of open emissions trading, which is what ensures cost-effective solutions."
"Moreover, these changes would complicate the scheme significantly."
"The Commission's proposal already provides aircraft operators with extra incentives to improve fuel efficiency."
"There is, in our view, no need for additional features that will just make it more complicated."
"In summary, the Commission can support 27 of the 100 proposed amendments fully, in part or in principle."
"I will give Parliament's secretariat a list detailing the Commission's position on the amendments, including Amendment 47 for which I would like to say that the Commission will maintain the provisions which foresee a change of the registry regulation, but is open to consider ways to ensure that conversion of aviation allowances does not burden Member States' compliance with a Kyoto target."
"Commission's position on amendments by Parliament"
"Liese report"
"The Commission can support fully, in part, or in principle 27 amendments: Numbers 1, 3-5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 17, 26, 29, 30, 36-38, 40, 45, 47, 49, 51-53, 57, 65, 70, 76, 79."
"The amendments which the Commission cannot support are Numbers 2, 6, 9, 11-13, 15, 16, 18-25, 27, 28, 31-35, 39, 41-44, 46, 48, 50, 54-56, 58-60, 61-64, 66-69, 71-75, 77, 78, 80-100."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, from 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) The need to act quickly and effectively to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is an obvious fact that can no longer be denied."
"Within this context, reducing the impact of transport on global warming will play a decisive role."
"The text we are discussing is one of the measures taken to achieve this, and I support this initiative."
"This legislation, however, will only be a success if we manage to reconcile the environmental objective with the objective of mobility for citizens, while respecting countries outside the EU."
"It is therefore essential that we achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions at the lowest possible cost for passengers."
"What is demanded of aviation should be sufficient not to compromise the reductions achieved by other sectors but balanced enough not to penalise the growth of the aviation sector."
"That is why I believe that targets for reducing CO2 emissions that are too rapid and too harsh, though laudable from a purely environmental point of view, are out of touch with reality and are in danger of having a counterproductive effect."
"I hope our vote tomorrow will take account of these different parameters."
"in writing. - (FI) We are to introduce a unique system, with air traffic having its own climate policy instrument."
"Emissions trading in the area of air traffic involves risk factors, and I appeal to you all to pay attention to one or two important issues."
"Although we are, with good reason, worried about increasing emissions from aviation, air traffic itself is nonetheless the future."
"I might even say it is inevitable for the environment."
"For example, according to the highly regarded MIPS survey on the overall incidence of environmental pollution, air traffic has its own benefits and would appear to be a solution for the future."
"Completely emissions-free aviation would thus solve the problems of emissions from transport, and that should be our priority objective."
"For that reason, in the building of compromises I wanted to channel revenue from emissions trading specifically into research and development in the area of aviation."
"If the growth in emissions is really worrying, the available resources should be spent specifically on the development of emissions-free transport."
"Hopefully, the Council also understands how important this is."
"On the other hand, the directive should also ensure that the Union's peripheral regions are able to compete fairly in the emissions trading system."
"This is especially relevant in the matter of non-auctioned rights in the allocation system."
"The ATK ('available tonne kilometre') model, which is based on an aircraft's maximum capacity, would be the best way to guarantee fairness in emissions trading, and would ultimately be better for the climate."
"This is true because the system where non-auctioned emissions rights are allocated by volume of goods and passengers would encourage the use of connecting flights and flying via cities with massive volumes of passengers."
"A system meant to protect the climate should encourage a system where air fares tend to be determined more on the actual number of kilometres flown."
"At the moment it is frequently the case that longer, and therefore more climate-damaging flights, which also make a stop en route, are cheaper."
"That is not rational as far as the environment is concerned."
"in writing. - (RO) The inclusion of aviation into the European emissions trading scheme is a positive action, emphasizing Europe's pioneering work in combating climate changes."
"The aviation emissions trading should not cause a decrease in the number of flights and an increase in prices, negative consequences for passengers, for the aviation industry and for the sustainable development of transports."
"Under these conditions, it is important to solve the technical causes."
"The reduction in emissions can be achieved by manufacturing engines with a new design, which would ensure more efficiency in the fuel consumption, by improving the aircrafts' aerodynamics, using new metallic alloys and composite materials for building fuselages."
"We also have to take into consideration research in the field of alternative fuels."
"NASA has announced the launching of a programme to find solutions for improving kerosene."
"Therefore, it is necessary to supplement financial resources for research and development and to encourage private investments in this field, while the funds obtained from bids within the scheme should be used in the fields of research and aeronautical innovation, which are capable of providing concrete solutions."
"I also ask the Council and the Commission to continue their efforts in negotiation with the international bodies and the partner third countries in order to obtain all the necessary agreements as to avoid any international litigations in the case of enforcing these legal provisions."
"in writing. - Aviation should be brought within the scope of the Emissions Trading Scheme."
"The ETS has shown its worth since being set-up two years ago."
"It should be a useful means of ensuring that the aviation industry plays its part in the fight against climate change."
"However we also need to reform the scheme so that it can fulfil its role effectively."
"Of course, none of us believes that this development alone is the answer to the emissions problem but it does represent a significant step in the right direction."
"Furthermore, it shows that the political will is there to take difficult decisions for the benefit the planet and its inhabitants."
"What we must also see is essential reforms of the way the emissions trading scheme works."
"In all of this we must ensure that the consumer is not unfairly burdened with huge rises in the cost of flying and consider looking at other ways in which CO2 emissions from the aviation industry can be reduced."
"I am aware that EU Transport Ministers are currently doing this by examining ways of modernising air traffic control and introducing new systems of landing fees related to greenhouse gas emissions."
"in writing. - (HU) An ever-increasing proportion of the population of the developed world understands the threat posed by climate change."
"However, we need to take drastic steps if we are to reduce our emissions by 20% over 13 years."
"Unfortunately, we are hardly seeing any steps to take us in this direction."
"It doesn't matter which of the emitting areas we investigate, there will always be 'voices' that want to protect the very industry we are talking about now."
"At the same time, we know that we can only meet the target that has been set if we involve every affected area in reducing emissions."
"If we make an exception for one, we will have to make up for it somewhere else."
"Which one will be the odd one out?"
"Air travel today is a tiny area, but one that is growing dynamically."
"Its growth is closely linked to the global price of raw materials, on which it does itself have great influence."
"We as politicians will truly support European businesses from a strategic perspective if we create an environment for them that encourages innovation."
"None of this affects passengers, since the measures taken towards reducing CO2 will increase the ticket price for routes within Europe by a sum of no more than approximately EUR 1."
"This is a fraction of what we have to pay for anti-terrorism security measures!"
"Together with this, however, a good-quality railway of 1000 km must compete with aviation and, to achieve this, the airlines must bear the costs to which they give rise, to the same extent as we expect it of railways and road traffic."
"Comitology (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on comitology."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the comitology reform that was decided in July 2006 introduced a 'regulatory procedure with scrutiny', which gives a veto right to the European Parliament on measures of general scope that amend a basic legal act adopted under codecision."
"In the framework of this reform, the three institutions concluded a joint statement in which they committed themselves to adapt 26 priority basic acts to this new procedure, and the Commission adopted 26 priority alignment proposals at the end of last year."
"It is in our common interest to have these alignment instruments adopted as soon as possible."
"The Commission is therefore very pleased to see that Parliament is now ready to vote on several legislative resolutions, after having reached good and fair compromise solutions between the three institutions."
"Other important dossiers will be on the agenda of another session of the European Parliament later this month, and I am confident that we will be able to settle these dossiers as well."
"I want to thank the rapporteurs from the different committees for their very cooperative and constructive approach."
"Consequently, the whole package of the 26 priority alignment proposals could be ready for adoption before the end of this year."
"This would be a very good result which will pave the way to the so-called 'general alignment'."
"As you know, the Commission made a commitment to review all existing codecision basic legal acts, in addition to these 26 priority acts, with a view to bringing them into line with the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny."
"The Commission will respect this commitment and propose this general alignment of all non-priority acts."
"It concerns in total more or less 220 acts."
"This will take the form of four to five omnibus or package proposals, the first of which should arrive in the European Parliament shortly in November."
"The next two omnibus proposals will follow within a couple of weeks and the final proposal just before the end of the year, or very early next year."
"A third aspect of revising Parliament's scrutiny rights is the revision of the agreement concluded in 2000 between the Commission and Parliament on comitology procedures."
"Here I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, Mr Galeote and Mr Corbett for the excellent spirit of cooperation which prevailed throughout the negotiations."
"I would also like to thank them for recognising that the special procedures foreseen in the agreement will apply in all extremely urgent cases."
"I am pleased to announce that the results of these negotiations have been politically endorsed and that the Commission will be ready to proceed to the formal adoption of the revised agreement, as soon as Parliament formally endorses the outcome of the negotiations."
"I am confident that the agreement we reach will help our two institutions work more efficiently in the future."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, this discussion on comitology has been going on for a long time."
"On the basis of the Basel II report, the European Parliament has finally won rights of scrutiny that should actually be normal in a democracy, against huge opposition from the Council and opposition from the Commission."
"Now we must attend to adapting the directives accordingly. Here the focus has been on the question of adapting the relevant directives - and that is understandable."
"The question of the extent to which we adapt the directives legislatively is certainly an important aspect."
"However, the agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council is about how Parliament can be appropriately involved."
"The Commissioner expressed her hope that Parliament will adopt the relevant alignments in the current year."
"It is important to us that Parliament be informed about the processes in good time and that the exchange of information to Parliament via the comitology committees take place promptly."
"The actual implementation phase is yet to begin and time will tell whether or not this will strengthen the rights of Parliament."
"The same applies to requests for urgent debate."
"To take one example: accounting is next on the agenda, IFRS 8."
"Here the procedure was that we in the comitology process were, unfortunately, only informed by the Commission at the last minute."
"Then we were expected to take a decision relatively quickly."
"The key, apart from the formal alignment process, will be whether the Commission, the relevant Directorates-General, the officials working in this area, are willing to include Parliament in the work in good time."
"Only then will effective scrutiny be possible."
"This is where it will be revealed whether the Commission as a whole is for this or not."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, here we are, talking about comitology again."
"Basically it is a matter, as you said, of implementing the agreement that we all welcomed as a success when we entered into it in July 2006."
"There are two aspects to it: the practical aspect, which I will not go over again, but also its translation to each of the directives and, today, we are concerned with the 26 priority directives."
"I am speaking in relation to those referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"From that point of view, I would like to express our determination that the European Parliament's position, when it examines these 26 priority directives, should be as coherent as possible."
"The same comitology agreement needs to be applied to these 26 directives, hence the idea of a parallel approach."
"However, as we well know, in these negotiations the devil is in the detail, and we met him during these negotiations on three particular points I would like to mention briefly."
"The first point concerns something that, within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - but not only there - has felt like a kind of provocation."
"On the subject of accounting standards, an area in which the European Parliament exercises its full powers and competencies, the Commission presented a proposal that said that urgency should be applied as an automatic procedure."
"We did not accept this and fortunately I see that we managed to get the Commission to back down on this point and forced it to give up its demands for systematic urgency, which would have deprived Parliament of an effective right of control in an area where, on the contrary, it has demonstrated its ability to be useful, effective and relevant."
"The second point is, of course, the issue of what are known as the 'sunset clauses' or revision clauses."
"The Commission and the Council really wanted these clauses to disappear."
"They felt that this was an inherent element of the comitology agreement made last year."
"In a spirit of cooperation, we have ensured that the Commission will be invited to check the efficacy and democratic functioning of the conditions of transmission of implementing powers regularly, every three years."
"I believe this is a good way to proceed and I see that, in the commitment the Commission agreed to sign through what is now known as a revision clause, it is invited to look at the extent of its competence and justify any changes in legislation or the absence of such changes."
"The third area is obviously the issue of scope."
"What we see is that the Council has not always followed the Commission's proposals, whether on transparency or prospectuses, the definition of cross-border missions or equivalences."
"I do believe, however, that in a spirit of cooperation, including on the part of the Portuguese Presidency, we are reaching a result that should satisfy all the institutions and I am pleased about this."
"(ES) Mr President, following the speeches from the Vice-President of the Commission and my colleague Mrs Berès, my speech is almost superfluous."
"I was responsible for producing the report for the Committee on Legal Affairs and, in agreement with our fellow Members from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we arrived at the conclusion that the urgent procedure that the Commission was asking for in Article 6(2)(2) was unnecessary, because at the moment cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, and also the Council, is excellent."
"Consequently, the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs asks for this article to be removed and adopts two further recitals, two further changes to the recitals, aimed at highlighting the flexibility of the procedure."
"After the adoption of recitals 1 and 2 in committee there were negotiations between Parliament and the Commission, which Mrs Wallström referred to, and we tabled a final amendment, Amendment 4, which replaces the current Amendment 2, and establishes a formula for cooperation between the three institutions."
"In other words, what is important in this text is the final sentence, which says that the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament need to act diligently in order to ensure that these rules and interpretations can be adopted in time, in order not to undermine the perception and, ultimately, the confidence of investors."
"I think that, at the moment, this formula of compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission could help to solve the problems without us having to resort to the urgent procedure that the Commission originally proposed."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for your constructive comments at this late hour."
"Let me just make two short last comments."
"First of all, on the register, I think you are absolutely correct in underlining the need to have information about the procedure, to be well-informed about the progress of different files, and one of the measures that we have agreed on is, of course, to update our comitology register as well."
"This we have agreed between the institutions, and the Commission is investing in this and we are sure that it will be in place by March next year."
"So I think at least this will help, but we will also encourage, of course, our services to work as closely as possible with the Parliament."
"The other comment is simply to say that I hope that we agree that the whole idea behind this particular procedure is to ensure that we have a consistent and coherent application of the new rules."
"That is also why we have proposed this sort of package or omnibus proposals, and that is, I think, the way forward: to make sure that we follow closely what has been agreed and that we can, between the two institutions, handle it as effectively as possible as well."
"The debate is closed."
"International accounting standards (debate)"
"The next item is the motion for a resolution on international accounting standards."
"Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, there is a certain logic in the sequence of discussions we are having because, in this debate, we have to decide whether or not to adopt the so-called IFRS 8 standard at European level."
"In a previous debate on 25 April 2007, when Parliament had to decide on this standard, we were unequivocal in stating that we felt the conditions were not in place for us to be able to do this."
"There were two reasons for this."
"The first was that we had just given the European Commission and the Council a very clear message that we felt that the convergence process the European Union was entering into with countries outside the EU for the recognition of their accounting standards could not simply amount to a cut-and-paste of their standards with the international standard."
"We also felt that the convergence process should be a mutual process."
"When it came to the IFRS 8 standard, we had the impression that this was not the route that was being followed by the international organisation and we wanted to alert the public to this."
"The second reason for doing so was that many people were warning us, quite rightly I believe, of the fact that this accounting standard was being proposed for all users, namely auditors, investors and supervisors, without an impact assessment having been carried out first."
"Now, we know the obsession of the Commission chaired by Mr Barroso with having these impact assessments carried out regularly as part of better regulation, which it uses as a roadmap."
"It seems to us that what applies at European Union level should also apply to the self-regulating international standardisation bodies We have therefore asked the Commission to conduct this impact assessment itself, in the absence of any assessment by the international body."
"The Commission met its formal commitment by presenting the conclusions of this impact assessment to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in early September, as agreed."
"Nevertheless, in future, we need to acknowledge that the scope of this assessment and the way all the parties were interviewed undoubtedly needs to be reviewed to improve the spectrum of those interviewed, so that it is not only those known as the preparers, that is those who draw up the accounts."
"Through its desire to move forward with this debate and perhaps also to contribute to the international standards becoming the reference throughout the world, Parliament still wants to adopt the IFRS 8 standard today and this demonstrates both its sense of earnestness in the procedure for adopting the accounting standards and also its sense of responsibility."
"As important discussions begin with the United States to establish the conditions for its own adoption of the accounting standards, it seems important to us to show our determination to do so ourselves in a lucid and responsible manner."
"I hope this Parliament will adopt the IFRS 8 standard tomorrow, while stressing that when it is revised - and this is already in progress at the IASB, the International Accounting Standards Board - account is taken of the need for precise financial information about the reality of group activities."
"Many NGOs in particular are sensitive to the fact that through this information, a clearer picture of the activity of groups - for example, mining in a particular geographical area or country by country where this is significant - can be given to those affected by these activities."
"Finally, as my last point, I would like to say again to the Commission that we feel the result of this procedure is a very important call to respect the European vote, as a matter of equivalence, and that, when impact assessments are carried out, these enable all parties to express their points of view."
"I would like to point out to you that the vote will not take place tomorrow, but on Wednesday."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to warmly thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent work they have carried out regarding the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 8 - Operating Segments, the new standard on segment information."
"After the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued the standard in November 2006, a debate ensued concerning the suitability of IFRS in the European context."
"This debate was useful."
"We had to make sure that the European Union would not adopt a new accounting standard just for the sake of convergence with the equivalent US standard, but mainly because it improves the quality of financial information and is conducive to the European public good."
"Before reaching a final decision, the Commission and Parliament agreed in May 2007 that the Commission's services would carry out an analysis of the potential consequences of adopting IFRS 8."
"They ran a public consultation during July and August and gathered the views of stakeholders on the cost/benefit implications and the overall impact of adopting IFRS 8."
"On the basis of almost 200 contributions, my services have prepared a report which was provided to Parliament on 10 September 2007."
"The report's main conclusion is that the benefits of adoption of IFRS 8 would outweigh its costs."
"Further, many constituents stressed that a swift endorsement of IFRS 8 would remove uncertainty about the treatment of financial statements for the period ending in December 2007."
"Let me stress that we did not ignore the concerns that had been raised regarding the introduction of the so-called 'management approach', which gives management more leeway compared with the existing standard on segment reporting."
"Some constituents were concerned that IFRS 8 lacks strict requirements on detailed geographical information because it allegedly does not require sufficient detail on a country-by-country basis."
"Discussions with constituents revealed, however, that IFRS 8 is rather expected to improve this kind of disclosure."
"Further, it seems that particular concerns in this area, in our view - and in the view of the majority of respondents to our consultation - cannot be resolved through a financial reporting standard on segment information."
"This could be better done through a further development of a framework regarding corporate social responsibility aspects."
"We agreed that IFRS 8 should not be adopted solely for the sake of convergence, yet we believe that it is crucial to see the issue also in the broader context of the European Union adopting a set of standards which are truly global."
"A couple of years ago we all agreed that Europe should not opt for its own set of standards but rather support and promote the development of a high quality and global set of standards like IFRS."
"We are working on improving the governance of the IASB."
"On 7 November the European Commission, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Japanese Financial Services Agency made a joint statement announcing their agreement to seek certain changes to strengthen the institutional framework of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) Foundation."
"These changes are intended to strengthen the accountability of the Foundation's trustees, in particular by replacing the current self-appointment process for the appointment of the trustees with a process in which public authorities are responsible for the final approval of trustees."
"The joint statement also recognised the importance of further strengthening the IASB's due process, including by carrying out impact assessments."
"This agreement provides a strong basis to address the concerns expressed by this Parliament."
"It also reflects the issues identified by the Commission's two monitoring reports to ECOFIN concerning the IASB's governance."
"We will work with the IASC Foundation and the international partners to develop more detailed proposals in the coming months."
"We will, of course, maintain a close dialogue with the European Parliament throughout this process."
"I am confident that the outcome of this process will ensure that standards respond to European needs and are easily acceptable and applicable by all stakeholders in the EU and also globally."
"The swift adoption of IFRS 8 is important for two reasons. It improves the quality of financial information and it provides certainty to all market participants."
"The discussions of the last months have demonstrated that a stronger involvement of the European Parliament in the endorsement process is necessary."
"The Commission will also continue to work with the IASB and the IASC Foundation and with our international partners to ensure that the process of developing international accounting standards is fully accountable, transparent and meets the needs of European stakeholders."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, the IFRS 8 process is symptomatic of where we stand today with regard to implementation, endorsement, of IFRS in Europe."
"I should like to say very clearly from the outset, to those who perhaps always assume the opposite of Parliament, that the majority of the European Parliament is in favour of IFRS, of a global standard, and of taking the same course on this, the right course."
"We ought to examine this IFRS process, in particular, in relation to whether all is well with it at the moment: the Commission presents the European Parliament with a standard at short notice, the Commission and industry are expected to implement it relatively quickly, pressure from industry gets stronger and stronger, and those who have the duty of justifying it to citizens on the ground are not given any opportunity to form an opinion on it."
"The Commission has prescribed an appropriate phase, but we are going to have to do some straight talking about what has happened now, as the implementation phase is now being postponed retrospectively."
"To avoid this happening in future it is vital that the legislative institutions, such as the European Parliament, are informed about the work in good time."
"I welcome the announcement last week by the Commission, with the SSI, the Japanese and IOSCO."
"What the IFRS organisation then presented - regarding providing its own governance - is a correct, but long-overdue step towards appropriate legitimisation and governance. We, the European Parliament, shall pay particular attention to whether democratic rules of play are observed."
"That does not mean that the European Parliament must be directly involved, but only if the process is working correctly shall we be able to ensure that it operates optimally in future when each individual standard is implemented - and in future we shall be consulted about each individual standard."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, adoption of the IFRS 8 standard will enable our companies to use the standard for the current financial year and put an end to uncertainty."
"The management approach will enable our companies to report publicly, with the same structure used internally, thereby reducing the burden of reporting."
"Users will have access to information that was previously kept internally."
"So IFRS 8 is a win for both the companies and the investors."
"But I have some concerns about the impact assessment that follow a pattern about which I have spoken before."
"Respondents this time seemed predominantly producers rather than users, and with regard to users there were no questions on comparability."
"A more pro-active approach may need to be taken with respect to impact assessments generally, and it certainly cannot have helped in this instance if one hoped-for sector of respondents does not have key questions posed."
"Further, some of the justifications in the report do very little to justify."
"Indeed, to me they look more like the type of document that is written ahead of meetings in the hope of reaching agreement."
"I am very British about this and prefer my minutes and responses and reports to look like they were drafted after events."
"I regret that European companies have been kept waiting for our endorsement of the standard, but Parliament should not be expected to give its assent, on a say-so, without time and proper information to make an assessment."
"However, I am pleased that there has been an improvement in cooperation recently, and I look forward to that continuing."
"Mr President, the importance of appropriate accounting standards cannot be exaggerated."
"In today's world there is a growing need for clear, comparable and sufficient information for investors as well as facilitating business by reducing compliance costs."
"Therefore, I agree with my colleagues on the importance of prudence in the question."
"Decisions should not be taken lightly, and I really think that the views of all colleagues who have mentioned timely impact assessment as an important tool to find balanced solutions and make sure that all stakeholders and their opinions are considered are very important."
"Parliament should, of course, be kept duly informed."
"Of equal importance is to ensure that the EASB governance system is reviewed and adjusted so that regulatory authorities can support its standard-setting process and its result."
"It is, after all, the only body we have to do a cross-border account standards setting process."
"However, while the process has not been perfect, we must not let this delay our work to close the gap between us and our economic partners."
"Today's world is much more interconnected, and it is in our interest to make it function as smoothly as possible, and compatible standards are vital to this end."
"Within the Transatlantic Economic Council, both sides are eager to make this work, and IFRS standards and financial reports are an important tool to find this mutual recognition of standards."
"For now, the IASB is the best way we have."
"European stakeholders must be involved and the functioning of the IFRS should be monitored."
"It can and should also be changed to correct possible mistakes, if we make mistakes."
"Democracy, of course, takes time but sometimes it is needed to correct mistakes."
"Many of my colleagues have mentioned that it was very important that Parliament was able to raise some concerns and make improvements to the process."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"Membership of political groups: see Minutes"
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"

"All that remains now is to thank our last six surviving fellow Members, our two courageous visitors in the gallery, the 15 or so officials and our 69 interpreters - there are more of them than all the spectators put together - for their participation."

"Commission legislative programme and work programme for 2008 (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, the next 12 months will be of vital importance to Europe for our future effectiveness, for our place in the world, for the confidence of our citizens in our ability to meet their expectations."
"We have every reason to be confident."
"The agreement on the Treaty of Lisbon was very welcome, but so too was the manner in which it was reached."
"There was a refusal to be distracted from the primary purpose of equipping the Union with the tools it needs for the future."
"There was a real determination to get down to business."
"At the same time, our economic agenda has brought results in terms of growth and jobs, helping to offset the risks of added turbulence this year."
"We are tackling the big issues: from energy to migration, from employment to development aid, namely in Africa, and in just a few weeks we have an opportunity to underline our global leadership on the fight against climate change in Bali."
"In short, the European Union is delivering."
"It was able to overcome the very difficult situation we faced in 2005."
"The twin-track strategy proposed by the Commission in 2006 has paid off, focusing on concrete results for citizens, and at the same time investing in a solution for the institutional settlement."
"The Union, I believe, is on track for 2008."
"We need to use this to best effect, implementing our commitments, taking forward key proposals already on the table, keeping up the momentum with new initiatives and, at the same time, keeping long-term challenges on our radar screen."
"In addition, of course we must respect and promote the process of ratification of the Treaty and show citizens what the European Union can offer in the run-up to the European parliamentary elections of 2009."
"I therefore welcome this opportunity to set out the Commission's contribution to a successful 2008 by presenting our Legislative and Work Programme for 2008."
"In doing so, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its active involvement in the work of developing this Programme."
"In particular the comprehensive summary report prepared by the Conference of Committee Chairmen and endorsed by the Conference of Presidents helped to shape our programme."
"Many Commission proposals are a direct match to the priorities set out in your summary report."
"But first allow me a quick word on the implementation of the 2007 programme."
"This time last year we discussed a targeted list of strategic initiatives for delivery this year."
"To cite just a few of the most visible initiatives, this has meant a series of key actions like the Strategic Energy Review, the recent proposals on labour migration, flexicurity, the wine market, market access."
"By the end of next month, all the strategic initiatives will have been adopted, with just one exception."
"This is the Emissions Trading Directive, which I have decided to put back one month to January."
"The reason for this was to ensure no distraction from the crucial talks in Bali - where I want the European Union to appear united."
"It will also give us the time to finalise the consultations needed on how to realise the European Union's agreed targets on greenhouse gas and renewables."
"I am sure that you will agree that this makes sense and in fact that it can represent time that we gain because the preparation will allow, I am sure, a better possibility of a consensus with our Member States."
"In addition to the strategic initiatives, we undertook to deliver a large number of priority initiatives over an 18-month period."
"Many of these are now coming forward."
"The coming weeks will see proposals on mortgage credit, Trade Defence Instruments and reducing CO2 emissions from cars."
"We should see a delivery rate of 70 % by year end and at, or close to, 100% by the end of the 18 months, next June."
"2007 is also proving a crucial year in preparing for the future."
"In particular, next week we will launch a set of key proposals for the Union's economic and social future. The single market review will gear up the single market as a strong, innovative and competitive market, bringing direct benefits to consumers and entrepreneurs and positioning Europe to shape globalisation to best effect."
"Alongside this, we will adopt a vision on how to promote opportunities, access and solidarity in the Europe of the 21st century, to be backed up next year with a full communication on a modernised social agenda."
"We will be paying particular attention to how we will be able to use the Treaty of Lisbon and its protocols to move forward on services of general interest, using these new opportunities to see how we can bring real added value to ensuring the role of these services in improving the quality of life of all Europeans."
"I very much look forward to the reactions of the European Parliament and the Council to the internal market review and the social vision."
"I believe that, taken together, they give us the balance needed to move ahead in key areas of our economic and social agenda."
"They show that Europe has the right tools and offers the right platform for our citizens to adapt to and to shape globalisation."
"Let me now focus on the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008."
"This is our political programme for 2008."
"It sets out our main initiatives and builds on our commitment to provide added value to Europe's citizens."
"We have sought to strengthen both the policy content and the process."
"As for 2007, the work programme for 2008 concentrates on a limited number of new policy initiatives, including 26 strategic initiatives grouped together in 12 packages, which the Commission commits to deliver during the year, and 61 priority initiatives, grouped together in 49 packages, to be delivered over a 12-month to 18-month period."
"We will centre our initiatives in five areas, which are of direct relevance to everyone in Europe: growth and jobs, sustainable Europe, managing migration, putting the citizens first and Europe as a world partner."
"We are also determined to strengthen our commitment to better regulation with a guarantee to deliver what we promise."
"We have noted with particular satisfaction that the European Parliament's summary report agrees with the key areas of central importance we identify for 2008."
"Close cooperation among institutions and Member States will be essential to realise our goals."
"For several of the areas mentioned in your report, concrete initiatives are either already adopted or planned to be adopted still in 2007."
"For next year, I am pleased to be able to note the inclusion in the Programme of a number of initiatives highlighted as of particular interest to the European Parliament."
"Just to list some of the key areas: the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs, which we agree remains central to our goals of a more prosperous, environmentally responsible and socially inclusive European Union; climate change, with this year's stress on mitigation, complemented by a new approach on adaptation; greening of the transport sector; a Small Business Act for SMEs (in fact it is a package of measures for SMEs); legislation to strengthen consumer protection regarding contractual rights and a new Consumer Scoreboard; better access to justice for citizens; improving the regulatory environment in Europe with a strategic review of better regulation."
"On the bulk of our agenda there is a large degree of agreement between the Commission and Parliament on the need to act and on the way forward."
"It is true that there are some suggestions in the summary report where we cannot give a definitive answer at this stage."
"For example, we are working actively on intellectual property and financial services, but feel that it is premature to fix now the form and level of ambition for specific initiatives."
"On waste management, we would accommodate the issues you have raised through the Action Plan on better implementation of waste legislation, rather than a new initiative at this stage."
"Let me make one point clear: what is not included in the list of new initiatives is not being neglected."
"The Commission's essential work of implementing Community law, of executing programmes, and of negotiating international agreements, will continue and is made more visible in other parts of the Programme's text."
"Also a new chapter on 'shaping new policies' seeks to reflect the multiannual nature of most of the activities of the Commission."
"We have also inserted in the Work Programme the communication priorities, but have added a novelty in this respect: we propose a number of those priorities to the other institutions so that we can work together to promote them."
"But this is not about centralisation - quite the contrary."
"We believe that a common understanding of priorities offers the springboard for 'going local', adapting communication to best fit different needs in different parts of the Union."
"We also believe that in this communication area partnership is crucial if we really want to connect Europe to its citizens."
"The Commission looks forward to a lively and fruitful debate reflecting the strategic dimension of the Commission's work programme and a strong political message to our citizens."
"The year 2008 is indeed a crucial year for Europe."
"Together the European Commission and the European Parliament can build on our excellent work together in 2007, can make the difference and can make, I am sure, 2008 a great year for Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Commission President, I would also like to extend a very warm welcome to the many members of the Commission who are present for this debate today."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by saying to you, Commission President, that having heard your minatory words last year about the attendance of Members of this House, there are more Members than Commissioners in the Chamber today, and I trust that you have noted that fact with gratification."
"On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, may I also voice some words of encouragement: we encourage you, during the coming year - the crucial year for the ratification of the new Treaty - to utilise your Commission's most important competence, namely the right to bring forward legislative proposals for Europe, in a way which ensures that you address the issues of serious concern to citizens effectively and utilise the opportunities at your disposal to narrow the gap between citizens and the European Union."
"We support your general approach as set forth in your programme, as well as the priorities you have chosen, from growth and jobs - whose success is crucial to underpin social cohesion in Europe - to many other detailed aspects, up to and including migration and research."
"My colleagues will focus on individual issues."
"We welcome the fact that you have indeed taken up various proposals arising from the structured dialogue with the committees."
"We would like to see this dialogue being intensified even further."
"We would also welcome it if your planning were not only to cover the first few months of 2009 but were perhaps to encompass a two-year cycle which could be developed further on a year-by-year basis."
"What we feel is missing is an indicative time schedule, and we also see a gap between your programme and the budgetary procedure, which it would be sensible to close."
"You intend to bring forward a total of 79 legislative initiatives and around the same number of non-legislative actions."
"If we look at this in terms of your stated intention to reduce bureaucracy, I am not sure whether you are genuinely serving that objective."
"The items of legislation whose repeal you have announced notably include many which would have expired anyway."
"To that extent, reducing bureaucracy is more about 'talking a good game' than achieving a real and effective objective."
"Next year is the year of the new Treaty."
"You have the opportunity - and I am confident that this Treaty will come into force - to incorporate this Treaty into your programme already at this stage."
"The Treaty will bring in important new elements: operability, transparency and democracy."
"It will also bring in an element which is vital for us and to which I recommend you devote some attention, and that is the principle of subsidiarity."
"A new debate on subsidiarity is starting in Europe, and the main partner for that debate is you, Mr President, and your Commission."
"A storm of protest erupted in some parts of Germany a few days ago over the issue of fruit and apple wines."
"I do not want to discuss the public reaction to this issue in detail, but let me say this, Mr President: what sort of spirit is at large in an administration which, at one bureaucratic stroke, obliterates regional traditions which go back hundreds of years, and does so in such a cold and insensitive way?"
"There is a problem with this approach, and it is your problem, Mr President."
"It is a problem with your Commission."
"You now have an opportunity, in the spirit of the new Treaty, to create a new culture of subsidiarity."
"That is the opportunity - the great opportunity - for your Commission to achieve more consensus among the population at large, and it is an opportunity which we in the PPE-DE Group would expressly encourage you to seize with both hands."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commission President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, may I also welcome you very warmly on behalf of my Group."
"Much of what the Commission President has said and which is included in this document meets with our approval."
"I would like to focus on two points which are crucial, in our view."
"These points are addressed at the end of your programme."
"I would have liked to see them included at the beginning, but their location in the text does not make them any less important."
"The first point is communication."
"I can only endorse what Mr Nassauer has said."
"We must convey a clear message to citizens about what Europe is all about and what we are trying to achieve with our various legislative proposals; otherwise, we are wasting our time."
"I am very pleased with the approach to the issue of communication - which also lies in the hands of Madam Vice-President - and the proposals she has put forward, which envisage a joint approach with Parliament."
"However, it is also a question of the language we use when we communicate with citizens and how we convey the message about what we are trying to do."
"Last year, we dealt with a number of items of legislation which improved the legal position of consumers, notably in telecommunications and other sectors."
"However, we have still not managed to convince our citizens satisfactorily that we are here for them and that we are not an elite group of people working away somewhere in Brussels."
"We need to do more here."
"I hope, Madam Vice-President, that you will be able to say a few words at the end of this debate about what you are planning in specific terms, for it is our common goal, and that is a message which we must convey in 2008 in particular."
"There is another important sentence which is also to be found towards the end of the document."
"It talks about social problems and the social dimension of the EU in the context of globalisation, in particular jobs and migration and citizens' concerns."
"Unfortunately, Mr President, the document you have presented to us does not contain many answers to these questions."
"This is not just a matter for the Social Affairs Commissioner, who is also doing good work."
"This dimension must be addressed by the Commission as a whole."
"Indeed, it is a matter for the President of the Commission himself."
"He, too, must focus on achieving this social Europe."
"There are many areas involved here, and I would like to cite just two of them. One of them is international trade."
"Is it not a scandal that there are still European companies which are reliant on child labour in India and other countries? What are we doing to tackle this?"
"This situation creates fears here in Europe and exacerbates poverty."
"That is borne out by various studies: it exacerbates poverty in countries which are our trading partners."
"(Applause)"
"As to immigration policy, your document talks about 'an integrated approach to migration'."
"Would it not be better to say: 'no migration without integration'?"
"Indeed, should the Commission not have been sending out a much clearer and unequivocal message here?"
"Yesterday, we discussed this issue with Commissioner Frattini."
"His initial comments about the situation of the Roma population in Rome, for example, were not very encouraging."
"His statements yesterday were much clearer and more helpful."
"Is it not the case that the Roma issue is also one which we have often neglected, not only in the new Member States but in the old ones as well?"
"Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are saying 'no migration policy without integration policy'."
"Surely this is an approach which the Commission should have adopted long ago?"
"I doubt that Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel mean the same thing as we Social Democrats do when they talk about integration."
"Nonetheless, the basic message is absolutely correct and the Commission must adopt a much clearer approach here."
"(Applause)"
"Combating right-wing extremism is therefore not only about addressing the issue on an ideological level; it is of course about social issues as well."
"Unemployment, social exclusion and anti-social elements are still present in our society and are being exploited by the extreme right in their campaign against Europe."
"For that reason, Europe and the European Commission must take action here."
"My colleague Mr Schulz, the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has often said that we want a social Europe."
"That is our primary goal and it should be the primary goal of this programme as well."
"You have said that we can make '2008 a great year for Europe'."
"We think that 2008 should be a great year for social Europe."
"My plea to you, Commission President, is this: please, take the lead in achieving this social Europe!"
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this is a political programme which suits a year in which the pace of integration is going to quicken dramatically with the completion of the Reform Treaty process and the expansion of the Schengen and the euro zones."
"But preparing for the bringing into force of the Treaty will be our principal task and here the Liberal Group have two principal concerns."
"First: that in building the area of freedom, security and justice the integration of the third pillar with the first should be as fast and comprehensive as possible."
"And secondly, with relation to the CFSP, reaching a first class agreement between the Council, Commission and Parliament upon the setting up of the external service promises to be fairly exciting and quite tricky."
"To explain and justify the Treaty to national parliaments and to public opinion, we ought to put greater stress on the social and cultural dimension of the single market, such as migration policy, as well as on the fight to combat climate change."
"These things will assist us to sell the Treaty."
"The CAP Check should be directly associated with the future reform of the financial system through an expansion of a cofinancing of the CAP."
"Finally, I should be grateful to hear the college's assessment of President Sarkozy's plan to establish a further 'Comité des Sages' to brood on the future of Europe."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioners, you have presented us with 26 strategic initiatives and 61 priority initiatives."
"I am not going to comment on all of them in four minutes."
"In debates of this kind it must always be borne in mind that the Commission has a responsibility and a quite special role to play in the Community decision-making process."
"It is you who have the monopoly on legislative initiatives and it is you who wield the power by screening the various amendments, whether they come from Parliament or from the Council."
"You have huge responsibility for the type of result that we are able to obtain as far as Community legislation is concerned."
"I can therefore assure you that, as ever, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is probably the most united of all the political groups in its support for this Community procedure, because I believe that the Commission has been entrusted with a formidable task in having to confront not only national interests but also the sensitivities of the various national governments."
"To get straight to the heart of the matter there are three points that I would like to raise."
"The first is energy policy: 2007 has been a big year."
"The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded and the March European Council adopted a number of objectives that in our view could have been more ambitious, but which we supported nevertheless."
"As you have pointed out, 2008 will now be a year for implementation."
"This is where some real vigilance will be called for on our part."
"We were really disappointed by the results on vehicle emissions."
"We believe that your approach to biofuels ignores the negative impact that this type of technology is having on our environment."
"We are of the view that in the second phase of emission permits we should be moving towards a bidding system rather than freely distributing what amount to nothing more than new financial assets."
"We are somewhat surprised that as far as the internalisation of transport policy costs is concerned you have only announced what amounts to no more than methodological studies."
"It appears to me that the economists have been debating this for at least 15 years and that the Commission could follow the example set by good national experience."
"We also think that this thinking needs to be applied to all aspects of energy policy, and that you should resist the idea of making too much use of so-called 'soft' instruments in order to please different lobbies or to meet different governmental requests."
"We need to employ restrictive instruments because the example set by the car industry shows us that voluntary agreements do not really work."
"As regards renewable energies we do not believe it is a very good idea to introduce flexible arrangements between the Member States."
"Everyone should do their bit."
"The second subject that I wish to raise concerns immigration policy."
"This is one area for which you have supreme responsibility."
"I recall the speech that Kofi Annan made to the European Parliament several years ago."
"It would be wonderful if the European Union could win the Nobel Peace Prize for a successful immigration policy."
"We are counting on you to see to it that such an immigration policy, which you have included in your work programme, and which has already commenced, does not result in the introduction of a common biometric passport for all Member States."
"I think that as well as creating a disastrous situation for people here, that would also damage the EU's credibility in the eyes of the rest of the world."
"Finally, the last point I wish to raise - and this surprises me, Mr Barroso - is the fact that your programme does not include anything on the international financial markets."
"If you want the citizens of the Community, or at least a large majority of them, to be more positively disposed towards globalisation and its various issues then the European Union, and the Commission in particular, cannot dissociate itself from the situation in the financial markets, the continued investigation of tax havens and our inability to debate issues surrounding the exchange rates between the euro, the Chinese yuan and the dollar."
"I believe that people are waiting for the European Union to deliver ambitious initiatives that will ensure that the financial markets operate for the benefit of the economy and society, not the other way round."
"I am reminded of the debates that Parliament held on this subject at the start of the current legislative period."
"Various people now appear to have lost all sight of this."
"For this reason it seems important to me that you should re-launch such an initiative with the backing of Parliament."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, along with my fellow Members I listened closely to what Mr Barroso said."
"He set out the Commission's strategic objectives, with growth and employment naturally being at the top of the list of priorities."
"Nevertheless, I noted that, as in the communication from the Commission, there was something singularly missing from his presentation and I would now like to ask the Commission President quite specifically about this."
"Is it true that on 23 October the College of Commissioners debated a proposal that had been put by Mr Mandelson concerning European firms and businesses that had moved their production to third countries where wage levels were low?"
"This proposal was possibly aimed at exempting the said companies from the anti-dumping duties that apply to products exported to the Union at prices that are significantly lower than their normal value."
"Is it true that this proposal received a large measure of support and that the Commission is to take a formal decision on this subject after 5 December?"
"How do you respond to those who see in such a measure nothing more than a financial subsidy for relocating production?"
"Would such a move not be totally inconsistent with those sections of the Commission communication that we are discussing here today, including the following:"
"Recent research shows that the main concern for EU citizens is 'the social dimension of the EU in the context of globalisation (in particular jobs and the fear of unemployment).'"
"Or else: 'The global competitiveness agenda contributes to creating lasting growth and jobs at home.'"
"(FR) Why was there no mention either in your presentation or in the Commission communication of the legislative programme for 2008 or of any project relating to major political issues such as the promotion of employment in the EU, industrial policy and, more generally, the benefits that the Community can derive from the current phenomenon of globalisation?"
"Finally, is it true that, foreseeing the major disruption that such a subject could cause during a vote in Parliament, not to say in the Council, you are planning to bypass the legislators by opting for guidelines instead?"
"I believe that my Group is not the only one here hoping for a clear response from you to these questions, failing which each of us will have to consider what form of reaction would be the most appropriate."
"If you enjoyed the manner in which the House mobilised its efforts against the Bolkestein Directive then you will certainly love the outcry that will be caused by the Mandelson Regulation."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, with your permission, I would like to start my speech in Irish."
"(GA) I approve of the Commission's projected legislative and work programme."
"The Commission is aiming above all to promote job creation and development in Europe; to make the EU come to grips with the problem of climate change; to bring about a common policy on migration; to give pride of place to EU citizens; and to ensure that the EU acts as a force for good all over the world."
"And of course the whole issue of globalisation is one that will concentrate our minds over the next number of years - not just in the short term for 2008 - and I welcome the initiatives taken in particular by the Commission to prepare Europe to deal with the effects and impacts, both positive and negative, of what globalisation will mean."
"We can see around the world that there is a threat to democracy also, and the actions that we must take with regard to ensuring that we can best deliver not just aid and assistance to those who are in trouble but also the promotion of the values of democracy, the rule of law, the separation of powers."
"We have seen in recent weeks that Pakistan, Georgia and other parts of the world are suffering from new forms of resistance towards democratic controls, new threats regarding the freedom of the press, and, most importantly of all, the annihilation of the will of the people to be heard and to be recognised within those networks."
"In particular, the continuing crisis around the world - particularly in the developing world with regard to the AIDS, HIV and other areas - requires us to be more imaginative and innovative in how best we can deal with these areas."
"But one issue in particular concerns me as we look to the future, in particular the short-term future, and that is the whole question of taxation within the European Union."
"Many of us have grave concerns with regard to proposals coming forward from the Commission concerning corporation tax, the common consolidated base for corporation tax and, in particular, the relentless desire of certain Commissioners to drive forward the proposal which we - I and others in this House - believe the Commission does not have the legislative or legal basis to move forward on."
"I am delighted that the Lisbon Reform Treaty has ensured that the issues of taxation still require unanimity."
"I am delighted at the fact that no changes can be made without the 27 governments agreeing."
"There is a place in Europe for ensuring that there is competition, not just in economic and in environmental terms, but also in the whole area of taxation."
"This tax competition is healthy, and we must be given assurances that any proposals coming forward will not have a negative impact with regard to economic growth and employment growth, which is so necessary for the peoples of Europe."
"Even if you look at America there is tax competition within the states and it appears to be working extremely well there."
"The last point that I would make is that, as we look to the future and move forward, the peoples of Europe are not asking for more bureaucracy, they are not asking for more regulation."
"They are asking for vision and a rapid response to the real problems that they face on a day-to-day basis, not some abstract ideologies from an ancient past which I hope we have left behind us."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, there is an election in Denmark today."
"I hope that the new Danish Parliament will have members who take the trouble to read the Commission's annual programme and the EU legislative proposals and consider them."
"For it is the EU that determines our laws, and it is sad to have experienced an election battle where the formulation of laws is simply not debated."
"Instead, in Denmark there have been discussions concerning municipal and regional matters such as food at playschools, education and hospitals."
"The Danish input into the legislative process within the EU is not being discussed amongst the elected people's representatives; democracy is being drained as a form of government."
"The Commission's annual programme should ideally be distributed for consideration by all the specialist committees within all the national parliaments and, in connection with this, all parties should take a position on what should be legislated at EU level and what should be kept under national jurisdiction."
"Proximity and necessity controls - or subsidiarity and proportionality to use EU jargon - should be considered by the national parliaments, first in connection with the annual programme and then subsequently when the Commission submits the various legislative proposals."
"This could connect the national parliaments with the EU and give citizens the opportunity to be involved before they receive a decree from Brussels, which has also promised to comply with the recommendations of the national parliaments, yet very few come."
"The national parliaments are asleep on the job, and it is depressing for those of us who are fighting for them, but it is good to see so many Commissioners at once."
"(DE) Mr President, o sonho europeo, the European dream, der Europäische Traum!"
"I think that the vast majority of Europeans have a fairly clear idea and generally agree on what this should be."
"That being the case, why is there so much mistrust directed towards the Commission in so many countries?"
"You say that it has to do with communication."
"However, a great many citizens, even those who only consider these problems in passing, are saying, no, it has to do with the specific projects, and it has to do with the Lisbon Strategy and its obvious failure to date."
"Mr Swoboda says that the social dimension is missing and I must admit that on this issue, he is right."
"However, at the same time, Mr Duff has said that the social dimension of the Constitutional Treaty - my apologies, you call it the Reform Treaty - must be the focal point."
"That is all very well, but where does it say anything about the social dimension there?"
"In which form is this Treaty actually readable, and where in this Treaty does it say anything about basic democratic principles such as the separation of powers?"
"If you actually did what you said and what you apparently intend - namely to convey the message effectively and implement your intentions in a way which is verifiable in hard data - communication would become far less of a problem."
"The President of the European Court of Auditors offered you a very clear starting point yesterday evening."
"He mentioned very specific numbers for the first time: EUR 4 billion incorrectly disbursed from the Structural Funds alone."
"Let me quote from his speech: 'The most frequent errors were claims for ineligible expenditure and failure to carry out tender procedures as well as a lack of evidence to support the calculation of overheads or the staff costs involved."
"The supervisory and control systems in the Member States were generally ineffective or moderately effective, and the Commission maintains only a moderately effective supervision of their functioning.'"
"You need to take action. Please do not attempt to improve communication about what you are not doing!"
"That is bound to go wrong."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank all the groups for their very interesting and challenging comments."
"Let me first try to answer some specific issues, and then I shall make some general comments."
"I should like to thank Mr Nassauer for the general support he gave to our priorities."
"Regarding the main issue - subsidiarity - he mentioned, let me say that we are as committed as he to the goal he has set, more precisely: to create a new culture of subsidiarity in Europe and to give our own example."
"I really am committed to that."
"I am not pretending that we are perfect."
"Sometimes it is difficult to change old habits, but we are moving in the right direction."
"When there are mistakes, which sometimes happens, then we try to correct them."
"The recent case we mentioned regarding the Apfelwein is a good example of that, and we should accept that sometimes we cannot foresee all the consequences of the regulations we are preparing."
"I want to assure you that I and the college that is present here are committed to subsidiarity."
"In all our initiatives we are now looking at the need for a specific legislative initiative - the impact assessment and the quality of our proposals - and we try to do it that way."
"Let me just highlight that, out of the 26 strategic initiatives I have announced, only 8 are of a legislative nature; out of 61 priority initiatives, only 28 are of a legislative nature; out of 87, only 36 are of a legislative nature in general."
"On top of this, we will withdraw 30 pieces of legislation."
"However, the point I want to make to you is the following: when we speak about the new culture of subsidiarity, I need your help to explain to our citizens that this is in order to strengthen the European Union, not to weaken it; in order to make the institutions more democratic and more accountable, and not to give in to those who are attacking Europe and the European Union in a populist, demagogic way."
"This is not the way I see subsidiarity."
"Sometimes, in some of our Member States, people say that, because of subsidiarity, the Commission or the European Parliament should not come forward with this kind of programme because this goes against subsidiarity."
"In fact, if what they do not want is the European Union to act when European action is needed, then I do not agree that this is indeed in favour of subsidiarity."
"To give you a recent example: in March the European Council adopted, as you know, some very important ideas for energy and the environment, namely protection against climate change."
"For instance, we adopted the general principles of unbundling."
"This was a decision of the European Council."
"However, I have sometimes heard some Member States state that the Commission should not insist on unbundling, because this is against the principle of subsidiarity."
"I do not agree with this, and I have to say so. It is, in fact, resistance to an important European movement that is in favour of creating a real internal market for energy and of having a very strong policy against climate change."
"This is not in favour of subsidiarity."
"This is the point where we need your help."
"We need your help to explain when the European Union action is needed, and to be critical of us when you think that European action is not needed, so that we should, if necessary, scrap some legislation."
"I will come back to Mr Swoboda's point on communication later, but I think he is right."
"In fact, I, together with Vice-President Wallström and the whole college, are working on this."
"But the basic idea is, precisely, partnerships."
"Let us be honest about this."
"We cannot do everything by ourselves."
"When I say 'we', I mean the European institutions - the Commission and the European Parliament."
"We need the active involvement of leaders at all levels - national and regional."
"This is important for subsidiarity."
"For instance, the Länder in Germany, the regions in most of our Member States, are critically important, and my college and I have been all over Europe in the national parliaments, sometimes in the different regions, explaining."
"I was recently in Poland, saying this very clearly, saying that Europe is not them in Brussels or Strasbourg: Europe is us, all over Europe, and this is a collective responsibility."
"That is, once again, a change of paradigm, because if you want to motivate the citizens for the European idea, we have to share with them those priorities and not just think about 'some people in Brussels or in Strasbourg' telling the other citizens what they should or should not do."
"We have mentioned the social dimension."
"I could not, of course, highlight all the points. Let me just tell you that in our programme there are many legislative and non-legislative initiatives in this area."
"Most importantly, we will conclude the work on stock-taking of European society with the vision of how to promote opportunities, access and solidarity in the Europe of the 21st century."
"This will pave the way for a new social agenda and provide the framework for a dynamic and modern approach to the contribution of European Union policy to European society today."
"The Commission will also submit proposals to amend the European Works Council Directive in order for them to anticipate and accompany restructuring."
"Another piece of legislation will concern the conditions of pregnant women, aiming at improving existing maternity protection provisions with a view to reconciling professional, private and family life."
"An initiative will concern the deepening of the open method of coordination in the areas of social protection and social inclusion."
"This will be accompanied by a recommendation on active inclusion of people furthest from the labour market, concentrating on three pillars: job opportunities and vocational training, income support, and better access to quality services."
"This takes place in the context of the overall Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs."
"Finally, the Commission will adopt the communication on anticipating and managing change, launching the second phase of consultation of European social partners on anticipating company restructuring."
"Just to give you some examples that we are indeed committed to the social agenda in Europe."
"Mr Duff, as regards the need to ratify the Treaty, as you understand, I fully share that priority, and I think, precisely, that the social and cultural dimension of Europe should be highlighted."
"I am doing my best in this matter, trying to explain that in Europe we need a strong internal market, but Europe is more than a market, and I think you can agree that this is also a shared commitment."
"Regarding the 'Wise Men's Group' proposal of President Sarkozy, about which you have asked for my opinion, the Commission has discussed this issue."
"We are, naturally, in favour of any initiative that promotes debate and reflection on the future of Europe."
"As real democrats we like debate."
"That is perhaps our tropisme, but we like debate, we like ideas and the exchange of ideas."
"So I think that President Sarkozy's initiative should be seen as part of the promotion of such debate and reflection."
"However, the Commission is keen to make sure that this initiative, if it were to be approved by the European Council, does not undermine our efforts to build on the success of the Lisbon Treaty and, most of all, does not undermine its certification."
"We must be clear about this."
"That is why we think that this group, in the event of approval by the European Council, should not engage in a new institutional debate."
"I do not think it would be wise to do this, so I will ask the 'Wise Men' (and women, hopefully!) to be wise enough not to open new institutional debates, but rather to concentrate on a vision for Europe in 20 or 30 years' time."
"This is important, and why should we not have a good debate on this?"
"We should not, either, engage in a negative debate about the geographical limits of the borders of Europe."
"This could be divisive, and it should not undermine our ongoing processes at European level, such as the budgetary review and normal conduct of enlargement negotiations."
"It is important because of defending institutions."
"We are for all kinds of debate, but let us be honest: we have institutions."
"We have the European Parliament, we have the Commission, we have the European Council and, in the end, the institutions are responsible - not wise men or, as we would prefer maybe to say, 'the bright kids' - and what they could bring as a stimulus to our debate."
"We also believe that the timing of the report of such a group should be given careful consideration; the end of 2009 seems appropriate."
"(FR) Mr Jonckheer, thank you for your comments, especially as regards the Community method and the Greens' support for it."
"We shall be very mindful of this."
"You will doubtless have noticed that during the debate on the Reform Treaty - the Lisbon Treaty - certain attempts were made to dilute the Community process."
"The Commission, which had cooperated effectively with Parliament, managed to avoid anything that could challenge the principles of the Community system."
"You said that 2007 has been an important year for the 'great cause', namely the challenge of climate change, and we in the Commission and in the European Union are proud to have contributed to this effort."
"Indeed, the Commission's Green Paper provided the basis for the agreement that was eventually reached at the March European Council."
"The European Union can be proud of having taken the lead in this area and it intends to continue its efforts in this direction, especially with the forthcoming Bali Conference and in the wake of major recent meetings such as the High-Level Event in New York and the G8 at Heiligendamm, which also proved decisive."
"It will do this with a view to launching a process that, by the time of the Copenhagen meeting in 2009, will lead - we hope - to the establishment of a post-Kyoto regime by 2012."
"This really is an ambitious target."
"In any event, we are aware that we need to motivate our other partners in this direction."
"Turning to the issue of migration you say that the European Union should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
"It could also be similarly recognised for its activities in other areas, too."
"In fact, I think that the European Union has long merited a Nobel Peace Prize, for when it comes to the experience of peace in the world there are few regions better qualified than the European Community, now the European Union."
"Let me give you an example."
"This month I am going to Singapore to take part in the ASEAN Summit and the Association invited me because it is seeking inspiration, based on our experience of regional integration, to work for peace, economic growth and social development."
"We should be proud to be an example to others in the world and this is something that we are working at continuously."
"On the subject of migration I wish to reply here to several questions that have been raised by Members of this Parliament."
"I have said this repeatedly and I say it again here: I find that it is absurd to have to deal with 27 migration policies in Europe."
"We have an integrated area here and we therefore need to have a common approach."
"Now let us be clear: some Member States are against it."
"However, we shall persist, for in an integrated area there is a greater probability of being confronted with problems of the kind that Italy has had to face recently, including that posed by certain citizens from Romania."
"We need more immigration in Europe, not less: that is the truth of the matter."
"That is why we are calling for an immigration policy that is responsible and that is based on two key aspects."
"Firstly, we have to be resolute when it comes to security by openly combating all forms of exploitation in the workplace and by eliminating the illegal labour market."
"For this reason we fully support the initiative put forward by Vice-President Frattini for a directive that will criminalise the employment of persons residing illegally in EU territory, the objective being to prevent the exploitation of such workers and to crack down on the criminal networks involved."
"We have to deal firmly with illegal immigration and with all types of activities that act as a cover for certain networks that are often nothing more than criminal gangs, for these groups are not only connected with illegal immigration but also with drug dealing, human trafficking and other forms of organised crime."
"At the same time we need to adopt an open, generous and united approach to the problem of how to integrate, first and foremost, those who are Community citizens and then, more generally, those who belong to the various migrant groups."
"We need to have the courage to say that this is a task that has to be shared out."
"The role of the European institutions is to put the framework in place, but when it comes to the practical side of things who will take care of the actual integration process on the ground?"
"Not the European Parliament and not the Commission, but the national governments, the regions, the local authorities, the NGOs and sometimes even the churches, indeed everyone who has a presence on the ground and who has a duty to improve integration."
"All this is a major challenge."
"You mentioned Kofi Annan."
"I have discussed this matter with him on several occasions."
"If there is one area that is poorly regulated on a global scale it is migration."
"We have laid down certain organisational principles for world trade and indeed for the environment, too."
"It is astonishing to note that migration, which is one of the greatest challenges the world has to face, is one area where organisation is lacking on an international level."
"I support your proposal that we in the European Union -precisely because we are a special case when it comes to integration and freedom of movement - should double our efforts to promote certain principles because Europe and the wider world are currently facing real threats in the form of xenophobia, populist movements and negative forces from the past that are opposed to those principles that we uphold, namely humanism and hospitality."
"We have to steer well clear of extremist positions and must work towards a rational, fair and progressive approach."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Wurtz, you asked a number of questions about trade protection instruments."
"First of all, I referred to these instruments in my speech by saying that we would very soon be introducing several initiatives in this area."
"Let me say to you that we are very much in favour of establishing effective mechanisms for safeguarding our commercial interests and providing protection against unfair practices."
"It is for this reason that we are presently looking at various ways of making these instruments more effective."
"What is more, we shall do this in a transparent fashion."
"A major consultation has just taken place with a view to ensuring that our businesses, especially the SMEs, are better equipped to cope with international competition."
"We intend to take the relevant decisions in this area in December."
"It should be recognised that Europe's businesses are the most international in the world."
"European production and distribution chains have now been established in every corner of the planet and are not merely restricted to the Member States."
"We believe that this business presence on the global stage is a source of competitiveness and growth for the European economy and for European jobs."
"I can assure you that we have no intention of rewarding or subsidising European companies that decide to relocate to third countries or set up part of their production facilities there."
"However, I will be completely honest with you in saying that we are not going to sanction or punish the European companies that are the most global and the most competitive in the world."
"We therefore need trade protection instruments that are both solid and transparent."
"We shall be reviewing our trade protection instruments with a view to introducing stronger measures - and indeed it will never be our intention to weaken them - by adapting them, obviously, to the new realities of globalisation."
"I am not going to dwell on the topic of globalisation."
"I shall be back here again tomorrow to discuss the document that we presented to the last European Council, and to the Community at large, on bringing added value to Europe and on the means for shaping globalisation to best effect."
"We are very aware of the need to defend European interests around the world, to protect our interests without resorting to protectionism, to comprehend and to have the courage to say to the people of Europe that if we in Europe close our doors we will be the first ones to suffer."
"It will not be easy but it has to be done."
"Europe is the world's largest exporter."
"It would be self-defeating and against our own interests if we were to go down the road of protectionism."
"The important thing is to work out how to keep our doors open without being naïve, how to maintain and even extend the opening-up of the global markets while at the same time defending our own interests, and this includes taking account of our concerns for the employment sector."
"Mr Crowley, thank you also for your support for our general programme."
"About the specific point - I know it is a worry and concern for you - let me be clear about the initiatives on taxation."
"As you know, the Commission has been working for some time on the issue of a common consolidated tax base."
"This is a very complex area and views are very different between Member States."
"I know well the sensitivity in Ireland."
"I also know the sensitivity in other Member States."
"As is usual practice, the Commission is carrying out an impact assessment to analyse the issues and to look at the likely impact of different possible solutions before making any formal proposals."
"All of this is public knowledge and it is entirely appropriate that the Commission refers to this in the work programme for 2008."
"But I agree with you that it is clear that unanimity is in the Reform Treaty as the rule for any legislation on these issues of taxation."
"So I believe that your concerns are well taken on board."
"I think I have reacted to most of your interesting remarks. Let me just say that I, of course, concentrated on the most, let us say, polemic issues."
"What I want to say is that we could see here a degree of consensus about Europe."
"A consensus that I believe is stronger between the institutions, also with the natural differences between political families and I hope also consensus between the different parts of our very diverse Union."
"This, I think, is not the lowest common denominator consensus."
"It is mainly the result of three factors."
"First, many of the challenges facing us today are impossible to contest."
"The imperatives of climate change, the realities of migration, and the risk of worldwide poverty: all these are clear challenges."
"And you can be from the left, the right or the centre, you can be from the north or south of Europe, from the old Member States or new Member States, from small or big Member States, yet these are common challenges that only together we can face."
"Second, we are making it progressively clear that the European Union is central to resolving these issues."
"Action by individual Member States can only go so far but it becomes more and more obvious that the European dimension is indispensable."
"Of course we have to see what is the appropriate level of using the European dimension - the subsidiarity issue that was raised by some of you - but I think that we can agree that even the biggest Member States alone cannot face all those challenges and that we need some level of European commitment."
"Finally, I believe the effort all the institutions have put into dialogue and cooperation is paying off."
"We are wasting less of our energies in scoring points against each other and more on focussing on how to serve our citizens - and always putting the emphasis on the citizens."
"A strong Union, yes, but a strong Union not for the sake of the institutions themselves, but a strong Union to deliver concrete results for our citizens: this is our programme."
"I think that, 50 years on, the genius of the founding fathers in creating our unique mix of institutions is as strong as ever."
"So, I very much look forward to working closely with Parliament as we carry forward proposals on the table into action, as we crystallise our thinking into concrete measures and as we develop our new agenda for the future."
"On my own behalf and on behalf of all the college, I want to tell you that we really want to have a working, loyal and dynamic interaction with Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Growth and jobs"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to address the Commission's agenda, particularly in the economic sector, not only because this is the area where the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' interest mostly lies, but it is also of vital importance to the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Commission must keep its active role in building a genuine single market for financial services."
"It is topical for a good reason."
"Firstly, the recent financial turmoil has underlined the importance of sound financial regulation."
"Secondly, the financial world is more and more intertwined."
"We must be able to build convergence with our main allies overseas."
"Transatlantic Market initiatives started a very important process which is especially critical to the capital markets."
"A few years ago a groundbreaking legislative process in the form of the Lamfalussy procedure was successfully introduced."
"The Lamfalussy procedure is the first attempt to shift widely to delegated legislation in the EU."
"Even though the first experiences from this procedure are positive, it is crucial to keep on building trust between institutions."
"The working relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission in this process are very important."
"As for the follow-up, firstly, the Lamfalussy procedure is basically a sound process that is welcomed by stakeholders."
"It is also in its early stages."
"It is developing all the time."
"Therefore no overhaul is appropriate at this point, nor is it the wish of most stakeholders."
"Rather we need targeted improvements - particularly Level 3 Committees - there is a lot of scope for improvement in their international cooperation, to challenge each other and explain."
"Finally, I would like to say about tax-related issues that the Commission should keep its active role."
"Even though taxation might seem a bit difficult, and we all know that it is still beyond unanimity, we must be very courageous in putting forward action in this area."
"Enhanced cooperation is a good innovation and the other items of the Commission's agenda in the field of tax are also very important."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, I believe that the people of Europe have very high expectations when it comes to the social dimension of European integration and that the strengthening of this social pillar is the weak link, if not to say the missing link, in the Commission's strategy."
"We need to stop opposing the strategy for growth, the establishment of the single market and the strengthening of the social pillar."
"This is a key factor for the support of the peoples of Europe and it is also, quite simply, an essential condition for the success of the Lisbon Strategy and for strengthening the competitiveness and economic efficiency of the European Union."
"In this respect there is a striking contrast with the awareness of the challenges posed by climate change, which effectively seemed to stem from last year's spring summit, and indeed the priorities laid down in the Commission's work programme contain more than a trace of this."
"We are a long way from displaying the same enthusiasm when it comes to meeting the challenges posed by social inclusion and the need to create a Europe that works for everyone, a Europe capable of promoting not just more jobs but better jobs too."
"There are declarations of intent and there are various references here and there, in the introduction and in the preamble, but these scarcely figure in the action programme, nor are they included in the legislative initiatives."
"Take, for example, lifelong learning, which is mentioned and which, as an accessory to the success of the new policy for the reform of the labour market, is essential if we want to have a fair and efficient system of 'flexicurity'."
"However, there is no grand ambitious programme, something the equivalent, for example, of the old Erasmus scheme, which is not only bearing fruit but has also proved a very effective link via which EU citizens can recognise and acknowledge the work of the European Union."
"When it comes to combating social exclusion and poverty, and promoting social protection, the proposals for action are essentially limited to non-legislative initiatives."
"We also regret the absence of any progress on the Working Time Directive and Part-Time Work Directive."
"Similarly, in the area of taxation, we cannot but note that for want of an initiative on a genuine corporate tax base - which is something that Parliament has been advocating and which the Commissioner concerned was working on - we are still not moving towards a more equitable single market in this particular respect."
"Finally, we are impatiently waiting for two initiatives that you announced."
"The first concerns the review of the European Works Council Directive, which Parliament has been calling for since 2001, and the second, which you mentioned, concerns maternity leave."
"I would like to conclude by referring to two examples of deadlock that seem to us to be absolutely incomprehensible and unacceptable: they relate firstly to services of general economic interest and secondly to social services of general interest."
"After so many White Papers, Green Papers, announcements, disputes before the Court of Justice and a number of clear and repeated demands from the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, and even though a consensus was reached between the Member States in the Council on including a new article in the Lisbon Treaty to provide a clear basis for a legislative initiative - in codecision with Parliament - on public services, which are services of general interest, there is still no concrete proposal forthcoming."
"Public services lie at the heart of our social model."
"The people of Europe are waiting for clarification that competition rules and single market rules will not suddenly just be imposed on them."
"Mr President, you should present an initiative to Parliament on this issue."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I welcome many aspects of the Commission programme."
"In particular, I am delighted to see the Commission's commitment to bring forward a specific horizontal directive under Article 13 to combat discrimination in access to goods and services, although perhaps I would have preferred to see specific directives in all sectors."
"However, I do welcome it."
"This is something I and many other colleagues have been calling for, and I look forward to working with the Commission closely on this."
"I also welcome the Commission's commitment to a communication on hospital-acquired infections."
"We need to work towards a code of practice at European level to ensure best practice is shared and standards are raised, given the stark differences that exist between Member States."
"I would also like to see an amendment to the 2000 Biological Agents Directive to protect health workers from contracting HIV and hepatitis C from needle stick injuries."
"There are over one million such injuries across the EU each year, and I am disappointed that there is no action planned in this 2008 work programme."
"I would urge the Commission to bring forward that amendment as soon as possible in line with the Parliament's request."
"I would also say, under health and safety legislation, that I am pleased that you are committed to having impact assessments before any new legislation is brought forward."
"But I urge you to make sure that you look at the implementation of current legislation as well."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I am delighted at the prominence given to energy policy in the Commission's plans."
"I would nonetheless like to draw attention to the need to achieve a balance between environmental and strategic aims."
"It is very easy to impose new environmental taxes, and easy to demand better environmental standards for construction and industry, but this will not, however, resolve the problem of our energy security."
"Political measures aimed at energy solidarity in a crisis are required."
"The principles of the common market should be urgently applied to energy proprietors who also control distribution."
"This is particularly important if the proprietors hail from third countries, such as Russia, where the principle of subsidiarity is not applied in the area of foreign investments."
"Countries at risk of economic blackmail will be more inclined to bear the cost of environmental programmes if the latter go hand in hand with strategic solutions vital to Europe's energy security."
"I remain under the impression that we have failed to achieve a balance in this area."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Mr Barroso this morning sounds rather like a bad First World War general: let us do the same thing we did last week, even though it did not work."
"There is absolutely no recognition that the model simply is not working."
"I mean, how could he talk about growth and jobs without acknowledging that this wonderful, fabled Lisbon Strategy has been a total disaster?"
"We have not achieved a single one of the objectives."
"And yet we talk about growth and jobs, but what are we going to do?"
"Are we going to deregulate?"
"Are we going to lift the burden off business?"
"No, nothing of the kind."
"I wonder how he has got the front to talk about a sustainable Europe when we still have the same common fisheries policy, we are still throwing back, dead, up to 50% of the fish we catch and yet we are going to stick with the quota system."
"But perhaps my favourite is the idea that this Commission programme is going to put the citizens first."
"That is laughable!"
"If you wanted to put the citizens first, you would respect their opinions."
"You would have listened to what the French and Dutch said and you would give them, with this new Treaty, the opportunity, in free and fair and open referendums, to see whether they share with you the same vision for the future of Europe."
"But you are doing none of that."
"You are burying your heads in the sand."
"You are pretending it is not happening and you are actually destroying your own European Union because the whole thing falls further into public contempt."
"(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the members of the EPP-ED Group who are concerned with budgetary matters have essentially been happy to approve the Commission's plans for 2008, and Mr Barroso has formulated a clear message that reflects political commitment."
"However, the work programme itself is rather an endless wish-list."
"If we were to debate the legislative programme and annual political strategy right at the start of the year, drawing them together, then the budget could be shaped to our goals, and not the goals to the budget."
"Parliament is committed to the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology and expects the Commission and the Council to make a decision on these matters that serves to benefit European citizens."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise that the Commission not only serves growth and job creation through many programmes but also uses taxpayers' money responsibly and demands similar responsibility from the Member States."
"I approve of the fact that, in the event of serious abuse, the Commission is prepared to suspend payments to the Member State in question."
"Hopefully, this painful step will not need to be taken but everyone, governments and European citizens, should know that the aim of aid is to develop under-developed regions, and that growth and job creation do not constitute an increase in the bank balances of smooth operators and spongers."
"The Commission can also count on the strong support and cooperation of Parliament in this area."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(PL) Mr President, I am glad that matters relating to growth and employment head the list of the European Commission's priorities for 2008."
"This is evidence of an understanding that full employment and preservation of the wide range of social services characteristic of the European social model cannot be achieved without swift and sustainable growth."
"Unfortunately, the Commission's document is disappointing because it lacks detail."
"The situation will not be improved simply by repeated reference to mantras such as 'the knowledge society' and 'flexicurity', whilst the Lisbon Strategy remains largely confined to paper."
"Specific and more determined action is required, so as to encourage European societies to be more active on the labour market, remove barriers within the single market, notably in the area of the free movement of labour and services, and create more favourable conditions for entrepreneurs."
"Europe is a world leader in terms of social and environmental protection."
"Europe's potential for growth is too low, however, and will not enable it to retain its position."
"Action should focus mainly on developing education, and increasing flexibility and readiness for work."
"We must move away from a paternalistic social policy that perpetuates inactivity towards a social policy that rewards activity on the labour market."
"The common currency has an important role to play in the creation of economic competition."
"I welcome the enlargement of the euro zone to include Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta."
"The discriminatory treatment meted out to certain new Member States endeavouring to join the euro zone should be cause for concern, however."
"Lithuania is a case in point."
"Any recurrence of such errors in the future could be detrimental above all for the eurozone."
"We trust that the European Commission will present us with specific proposals regarding support for employment and growth, so as to ensure a high and constantly rising standard of living in a united Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the PPE-DE Group is concerned, the objectives for the coming year in the field of the internal market and consumer protection are very clear."
"Firstly, we want to see the completion of the internal market through the removal of remaining barriers and obstacles."
"That is why, Mr Kyprianou, we welcome your proposal for a health services directive, based on Article 95, which would adopt a very broad-brush approach to the health sector."
"We also welcome the fact that Mr McCreevy and his Directorate-General will be looking at further aspects of public procurement as a follow-up to the Services Directive."
"Secondly, we want to see comparable standards of consumer protection being established in all Member States of the European Union and, Mrs Kuneva, we greatly welcome your review of all the relevant EU legislation in this area."
"We are also pleased that we can act on this review in two directives, firstly in a horizontal instrument and then in a revision directive which will cover all the other areas to be dealt with."
"Thirdly, we want to help achieve a situation in which we finally have clearer, simpler and therefore fewer rules in the European Union."
"I am turning to you now, Mr Verheugen: as Members of this Parliament we will be looking very closely at all the proposals relating to the free movement of goods from this perspective."
"The Toy Safety Directive will come, as will the Construction Products Directive, and I am sure we will see some movement on tractors and defence goods as well."
"We hope that we will make tangible progress here."
"We are also very much looking forward to your anticipated study on consumer labelling."
"Sustainable Europe"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, thank you to the Commission."
"The Commission's policy is Lisbon."
"The Parliament's policy is Lisbon, but Lisbon is not happening."
"We want to know why not, we want to see progress and we want to see that monitoring and enforcement."
"President Barroso talked about prizes."
"Let us have the Barroso prize for achievement each year for the Member State that has made most progress."
"Why not?"
"Give them some encouragement."
"Where we do want progress is on some of the things in the programme."
"We obviously want it on emissions trading."
"We do not want to see it slipping any more than the one month he referred to."
"We want progress on climate change, quite clearly."
"We want progress both in terms of what we can do through legislative restriction on emissions and so on, but also what we can do to encourage individuals."
"So let us have the things like eco-labelling proposals coming forward."
"We also want some progress on the information to patients - Mr Verheugen's proposal."
"We want to see progress on patient mobility and cross-border health."
"That is urgent."
"Otherwise, we are going to have lawyers deciding policy for us."
"We want to see that coming forward along with measures on patient safety, medical professionals' information, work on hospital-acquired infections, work against the counterfeiting of drugs and so forth. We want to see that mental health proposal which has been promised and has not yet appeared."
"It was promised for this year."
"Let us have it please."
"That is an important step."
"Lastly, this week we have the very first World Diabetes Day - the UN has supported this, as have Member States, the Council and the Parliament."
"Let us have a bit of support from the Commission on progress on that as they see the symbol that we are going to erect in the courtyard of this Parliament tomorrow."
"Let that be a reminder that we want some action to support the many families, and children in particular, who suffer from that debilitating disease."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I am very pleased to see that climate change remains one of the key priorities of the Commission for the coming year."
"Here we have an awful lot to deliver and I think we should focus on that delivery."
"I understand why Commissioner Dimas is delaying the publication of the ETS and the other parts of the energy package until the new year, but I hope that does not mean that we are losing our resolve on climate change."
"There is a certain amount of scepticism in Washington and elsewhere about how serious the European Union is about climate change."
"It would be a real shame at a time when we are seeing changes in Washington, on both sides, Republican and Democrat, where we are seeing changes in Australia and a willingness to begin dialogue in China and India, if we were to stumble on our reform package on climate change."
"We had our summit in March but it is not enough to talk about targets."
"We have got to implement them."
"We cannot just 'talk the talk' on climate change; we have to 'walk the walk' on climate change."
"You, as the Commission, cannot do that alone."
"You need the governments of Europe to back you, and there will be a tough debate on burden-sharing in the new year."
"I hope this Parliament will be involved in that debate, not just watching on the sidelines, and we look forward to seeing how we can be involved."
"But you also need the support of this House, and I say to the colleagues opposite and to the Liberals: last month, on cars, you let us down on climate change because you watered down the Commission proposals."
"There will be another test later this morning on aviation emissions and I hope that we will have a strong package."
"Finally, Mr Barroso mentioned the committee of wise men or wise people, which Mr Sarkozy wants to set up."
"Why cannot these wise people - yes I agree they should not be looking at institutional reform - why cannot they look at delivery, that we actually deliver what Europe promises, and then we will begin to make the reconnection with the citizens that is so often talked about."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I welcome very much the emphasis given in the 2008 work programme to the importance of a sustainable European energy policy."
"President Barroso spoke out about the greening of the transport sector and, of course, that is vital."
"However, to my mind, the really shocking statistic is that in Europe we use 40% of our energy in buildings - in heating, cooling and lighting - even though we have the technology to design and engineer our buildings to have virtually no energy requirements at all."
"Therefore, I want to make a plea to the Commission to be radical in its review of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive next year - point 2(c) of the Strategic Initiatives."
"Two things are needed."
"Firstly, the minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings should be tightened."
"We need to move very quickly to a passive house or 'zero carbon' standard, with no net energy requirement."
"Thousands of passive houses are now being built in Europe but, unfortunately, only in a few countries and regions."
"Secondly and most importantly, we need to get rid of the 1 000 m2 threshold and bring all buildings with a heating or cooling requirement within the scope of the Directive."
"That would mean all buildings undergoing major renovation would be brought up to high energy standards."
"We have to look at the energy wasted in existing buildings and not just at new buildings, because 75% of the buildings which exist today will still be standing in 2050."
"MEPs have been discussing the Commission's action plan on energy efficiency in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and it seems to me that there is the political will in Parliament for a radical revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive."
"I hope we can count on the Commission to come forward with some strong proposals next year so that we can stop this completely unnecessary wasting of energy in our buildings."
"Mr President, we, too, welcome the Commission's vigorous efforts, the legislative programme and the work programme."
"The programme brings out the need to adopt measures in the transport sector that are more environmentally friendly; it highlights the Strategic EU Energy Review, the suppression of biodiversity and the marine environment strategy."
"We recognise the EU's major contribution so far to the fight against climate change, about which several Members have already spoken."
"My only comment with regard to accepting the inevitable period of climate change we will have to undergo is that I disagree."
"Rather than accept it, we should put pressure on our partners to comply with the Kyoto Protocol and abide by the post-Kyoto commitments to reduce gas emissions."
"We Europeans should also practise what we are constantly preaching."
"The European Commission also emphasises health and proposes numerous legislative and non-legislative packages."
"Medical insurance and quality of health services, pharmaceutical products, organ transplants, rare diseases and innovative technologies to fight chronic diseases are among the issues that the Commission intends to include in its programme."
"The Commission's targets are very ambitious, but we shall have to wait and see their finer detail."
"Lastly, I must mention the Health Services Directive."
"Under what conditions will the free movement of patients and health professionals be permitted?"
"How can we avoid a disproportionate burden on health funds?"
"These are just some of the questions that we will have to consider in connection with this new directive."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission's work programme and I look forward with keen interest to hearing how the EU is going to meet its extremely ambitious greenhouse gas emission and energy targets."
"I was recently in Washington having meetings with the members of the Congress."
"They are fascinated to hear about our emissions trading system and are talking about cap and trade but they are rather incredulous about how ambitious our targets are."
"I am also looking forward with keen interest to hearing how we are going to further develop the common research area."
"As President Barroso is not here, I will forbear from commenting on the European Institute of Technology and move on swiftly to mention the Small Business Act, the Commission communication for small businesses, because there are high expectations in the small business community of this proposal."
"But I am bound to say that in my Member State it may cause some confusion since a non-legislative action described as an act is possibly something of an oxymoron in UK terms."
"Nevertheless, the small business sector is vitally important for our economy, for innovation and flexibility, for creating jobs, and it is to be supported."
"But we do have this habit at European level of being strong on rhetoric and weak on actions in support of small business."
"(DE) Mr President, the focus on a sustainable Europe arises, among other things, from our priority to protect the climate."
"There have been many references today to excessive bureaucracy, over-regulation and the violation of subsidiarity."
"It has also been made very clear that these arguments are invariably advanced whenever a new rule or law is unwelcome."
"However, in terms of effective climate protection, it is clear that if we had gone ahead 10 years ago and adopted rules to cut CO2 emissions from vehicles, the European Union would now be in a better position and we would not be under the pressure we are now feeling to bring about the effective climate protection that is required."
"It is also apparent from the European Commission's various assessments that one of our decisions, namely to cut CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, could be attained simply through compliance with legislation which is already on the statute books, and so my question to the Commission is this: what specific steps are being taken to monitor the implementation of existing legislation?"
"I have another question which relates to risk assessment on genetically modified organisms, which is also mentioned in the Commission's work programme."
"My question is this: what improvements is the Commission trying to make in this area?"
"As we know from many debates, this is also one of the main points of criticism of our work and of legislation in this field."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, the cohesion and regional policies function on the basis of the regulations with which we established a seven-year framework in 2006."
"A total of EUR 350 billion was earmarked for growth and employment, with priority for the Lisbon objectives, and there was a specific goal in mind."
"This is all well and good, you may say, but what is missing?"
"I am missing the Fifth Cohesion Report in the plan for next year: it was promised for June 2008."
"The report must lay the foundations for long-term adjustments to the cohesion policy and for our plans regarding the regions and cities."
"In our Member States there is a trend towards renationalisation, which Parliament firmly rejects as it covers a whole range of policy areas: R&D, innovation, regional cohesion and rural policy."
"In this context, I would like to address Commissioners Hübner and Potočnik."
"The PPE-DE Group launched the debate on the medium-term approach with a parliamentary hearing last week, quite rightly to look at the question in more depth and to bring the citizens and regions into focus in the coming years."
"Finally, the move to make the new Solidarity Fund more flexible, Mr President, has been blocked by the Council, and we would like to see a breakthrough there."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, much more support is required."
"(DE) Mr President, very briefly, I would like to list what I regard as the most important points arising from this work programme."
"Undoubtedly a key theme for 2008 is the Health Check for the common agricultural policy."
"The 2003 CAP reform should be reviewed and simplified, we all agree on that, and to that extent I hope, as rapporteur, that the important contributions that we in Parliament make to this own-initiative report will be taken into account in the ensuing legislative proposal."
"This Health Check must help us find the right path towards a common agricultural policy for the post-2013 period."
"A further project is the planned Green Paper on Agricultural Product Quality."
"Quality must become an even greater focus in agriculture, and this applies to farm imports from third countries as well, which must conform to the same standards as those applicable to EU producers."
"I am particularly keen on an initiative to promote the consumption of fruit in schools."
"This is something which we in the PPE-DE Group have been championing for some time, and we are gratified that the Commission intends to take up this initiative."
"Other key issues for 2008 such as the Milk Package, the 2008-2009 Budget Review, the Action Plan on EU Animal Health Strategy and the Review of Support for Less Favoured Areas will certainly make sure that there is no scope for any boredom in Parliament!"
"(DE) Mr President, the issue of transport and mobility is naturally also viewed as a priority in the programme for 2008."
"Of course, we have very clear challenges here."
"We must set priorities in 2008 ranging from economic efficiency, impact on the environment and, not least, the rights of users and their safety: issues which can only be touched on briefly here."
"The rules on security controls at airports, for example, were introduced in response to pressure from very topical events at the time."
"In the PPE-DE Group, we consider that the relevant directive could now be reviewed."
"As to passenger rights, this issue could be dealt with conclusively if we were to focus in more detail on the rights of passengers in international coach travel as well."
"That would mean that in Europe, passenger rights would be covered in all modes of transport: air travel, rail and road."
"As regards trans-European networks, this is a topic which we have discussed on frequent occasions in recent months."
"Here, of course, we face a special situation: too little money and a lot of projects, especially now that the Council has announced several new projects in recent weeks."
"We take the view that on the issue of trans-European networks, clear decisions must be taken in 2008, and that transboundary routes must have absolute priority so that the so-called bottlenecks disappear, allowing effective application of the principle of multimodal transport."
"A swift decision must and could be reached by taking account of those countries where cofinancing is already envisaged and where the projects have got off to a good start on a technical level."
"(ES) Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, in relation to the Commission's common fisheries policy proposals we again face a number of issues the Commission has not followed up as rapidly as it should have."
"Suffice to say we are some years behind in securing a new regulation on technical measures in the Atlantic: this is a fundamental aspect for fisheries management that we hoped to secure by 2008, since it would be the best possible contribution by CFP to the goal of simpler legislation."
"We would also like the Commission to make a start on issuing precise guidelines as to how it intends to apply the maximum sustainable yield model to EU fisheries, particularly multi-species fisheries."
"We feel it is important for specific legislative proposals to be put forward for eco-labelling of fisheries products since this will have significantly improve the traceability of these products and provide guarantees to prevent the consumption and sale of products obtained from illegal fishing."
"Finally, following the Commission's announcement that it intends to withdraw the draft agreement with Tanzania, I must pass on the request from the sector that it do all it can to continue negotiations with this country: they are vital to provide the tuna fleet with fishing grounds in this area of Africa through a number of agreements with adjoining exclusive economic zones."
"An integrated approach to migration"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we are discussing the programme for 2008, I would like to start by pointing out that we have made major progress in the field of home affairs policy in recent months, and I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Frattini for that."
"We have Schengen, and this week in plenary we have taken major steps forward with Prüm, the Visa Information System (VIS) and data protection. This is major progress."
"We cannot leave it at that, however. Now it is about the practical work for tomorrow."
"The key priority for all of us, on a practical basis, is to make major progress with SIS II."
"In the PPE-DE Group, our main concern is that after the great success of the enlargement of the Schengen area, fatigue will now set in and many Member States will slip into a state of inertia."
"That is something we cannot afford."
"We need SIS II as a major project for next year."
"In the legislative sphere, I would like to touch upon the border security issue again in particular."
"Here, we must consider whether in future the evaluation of external border protection should no longer be carried out by Schengen members' own evaluation teams but by the Frontex agency. That is where this responsibility should lie."
"I would ask the Commission to be brave and, on the proposals regarding migration, to actually define a European added value."
"If a proposal is submitted for a Blue Card for highly skilled workers, this should not just be a proposal that endorses national rules and applies a common label: it really has to be a European proposal."
"The same applies to combating terrorism."
"If a system for the transmission of air passenger records is established, we cannot have 27 individual rules, which we could bring in straight away; we really need a European proposal."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot go along with a lot of what President Barroso has said, especially when he says that the Commission is being tough on illegal immigration but very generous and supportive on integration."
"We can certainly agree to the directive on penalising employers who illegally employ non-Community migrant workers, but we find no trace in the programme of those legislative measures on legal migration previously announced by Vice-President Frattini."
"No mention is made of the Directives on seasonal workers and highly skilled workers, nor of opening up legal migration channels for unskilled non-Community workers, who constitute the majority of immigrants now present on EU soil."
"We believe these measures to be necessary, not least so as to combat exploitation and bring undeclared work out into the open."
"The reference to a shared overall approach is fine, and one cannot fail to agree on the need to avoid having 27 different immigration policies, but we look forward to receiving some more tangible information about the European surveillance system announced in the programme."
"Finally, Mr President, I would recall that under the new Lisbon Treaty many of these subjects will be handled through codecision as of 1 January 2009, with this House assuming full legislative responsibility alongside the Council and the Commission."
"It might perhaps be useful to prepare the ground for better cooperation among the EU institutions."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, one point I wanted to make was very similar to what Mr Fava has just said about the absence of any major emphasis on the need for an EU policy on legal migration."
"We have had the proposals from Commissioner Frattini - and all credit to him - but we need great pressure to be put on Member States to respond to those proposals because the challenge of getting a comprehensive and well managed legal migration system for the EU should be up there with the challenge of climate change."
"It links into so many other issues, economic and social."
"We should be having a summit of Prime Ministers to look at not only EU competence but also exchanges of best practice on management of migration as well as integration."
"I must confess I have my doubts about the emphasis that is put by the Commission on the benefits of circular migration."
"I wonder whether that is going to come unstuck in the same way that our experience with Gastarbeiter did many years ago."
"I am not sure that it is going to work out."
"Human beings do not necessarily leave when they envisaged that they would leave."
"My last point is to raise data protection concerns about the envisaged entry-exit scheme and the electronic travel authorisation."
"I do not know what electronic travel authorisation will add to the visa information system, and I look forward to hearing a great deal more from Commissioner Frattini about these schemes."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements in which 12 new countries acceded to the Union are now behind us."
"It is now time to focus on the integration of all the citizens of the 27 countries and to set a common course and common challenges for Europe."
"One of the points in the Commission's programme is to put the citizens first."
"With that in mind, future enlargements should be approached with caution and due consideration."
"Enlargements opposed by the citizens should be avoided."
"I have in mind Turkey."
"As Mr Barroso pointed out, we lack a common immigration policy."
"I trust that the principle adopted will involve controlled immigration, carefully selected, as in the United States."
"After all, immigration is not simply a response to particular circumstances affecting the labour market or pensions."
"It involves people with whom we will have to coexist for centuries."
"We should select individuals who will find integrating into European civilisation a pleasure rather than an imposition."
"- (EL) Mr President, Europe benefits from its immigrants, but in today's Europe xenophobia is increasing rather than diminishing."
"The example of Italy is fresh in our minds."
"In my country, Greece, an EP delegation recently saw for themselves the wretched conditions in which hundreds of immigrants and asylum seekers are detained on the island of Samos."
"This was in a detention centre which Ministers promised would be closed immediately, but which is still open, despite a report by an international NGO condemning it for torturing illegal immigrants."
"Unfortunately, in the present dangerous climate, instead of promoting the positive aspects of immigration, the Commission is responding to a climate of fear artfully created in certain sectors."
"The problem you have presented us with focuses mainly on policing, and this is somewhat biased."
"It is necessary, of course, to combat illegal immigration."
"There is a need for solidarity with countries receiving huge influxes of immigrants."
"Proper agreements on readmission at European level and the common European protection of immigrants' fundamental rights are needed."
"Immigrants cannot be sent back into danger and destitution."
"Europe needs a serious foreign and economic policy to combat the main causes of migration, such as poverty and war, through peaceful yet tough measures."
"Above all, of course, a multilateral policy is needed to integrate migrants into our societies."
"Instead of this, your programme equates immigration with criminality."
"Commissioners, you are specifically stating that the European border control system, a programme that is integrated into the framework of immigration policies, will increase the internal security of the Schengen area by preventing illegal immigration, terrorism, etc. What does security have to do with immigration, or indeed with illegal immigration?"
"What does it have to do with terrorism?"
"By associating these bogeys with immigration in the public imagination and in Europe's policies, I fear you are playing the game of the EU's far-right forces."
"Please eliminate these dangerous attitudes from your strategy documents."
"There are undoubtedly criminal immigrants, just as there are English, German and Greek criminals, but the immigrants' only real crime is that they were born in poor or war-torn regions."
"Putting the citizens first"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of budgetary control, the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008 is a disappointment because key issues and problems relating to budgetary control simply do not feature in the programme."
"It could be argued that this is about current management, but our concern is this: if we look at the past few years of 'current management', it is clear that in order to solve the problems, the Commission really should have adopted an agenda which went beyond current management."
"We are unlikely to make any progress on the statement of assurance, although the Commission should be bringing substantial pressure to bear on the Member States here."
"You have our support on this issue, yet we do not see you doing this."
"As a result, you are very likely to fall short of your own commitments: commitments which the Commission President himself undertook personally on behalf of this Commission."
"He pledged to move forward towards a positive statement of assurance."
"We are at least as far from achieving this now as in all the years before, as we have known since yesterday evening."
"When it comes to implementing the commitments, what we believe is lacking is a serious approach."
"The same applies, incidentally, to the Commission's legislative programme itself."
"You should be world champions in practical implementation, not in planning!"
"Of the 200 items for codification announced for 2007, just 23 have actually been submitted to Parliament to date, and only six of the 43 announced new items have been tabled so far."
"The question which arises is this: why are we even talking about this programme if you will not be putting it into practice?"
"You really need to do better in 2008."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to express my thanks to the Commission."
"A work programme is not just a declaration of principles, but a tool to implement specific policies."
"The humblest bid to implement, however, can be a gem, and I feel the real gems in this work programme are initiatives that place the European citizens centre stage: initiatives concerning, for example, patient safety, quality of health services or reconciliation of family and professional life, as Mr Barroso said in his speech here."
"We would have liked to have had this in writing in the same detail as part of the work programme."
"Perhaps the greatest gem of all, though, is the proposal for a directive to combat discrimination in all the Member States."
"We need this directive in this Year of Equal Opportunities for All because it must show that discrimination is not just a social, moral and political error, but also a waste of human resources."
"The Reform Treaty states that the EU must encourage not only social cohesion but also non-discrimination."
"Consequently, the right directives are needed because all European countries must have the same levels of protection against discrimination."
"There cannot be a discrimination hierarchy."
"A Europe that tolerates any kind of discrimination cannot purport to be an example to anyone."
"I do have one problem here, however, and that is the role of the European Parliament in this issue."
"All we have is its opinion, and it is rather ironic that we are encouraging equality here yet when it comes to institutions all of them are equal but some are more equal than others."
"I also regret that the introduction to this work programme makes little mention of, or reference to, discrimination against, and integration of, immigrants."
"We call on the Commission to keep the promise it made to this House that EU action will cover all areas of discrimination."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr Barroso's slogan is 'delivering results for Europe', but these results must also be in the area of intangible business, not only in the market."
"Mr Barroso's Commission was to become the champion of citizens' freedoms and rights."
"That has been very disappointing up until now, but with less than two years to go perhaps there is light at the end of the tunnel."
"As far as I am concerned, the highlight of the 2008 work programme is the proposal for a directive on equality outside the workplace, that is, a general prohibition of discrimination."
"At last the Commission is listening to what Parliament has been calling for over the last number of years."
"Priority must be given to this matter."
"However, the Commission must guarantee better compliance with the existing legislation because there is a discrepancy between the excellent anti-discrimination laws we already have and the Commission's inability to actually enforce them."
"The anti-discrimination principle must also be introduced in other areas, such as inheritance taxes and wills, and the Commission must recognise modern family set-ups in this respect."
"I also welcome the proposals to reinforce equality between men and women, for example by reconciling work and family life."
"As regards the position of women in the labour market, the proposals for more flexibility are important."
"Flexibility is, as it happens, good for women."
"Rigid rules for the protection of employees put women at a disadvantage."
"Intercultural dialogue has been highlighted as a priority."
"The intention is to get rid of social tensions by means of dialogue, but in reality this is often inter-religious dialogue and I therefore object to it, Commissioner."
"There is nothing concrete in the proposals for the coming year, and it is therefore not clear what the intercultural dialogue will be, but I fear that it might be the annual photograph of Mr Barroso with the generally conservative ecclesiastical leaders."
"I would like the agenda of these ..."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the following issues."
"First, as regards the multiannual strategy to establish an area of freedom security and justice: the draft Reform Treaty foresees the respect for the rights of persons belonging to minorities."
"I believe that now we really need a common European policy on minority rights and social inclusion - the recent events in Italy demonstrated this clearly."
"Speaking about putting the citizens first, I am sure that we have to return again to the concept of civic citizenship, which includes all permanent residents of the EU."
"Mr Frattini, the Commission should take a stand on this."
"As regards multilingualism, European policies to promote language diversity must take into account that not only official languages exist but also regional and minority languages."
"These languages should benefit from multilingualism policies also."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a kind of irony in the Commission claiming that it wants to put the citizen at the centre of the European project in its 2008 legislative programme."
"It is true that the citizen, the poor lowly citizen, has never before been central to the concerns of the Brussels-Frankfurt-Luxembourg triangle, where practically all the powers will be concentrated from now on, in other words in the hands of institutions that do not even respect the fundamental principles of democracy."
"How, therefore, can we claim that we are promoting the welfare of our citizens in the era of globalisation when in fact we are in the process of abandoning the principle of the republic, which is government of the people, by the people, for the people?"
"Caring for the citizen means respecting what he has to say."
"In this regard, the Lisbon Treaty is an insult to the people of our nations, because it is just a copy and paste job of the European Constitution that was overwhelmingly rejected and because it confirms the logic of the current Treaties that prohibit us from controlling the euro, from safeguarding our markets, from protecting our borders from illegal immigration and from defending ourselves in international trade negotiations."
"In particular - and these remarks are intended especially for my French colleagues in all the parliamentary groups - this Lisbon Treaty does not change the dogmatic concept of competition without balances, without national interests, without frontiers and without any concern for democracy."
"Its Charter of Fundamental Rights, which takes precedence over the rights of individual Member States, sweeps away the notion of the Citizen of the Republic as laid down in our Constitution and replaces it with the most dangerous form of multiculturalism."
"As for the Citizen of Europe, no one has ever met him: in fact he does not exist."
"To conclude, therefore, if anyone here is concerned about the citizen let them start by demanding a general referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the perspective of the PPE-DE Group in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to make the following three points."
"Firstly, we very much welcome the fact that the European Commission has included a proposal for a European Company Statute in its legislative programme for next year."
"This is something which this House has wanted for a very long time, and so it is very welcome indeed."
"What we find regrettable is that the Commission has, in effect, been forced into this course of action after we made use of the legal instrument of Article 192 and opted to present a legislative own-initiative report, despite the fact that the Commission has been aware of this problem for a very long time. Indeed, it has been mentioned repeatedly in a whole series of company law programmes ever since the days of Commissioner Bolkestein."
"Secondly, we find it most regrettable that this year, the Commission suspended the process for the adoption of the Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered office of limited companies."
"This is indeed a major problem."
"We expect the Commission to reconsider and include it in future legislative programmes."
"If this does not happen, may I make it clear here and now that we will again make use of Article 192 and force the Commission to bring forward a relevant legislative proposal."
"The Commissioner's notions that for the application of the Merger Directive, it would first be necessary to set up a company in another country in order to merge with it are bureaucratic and absurd."
"This is not a solution that we regard as acceptable."
"With a view to the next legislative term, at least, we would also like to see the Commission giving some thought to achieving progress in relation to copyright and perhaps commissioning a Green Paper on this issue."
"(ES) Mr President, we are obviously extremely pleased that citizens are at the forefront of the European project, but I must point out that one of the EU's major problems is the general public's vast lack of knowledge of what the Union is."
"I think any of us who give talks, teach or speak on the subject witness this phenomenon."
"Only the other day the media in my country referred to your colleague Mrs Ferrero-Waldner as the Swiss Commissioner."
"Having said this, what we need, year after year, is a specific and broad awareness campaign to bring the European project closer to citizens and to gradually raise awareness of the institutions and how they operate."
"I would also ask the Commission for a more accurate definition and smoother communication with this House and the Committee on Culture and Education in relation to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008, since the website clearly has some major limitations."
"Europe as a world partner"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, it is true that 2008 will be an important year, as the President of the Commission said, but it will be a year of transition prior to the end of this Commission's mandate."
"I think if we can draw one conclusion, it is that the Durão Barroso Commission, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which it was forced to handle EU affairs, was clearly equal to the task, both internally - the work programme - and in terms of its external image."
"In my capacity as group coordinator in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am worried about a number of future international events such as the election of the next President of the United States and the repercussions of this on conflicts in central Asia, talks with a new Russian President, development of the Neighbourhood Policy and accession negotiations, assistance in the event of a statute for Kosovo, the result of the Annapolis Conference in the Middle East, the elections we all wish to see in Pakistan, the Olympic Games in China after the Communist Party Congress and the next EU-Latin America Summit in Peru."
"However, Madam Vice-President, please ask the President of the Commission to reiterate our praise of the Commissioners responsible for external relations."
"I see that only Mr Rehn is here today and I also wish to extend my congratulations to Mr Mandelson, Mr Michel and, of course, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"The most important thing here is for the EU's external action to be visible and effective, and I would ask you, Madam Vice-President, to exercise extreme caution when applying the provisions of the new Treaty so as not to compromise EU achievements and successes in foreign policy."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, most EU citizens agree that the Union must play a larger role on the world stage."
"The Council should play a larger role in this regard, but it is often paralysed or inefficient as a result of internal disagreements."
"The Commission will hopefully set a good example this coming year, starting in Europe."
"In Turkey the negotiations must proceed smoothly and care must be taken to see that they stay on the right track."
"There is much work to do in the Balkans: Bosnia needs help to start forming a state and Macedonia needs to prepare for the start of membership negotiations."
"In addition, of course, the European Union will hopefully make an important contribution to the rebuilding of Kosovo and with any luck by the end of this year or some time next year a solution will have been found to the question of its status."
"We very much want the Commission, however, to continue with the Black Sea initiative it has undertaken."
"It is very important for the European Union to strive for regional cooperation around its borders."
"What will the Commission do in terms of the Central Asia strategy that was recently approved by the European Council?"
"In this respect, I also wish to ask if we may expect further development of the energy policy that Parliament requested earlier this year."
"This is very important, including with regard to relations with the region I called 'zonet'."
"Then there is the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"I think that the priority this coming year must be to conclude the negotiations with Ukraine: in this respect we hope - and Parliament will discuss this tomorrow afternoon - that a situation can be created in that country that will allow, over the coming years, for a new type of agreement, a form of association, under which Ukraine can continue the reform process with the new government towards further integration with the European Union."
"In that process Moldova must not be forgotten either, as it is in need of a new partnership agreement."
"I hope that the Commission will also present proposals on that issue next year."
"Naturally we must also look at how to handle a country like Georgia: this is something we will also debate tomorrow afternoon and we would ask the Commission to be proactive in this regard."
"Finally, there has been very little progress with Russia so what can we do to move things forward?"
"We would suggest renewed action after the presidential elections."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to my regret I have to say that I am disappointed with the section of your legislative and work programme on Europe as a world player."
"There is of course little legislation in the field of external relations, as we all know, but there is all the more work to be done for that and I find that what has been written on the subject, with a couple of exceptions, is in fact grossly inadequate."
"There is obviously also difficulty in clearly identifying Europe's fundamental problem when it comes to foreign policy."
"The text glibly states that Europe is a world leader in the fight against poverty, the promotion of sustainable development, human rights and governance, and so on and so forth."
"That may well be, but it is not perceived as such by the rest of the world, certainly not by the EU Member States, and I hear very many complaints that it is not so."
"What is true, however, is that the European Union is the largest provider of all these things that are listed."
"Reflecting this in our image as a world leader, as a body that takes the lead on the global stage, is something else entirely."
"I am encouraged by the positive direction of the programme's proposals concerning Africa."
"I feel, for example, that the proposal to establish trilateral discussions between the EU, Africa and China is particularly hopeful and positive."
"I also think that the proposals to make greater efforts to promote economic development in Africa is just as important."
"We are thus moving in the right direction, although there are still not enough specific goals."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the year 2008 will differ from the current year in that it will not bring a further enlargement of the Union."
"The coming year will, however, provide an opportunity to develop economic and political relations between the Union and a number of important countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and also for instance in the South Caucasus, as previous speakers have already mentioned."
"We must keep two Union priorities in mind."
"Firstly, participation in peaceful stabilisation, notably in the Middle East and South Asia."
"Secondly, exerting pressure on all our partners to ensure that the development of our bilateral relations in the areas of economics and politics is linked to respect for human rights."
"This applies to each and every one of our partners, regardless of whether the particular country concerned is a poor African or Asian one, powerful Russia or fast-developing China."
"These two areas, the political and economic on the one hand and human rights on the other, cannot be torn asunder and dealt with separately."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, 'Europe as a world partner' is a very nice heading for the Commission programme, but what we are really talking about is the European Union, not Europe, and it is presumptuous to use this heading at all, for Europe is far greater than just the European Union."
"The EU wishes to present itself as a world partner, and the Commission's programme is very honest about this: it talks about a foreign policy to project, promote and protect - and therefore assert - Europe's interests and values successfully."
"How is that supposed to happen?"
"The answer, increasingly, is by using military means!"
"The European Union is now a military actor all over the world."
"On paper, this is to provide assistance to people, but in practice, EU interests, or the interests of EU Member States, are being asserted by military means. Congo is a good example."
"The EU's military intervention there has ensured that Joseph Kabila, an autocrat who is acceptable to the EU, is now in power, backed by elections, and his opponent has been forced into exile."
"A brutal war has erupted in Eastern Congo, with some 350 000 people forced to flee their homes."
"The EU's military intervention in Chad, too, has primarily served to bolster the position of military ruler Idriss Déby, an old friend of France."
"This type of EU military operation is simply a continuation of Member States' neo-colonial policies."
"It seems that it is difficult to voice unadorned criticism of political friends."
"Pakistan is a case in point at present."
"The basis for all of this is the Reform Treaty, which makes a clearly militarised EU policy possible."
"The next issue is Kosovo, and we are seeing what can happen there."
"Individual Member States have already announced that they intend to recognise Kosovo on a unilateral basis."
"I urge the Commission to reject such measures unequivocally and not to condone any unilateral recognition of Kosovo."
"Mr President, at the risk of upsetting Commissioner Dimas again, I will repeat some of the words I said last night."
"Only legislate, Commission, please, where it is needed in the new work programme."
"Enforce the regulations that we already have in place and enforce them right across the European Union."
"Do not bring in policies which actually discriminate against industry, business, opportunities within the European Union."
"Commissioner Barroso mentioned something very close to my heart on the Committee on International Trade, and that is trade defence instruments."
"Use them where it is necessary to protect the health and safety of consumers in the European Union but do not use them as a protectionist measure."
"We live in, as he quite rightly said, a global economy, and I look forward to seeing that."
"With regard to Commissioner Mandelson, I wish him well in the WTO Doha Agreement and I hope that we can move agriculture forward with the US and the European Union to ensure we get a settlement, building on things like Euromed, which are very important to the European Union."
"We have agreements with Morocco and we must look at these sort of situations."
"The US has just put in a free trade agreement on that."
"Finally on EPAs: just over a month ago, Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson was standing strong on his commitment to conclude EPA negotiations by December."
"Let us hope that he has relaxed his position and will move forward on that."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the context and constraints affecting the Commission in the field of foreign policy, and so we are grateful for the efforts it has made, for example, to ensure that aid continues to reach the Palestinian people after the dramatic turn taken by events following the legislative elections."
"On this subject, we would suggest to the Commission that it prepare as of now for possible future scenarios, whether the Annapolis conference is a success - as we hope it will be - or a failure."
