"For example, may I remind you that the new Title IV of the EC Treaty provided by Amsterdam will remove from the national parliaments all decision making powers in the field of immigration, without providing any replacement control for at least five years, and then only the inadequate control of the European Parliament."
"Such deficiencies cannot be remedied by simple interinstitutional agreements which have the distinction of being prepared in obscurity, leaving out the national parliaments, and not being ratified by the people."
"The method and the objectives have to be changed."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations believes that to overcome the democratic deficit in Europe we need a new treaty - note the use of the word 'treaty' rather than 'interinstitutional agreements' - to restore the national parliaments' role within the European decision making process."
"In this respect, I regret that Members have once again shown ostracism, a few days ago, by excluding on principle the national parliaments from control of the euro."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Amsterdam Treaty constitutes a significant step on the road to the democratization of the European Union, and our journey down this road must continue."
"The Intergovernmental Conference has agreed that the common institutions should use every means to improve their functioning without any change in the Treaties."
"There is room for manoeuvre and the Herman report suggests various themes which we think are of prime importance."
"Firstly, economic and monetary union."
"The future president of the ECB has ensured us that he is willing to hold regular quarterly meetings to exchange ideas."
"We emphatically welcome this readiness for dialogue, but it is something which should not just depend on the goodwill of whoever is in charge at the ECB."
"That is why we want an interinstitutional agreement - one which also incorporates Parliament's participation in the procedures for coordinating EU economic policy."
"Secondly, Parliament continues to play a weak role, both in the area of foreign trade and payments policy, and in competition policy."
"The current information procedures are in need of improvement."
"The details of this should also be decided by interinstitutional agreements."
"Thirdly, employment and social policy."
"The fight against unemployment and the development of the European social model are priority issues, the importance of which is also confirmed by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The latter makes Parliament an equal legislator in many areas of social policy."
"But there is a yawning gap in the democratic process where agreements between the social partners at European level are to be implemented by Council decisions."
"The fact that there are no plans to involve Parliament is in stark contradiction to the principle that legislative actions always require Parliamentary legitimation."
"Such a process must now be established, at least on an informal basis, and this is something which also requires an interinstitutional agreement."
"After all, as we know, it is still true to say that more democratization in Europe logically means more reforms."
"Mr President, the decision making process over the euro has demonstrated again that the degree of democracy in the European Union is still in need of urgent improvement."
"Admittedly, we have made important progress with the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I estimate that some 80 % of legislation and the budget will soon be controlled by the European Parliament, but that does not alter the fact that a number of important areas are not included, as my colleague Mr Herman has indicated in his report."
"Agricultural policy, fisheries policy, common trade policy, competition policy and development cooperation policy - none of these types of areas are yet controlled in this democratic way."
"We are not likely to be able to do anything about this before the next round of Treaty changes."
"Mr Herman has made an excellent proposal to try and improve this control in the meantime by concluding interinstitutional agreements."
"I find this an excellent proposal, and I think we should do it - not just in relation to the area discussed in the report, but also in other areas."
"At the same time we must ensure the Treaties are changed, and give our support to this, before a number of new Member States join."
"Mr President, perhaps we should also get ready to show our teeth, because I for one am of the opinion that we should now start to withdraw our cooperation from measures which are not subject to democratic control, exercised by either national parliaments or by our own Parliament. We could do this at the consultation stage."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament ought to be improved."
"Many parliaments have so-called joint committees."
"These do not yet exist in the Netherlands, but I hope that the newly-elected Lower House in the Netherlands will soon introduce such a joint committee, so that the twilight zone of institutional cooperation can be better controlled, by the national parliaments as well as by the European Parliament."
"I should like to support Mr Herman's proposal wholeheartedly. His report deserves wide support today, from the entire Parliament."
"Mr President, congratulations! You are making great strides in Dutch."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament likes to complain, and does so frequently, about the slowness of the European decision making process. We also tread new paths, as is our duty."
"We like to signpost new routes for the future."
"Despite this, European reality sometimes progresses more quickly than expected."
"The promises about a continuous dialogue between the executive board of the European Central Bank and this Parliament strike me as a good and happy example of this."
"My group and I will in future unfailingly continue to contribute to an increase in openness, transparency and accountability in all the Union's institutions, as we have always done."
"Some of these institutions are beginning to understand that the people of Europe will only continue to accept the Union if 'accountability' , as it is called in English, is implicit."
"The Commission understands this, and the executive board of the European Central Bank seem to understand this too."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by sharing with you my opinion that it is the Council, as an extension of the governments of the Member States, who have the greatest difficulty in understanding their duty with respect to safeguarding democracy in the entire Union."
"Together with the rapporteur and our colleagues in this Parliament, we will see to it that their understanding continues to improve."
"Mr President, the Herman report is commendable, indicating as it does the democratic deficit that exists within the Union."
"The report shows very clearly something which, in effect, we already knew: that is, how much is wanting as far as democratic control, democratic legitimacy, openness and transparency are concerned."
"This is a very serious democratic problem, not least in respect of EMU, the euro and economic policy."
"To employ temporary arrangements to rectify or compensate for these democratic shortcomings retrospectively is perhaps akin to crying in the wilderness."
"Nevertheless, I must support the interinstitutional agreement proposed in the report, since it at least helps to do something about the democratic deficit."
"I shall also be voting for the amendment by the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, which states that such an agreement requires consultation with the Member States and also greater influence for, and consultation with, the national parliaments."
"But the real deficit is surely the lack of support among the citizens for such issues as EMU, and the lack of dialogue."
"Mr President, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur who is pursuing a line this Parliament has always pursued, namely taking the Treaties as they stand, recognizing their insufficiencies but trying to interpret them in the most creative way possible, trying to take the Treaties and, as it were, stretch them like a piece of elastic to try to get as much out of them as is reasonably possible."
"Mr Herman is a veteran of the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"He knows very well what is possible and what is not possible in this regard."
"He has come up with another admirable piece of work today."
"Our colleague from the Europe of Nations Group, however, claims that this is undemocratic, that it is changing the constitution by means of backdoor deals in closed rooms between the institutions."
"I must beg to differ with that view."
"After all, what is done can only be done in the context of the Treaties."
"It cannot change the Treaties."
"So the Treaties as ratified by all our national parliaments will not be changed by the back door."
"But there is always room for interpreting Treaties and for going for one interpretation rather than another."
"It is quite legitimate for us to do this."
"It is something Parliament has done in the past with great skill and we are doing it again."
"Far from being undemocratic, any interinstitutional agreement is between the elected governments who meet in the Council on the one hand and the directly elected Parliament on the other."
"It is an agreement reached in public whose text is voted in a public vote in the elected Parliament."
"It is not undemocratic."
"I very much regret that the EN Group - which I believe officially stands for the Europe of Nations Group but should really stand for Eurosceptic Nutcases - takes this particular view."
"I am sure that the overwhelming majority in the European Parliament will back the resolution that has been put before us."
"Mr President, the Herman report is very much to the point and has the relevance we have come to expect from our intelligent and tireless colleague."
"Firstly, because the democratization of European economic policy is more necessary than ever since the arrival of the third stage of monetary union."
"Also, because Amsterdam alone has not resolved the problem, since economic and monetary matters were excluded from the negotiations."
"We do know, however, that it is becoming more and more difficult to get anything out of intergovernmental conferences, however hard you squeeze them."
"An interinstitutional agreement to involve the European Parliament in the decision making legitimization chain is appropriate with the advent of an economic policy that will of necessity be more and more a joint one, in the wake of the single currency."
"An independent single currency is the very symbol of an emancipated European civil society, of which the currency is more truly the expression than any political power."
"That is another reason why the only body that represents that civil society - the European Parliament - should be brought into the front line of political participation."
"So an interinstitutional agreement may be the right way to plug the gaps in the Treaties."
"What is more, in some of the cases I have described, the European Parliament has already acted informally."
"And the Council also accepted the institutionalization of participation by the European Parliament only last week, particularly as regards Agenda 2000."
"Everyone, therefore, is aware that our most important future task should be democratization above all."
"I would like to thank Mr Herman for his work."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the lack of democratic control pursuant to the Euratom Treaty."
"This is not an abstract issue but a very specific one."
"Nuclear matters are an important part of European activities, and the powers of the Commission under the Treaty, especially in the context of international agreements, are quite extensive."
"The present issue of non-proliferation in India is a case in point."
"Paradoxically, the role of the European Parliament is minimal, or rather, non-existent in this area."
"This is no longer acceptable in 1998-40 years after the signature of the Euratom Treaty."
"I am therefore very pleased that Mr Herman has taken this point on board in paragraphs 15 and 16."
"We are now faced with the specific matter of KEDO, the Korean Energy Development Organization, which raises geopolitical issues and issues of nuclear non-proliferation, safety and energy, but the European Parliament is playing a very marginal role."
"I am very pleased to see Commissioner Oreja here and I call on him to take the initiative to agree to institute a formal consultation procedure on the important matter of KEDO."
"I hope also for the support of this House for Amendment No 3, which asks the Commission for information on the financial consequences of this important issue before signing the agreement."
"I think I have covered this in just under one and a half minutes."
"Mr President, the procedure with interinstitutional agreements is, in my opinion, extremely questionable from a democratic point of view."
"In the first place, it is not possible in any democratic country to amend constitutional laws in this manner."
"Such amendments must be effected in a manner that is open and subject to the control of the citizens."
"Secondly, the European Parliament cannot replace the authority of the national parliaments."
"The national parliaments are, of course, founded on what we call the principle of national sovereignty - that is, they are the leading legislative institution within the state."
"The European Parliament, on the other hand, is of course bound and trapped in a complex structure where the citizens truly lack influence and which is not ruled by the openness that prevails in national systems."
"Moreover, the national parliaments have historically been carried forward by parties and movements struggling for democratic and civil rights."
"The European Parliament, on the other hand, has been created ""from above' , and its tragedy is that it really lacks a civil foundation."
"Thirdly, a genuine democratization of the Union would actually require a radical reform of its entire structure."
"The power of the Commission should decrease, since public officials are not supposed to have political power or to be as important as elected politicians."
"The power of the national parliaments should increase."
"The Council's power should also increase, since it, of course, consists of government representatives who have parliamentary accountability in their home countries."
"Finally, the overall organization of the Union should be substantially reduced in size."
"It is both wrong and unproductive that we sit here in the EU's institutions, including Parliament, and decide upon enormous amounts of details and regulations."
"Instead, we should be focusing all our energies on the major pan-European problems and questions."
"Mr President, I too welcome Mr Herman's report, particularly some parts of it that have hardly been touched on by previous speakers: the need to control power at European level where it has been lost by national parliaments, the need for greater parliamentary control over agricultural and trade policy and, in particular, its recognition that the European Parliament itself must be made more open and more effective."
"We often criticize the democratic deficit and shortcomings in other institutions, but are less critical of our own."
"Inevitably, however, our minds are on economic and monetary union, and I even welcome Mr Herman's comments on the democratic accountability of the ECB."
"I would prefer that the bank were under proper political control, but it seems that we are all now, or most of us, in thrall to the new religion of 'central bankism' and the best we can hope for is that when the bank screws the people of Europe it will have to come to the European Parliament to account for it."
"There is one major shortcoming in any possible control that this Parliament might exercise over the ECB and in the latter's accountability to it, and that is the statement by Mr Duisenberg in the hearings that the minutes should only be published after 16 years."
"This is wholly unacceptable."
"The governors of the ECB are appointed for a fixed period and cannot be got rid of no matter how abysmal they turn out to be."
"They have that at least in common with Members of the European Parliament."
"They cannot be got at and it is therefore quite unacceptable that they should continue to behave as if they were members of some religious cell answerable only to the God of the Market."
"I believe that the minutes of the ECB should be available to this Parliament in a matter of weeks - not after a period of 16 years, and unless we can find out how the deliberations go in a much shorter period I think that the whole notion of accountability is something of an illusion."
"Mr President, the European Parliament must fight for its democratic rights."
"That has been the case in years gone by and the future will certainly be no different."
"Interinstitutional agreements are an excellent way for the European Parliament to acquire, in important areas, those rights which are appropriate to a democratic European Union."
"Mr Herman's excellent report indicates a number of important areas in which progress can be made and where our efforts must be directed in the near future."
"I should like to direct our attention to some of the other major questions which will face us in the coming months and years, issues in which the European Parliament wants to - and indeed must - become more deeply involved, as is in keeping with current Treaty law."
"Major reforms are imminent in the areas of the common agricultural policy and the structural policy."
"We have had to negotiate a new financial perspective for the years ahead, and for all the areas in question it seems important for the European Parliament to be involved in the decision making process in a manner which is proper and appropriate to a democratic Union."
"We shall have to fight for these rights."
"In a quite significant area - namely in the pre-accession strategy and agreements - the British Presidency has already commendably stated its readiness to grant Parliament many of the rights and opportunities which we simply do not yet have under current Treaty law."
"I am expecting the Austrian presidency to do likewise and to give this Parliament the opportunity to participate in the decision making process when it comes to the major issues facing the Union."
"Mr President, the Danish referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty is now only two weeks away."
"One reason many Danes are contemplating voting 'No' is because they feel the system is closed, bureaucratic and undemocratic."
"In many ways, I believe the EU system far outshines its reputation."
"The European Parliament is much more open than the majority of national parliaments."
"The Commission is surely no more bureaucratic than other state bureaucracies."
"However, that does not mean we can rest on our laurels."
"Many problems are waiting to be tackled and we should always be on the lookout for any improvements that could make us more open and democratic."
"Interinstitutional agreements are often a good idea in our quest for more openness and democracy in the EU."
"However, there is at least one area mentioned in the rapporteur's excellent report in which I do not wish to see interinstitutional agreements increasing the influence of the European Parliament."
"This is social dialogue."
"Social dialogue is still in its infancy, and it is important for us to leave it to the parties to the labour market to achieve mutual agreement and establish a framework for collaboration."
"Preferably, we should not get involved."
"Now that the UK, too, has been included in the social protocol, there is even more reason to wait and see."
"Now there is some hope of really speeding up the negotiations."
"In terms of competition, no-one now stands to benefit by remaining outside."
"In short, I am voting in favour of the rapporteur's excellent report because of the many positive elements it contains and because we must never stop investigating how to make the EU more open and democratic."
"But I have no desire to interfere in social dialogue; let us keep our fingers out of the pie!"
"Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Herman for an excellent report."
"The immense new challenges of the European integration process, such as the eastwards enlargement of the Union and the single currency, will require a lot of time for the formulation of opinions. The imparting of information to our citizens takes unconditional priority."
"An examination of the institutions is essential in this regard."
"Openness and the democratic machine are difficult terms to define when we talk of a citizens' Europe."
"It is the people that make up Europe, not the institutes or the Member States."
"Nevertheless, there is still only the vaguest reference to ordinary citizens when legitimizing so-called major projects."
"Economic and monetary union has caused national powers of decision making to pass into the hands of the ECB, which is not controlled by any democratic body whatsoever."
"A rather sadly comic example is that the EMU issue was discussed by a Union institution behind closed doors and barbed wire, hidden away from other people."
"The media followed the EMU debate in the European Parliament unusually closely that weekend, because that was the only institution that was discussing the matter with the doors open."
"It is important to correct the democratic deficit with increasingly effective partnership between the European Parliament and national Parliaments, in order to safeguard common parliamentary interests."
"Increased openness cannot create a creditable base for a citizens' Europe unless the institutions meet the great new challenges ahead."
"The fateful and foolish decision of the Amsterdam Conference in favour of common democratic surveillance and reform of the institutions will inevitably have an effect on the timetable for enlargement."
"How could our citizens give their support to an enlarged Europe if, despite the fact that the Commission has issued papers in a variety of colours, everyone can see that Union institutions and national governments do not have the political will to embrace real change, and openness seems merely a catchword?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to congratulate Mr Herman on his excellent report, which is another parliamentary initiative designed to make the European system increasingly democratic and responsible, especially when the provisions of the Treaty leave areas of uncertainty with regard to the quantity or quality of democratic control."
"As the rapporteur has underlined this morning, the Treaty of Amsterdam represented major progress with respect to codecision, as regards both its scope and its procedures - in the appointment of the European Commission, in parliamentary control over the implementation of the budget, and in executive activities in general."
"I would remind you in this respect that the Commission is preparing the review of the commitology decision of 13 July 1987."
"I also want to mention the growing role of the national parliaments and COSAC, the conference of specialized parliamentary committees."
"Undoubtedly, the development of this process of participation by the national parliaments and close cooperation between representatives elected democratically at European and national level has benefited from the very positive climate of collaboration which has been established between the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"And in that sense, I also thought it very timely that Mr Herzog mentioned the role civil society should play, and the suggestion of regular meetings."
"The subject raised by the rapporteur is the strengthening of Parliament's powers or, as it says in the proposal, its increased participation in essential sectors of the Union's policies, using measures which do not modify the existing Treaties but guarantee democratic control, at least until the new intergovernmental conference."
"In my opinion, most of the proposed measures are very useful and offer prospects for agreements to be negotiated at institutional level."
"In that sense, we eagerly await the second part of the report, already announced by Mr Herman."
"For example, I think that in monetary or foreign policy issues, the European Parliament should be able fully to exercise the right of control, without questioning the provisions of the Treaty until the next intergovernmental conference."
"These sectors are too important to the future of the Union for there not to be efficient democratic control."
"Of course, it is not a question of either subjecting the provisions of the Treaty to force or creating obstacles which might delay decisions, since these must be taken quickly."
"But it is essential to remove the barriers which, in practice, prevent the European Parliament from fully expressing its point of view, which should of course be taken into account by the other institutions."
"So we need to find and create that margin for interpretation, as Mr Corbett said, and as I understand it, that is also the rapporteur's intention."
"On the other hand, I think we need to avoid the excessive fragmentation of interinstitutional agreements."
"The report proposes a series of sectors in which the agreements should accompany the Treaties, in a manner of speaking."
"The rapporteur has identified these sectors well. However, I wonder if it is really essential to have a specific agreement for each of them, or whether it is not better to define, jointly, some principle of general application, instead of negotiating specific rules sector by sector."
"But I am just asking a question. I do not have the answer."
"I think it is something we can take into consideration."
"Also, I do not think the interinstitutional agreements should distort certain Treaty provisions."
"For example, I am thinking of the problem of approving agreements made by the social partners."
"I do not think the approval procedure needs to be made more complicated. As everybody knows, it is of an almost legal nature, I would say."
"The institutions can decide whether or not to approve that type of agreement but, of course, what they cannot do is decide to modify them."
"I wonder if the European Parliament - which has to assess whether it wants such agreements or not - has not already got enough ability to express itself politically, both during and at the end of negotiations."
"Also, we must remember that basically social policy is not implemented through this sort of agreement, but through the other Treaty procedures."
"I would remind you that President Santer had to hold a conference for the social partners, to check their willingness to use social agreements for specific matters."
"I am not going to repeat the details of this excellent report."
"My aim with these comments is to show you that I have studied the Herman report in depth, because it merits careful study."
"I also want to say that it ranks among the initiatives taken by the Committee on Institutional Affairs with a view to getting the Treaty of Amsterdam applied in the most appropriate fashion and, above all, guaranteeing that the Union's decisions are democratic. That has always been Mr Herman's concern, not just in this report but for many years, and he always gives important clues about how to carry on making progress in the right direction."
"This process, which extends the guidelines expressed by this Parliament in January 1986, is being followed attentively by the European Commission, which places itself at Parliament's disposition."
"In its resolution to approve the Single European Act - Mr Herman will remember it - the European Parliament made a highly realistic commitment in welcoming the new Treaties and helping to improve the building of Europe, both through reforms and using an intelligent and forward-looking application of the existing rules."
"Mr President, I note that Parliament is continuing along those same lines today."
"We have seen how the speeches have demonstrated a clear majority in favour of these views, and therefore I want to repeat my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"But a lot has been said about 2 May and I do not want to finish without mentioning the dates 8 and 9 of May, which saw the recent European Movement congress 50 years after the Congress of Europe in The Hague in 1948."
"And I want to convey to you the fact that many of the speeches made there, especially the one by the President of this Parliament, stressed that this century must not end without a great initiative being launched to allow us to create an institutional framework in keeping with the great progress we have seen in Europe over the last few years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00 noon."
"Information and communication policy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0115/98) by Mr Pex, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the information and communication policy in the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our debate is running slightly late."
"I must draw your attention to this."
"We are keen to vote on Mr Pex's report at noon."
"I therefore request everybody to respect their speaking time strictly, and I will remind people of this where necessary."
"Mr Pex, you now have the floor for six minutes. Please begin by setting us a good example."
"Mr President, in its budget the European Union has allocated 27 eurocents per head of population to informing the citizen about what is happening in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"That is not very much, which means this small budget must be managed carefully and everything must be done to ensure that the communications and information activities are as effective as possible."
"This Parliament's Committee on Budgets, and latterly also the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, have made efforts over the past few years to improve the information policy."
"This has led to the own-initiative report which I am able to present to you today."
"The report carries my name, but the text is the fruit of the excellent cooperation between all the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Institutional Affairs, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"I thank all my colleagues for their cooperation, and especially for their input."
"Briefly, these are the things my report deals with. Firstly, actually improving the coordination of information activities."
"Secondly, improving the coordination of activities between the different European Union institutions, especially between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Other institutions could become involved in this."
"It is this point in particular which has created difficulties in the past."
"In my opinion, this policy has focused too much - and sometimes still does - on demonstrating the merits of the respective institutions, and not enough on the citizens' need for information."
"The third aspect is the decentralization of activities down to the level of Member States and the regions within the Member States."
"The message from Brussels does not always come across."
"The message needs to be translated for the local culture and views, if the message is to be understood."
"That means more must be done by the national offices of both the Commission and this Parliament, so it is important that these offices are reorganized."
"The fourth is the creation of so-called ""European Union Houses' , which are an amalgamation of the national offices of the Commission and this Parliament, so that the citizen can access information in a single location."
"It is of the utmost importance that these European Union Houses should be established where they can be easily recognized and accessed by the citizen."
"They should be able to enter them as easily as entering a shop."
"Separate counters should be provided for Parliament and the Commission if required, as each European institution must continue to be able to retain and fulfil its responsibilities, irrespective of the amount of cooperation."
"The fifth point is to improve the quality of information, partly by employing modern communication techniques, an improved audiovisual service, and the proper use of electronic information technology."
"The information policy is not a means to an end."
"What matters is that the citizen becomes interested in what Europe does for him and what it means to him."
"In the Netherlands we have a saying: ""The farmer does not like what he does not know' , and also: ""Unknown, unloved' ."
"All the surveys show that people are not terribly interested in European issues, and they do not know much about the institutions."
"This is made manifest by the most important poll of all, the European elections."
"In my country, the turnout for the 1994 election was a mere 35 %."
"What will it be like in 1999, if the policy does not change?"
"The issue is, first, to arouse interest amongst the citizens of Europe, and after that, to meet the information requirements adequately."
"The organization of common activities of both institutions requires special attention."
"A moment ago I mentioned the need for actual coordination, and this means we cannot leave it at fine words about good cooperation, as was the case until recently."
"It means that the organization, management and control should be set up in such a way that there is true coordination."
"In this, a distinction must be made between political management and implementation."
"According to the rules of this Parliament, the political responsibility for information policy rests with the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media."
"Carrying out the specific information activities of this Parliament falls within the remit of the Bureau of this Parliament."
"And the general information initiatives carried out in conjunction with the Commission are the responsibility of the interinstitutional Working Party on Ongoing Information Activities which is to be set up."
"This is a clear structure which is, in fact, already in existence and headed competently by Mr Anastassopoulos."
"However, it should be used more specifically, so that the policy can be laid down appropriately and implemented."
"The advantage of this approach is that we will be able to start implementing the new policy tomorrow."
"A practical aspect of the cooperation between the Commission and Parliament is that they can both use the communication infrastructure."
"I am thinking of audiovisual services and press facilities."
"Cooperation here means cost savings and higher effectiveness, and a better service for the press."
"We need good communication channels."
"I have sought to let the relationship with Euronews function on a new basis, and to intensify the relationship."
"This could also be the case with other broadcasting organizations, of course, especially with regional and local ones. 'Europe by satellite' could play a special role here."
"This, too, requires a customer oriented policy."
"I would like to conclude by thanking my committee and my colleagues for all the work which has been done."
"I hope that all those involved in the policy, and first and foremost the Members of this Parliament, will want to participate in this customer oriented policy, placing the citizens at the centre, with the institutions subservient in the background."
"Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights paid particular attention to the institutional question of a modern and efficient information policy."
"Essentially, the situation is simple."
"The European Union has a duty to inform people and this is implied in the Treaties, its powers and its objectives."
"The citizen is entitled to receive accurate information about what we do for him."
"It is true, no other international organization in the world has such a direct impact on the lives of ordinary citizens."
"A working party chaired by myself as far back as 1993 highlighted the information policy's lack of strategy guidelines."
"There is no general message common to all the institutions in which the citizens can recognize themselves."
"If the message is to get through, it must be expressed in clear and simple terms."
"Moreover, if it is to be understood, it must reflect reality, and that means that the message to the citizen must present an accurate and unambiguous image of the European Union."
"Who is to convey this message?"
"Undoubtedly, both the Commission and Parliament play a part."
"The Commission, as a supranational body and guardian of the Treaties, retains a leading role in communication."
"But the European Parliament, whose impact and role continue to increase, must be able to fulfil its obligation of communication towards the citizen."
"Not only as far as the overall policy of the Union is concerned, but also primarily concerning its own input into the European integration process and its impact on life in the European Union."
"Or, to put it briefly: we, as Parliament, must show the citizens that the political institutions are there for them, and not the other way round."
"Mr President, in a report which I submitted to the Bureau on 21 March 1995 on an information policy for the European Parliament, among other things I recommended the drawing up of a report by the competent Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and an annual debate in the House on this important issue."
"However, it has taken three whole years to arrive at today's debate."
"During this time, the information issue has not ceased to concern us greatly and the Bureau has pushed forward a number of actions which have sketched out a new policy."
"Our starting point was the realization that a great lack of communication separated the European Union from its citizens."
"I am not a blind devotee of opinion polls, but when in all the opinion polls, year after year, 60 to 70 % of citizens declare that they have no knowledge of what is happening in Europe, or that there is a lack of information on the subject, the problem can only be regarded as crucial for democracy in Europe."
"How can there be serious discussion about a citizens' Europe or citizens' participation under such conditions?"
"To begin to reduce somewhat this significant lack of communication, we attached primary importance to the development of cooperation with the European Commission, which has more general responsibility for information on European activities."
"The Commission responded and set up an organizational working party chaired by Mr Oreja and myself."
"This group has worked hard over the last few years and laid the foundations for more methodical coordination and a more systematic policy."
"Such terms as partnership, decentralization, dialogue with the citizens, and communication without propagandist undertones took on a new meaning."
"The PRINCE programme for the three major actions in this field served as a laboratory for the implementation of our new ideas and methods in an effort to turn the rapidly developing new technology to advantage."
"We also had the satisfaction of seeing our original cooperation with the Commission finally take on a trilateral dimension, as the governments of 11 Member States signed agreements with us and shared in the joint effort."
"Thanks to the spirit of cooperation shown consistently not only by Commissioner Oreja but also by his colleagues, for which we thank them, the framework of our actions has thus been traced out and put to the test. And from within this general framework has come the report we are debating today, after so much delay."
"The problem of our communication with the citizens naturally remains, and it is enormous."
"The little progress that has been made is not enough to significantly reduce this lack of communication."
"We need more money."
"The approximately ECU 100 million a year represents little more than the budget of an average European company which normally advertises a single product."
"We need even better cooperation with the Commission and even better coordination."
"We need even better cooperation with governments, and governments must cease to claim all successes as their own and to present the European Union as the scapegoat for all failures."
"We need to make even greater use of the new technologies and to have greater access to television, which is the chief or only source of information for 70 % of citizens."
"The main thing, I think, is that we must not be discouraged by the difficulties, and we must persevere."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of the European Union will very, very soon be faced with this electoral date which is going to be very important for Europe, that is the re-election of Parliament, without forgetting, of course, the reappointment of the Commission."
"Unfortunately, I am not sure that the communication policy applied today has achieved its aims, whether this policy is specialized or intended for the general public."
"Who is familiar with the functioning of the institutions?"
"Who is familiar with the content of the Treaties?"
"Who knows the risks of enlargement?"
"Who knows our decisions?"
"Only the farmers know about the worrying CAP plans. Their organizations have an excellent system of communication."
"As a result, information is achievable."
"Let us try, therefore, to make the general public aware of what the European Union has achieved and the advantages it presents. This would help them in their choice, and create support for a European construction which is in accordance with their wishes."
"In all parliaments, the risks of communication are political and are therefore a matter for the democracy and authority of their executive."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media is also, as its name indicates, the committee responsible for media. It therefore has a duty to consider and form an opinion on the subject of this policy."
"Our group was involved fully in this work and while we always supported the theory of the rapporteur, Mr Pex - which was to optimize the joint resources available at an institutional level - we defended the idea that Parliament did not necessarily have the same political ideas to communicate as the Commission."
"In effect, this diversity of opinion prepares the public for an understanding of what is at stake."
"A committee on European information was proposed by the rapporteur as a kind of executive of the communication policy."
"I, for my part, have never supported this idea and today it seems that its adoption would not have any binding legal value."
"Our political group recognizes the importance of the overall consideration which has been given to this important topic and congratulates the rapporteur, Mr Pex, on the work which has been accomplished."
"We agree with the main objectives which have been determined: objectives of decentralization, interinstitutional cooperation, intensifying contacts with citizens, value for money, research and transparency."
"All of this is extremely important to us."
"The fundamental message of the Treaty of Amsterdam was to force the European Union to communicate more intensively with its citizens."
"Let us try to apply the Treaty ourselves, and let us prepare the citizens for an understanding of what is being decided for them."
"I would not like to finish without congratulating the rapporteur once again."
"Mr President, since the outset this report has created a certain feeling of uneasiness, as also demonstrated by our President, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado's speech, an extremely rare event in a public sitting. He thinks the text goes against the Treaty and Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"This ambiguity remains after amendment."
"If it is a question of ensuring a more effective information policy, it will suffice to study the improvements which can be made in the functioning of the Directorates-General responsible, with full respect for Parliament's Rules of Procedure, and obviously in relation to Parliament's Bureau."
"Many of Mr Pex's suggestions are also interesting in this respect."
"The report goes further, however."
"In paragraph 16 it grants a degree of power to an ad hoc body, but in this case it must guarantee its objectivity."
"That is not the case."
"The composition of the working party, which is made up essentially of political representatives and not civil servants, shows the exclusive presence of the two large political groups in this Parliament."
"This situation is unacceptable for a body which goes beyond the study and research of better means of communication, the only task which the President of Parliament, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, had suggested, but which the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media did not accept."
"In the form in which it is presented in paragraph 16 of this report, and given its powers, this working party which the report proposes to institutionalize could be turned into an EU ministry of information, a ministry which, moreover, would not be democratically accountable."
"Ladies and gentlemen, to this we can only say no!"
"Pluralism is essential in the information society, but not in a form which consists of two speeds, one being direct control by the PSE and the PPE, and the other being a vague monthly report on the body's activities, intended for the other political groups."
"So if the majority of this Parliament does not vote in favour of our amendment on pluralism, I will, regrettably, vote against this report."
"Mr President, information policy is an important aspect of democratic culture, but it is also a power issue."
"The way in which an institution behaves in this critical area is an indicator of its democratic qualities."
"The background to this report, the inadequate objectives which have been set, and the composition of the working party all clearly demonstrate that a majority of the Members of this House regard information policy as purely a power issue."
"The result is a tendency to confuse information with propaganda, and the representation of Parliament becomes confused with the self-representation of the majority groups."
"Mr President, it is already a mouth-watering prospect that according to paragraph 6 of the report, information policy should ensure that ""European citizens are provided with quality information, targeted where possible, which reflects their concerns and gives them a positive image of the European Union.'"
"Is it the duty of the European Parliament's information policy to give people a positive picture, or the knowledge which allows them to form their own independent and critical judgement?"
"The attitude of mind which prevails on this issue in this House can be seen in recent events, when the majority groups actually used the protest demonstrations - which are quite normal, which have occurred hundreds of times in the history of this House, and which still go on - as a motive simply for conjuring up images of the downfall of democracy."
"To withhold pictures of these demonstrations from the television companies, to expel photographers from the gallery, shows an attitude of mind which does not shrink from censorship and which, instead of informing the people, only seeks to indoctrinate them."
"In my opinion, such actions are hardly a fitting testimony for the European Parliament."
"Mr President, in taking the initiative of studying the problem of information in the European institutions, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media has done something worthwhile."
"However, even though everyone sees the need for it, the actual completion of such a project is not an easy thing."
"We must thank Mr Pex for having buckled down to the task, and our colleagues from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media and the Committee on Institutional Affairs for having helped him to avoid certain pitfalls."
"Nevertheless, whatever false images people may have of Europe and its institutions, it is important to distinguish between information for the citizens and the actual communication policy."
"Information includes helping our fellow citizens to have a better perception of the European institutions and a greater knowledge of the decisions taken, while communication, in political terms, is the duty of the political groups and the Members of the European Parliament themselves."
"Our mandate obliges us to learn to pass on the message and to explain our choices."
"No institutionalized communication policy could replace this."
"Furthermore, simpler institutions which are easier for people to understand would ease their sometimes conflicting relationship with Europe."
"This is a question which cannot be evaded, but it goes beyond the scope of this debate."
"More specifically, with regard to the problem of setting up a permanent working group, my group has reservations."
"Nevertheless, such a body could not exist without all the political groups being represented."
"We are therefore voting for the amendments which go in this direction."
"This is the sine qua non of a true information policy."
"Mr President, you wish to vote at 12.00 noon."
"I would like to ask you to explain clearly why Mr Pex's report was still not ready for distribution last Friday, and why the amendments were not available until yesterday."
"Which powers wish to hamper a normal parliamentary discussion?"
"The citizen generally views the increasing European integration critically."
"The national administration may be remote from the experiences of the citizen but the distance between the citizen and the European institutions is even bigger."
"As Europe is gaining more and more powers, this distance must be reduced."
"That is why I am pleased with Mr Pex's lucid report."
"In the run-up to the 1999 European elections it is necessary, amongst other things, for the citizens to know that their choice in these elections is of real value."
"It must also be pointed out to them that the strengthening of European integration, in which citizens can all but follow the policy makers, is a battle which is not over yet."
"I have a few questions and comments about the report's substance."
"The report rightly points out how inadequate information about the Union's policy is."
"The report argues that this is caused by the lack of successful public support for European policy."
"To a certain extent this is true."
"If the citizen does not know which decisions about what are made at European level, it is unlikely he will quickly become very enthusiastic about it."
"However, we need to put this into perspective."
"The argument has been put forward several times that better information will convince the citizen of the benefits of the Union."
"Citizens will begin to realize the good things about European integration ""as a matter of course' , as a result of better information."
"This causes me to ask what kind of information goes out to the citizen?"
"Is it genuinely objective information supplied to the citizen as part of the improved information provision, or is it merely propaganda further to stimulate European integration?"
"Of course, it remains to be seen whether, as a result of openness in European decision making, the citizens will indeed be convinced of these benefits."
"This openness could also lead to them forming a clearer idea of the disadvantages."
"The core of the resolution consists of a proposal to the Commission to submit a legislative proposal with the aim of integrating the information services of the Commission and this Parliament."
"In itself this would seem beneficial, because this way the citizen will be given unambiguous information."
"How to explain what distinguishes the institutions from one another, however, seems to me to be a difficult task."
"This point therefore merits attention in the evaluation mentioned above."
"Mr President, the very first paragraph of the explanatory statement to Mr Pex's report already shows the mentality with which this document, and occasionally this Parliament, are imbued."
"I quote: ""European Citizens are in general not very enthusiastic about the development of European integration."
"One of the major reasons seems to be a lack of communication with Brussels and Strasbourg and a lack of information about targets and means by the European Institutions' ."
"So, if I understand the report correctly, people who are critical of the current state of affairs in official Europe are either stupid or badly informed."
"This demonstrates, with all respect, a certain Euro smugness."
"In my own country of Flanders, for example, there was for many years a rather general positive preconception, which I also shared, about European construction."
"If this positive view is now crumbling, it is not because people are badly informed but, on the contrary, because they are becoming better informed."
"And because they conclude, on the basis of extremely concrete facts, notwithstanding all the constantly biased European propaganda, that the subsidiarity principle for instance, which is so highly praised, is being violated systematically, deliberately and continuously."
"That Europe should lay down who should have the right to vote in my country, for example; that European institutions do not show the least respect for the language laws of Flanders; that Europe avoids referendums like the plague; that benefits of scale in the form of efficiency, so highly praised, are by no means always realized."
"Those who wish to gain more enthusiasm from the European citizens for the European project should not spend billions, but should start by respecting the European nations who do wish to cooperate closely, but who are not interested in European uniformity."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mr Pex for personally pushing this item onto the agenda of the House."
"It has been a critical area which has been neglected for a number of years, because the lack of visibility within the EU, in particular within the Member States, has been lamentable and there was, and still is, a need for better direction within DG X and our own information policy within Parliament."
"There is a massive amount of work to do, and it is not surprising on the basis of the way some of the offices of the Commission work within the Member States."
"I want to talk specifically about the disaster of the Cardiff Office of the Commission in Wales."
"For years, this building has been proudly standing there."
"For 15 years we have not heard a squeak from it."
"How could the Commission have allowed this situation to continue for so long?"
"How could the Commission accept such inactivity?"
"It has cost thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money to maintain such a building, a silent building, which has told the Welsh people nothing about the EU."
"It is not only that: the office has had the cheek to pass on information requests to the Commission to Members' offices."
"Last Thursday I found out what the office is doing for Europe Day: nothing, absolutely nothing!"
"What I want to know is this: how typical is this of other offices within the Member States?"
"At last the Commission is starting to pull its finger out and will soon be appointing someone."
"But it has taken almost a year to appoint someone for the Cardiff Office."
"By the time that replacement is there the opportunity to ride on the back of the British Presidency will have been lost and the Cardiff Summit will be over."
"Mr Pex's report will make sure that this situation never arises again."
"DG X is changing and it is improving, and there are some great examples of direct communication, especially using the Internet."
"I just want to put it into perspective: the EU spent 10 % of what Pepsi Cola spent on telling us about the difference between changing its coke cans from red to blue - so we must keep it in perspective."
"Mr President, the proposal on the future of the European Union's information and communication policy, on which Parliament is invited to vote, contains a number of important points which I would like to highlight."
"First of all, however, I must congratulate the rapporteur, Peter Pex, on his initial audacity, but also for the flexibility he has shown in this long and complicated process."
"It is that flexibility that has enabled him to complete this report, which deals with a highly important subject for all the Union's institutions."
"The text we are to vote on is the possible wording."
"But, if there is sufficient political will in the institutions - and that is a critical point - it could be an excellent instrument to strengthen our citizens' sense of being Europeans."
"The essential points I wish to bring out are these: it should be customary for Commission and Parliament to cooperate together, and for both of them to cooperate with the other institutions;"
"Parliament should have more control over the definition and implementation of policies; there should be more openness from the ordinary citizen's point of view; and, finally, information policy and the profit/cost ratio should be more efficient."
"I would, however, like to emphasize one aspect the report does not touch on, Mr President, and that is the irreplaceable role played by the regional and local media in keeping the people informed."
"Since the press is one of our targets, we should specifically make room for the means of information that are closest to the people, because it is they that keep institutions in touch with local life, and are able to translate the Union's political messages into specific terms."
"If we fail to do so, we shall be throwing away a valuable ally."
"The attention the report proposes to give to regional television stations should be expressed by using the initiatives that already exist in that field, particularly the regional CIRCOM, which consists of 376 regional stations in 39 European countries."
"The European elections in 1999 will be the next major test of how serious we are in our attempts to improve the idea Europeans have of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to congratulate Mr Pex on his excellent work and his delicate mediation in drawing up this own-initiative report."
"An efficient and organic information policy represents a fundamental instrument to ensure that the citizens understand the values on which the European Union is based, the objectives proposed and the efforts required to attain these objectives."
"In fact, it is only with clear, continuous and open information that the citizens can know and participate in the mechanisms and complexity of the European structure, and sometimes unexpected results and contributions can be achieved."
"It is therefore necessary to enable the citizen to have easy access to sources of information, to encourage him to know more, to examine matters closely, and become close to the institutions, and not to see them as inaccessible and incomprehensible."
"It is therefore important to identify, on the one hand, the best communication systems, and on the other hand, what should be transmitted."
"I believe that information transfer systems must always give priority to the principle of ease of access, and it is desirable to coordinate the structures in which Parliament and the Commission can physically share their technical resources and infrastructures."
"This point is in agreement with the rapporteur's idea of decentralizing the information centres, to make it easy to make contact even with people who live far from the capitals."
"As for content, it is most important to consider the objectives in the major areas, the direction in which the European Union is going, and the fundamental role the citizens play in this development."
"Secondly, the function of each of the institutions - Commission and Parliament - should be considered: their common and individual objectives, and their different responsibilities."
"Cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission is very important, above all to identify the effects of information on major topics, to coordinate the specific contribution of each of the two institutions."
"However, any strengthening of coordination must leave each institution sufficient autonomy, and safeguard the visibility of the roles and responsibilities of each."
"In fact, if it is feared that the citizen has difficulty distinguishing between Parliament and the Commission, the solution is not to unify the image but, on the contrary, to show the different roles clearly."
"On this point, it should be stressed that it is the job of Parliament - more than any other institution - in its capacity as an assembly of directly elected representatives, to show the decisions taken by the assembly and the various bodies it consists of, respecting and reflecting the diversity of opinions which are expressed within it."
"Lively, pluralistic information is the fundamental element of democratic debate."
"Parliament must vouch for it."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to state that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party intends to vote in favour of this report."
"The future of the European Union depends on the support of its citizens."
"No excellent information policy can cover for a chaotic structure or poor decisions, but much of the dissatisfaction felt by our citizens stems from the EU's distant stance."
"It is hard to discern any connection between Brussels and its bureaucratic decision making machine and normal, everyday life."
"The big challenge for the EU's information and communication policy is to bridge the abyss that separates the EU institutions and the people."
"It will require information to become communication that goes in both directions."
"The bridge over the abyss can be built only through partnership, involving both the institutions of the Community and the Member States."
"The new telecommunications technology will allow more and better interactive communication."
"At the same time, the EU information machine must regionalize. It must bring our citizens closer, with the aid of regional information outlets and local media."
"For example, libraries make an excellent place for this kind of activity."
"It is obviously also important that the language of EU information should be as clear and comprehensible as possible in all communications."
"Mr President, the European Parliament is not very successful in its information policy."
"There is little doubt about that in this House, but unfortunately opinions tend to differ somewhat on the reasons for this."
"However, I can assure you that it does nothing for the credibility of our information policy if the services of the European Parliament remove the cameras when things happen which are not agreeable to a large part of this Parliament, or take other measures to avoid the press finding out about them."
"To be honest, not only did this happen this week, it happens regularly here."
"It contributes nothing to the credibility of the information policy."
"Moreover, this Parliament also manages to ignore its own failures when criticizing the information policy, whilst blaming others rather easily. Yet it would add to this Parliament's credibility if it were to show its teeth once in a while in instances when it is able to do so."
"I only mention the inauguration of the Commission, or the customs union with Turkey."
"These are just a couple of examples."
"Consider this Parliament's buildings policy, or the fact that we have to meet in more than one assembly. I can assure you, that adds nothing to the credibility of this Parliament in the eyes of the outside world."
"An information policy is hardly sufficient to counter this kind of thing, even if you try to implement it in conjunction with the European Commission."
"There is really no point, unless this Parliament polishes up its own credibility. That would truly be the best way to convince the voters of the European idea."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to congratulate Mr Pex on this long overdue report."
"If Europe is to become a Europe of the people, then its tangible benefits, its aims and its perspectives must be more clearly understood by the people."
"That means democracy in its absolute sense, and the right to have things explained."
"We all know from our own national organizations just how much uncertainty and ignorance still prevails on the subject of Europe."
"There is a serious information deficit - incidentally this also applies to the national governments - and a clear disparity between the successes of the EU and its image."
"This has resulted in the unpleasant fact that interest in the EU has long centred around negative stories from Europe, and the sceptics have been gaining ground."
"As has already been said, people do not know about the European Parliament's rights of codecision after Amsterdam, for example."
"How many citizens of the EU are aware of the legislative rights of this House?"
"Do we even know how the great euro information campaigns permeated down to the ordinary citizens?"
"Was the success of these campaigns ever analysed or discussed with us?"
"How did we ever get into such a situation of no confidence in the democratic legitimacy of decisions taken at European level?"
"I believe we need a more efficient front-line mediation structure, and information on European Parliamentary decisions must be circulated quickly."
"We must also pay attention to the amount of information we supply and to the language used, particularly with regard to those target groups who are in urgent need of it."
"I would just like to say one more thing. I cannot imagine that efficiency will be further enhanced by setting up more wonderful - and wonderfully expensive - EU offices and other bodies in Brussels."
"This will only be achieved by a further decentralization of our information services."
"The ""Europe Info Points' , which proved a big success, would be eminently suitable for this task. These units must be extended, for they operate at the grass roots and offer the ordinary citizen a shortcut to EU information."
"Local authorities are willing to cooperate here."
"Let us make use of the opportunity provided by central, regional and local authorities, and let us at last launch a confident offensive for the European cause."
"Mr President, there is a lot of discussion about drawing our citizens closer to the EU and its institutions, but this is surely just as much a matter of the institutions, the European Parliament included, coming out to meet citizens and learning what priorities they place on the various interests. The institutions must make themselves more transparent, easier to comprehend and perhaps a bit less boring."
"They should endeavour to get people to take an interest in European affairs, encouraging them to want to get involved in things, thus motivating them to take a stance while also giving them a sense of value in doing so."
"As we discussed here earlier this morning, that is also important for democracy."
"And the positions and efforts of national parliaments at the European level could contribute to making citizens more aware of European issues."
"What we need is a personal dialogue."
"Dialogue does not just mean campaigns, because to me, the term 'campaign' sounds almost like psychological rape."
"Forthcoming policy in the area of information will have to mean taking citizens seriously and treating individual countries with sensitivity."
"(NI). (DE) Mr President, the rapporteur correctly points out that the EU's information and communication policy should be made more efficient."
"But what does he mean by this?"
"He comes to the conclusion that by increasing efficiency in this area we would be able to dispel the negative climate of opinion surrounding the EU, and consequently force the pace of European integration."
"I do not share this view."
"The widening gulf between the citizens of Europe and its institutions is not being caused by the inadequate information policy but by the unsatisfactory answers which have been given to Europe's most burning questions, such as that of the 18 million unemployed."
"While the rapporteur stresses the multilingual talents of the people of Europe, the Committee on Institutional Affairs is already discussing the future adoption of Esperanto as a common European language."
"While the rapporteur stresses the importance of the moving picture, Members of this House are proposing that the cameras be removed from the Chamber."
"While the rapporteur underlines the importance of intelligibility in the drawing up of legal documents, Members are declaring that they are unable to understand the language of the regulations which have been submitted on agricultural reform."
"As these examples show, the claims which have been made simply do not live up to reality."
"Pretty wrapping paper is not enough - the contents of the package must also be right."
"If the communication policy of the institutions is to be regarded..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media wishes to coordinate visiting and information policy for EU institutions."
"This may sound alluring, but that is not necessarily the case."
"A certain degree of coordination and exchange of ideas may be fine, but we should remember that the institutions are independent units."
"People should be able to differentiate between the Court of Justice and Parliament, the Commission and Council."
"When visitors come here, they obviously often say they are going 'down to the EU' , but there is no need for us to confirm that all the peas are from the same pod."
"In this matter, our only responsibility is to the European Parliament."
"The others will manage just fine."
"We should allow visitors access to the House so that they can see the openness with which we operate."
"For example, our committee meetings are open compared to those of the national parliaments."
"Visitors should have access to our work rooms so they can get the feel of a democratic, open institution."
"I have often asked the administrative management of the House to make proper rooms available for visitors."
"The Danish Social Democrats alone will probably have up to 3000 visitors this year, and that is only for four members."
"We must find space for them, and that might well be some meeting room where the parties can set up their stands and computers."
"Our information policy has two key elements."
"On the one hand, we must provide information about ourselves, and resources have been set aside for this, but beyond that, we must also be accessible to the representatives of the public, including the press."
"Over the last couple of days, I have been shocked to hear colleagues complaining about the zany dress of other Members and the fact that the media were curious to know what these Members meant by it."
"It seems utterly idiotic for us, in a democratically elected Parliament, to have any interest whatsoever in restricting press access to our official meetings."
"Mr President, this report represents a large collection of contributions by various groups on the question of information, and is also a clear indication of Parliamentary cooperation."
"When we remember that communication is a core issue in the information society, and takes place mainly via the mass media, we could hardly be dealing with anything more important."
"That is because the legitimacy of the whole Union rests very much on the image that people get from our work - the very people who directly elect us."
"We struggle with the professional media, we struggle with the advertising used by mega-corporations, and sometimes it is in downright desperation that we wonder how democracy might be marketed so that it might come to the attention of the people, people whose lives, nevertheless, still depend somewhat on democratic decisions made both at home and in Europe."
"I think we must continue to improve our information systems, because the appropriation we allow for the provision of information is very little compared to what, for example, is put into the worldwide marketing of a drink extract or a trademark."
"This means that democracy has, as it were, been bypassed by mainstream information systems, as global companies attract international notice and, in certain countries, are already entering our schools."
"As long as we bear this in mind, we shall be on the right track."
"Mr President, my own county, Essex, is the gateway to Europe, home of the major ports of Tilbury and Harwich with airports at Stansted and Southend, a major beneficiary of European defence conversion, industrial adaptation, fishing and social funds."
"And yet it is still too often known falsely for its notorious Euro-sceptics."
"That is why I would like to announce two pieces of good news in this morning's debate."
"First, this week's EU announcement of a new European Information Centre serving the business community in conjunction with Essex County Council."
"Essex has been a black hole in the Brussels network with many local small businesses giving up before they had started with European programmes, tenders or exports."
"This new European Information Centre will give them direct and free access to all European documentation."
"It will make the requirements of European legislation and the opportunities for European funding easily understandable to them."
"It will provide an opening to other businesses through the network of 232 centres throughout the European countries."
"Secondly, on 28 April we had a coming together of local government, education and business representatives over the whole of the East of England."
"They have agreed to improve coordination of European information."
"That is very good news, which I wanted to pass on to colleagues this morning."
"Mr President, I will say briefly that it was about time Mr Pex's report came before the House."
"The compromise which was reached was approved unanimously by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, in the presence of the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and the DGIII and DGX services of Parliament and of the Commission."
"I support it too."
"I would also call for vigilance on the part of our Parliament to ensure that this European body which we are setting up can, in addition to its tasks of coordinating common areas of information, also exercise control of this information and communication policy which we want so badly."
"We must not, by passing it off as an otherwise desirable decentralization, privatize this sector by entrusting it to external offices made up of experts from outside the Commission and Parliament, and thus without any form of control."
"That would also open the way for harmful misuse."
"Let us therefore pay close attention to ensure that the elected members of this body exercise their political mandate independently and resolutely."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will make this a very short speech, although I must admit that Mr Pex's important report deserves a long comment."
"I want to congratulate him on his initiative."
"I share his concern over the need for the European institutions to promote and develop an active and effective information policy."
"It is not an easy task."
"It is not easy, simply because of the technical complexity of the decisions taken at Community level. It is also not easy for a structural reason, because it is difficult to talk about the existence of public opinion in Europe, at a European level."
"There are national public opinions, but it is hard to convey the content of our institutions' decisions at Community level, to public opinion at a Community level."
"The basic message of Mr Pex's report is that there should be more coordination between the information activities of Parliament and the Commission."
"Thus he rightly stresses in his report that the Commission and Parliament have objectives in common, but that they are not identical, which means that communication policy should either be developed jointly or in a differentiated manner by each institution."
"So I fully share his view that we have to coordinate and collaborate better wherever such coordination and collaboration is possible, with full respect for the institutional autonomy which allows each one to develop its role efficiently."
"In regard to the report's two sections, I am not going to make any comment about the Commission's information policy because I agree, and these are partly policies which are already being implemented."
"So I will concentrate on the second part of the report, on the mechanisms to ensure cooperation between Parliament and the Commission."
"I must confess, I have certain reservations here as regards parts of paragraph 16 of the report."
"Firstly, the Commission is invited to present a legislative proposal by 30 September 1998, in order to create an interinstitutional working party."
"I think it will be hard for the Commission to adopt a legislative proposal on this question by that date."
"A whole series of questions needs to be examined first, of a legal, technical and institutional nature, before we would be ready to formulate such a proposal."
"Furthermore, I note that the rapporteur himself fails to request in his report that the proposal be presented by reason of Article 138 B, which is the channel provided for in the Treaty to request the Commission to propose Community acts."
"Thirdly, I think it could be a good idea to set up a working party like the one mentioned in the report, and I fully agree, but I do not think we need to create a new body in order to put this idea into practice."
"It is working well and yielding results, and it needs to work better and better."
"In my opinion, it is not necessary at the moment to create new institutional structures in order efficiently to develop a better coordination of information policy."
"As regards the ""European Union Houses' , I just want to say one thing. Parliament and the Commission can be based in the same building or in neighbouring buildings, and that is a good approach."
"I share that objective."
"That is exactly the policy I have been following ever since I have been responsible for this area."
"What we must do is avoid duplications, and I am sure that, together, we will manage to establish and share archives, libraries and conference rooms."
"As for the other matters mentioned in paragraph 16, I agree with the whole set of initiatives - Euronews, ' Europe by Satellite' , and the European Union on radio and CD-ROM."
"On all these points, I fully share the rapporteur's views."
"I will conclude by saying that those are the reflections sparked off by Mr Pex's important report, which has the great merit of raising important, urgent questions affecting the European institutions' policy of information and communication with the people."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00 noon."
"Welcome"
"It is my great pleasure to welcome Mr Dan Tichon, chairman of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset , who is doing us the honour of visiting the European Parliament and who is seated in the official gallery."
"Votes"
"Madam President, Members will recall my question to the President yesterday in this Parliament: he advised us that it would be the Bureau, and only the Bureau, which would review and make decisions relating to the 50 % voting attendance in Chamber during roll call votes."
"This is what the President told us."
"As Members of this Parliament, we believe this is undemocratic."
"We believe that the Bureau is taking decisions which could have a knock-on effect in the future because a precedent is being created."
"We have therefore decided to protest in this manner."
"This is the only avenue of protest that we have regarding the way the Bureau is handling this particular crisis."
"Therefore, my presence in the Chamber is noted for this roll call vote."
"I may wish to vote on some occasions but on this occasion I merely wish my presence to be noted."
"I appeal to other Members to do likewise."
"Madam President, my presence in the Chamber should be noted."
"Ladies and gentlemen, presiding a sitting would not be the same without a comment from Mr Falconer."
"It has become a pleasant habit. We take it in good part."
"Mr Falconer, we note that you are not taking part in the vote but that you are indeed present."
"(Mr Falconer requested the floor) Mr Falconer, I cannot allow you to speak again; that would be once too often."
"After the vote on Amendment No 18"
"Yes, Mr Falconer, you are still there. I can see you."
"Are you going to insist, Mr Falconer?"
"If it really is for a point of order, it will be the last."
"Madam President, that is not what the instructions from the Bureau say."
"The instructions from the Bureau say that you will make it known at the vote."
"I wish to be known at the vote and so therefore I wish to be recorded before the vote takes place."
"That is what the instructions say, so please obey your own instructions."
"Mr Falconer, to save time I promise to check that you are present, but you will understand that I am not willing to participate in your game."
"We have a lot of amendments."
"I can see you are there. Whether you vote or not, I know you are present and I have recorded it."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr Falconer, I will allow you to speak on condition that it is for a final point of order."
"Madam President, if the opposite side and other Members in this House wish to bleat like sheep and act like sheep when someone tells them what to do, and then they follow blindly, how can their electorate expect them to represent them?"
"How can the electorate have any faith in this Parliament when their own representatives are being dictated to?"
"Madam President, you said: ' I am not willing to participate in your game' ."
"Mr Falconer did not start this game!"
"The game was started by the Bureau."
"It was the Bureau that held these instructions down, not Mr Falconer."
"I therefore ask you to withdraw those words!"
"I ask Members of this House to stop behaving like sheep!"
"Madam President, this concerns an oral amendment which has two parts."
"I have the French text in front of me."
"Recital G begins: ' Inquiet du non respect par Israël des engagements... '"
"The first part of the oral amendment consists in replacing this phrase with the phrase: ' Convaincu qu'Israël doit respecter ses engagements... '"
"The second part of the amendment consists in adding at the end, after the phrase 'novembre 1995 ' , the phrase: ' et des accords d'Oslo ' ."
"Thank you, Mr Dimitrakopoulos."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
"Madam President, on behalf of my group I would just like to express my approval and full support for this oral amendment."
"(The President noted that there was no opposition to the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, we all know that yesterday it was decided to start a dialogue between the population of Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"In paragraph 3 we call on them to begin this dialogue."
"I would therefore recommend the following changes in paragraph 3."
"This paragraph will start with the words: ' welcomes the opening of a dialogue between...' ."
"This is all that is in paragraph 3."
"(The President noted that there were more than twelve objections)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is something I do not understand."
"There is a request for an oral amendment."
"You did not protest initially. At the end you can always vote against."
"Your attitude is completely stupid."
"First you listen and then you say: ' No, I did not want to listen' ."
"It is completely contradictory."
"We were within the framework of the procedure. You cannot begin at the beginning again."
"One day someone should explain the rules clearly to you."
"When the resolution was drafted we did not know what was then happening in Belgrade."
"We did not have the facts as now presented by the speaker."
"We should have been given the chance at least to put arguments in favour of the proposal before it was rejected."
"I regret we did not have that chance."
"One thing which is certain is that we are not going to start a debate on the matter."
"We are all aware that the rule was fully respected in this case."
"We were faced with an oral amendment of which, by force of circumstance, our colleagues were unfortunately not aware in advance."
"That is what happens in such cases."
"I shall now give the floor to Mrs Pack, since she will tell us the reasons for this opposition to the oral amendment."
"I should just like to point out that no new information whatsoever has been forthcoming since yesterday."
"We already knew by midday yesterday that Mr Rugova and Mr Milosevic intend to meet tomorrow."
"More than this we do not know."
"We therefore have nothing new to add."
"We hope this discussion can commence without any preconditions, as stated in the resolution."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, on the subject of this Amendment No 4 on the reduction of working hours, taking account of the debate underway in a number of countries in the European Union and taking account of the votes in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, I wanted to say that, as rapporteur, I cannot ask for this to be supported."
"However, as author of the report, I support this amendment."
"Good, I think the House is now clear on this."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, I will be very brief."
"The third indent refers to a working document which, in the meantime, has been replaced by Mrs Randzio-Plath's resolution, and therefore it must be updated."
"I would ask for Parliament's indulgence to amend as necessary to 'having regard to its resolution of 2 April 1998, doc."
"A4-0110/98' ."
"I will ask for the floor in a moment, on the subject of paragraph 9, for the purposes of a very minor amendment."
"(During the vote on the amendments, Mr Falconer requested the floor several times)"
"No, Mr Falconer, we agreed that that was your last point of order."
"I am sticking to that and I think I have been very patient."
"(Mr Falconer insisted - protests from the House) Mr Falconer, this is really very unpleasant."
"I will speak frankly: I am asking you to stop!"
"All the Presidents who have occupied this rostrum have shown a great deal of patience."
"But that is the end of it."
"I would like us to continue with the vote."
"On paragraph 9"
"Madam President, I would ask you to change the wording slightly, not for purposes of economy but to avoid any possible differences in interpretation between Mrs Randzio-Plath's report and mine."
"I propose to replace the words 'or given the chance' with 'to enable it' ."
"(The President noted that there was no opposition to the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"I congratulate Mr Herman and I apologize to Mr Pex but it is too late to vote on his report now."
"The vote will take place this evening, following the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"I wish you bon appétit and I now give the floor to Mr Falconer!"
"(Mixed reactions)"
"Madam President, I hope and trust that you will respect my rights."
"Obviously Mr Blak does not want to respect them but that is for his electorate to judge."
"My point was this: how many persons have approached your services to advise them that they will be in the Chamber but not voting?"
"That is my first point."
"My second point was to ask: can your services identify if they were still in the Chamber?"
"I believe that is a genuine point of order."
"It is part of the procedure which we have adopted."
"I know that one person approached me and told me that he had registered that he was going to be in the House."
"I did not see that person in the House during the vote and I am just enquiring as to how many more persons actually did that to register their protest."
"Mr Falconer, I will reply immediately."
"The presence of the Members is checked throughout the votes. I can assure you of that."
"Thank you, Mrs Green."
"I appreciate what you say."
"Madam President, I should also like to thank you for your patience."
"I also thank Mr Falconer for standing up for the rights of Members."
"Like our rapporteur, I am delighted about the Council common position organizing the introduction of operator number portability in the telecoms sector and of carrier pre-selection."
"These are two very important measures to guarantee that competition in this sector functions properly and thus to promote the interests of the consumer."
"The deadline of 1 January 2000 for most Member States also seems adequate."
"Also like our rapporteur, however, I regret that the Commission has submitted no proposals for introducing number portability in the mobile telecoms sector."
"I agree with him that it is essential to make the use of the 112 emergency number operational in all countries of the European Union."
"I believe that the citizens' Europe can more easily be made reality by means of practical measures like this than by a proliferation of incantatory declarations."
"K. Collins report (A4-0181/98)"
"Given the complicated title of the proposal for a Council regulation which is submitted to us, it would be useful to remind you that the text on which we are going to give our opinion aims to indicate with precision which genetically modified soya or maize based products must be labelled as such and, where necessary, precisely how they should be labelled."
"In my opinion it is essential that we take a firm stance in favour of clear wording in the case of these products, especially as this regulation will probably be used as a reference for precise measures for the labelling of new foodstuffs and ingredients, for which we have waited a long time."
"We cannot drop our guard now, knowing the effort we have had to make to gain acceptance of the principle of a specific supplementary labelling, one as complete as possible, within the context of the adoption of the novel food regulation."
"Consequently, I fully support the amendments which aim to reinforce that part of the wording which is fully justified and which is submitted to the consumer, as well as to clarify its content."
"I support in particular the development of a better scientific evaluation of the presence of GMOs. This means doing away with the possibility of a 'may contain' label and replacing it with the clear label 'contains a GMO product' , and the possibility, where necessary, of an abbreviated label 'genetically modified' , which has the advantage of not being excessively long or complex while still remaining sufficiently clear."
"I am voting in favour of this report that will force the labelling of certain foodstuffs that contain genetically modified organisms - GMOs."
"I would have liked it to go a little further."
"Yet let me make it clear, as a scientist my judgement is that GMOs are safe for public consumption."
"However, as has been so sadly proved on many occasions, science and scientists are not infallible."
"I want Community law to allow those consumers who make a different judgement to mine to be able to exercise that choice in Europe's shops and supermarkets."
"That is why labelling is necessary, in that without forbidding GMOs it maintains the individual's right of choice."
"The Danish Social Democrats do not endorse the report because it compromises the labelling of GMOs."
"Removing the possibility of labelling foods with the wording 'may contain' is an affront to the consumer's desire for information."
"It was a European Parliament proposal that originally advocated that doubtful cases should be labelled."
"This assures genuine choice for those consumers who categorically do not want foods which contain GMOs."
"Tindemans report (A4-0171/98)"
"Madam President, I am presenting this explanation of vote on behalf of my Group, namely the Green Group in the European Parliament."
"It relates to a report which has produced a fundamental change in the policy of this House."
"The Green Group, like a few other groups in this Parliament, belongs to that section of the House which does not consider it necessary to be armed to the teeth in order to achieve a democratic, ecological and socially just European Union."
"In this respect, we condemn the fact that in spite of massive protests by a minority in this House during the ratification process for the Amsterdam Treaty, and despite the fact that some Member States of this European Union are neutral, such a report was put on the agenda."
"The result is that this initiative by the European Parliament anticipates matters which go much further than the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore will severely disrupt the ratification process in the neutral states. Most importantly of all, it will certainly not be in the interests of freedom of choice for the citizens of Europe."
"We were given no mandate from the people to do this."
"In the midst of all this confusion a serious change has taken place."
"At the conclusion it was not made clear that the name of our committee, the ""Subcommittee on Security and Disarmament' , has been changed to the ""Subcommittee on Security and Defence' ."
"This too goes far beyond the Amsterdam Treaty."
"On behalf of the Green Group, I wish to register a strong protest against the attempts which are being made to change the procedures in the European Union by way of initiatives, and to do this against the will of the European people."
"Foreign and security policy consists of different components: foreign policy, aid, trade, conflict resolution and peace, disarmament policy, refugee policy and military defence."
"Security policy is therefore not the same thing as military defence."
"From a modern security perspective, the security of the people is the central consideration."
"The threat to the people may be anything from environmental disasters to social exclusion."
"Conflicts between states are becoming increasingly unusual."
"Instead, intra-state conflicts are becoming ever more common."
"Most of these conflicts have their origins in social antagonisms of an ethnic and/or religious nature."
"Such conflicts cannot be resolved by military methods."
"Many of the EU Member States do not accept a common defence policy."
"In Sweden, 70 % of the population is opposed to this."
"The realization of a common defence policy has been removed from the agenda for a long time, to come as a result of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Parliament does not have the right to decide on a common defence policy."
"Unanimity is required within the Council of Ministers in order to adopt such a policy."
"We cannot support the report."
"I voted against this report because although I want the EU to move towards a common foreign and defence policy as part of a federal Europe, I cannot support the basis of that policy as that of nuclear deterrence."
"The British and French nuclear weapons should be dismantled in accordance with Article 6 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and in line with the judgement of the International Court of Justice in 1966."
"Then we can develop a common defence policy."
"I support the development of an EU defence policy."
"I consider that it is an indispensable part of European integration."
"Therefore I totally support the proposals contained in Mr Tindemans' report."
"However, I would like to take issue with Ms McKenna's remarks during her contribution to the debate."
"She has claimed, wrongly, once again that the Amsterdam Treaty establishes a European defence policy, thereby undermining Irish neutrality."
"It does no such thing."
"The Amsterdam Treaty specifically respects the current defence and security polices of each Member State."
"This is a specific Treaty commitment to respect Irish neutrality."
"An EU defence policy can only be established if it is agreed unanimously at a future Council meeting."
"Furthermore, it would require amendments to the EU Treaties and would therefore be subject to a referendum in Ireland."
"She should desist from making those fraudulent claims which she and her colleagues have made during every referendum in Ireland."
"The fact that they have consistently proved to be without foundation unfortunately does not prevent their repetition."
"I also take exception to her personal remarks about Mr Tindemans."
"They are intemperate, offensive and ill-advised."
"Mr Tindemans is the spiritual father of European Union and no-one in this House has done more than he has to bring about permanent peace and reconciliation in Europe."
"Ms McKenna and her colleagues would do well to follow his example rather than criticize him."
"The Tindemans report as approved stands for a thinking that at least partly reflects Cold War attitudes."
"It is wishful thinking, considering the Amsterdam Treaty and the four militarily non-aligned countries, to talk about integrating the WEU into the Union."
"Finland is at present the only Union Member State having a common border with Russia."
"We do not see Russia as an enemy and we hope that the ties between the Union and Russia will be strengthened, creating an even larger area of peace, stability and prosperity."
"We do not see military means as a primary answer to the problems facing us in the immediate neighbourhood of the Union."
"This was the reasoning behind the Finnish-Swedish initiative to include Petersberg tasks within the scope of the Union."
"The Tindemans report is not based on clear-headed thinking about European defence and security needs."
"We therefore had to vote against the report."
"The Danish Social Democrats have chosen to vote against the resolution."
"The Tindemans report regards the EU from the outset as a military power and, in its recommendations, goes further still in its efforts to make the EU the standard-bearing regional superpower."
"The report concludes that Union initiatives with regard to problems arising in areas such as the Middle East and the Balkans have been too little and too late, and that the European Parliament's natural role as a responsible player on the world scene has not been very evident to the Commission or the Council of Ministers."
"As social democrats, we cannot take issue with that."
"However, the report's proposed solution to this problem involves suggesting a rapid assimilation of the WEU into the EU."
"An EU as a potential military superpower is a step in the wrong direction for a united, peaceful Europe."
"The report also sets out a number of points to accelerate the integration of the WEU into the EU, strengthening the common defence profile that Mr Tindemans so earnestly desires."
"However, the rapporteur offers no solution to the difficulties the EU would face in explaining itself to its neighbours, who would object to an EU bent on arming itself."
"Similarly, taken to its logical conclusion, a common defence policy would mean French and British nuclear weapons having to come under Community jurisdiction."
"So, like others in the social democrat group, we have chosen to vote against the resolution."
"Europe already has a joint security identity in the form of NATO and the OSCE."
"It does not need another one."
"We have voted against the Tindemans report because it represents a considerable step on the path to militarization of the EU, which unfortunately confirms the fears that many of us have been voicing for some time about trends in EU cooperation."
"Through the Tindemans report, the European Parliament is lining up behind the view that the EU must be developed into a military superpower with objectives broadly in line with those of most of history's superpowers: the unilateral defence of its own interests, including security of supply, by force of arms."
"The report also represents the view that the EU should be entitled to act as a kind of ""global police force' and intervene militarily in other countries' affairs as it sees fit."
"We advocate an international legal system, which may also include peace initiatives of a military nature of the type undertaken for some time by the UN and the OSCE. We can also envisage various forms of reinforcement, within the framework of the UN Charter, of the UN's and OSCE's roles in this connection."
"We are opposed, however, to individual superpowers or regional blocs independently pursuing military interventions outside the UN framework, for which the Tindemans report unfortunately paves the way."
"It is also evident that the vision of security policy underlying the Tindemans report does not in the long term leave any room within the EU framework for non-alignment by the Swedish model."
"This unfortunately also bears out fears that we have voiced in the past."
"In conclusion, we would like to point out the significant fact that the Swedish version of the title of the Tindemans report translates 'defence policy' as 'security policy' , which is such a serious misrepresentation that it gives a wholly misleading picture of what the Tindemans report is actually all about."
"Joint resolution on Euro-Mediterranean cooperation"
"Do I need to say it again?"
"For us, the Mediterranean Sea is an inland sea."
"Our relations - and the quality of those relations - with all the countries bordering on it are vital, both for them and for us."
"That requires partnerships and voluntary actions, with full respect for our differences, our constraints and our histories..."
"This process has been improving for a few years. However, there have been too many delays, too much mixing of genres, and sometimes too much of a superior attitude on our part, not to mention hints of neocolonialism."
"On the subject of Algeria, Morocco or the Middle East, no-one has ""the perfect answer' ."
"Certainly, we all agree that we must eradicate terrorism, perfect democratization and relaunch the peace process."
"We may have ideas or suggestions and defend them keenly, but we must be able to listen to those who are in contact with these grave and dramatic problems."
"Laxness, denial and pretended superiority should not form the European guidelines."
"Nor should we forget to demand that the Member States of the European Union ratify their agreements quickly, so we can make the necessary funds available, help the countries of the south, open our markets and also demand that our political weight be recognized in our common quest for solutions."
"I believe in our success if, and only if, we manage to use political means."
"Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, launched by the Conference of Barcelona in November 1995, is a sustainable element of stability and economic development of the entire region."
"In fact, for the European Union it is a matter of promoting growth to reduce unemployment in the region and decrease migration pressure, contributing in general to the stability and security of the Mediterranean countries."
"This strategy will consequently have positive repercussions on European security."
"Europe is discovering a basic concept: an ECU invested in Asia will create jobs, wealth and security in Asia, while an ECU invested in the Mediterranean will create security for the whole of Europe."
"That is why the European Commission must relaunch decentralized cooperation, which has been paralyzed for too long, as quickly as possible."
"When does the European Commission intend to reactivate the application of the MED programmes?"
"These programmes do not function through national governments, but with a multilateral cooperation decentralized to regional and local level."
"In other words, they are very important as they make it possible to form direct links between persons, groups and organizations which share the same interests and which have the same aims, both within the EU and the Mediterranean partners, and between those partners."
"In this way economic development can be encouraged, through the formation of a ruling and entrepreneurial class which represents the various strata of society and not only the positions of the élite."
"And this will be good not only for the Mediterranean region but for Europe as a whole."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the motion for a joint resolution on Euro-Mediterranean agreements."
"We have done so based on considerations of the importance of supporting EU projects in this area."
"We should be involved in helping to secure peaceful development in terms of trade, democracy and human rights in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean."
"One deficiency in the motion for the joint resolution is that it does not put strong enough emphasis on human rights."
"The Danish Social Democrats wish to urge the Commission at the earliest opportunity to propose a strategy to promote adherence to human rights in the Mediterranean area."
"Furthermore, the Danish Social Democrats consider it a matter of importance for pressure to be brought to bear on the Commission to increase grants to promote adherence to human rights in this area."
"Setting aside ECU 9 million for such initiatives is not enough."
"Sufficient funds should be set aside to allow activities to be expanded and programmes to be made more comprehensive."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while I have every respect for the Commission's efforts in launching the MEDA programme and the MED-MEDA programmes, I do have a specific criticism to make on behalf of my group."
"The MED programmes have been terminated by Commissioner Marín, though no individual criticism was directed at them, solely as a reaction to the deplorable state of affairs generally."
"In this way, good projects have paid the penalty for the failures of the Commission."
"This course of action is extremely unpolitical and is indicative of the Commissioner's helplessness."
"His intervention in yesterday's debate was also, regrettably, quite out of place."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to put a stop to such behaviour when similar circumstances arise in the future."
"Terminating good programmes unfortunately does not make up for poor programme execution, in fact quite the reverse, for even greater damage is inflicted."
"I only hope the Commission now puts the MED programmes into effect with even great urgency."
"Madam President, I should like to stress that I was happy to vote for the Kosovo resolution, even though I was extremely annoyed about the manner in which yesterday's debate was handled."
"I do not believe there is any sense in having such a discussion when the representatives of the Council and Commission are not present - and some of them even failed to attend the evening session."
"I also think it was an awkward situation, because the Council and the Commission are obviously not acquainted with the latest developments in this area, for these were not entered into."
"The manner of the postponement, with the undoubtedly important and interesting debate on India being brought forward, is at the very least questionable."
"I am nevertheless convinced that we have to debate this matter in much greater depth, and that in doing so we should not lose sight of the real culprit - for he sits in Belgrade and not in Prishtina."
"In 1989 Milosevic acted unconstitutionally in annulling Kosovo's autonomy and he is without doubt also guilty of those crimes against humanity which were recently perpetrated in that country. There is therefore no doubt in my mind that he should not be sitting at the negotiating table but rather standing before the Court in The Hague."
"We have abstained from voting on the resolution on Kosovo."
"Our inability to vote for the resolution is due to point 6, in which a request is addressed to the UN Security Council, the OSCE, NATO and the WEU to take all necessary measures to prevent the conflict spreading."
"We believe that this request should only be sent to the UN Security Council and the OSCE, which make decisions on measures based on a political analysis."
"The solution to the conflict in Kosovo is not a military question, but a political and diplomatic one."
"In other respects, however, we view the resolution as a correct analysis of the current political situation."
"In our resolutions we continuously reiterate the need to support the forces of democracy in Kosovo."
"It is then all the more regrettable that to the best of my knowledge not a single project has been funded this year through the PHARE democracy programme."
"On behalf of my group I would therefore like to ask the Commission exactly what it intends doing in the very near future to organize help from the democratic programme for the civilian population of Kosovo."
"If the Commission is looking for proposals, then my group is ready to submit ideas right now."
"Caudron report (A4-0138/98)"
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Caudron's report on the competitiveness of European industry."
"In our opinion, the report contains several good points regarding how to ensure that European industry can become more competitive."
"However, we cannot endorse the rapporteur's view that all countries should impose an equal burden on their companies as regards environmental requirements."
"In accordance with Article 100 A(4) of the Treaty, each Member State should have the option of creating whatever environmental legislation it may deem necessary with regard to sustainability, health and welfare, and in the future, environmental policy will increasingly be based on Article 130, implying that Member States may build on EU minimum requirements."
"We are also against the rapporteur's approach to the harmonization of fiscal policy, in paragraph 15."
"We strongly distance ourselves from any type of harmonization of income tax."
"E. Mann report (A4-0173/98)"
"Madam President, given the rapid increase in European-wide teleshopping, I support the rapporteur's proposal that it should be regulated at an international level through the World Trade Organization."
"It is also vitally important that action is taken to ensure that the teleshopping trade is subject to the highest consumer standards."
"Consumers must be protected against purchasing defective or dangerous products."
"I have noted the rapporteur's suggestion that the Commission should investigate whether or not it is feasible to tax Internet sales."
"However, I would point out that any such decision should not simply be to dissuade EU consumers from buying cheaper items by taxing them."
"Our energies should be more directed to ensuring lower and more transparent prices within the EU itself so that non-EU products are no longer an attractive alternative."
"Hopefully, the introduction of the single currency will significantly contribute to achieving this."
"However, harmonization of the various VAT and other rates also has an important role to play."
"Herman report (A4-0117/98)"
"Madam President, Mr Herman's report on the reform of the functioning of the institutions without modification of the Treaty shows a surprising approach which I regret that no-one here in this Parliament is reacting to."
"On the main subject of the report, that of control of economic and monetary union, we are blandly told that the weakness of democratic control is unacceptable, which we have known since the beginning, but that the negotiators of the Maastricht Treaty did not want to weigh it down, and those at Amsterdam did not want to do anything either for fear of reopening Pandora's box."
"In other words, to avoid giving rise to a new debate, it was better to tolerate an indefensible situation."
"The result is that today, on the eve of the entry into force of the single currency, everyone is worried about the weakness of democratic control and the European Parliament is reduced to having to come up with emergency secondary measures to give the impression that the citizens will have a say in the matter."
"The Herman report notably proposes initiating reforms by means of so-called interinstitutional agreements between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament."
"These agreements do not by any means have the value of a treaty, but allow those in favour of integration to agree among themselves on progressively extending the powers of the European Parliament, in order to create a situation which will later be presented as an established fact."
"We obviously do not agree with this type of procedure."
"The Herman report succeeds only in making the constant manipulation of recent years plain for all to see. The aim of this manipulation is to have only scraps of discussions approved, to constantly postpone full debate and to prevent the citizens from giving their considered opinion on the process of monetary unification."
"If any additional measures are required for this monetary unification, let them be discussed and put clearly to universal suffrage."
"g. (SV) We cannot vote in favour of this report because its thrust is that the European Parliament should be the channel through which democratic control is gained over the European Central Bank and other political issues."
"This essentially means a weakening of the national parliaments."
"In many Member States, the national parliaments have double the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament."
"The level of participation in the various elections around the EU Member States speaks volumes."
"In order for the European Parliament to acquire the democratic responsibility to function better in the EU, it would be better if its Members were chosen by the national parliaments."
"It is around the time of the elections to the national parliaments that democratic political debate occurs in Europe today."
"Since its first election by universal suffrage in 1979, the European Parliament is truly the product and the representative of the citizens of the Union."
"Anxious to absorb the democratic deficit of the European institutions, we constantly aim to bestow on our House all the attributes which belong to a true parliament in a state of democratic law."
"From Intergovernmental Conferences to revision of the Treaties, European construction is advancing gradually down this road."
"We should note that, while the Maastricht and Amsterdam texts are going in the right direction, they remain nonetheless insufficient in this area."
"The citizens of the European Union are losing patience."
"Despairing of better transparency and greater democratic control in the functioning of the European institutions - which are too often regarded as a technocratic machine insensitive to their true aspirations - some citizens will from now on be tempted to withdraw into themselves."
"Following the Brussels Extraordinary Summit and the adoption of the single currency, the report we are examining today comes at just the right moment and proposes a number of measures which, even if they can only be provisional, nonetheless represent a necessary palliative to a persistent democratic deficit."
"While awaiting another new and necessary Intergovernmental Conference in the future, we need to conclude agreements of interinstitutional cooperation in those areas of competence in which the loss of control by national parliaments has not been replaced by that of the European Parliament."
"In fact it must be obvious to everybody that the citizens of the European Union will not accept that issues as crucial as economic and monetary union, the Stability and Growth Pact and foreign economic policy should escape the control of their elected European representatives. We all know the impact these issues have or will have on employment and social questions."
"In implementing the different proposals for interinstitutional agreements contained in the present resolution, the European institutions will contribute significantly to reducing the lack of comprehension which separates a number of our fellow citizens from a European construction which many of them claim to want."
"The Danish Social Democrats are abstaining from the vote on Mr Herman's report, despite the importance of ongoing considerations of how to make EU operations more open and democratic without amending the Treaty."
"Moreover, it is correct to highlight interinstitutional agreements as an important means of achieving this goal."
"The report contains several excellent proposals."
"We endorse the ideas of more openness and democratic control of the European Central Bank and general economic policy within the euro zone."
"Despite Denmark's legally binding derogation concerning participation in the third stage of EMU, it is of great importance to us that decisions made in these areas should be as open and democratic as possible."
"However, paragraph 6 of the report contains wording that could be interpreted to the effect that compromises made in Amsterdam and Luxembourg in the area of employment are devoid of tangible content."
"That is not our perception."
"These compromises are an important contribution to the strengthening of employment policy in Europe, and the results are already beginning to manifest themselves little by little."
"Furthermore, we would like to emphasize that we cannot endorse the idea of the European Parliament becoming involved in social dialogue."
"Social dialogue must be supported and expanded, and in our opinion, that is best done by giving the social partners the freedom to negotiate to their mutual satisfaction."
"g. (SV) What is needed in order to strengthen democracy, improve openness, increase public participation and thereby reduce criticism of the EU is reform from the bottom up."
"That will not come about via this report."
"The powers of the national parliaments must increase with regard to proposals, current business and control."
"The powers of the Council must also increase."
"The Commission's powers, on the other hand, must be substantially reduced."
"Its exclusive right to submit proposals is completely unacceptable."
"It is as if only the mayor were to have the right to submit proposals in the municipalities - an absurd thought!"
"The powers of the European Parliament must not increase, since this would lead to a federal system."
"However, the European Parliament's working methods must be improved with a view to achieving more contact with the general public, less time spent in Brussels and more time in the homeland, more direct contact with the national parliaments, more questions of principle and concentration on the major political issues and dispensing with all questions of detail."
"The undemocratic system of dividing up speaking time through the group leaders must be abolished."
"A more democratic model needs to be created that gives all elected representatives the opportunity to speak on questions in which they are involved."
"Speaking time must also be adapted to match the importance of the issues in question."
"That two weeks should be devoted to questions of detail, but two and a half hours to the most important question - the EMU debate - during the entire session of Parliament illustrates the current imbalance."
"I thank our colleague, Fernand Herman, for the own-initiative report which he has drawn up on possible improvements to the functioning of Community institutions without modification of the Treaty."
"The democratic deficit which the institutions of the European Union generally suffer from and the possible solutions to this are set out perfectly clearly."
"Like our rapporteur, I believe that the most substantial institutional improvements have been the result more of practices established on the basis of either institutional agreements or case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, or indeed of the extensive use of existing procedures, than of formal modifications of Treaties."
"The role of the European Parliament must be strengthened urgently in two areas: social policy, which is particularly important in the eyes of European citizens; and economic and monetary union."
"I would stress the problem of democratic responsibility in the economic and monetary areas, where the European Parliament, according to the Treaties, does not have any formal role."
"We cannot, for all that, neglect the areas of common commercial policy, international agreements and competition policy."
"In future, we should even extend our thinking to include foreign policy and police and judicial cooperation."
"Our rapporteur recommends reaching an interinstitutional agreement. I share his view entirely."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.27 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0498/98 by Mrs Günther and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the situation in Sudan; -B4-0506/98 by Mr Telkämper and Mrs Aelvoet, on behalf of the V Group, on the situation in Sudan; -B4-0523/98 by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the political situation in Sudan and the humanitarian crisis in southern Sudan; -B4-0534/98 by Mr Bertens and Mr Fassa, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Sudan; -B4-0539/98 by Mr Hory and others, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the situation in Sudan; -B4-0541/98 by Mr Newens, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Sudan; -B4-0552/98 by Mr Pasty and Mr Andrews, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the situation in Sudan."
"Madam President, the Sudan lies at the heart of a region where stability is often threatened."
"In the forefront there is of course the clash of cultures, in this case the Muslim-Arab north versus the non-Muslim south."
"Consequently the Islamic State of Iran backs the Khartoum faction - and China too, though this is mainly to annoy the USA - while the neighbouring countries are frightened because a united fundamentalist Sudan seems to them a dangerous prospect, as this religious spark, as it were, could well flash over into the Muslim populations of these nearby states."
"The hope attached to the Nairobi talks resides in the fact that a compromise may be possible this time due simply to the respective weaknesses of both sides in the conflict, for at the fruitless peace talks held six months ago the same peace plan, more or less, was on the table."
"The intention now is to agree, for a transitional period, on a loose federation between north and south and then, after several years, to put to the people in a referendum how they wish to be governed."
"However, it is to be regarded as a sign of the helplessness of the European Union and the rest of the international community that we are now grateful for being allowed to provide aid to the suffering population of that country, while it is those very people in power in Sudan who should be responsible for this."
"Madam President, when you talk about the Sudan, you are talking about my family."
"My two children were born there, and the country means something to me."
"To see 400 000 people once again near starvation, it gets me, it gets everyone."
"Especially if you know that the cause is the ceasefire which has not been declared by the governing party, let alone by the resistance movement in the south."
"The Union must increase pressure to the maximum."
"They must be persuaded to take up the numerous peace initiatives again."
"I would have thought all types of pressure are legitimate, including the freezing of IMF and World Bank funds, because 400 000 to 500 000 human lives are at risk."
"In the meantime, this same Union must not renege on the humanitarian front."
"That is why I thank Commissioner Marín, and in any case the Commission, for the recent ECHO flight with ECU 8.8 million in emergency aid."
"People must not lose interest in the helpless Sudanese."
"Madam President, sometimes when we put forward topics for discussion marked 'urgency' people say: ' Where is the urgency?'"
"Pictures on the television screens of Europe are sometimes what it takes to alert people to human tragedies, such as the continuing crisis in Sudan, and we are absolutely right to come back to it."
"We are not alone, however, because at the ACP Joint Assembly in Mauritius recently, to everybody's agreeable surprise, there was a solid majority of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries voting separately, at their request, from the EU, condemning the Sudanese."
"That is not, however, enough."
"We have to look for a long-term and permanent solution."
"This is where the example of Eritrea and Ethiopia, which were in a similar situation not that long ago, is instructive, and so we should welcome the prospect of a referendum, and reinforce the right of self-determination of the south."
"Madam President, over the past 15 years a million people are estimated to have died in the civil war between north and south in Sudan, and hundreds of thousands more are now threatened by imminent starvation caused partly by a twoyear drought but primarily by armed hostilities."
"In the hardest-hit region of all, Bahr-al-Ghazal, northern-backed forces are reported to have burned crops and grain stores, and here and everywhere else deliveries of emergency food aid have been barred, while people have been eating their seed stock and leaves and dying in swarms."
"In this merciless conflict human rights have been totally ignored. Action by the international community must be stepped up to try to avert an even greater human tragedy than has already occurred."
"The Sudanese government has an appalling record of ruthless repression in north and south alike, apart from its military operations: imprisonment, torture, execution and the use of terrorism against its own and neighbouring peoples."
"The Sudanese government has ignored UN Security Council resolutions on human rights."
"In these circumstances, sanctions on development aid, but not on humanitarian aid, will have to be maintained."
"Peace is desperately needed, and it is therefore sad that talks in Nairobi this week broke down."
"Peace, however, is only possible on the basis of accepting the right of the peoples of Sudan to democracy and democratic self determination."
"We must welcome the fact that agreement has been reached to lift some restrictions on food aid destined for those in dire need, but all possible pressure must be maintained to ensure that humanitarian aid gets through everywhere."
"The European Union has already made an important contribution, but we must ask that efforts be intensified to provide relief in this appalling human catastrophe."
"This is the aim of this motion."
"Madam President, everyone knows that the drought of the past few years has quite plainly only aggravated the problem of the war in Sudan."
"In other words, the main obstacle to combating famine and promoting peace must be removed by working on peace negotiations."
"We know that the result which has been achieved as part of IGAD is still incomplete at the moment, and that both parties still have some way to go."
"Yet I think it is important to signal from within the European Union that we expect further results as part of IGAD."
"Secondly, as far as the problem of the now acute food shortage is concerned, and since access is possible again now - thank God! - the European Union should also take the lead in ensuring that the food reaches the starving population for the time being."
"Madam President, I have been dealing with this question for five years in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly."
"Sadly, nothing positive has yet been achieved for the people of Sudan."
"We need an immediate ceasefire, we need negotiations between all parties, otherwise nothing can be achieved - for partial negotiations have so far not proved successful."
"Human rights and democracy, the right of the population of southern Sudan to self determination, these must be respected, and we urgently need humanitarian aid before another 100 000 people starve to death, helpless in the face of the current conflict."
"What we need are sanctions against the government of Sudan, and these should be imposed not just by the EU but also by the international community, so that more pressure can be brought to bear and the neighbouring countries can be protected."
"Madam President, as the honorable Members are aware, the Commission stopped all development aid to the Sudan in 1989 because of the persistent lack of respect for human rights, the absence of democracy and the lack of significant attempts to negotiate a peaceful end to that country's civil war."
"Since there has been no sign of real change, and unless substantial progress is made with regard to the peace process and human rights, there is no reason for the Commission to change its position."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is following developments in the humanitarian situation in southern Sudan very carefully."
"In 1997, the Commission was the largest aid donor, with ECU 23 million. Added to the Member States' bilateral aid, that represents 65 % of all the humanitarian aid received by the Sudan."
"In November 1997, a decision was made to give the Sudan ECU 6.7 million, out of the total sum of ECU 23 million I just mentioned, to help the world food programme."
"I should point out that a large proportion of the food currently being distributed in Bahr-al-Ghazal, in the south, forms part of this contribution."
"On 23 March this year, the Commission approved a decision to the sum of ECU 11.8 million, in the form of an overall plan for humanitarian aid to meet the needs of the victims of the war in the Sudan."
"That aid - from this year, 1998 - is being implemented by 35 non-governmental organizations and this time covers both the south and the north of the country. It basically focuses on the medical, food safety and health sectors, especially drinking water."
"This decision also includes a reserve of ECU 1 million which is being used to provide additional funding for certain activities in Bahr-al-Ghazal, again in the south of Sudan."
"Nevertheless, the situation in the north of the region is still very worrying and may deteriorate when the rainy season arrives. That may hamper the delivery of humanitarian aid, as has happened in the past."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0504/98 by Mr Macartney and Mr Weber, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the possible re-entry into service of the Mochovce nuclear plant in Slovakia; -B4-0509/98 by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the V Group, on the entry into service of the Mochovce nuclear power plant in Slovakia; -B4-0515/98 by Mrs Flemming and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the entry into service of the Mochovce nuclear power plant; -B4-0524/98 by Mr Papayannakis, Mr Campos and Mr Sjöstedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Mochovce nuclear power plant; -B4-0536/98 by Mr Eisma, Mr Frischenschlager and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the entry into service of the Mochovce nuclear power plant; -B4-0542/98 by Mrs Graenitz, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the planned entry into service of the Mochovce nuclear power plant."
"Madam President, the resolution on Slovakia is a compromise resolution."
"I think all of us have reservations about certain points."
"For example, I have reservations about recital F. A point one should make to our Slovak colleagues, if they are listening to us, as I am sure they will be, is that we are not singling out Slovakia in particular for criticism."
"In this House my group put forward a proposal to bring in Dounreay in Scotland as well because the situation there in many respects is just as serious."
"So we are certainly not singling out Slovakia. When we say that the Slovak authorities have failed to provide any clear answers to the problem of nuclear waste storage, as in paragraph 5 of the resolution, that certainly obtains in many other countries too."
"What I would say is that the resolution is a package."
"If you take recital H which expresses doubts about the safety of the Mochovce station alongside paragraphs 2 and 3, these add up to a reasonable request that the evaluation study which will be published, we understand, within two or three weeks should take into account any criticisms and problems."
"All of this adds up to a responsible, balanced and fair package and should therefore be supported."
"Madam President, the history of nuclear energy in eastern Europe is that of unparalleled decline, whether you take the defunct reactors in Bohunice and Chernobyl or the Mochovce nuclear plant."
"This sad decline has for years been accompanied by anxious resolutions from the European Parliament, which have basically done no more than lag behind events with half-hearted measures aimed at risk limitation."
"These have all come to nought, as the case history of the Slovak nuclear plant shows."
"This plant is being built without containment, it is full of defects and it is to feature equipment from a Russian nuclear reactor which has never even been tested."
"Even the most impartial observer must now realize that the strategy of the European Union, which has been to re-equip the nuclear plants of central and eastern Europe and bring them up to Western safety standards, has now failed. I believe the reason for this is all too evident."
"As long as the European Union fails to realize that nuclear energy cannot be made safe and that we need to develop a non nuclear-based energy policy for the future, then we shall continue to lag behind events."
"Our main demands are: no start-up of the Slovak nuclear plant; complete shutdown of the defunct reactor in Bohunice; and no reduction in European nuclear safety standards as part of EU enlargement, until such time as this view finally prevails."
"Madam President, I first wish to thank all the people whose support has led to the adoption of this joint resolution, and also the operators of the Mochovce nuclear plant and all those NGOs which were prepared to provide us with comprehensive information in this field."
"Of course it is the right of every sovereign state to make its own decisions on the use of its primary energy sources, but in recent years, and certainly since Chernobyl, we have come to realize that we are all nextdoor neighbours when it comes to the nuclear plants of Europe. It is the right of every neighbour, in the face of such potentially dangerous technology, to demand the application of those safety standards which are taken for granted in Germany, France and the UK."
"This is all part of the acquis communautaire ."
"Without adherence to the strictest possible safety standards there can be no talk of accession to the European Union."
"Two international panels of experts have visited the Mochovce plant in recent weeks."
"It was taken for granted that the start-up of the plant would await the outcome of these investigations and any identified defects would be put right beforehand."
"But no, the operators announced to an astonished public that whatever happened, they intended to commence operating trials on 21 July."
"This is something we cannot accept."
"We are also still owed an answer as to the nuclear waste, for this material certainly cannot be sold to Russia."
"The law is absolutely stringent on this."
"Neither Austria nor the EU can force Slovakia or any other country to collaborate with us, but compliance with the findings of the two panels could constitute the starting point for creating international structures for greater transparency in nuclear matters, and for this Slovakia would earn the gratitude not only of Austria but of the whole European Union."
"Madam President, our draft resolution asks for a very small number of reasonable things from Slovakia: an assessment, and the promise that the findings of that assessment will be respected."
"I remind you, however, that at Mochovce, as a result of a previous assessment, 201 cases of inadequate safety measures have already been detected, some of which are outrageous, such as the lack of insulation, corroded material and inexistent fire protection."
"I therefore think that we have the right to intervene and to call on Slovakia not to go ahead with putting this nuclear plant into operation. It is not simply a matter for Slovakia alone."
"We know very well that it is a pan-European matter and, I would venture to say, a global matter. We would be more convincing, Madam President, if we announced a programme to replace nuclear energy throughout the whole of Europe and if of course we promised credible assistance to Slovakia, to ease its way through this period during which it will need energy until it can give up its own nuclear energy."
"Madam President, this is not the first time we have discussed Mochovce."
"More than three years ago we came together here to form an opinion on the same topics."
"I think the safety of the nuclear plants in central and eastern Europe will keep us busy for many years to come."
"The situation in Slovakia becomes increasingly urgent when we look at the nuclear plants over there. The Slovak authorities intend to start up the nuclear plant in Mochovce in just a few weeks' time."
"We are very worried, because there is still no clarity about the storage of nuclear waste and the safety of the installation itself."
"I therefore beg the Slovak authorities to postpone the start-up as long as this uncertainty still exists."
"That is why it is so important for us in this Parliament to make a statement today."
"In a few weeks' time our Joint Parliamentary Committee is due to meet with Slovakia, and they should be given a proper brief from this entire Parliament."
"Madam President, I hope we will all adopt this resolution unanimously, so that our imminent delegation to Slovakia knows the position of the European Parliament, and the position the Slovak authorities ought to adopt."
"Madam President, I have been asked by many people why such an urgent resolution on Mochovce is being tabled now."
"I believe this resolution has become important for the following reasons. The inspection visits carried out last week and the week before by independent international experts have shown that progress has been made, not least because funding has been provided through the PHARE programme."
"They also showed, however, that some questions have still to be answered, particularly that of evaluation."
"The investigations revealed that some problems have still to be solved, particularly the lack of any containment in the normal sense, and that the systems which have been installed for this purpose have not been inspected to see whether they are capable of guaranteeing safety in the event of a serious incident, such as occurred at Three Mile Island or Chernobyl."
"It is worth recalling here that the results of radioactive contamination from Chernobyl can still be detected in the European Alps."
"Secondly, I think the results of these inspections should be submitted prior to the commencement of operating trials, so that any improvements deemed necessary can be undertaken before rather than after the event."
"In this context, I must also mention that it seems strange to me that one expert was excluded from the visit."
"This particular person was involved with the Greifswald nuclear reactor and his experience would be most valuable."
"I should also like to point out that the last meeting of the Council of Ministers, which discussed the problems of integration and enlargement, dealt with the subjects of Mochovce and also the shutting down of Bohunice, in the event that other energy sources are available."
"Everybody there was of the opinion that nuclear plants which are not safe should be shut down."
"We are very concerned about the safety of the citizens of Slovakia, the transition economies, the European Union and everyone in Europe."
"I do not want to see - and I think this goes for all of us - any irreversible steps being taken in Slovakia which might threaten the safety of all these people."
"Madam President, this Parliament must respect Slovakia's right as a sovereign country to determine its own energy policy and to operate a nuclear plant if it so wishes."
"We should note that Slovakia has signed all the international conventions, that it was a Member of the International Atomic Energy Agency Board between 1993 and 1996 and that Mr Lipar, the head of the regulatory authority, is vice-chairman of the Nuclear Safety Assistance Coordinating Committee which is operated by DG XI in the European Commission."
"Because of a previous resolution in this Parliament, the completion of Mochovce has gone ahead without European Union financial assistance."
"As a further result, there is no legally binding international agreement to close Bohunice number 1 reactor when Mochovce is in operation."
"This Parliament bears the prime responsibility for that situation."
"It is to the credit of Slovakia that the completion has gone ahead not only with their own national engineers and with the assistance of the Russian designers but also with the involvement of Siemens, EDF, Westinghouse and Framatome, all western experts in the nuclear field."
"The completion has been made to standards set by Risk-Audit, an organization established by German and French nuclear safety authorities."
"There has been a study carried out."
"The indications I have had are that it is a favourable study but we ought to wait for the study before we jump to conclusions."
"It is due in June, and the date that I have for the proposed start-up of Mochovce is July."
"Most of this resolution is irrelevant to the Mochovce circumstances."
"What we need at European level, and we still do not have, are standards which all the countries have to apply to the safety of their nuclear reactors."
"Madam President, we all want the central and eastern European countries to progress economically and to have safe nuclear plants."
"Just as we want all the nuclear plants in the world to be safe, together with coal mines, factories and every other type of installation."
"I have heard a lot of silly things being said here, Madam President, and I am surprised that people say such things without knowing what they are talking about."
"I am a member of the delegation to Slovakia."
"They have explained a lot of things to us."
"I think they have the sovereignty to do whatever they think is right, and it is their responsibility to protect the Slovak people, their neighbours and the whole of Europe."
"In 1995 this Parliament refused all assistance."
"That was a great mistake, but they have no right to say the things they are saying now."
"So, Madam President, I shall not be supporting some points of the resolution."
"It will not be fully approved, Mr Eisma, because it is not particularly correct."
"Slovakia imports 15 % of its electricity. It is growing a lot and it needs help."
"I wish them great success, and I hope the Mochovce nuclear plant works well and safely."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a letter from Austrian MPs to the Slovak government and to the Members of the European Parliament reports on the possible dangers associated with putting second generation reactors into service in the nuclear plant in Mochovce in Slovakia."
"On behalf of the Group Union for Europe, I must note firstly that the Slovak Republic ratified in 1995 the convention on nuclear safety which was adopted by the IAEA in 1994."
"This convention came into force in 1996."
"Secondly, the modernization of sections 1 and 2 of the nuclear plant in Mochovce, although it was not subsidized by the EBRD and thus does not benefit directly from European funds, received financing which affects the whole of Europe."
"This work was granted to Slovak companies and to a consortium of Czechs, French, Germans and Russians."
"The prescribed level of security will from now on be identical to that of Western sectors for the same technology, and it meets IAEA criteria."
"International experts recently confirmed that all precautions had been taken in terms of the safety of modernized installations."
"In this context, one cannot help but be surprised by the terms used in the letter addressed to the Slovak President."
"Slovakia must guarantee energy production at the level required by its population."
"It cannot say no to Mochovce."
"From now on there is no reason to do so, in that all nuclear safety precautions have been taken for starting the operation of second generation reactors, which are henceforth as safe as the reactors used in the European Union."
"So let us wait for the results of the evaluation, which we will have at the end of June, and allow the Slovaks, who are sovereign in this area, to bring back into service, for the benefit of its population, a nuclear plant which guarantees all necessary security standards."
"Madam President, the start-up of the Mochovce nuclear reactor is a decision which will have farreaching consequences for the entire future of nuclear power generation."
"This reactor would never have been approved as safe either by an EU Member State or in the USA."
"The nuclear industry is placing its high-risk installations right up against the borders of the EU."
"This is a cynical gesture to the safety of the whole of Europe."
"Added to this is the fact that we are for the first time faced with a situation in which the start-up of a suspect nuclear plant may well be part of an election strategy."
"The Slovak Prime Minister, Vladimir Meciar, is keen to show the world that he heads a determined and strong government, prior to the autumn ballot."
"The nuclear plant is to go into operation in spite of the fact that internationally recognized experts consider that building a new installation would be more cost-efficient that refitting an old one to meet international safety standards."
"A panel of experts has recently examined the plant and their findings are to be made known shortly."
"I propose that the European Parliament should invite these experts to a hearing on safety standards at the plant."
"Slovakia does not have a credible energy policy."
"I recall that the Slovak government originally promised that the start-up of Mochovce would be accompanied by the closure of the two unsafe units at Bohunice."
"This was also the basis on which the German-based Hermes Bank provided a credit guarantee for Siemens-KWU to supply equipment for the start-up of the Mochovce plant."
"Contrary to all promises, Bohunice is being refitted, rather than closed, at a cost of over ECU 150 million."
"Slovakia recently declared that Bohunice would be put into service along with the start-up of Mochovce."
"The European Parliament and the Hermes Bank have clearly been deceived."
"In view of these events the resolution in question is very restrained, but it can be accepted as a minimum response to the situation."
"Madam President, I will be brief and make just two points."
"I would say to the people of Slovakia that nuclear energy may in many respects be a clean form of energy but it is one that allows no room for any mistakes at all."
"That is why neighbours worry and I understand the Austrian position in this."
"I am from the south of England and had to take environmental health officers to France where we wanted to look at French nuclear power stations."
"Those are concerns people have about any nuclear energy."
"However, I would say to this Parliament that, as the vice-president of the joint parliamentary committee with Slovakia, I met yesterday senior safety officials from Slovakia and the Slovak Electricity Authority."
"I have no doubt they take their responsibilities very seriously, and we should welcome the action of the Slovak government in inviting an independent panel of experts to inspect this plant."
"If those independent experts give it a clean bill of health, we should respect that and, just as we often pass condemnatory motions on Slovakia, we should also respect good news when it comes from Slovakia."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you will remember that after independence the Slovak authorities decided to complete the two first reactors with Western assistance, for which they requested a loan from Euratom and another one from the EBRD."
"Because of that request, the Commission promoted a major modernization programme for these reactors during 1994 and 1995."
"The programme consisted of a large number of measures which, if implemented, would have guaranteed safety levels absolutely equivalent to those in the West."
"However, before the Commission and the EBRD had announced their decision about the loans, the Slovak government decided to withdraw the loan requests and use other resources to finance the installation of the reactors."
"The project was indeed carried out, mainly with the assistance of the Czech Republic and Russia. Certain Western companies also participated, by means of bilateral export credits."
"As a result, the Commission ceased to participate in the management of the project or in defining the safety improvement programme."
"In its opinion on Slovakia in Agenda 2000, and in the association agreement for Slovakia's accession, the Commission has mentioned the need for the Mochovce nuclear plant to work to international safety regulations, and for the implementation of a realistic programme to close the Bohunice reactor."
"At the moment, the Community's participation in this project is limited to supporting the Slovak authorities."
"The PHARE programme is funding a project for experts from the EU to review the Mochovce units under the direction of Risk-Audit, which is a company effectively composed of independent organizations of safety experts from France and Germany."
"In order to evaluate the safety of the reactor, the Commission agrees with Parliament that it is important for the experts to have access to all the documentation related to the modernization programme, and other details about the reactor."
"This assessment, by the independent organizations I just mentioned, could be available by the end of 1998."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"Guatemala -B4-0493/98 by Mr Bertens and Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the political assassination of Bishop Juan José Gerardi in Guatemala; -B4-0516/98 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, Mrs Ferrer and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the murder of Juan Gerardi, auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of Guatemala; -B4-0525/98 by Mrs González Álvarez and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the murder of Bishop Gerardi in Guatemala; -B4-0544/98 by Mr Cabezón Alonso, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the murder of Bishop Juan Gerardi in Guatemala; -B4-0555/98 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the murder of Bishop Juan Gerardi in Guatemala;"

"Guatemala"
"Madam President, the murder of Bishop Juan José Gerardi is seen by many as an attack on the peace process."
"He played an important role in opening up the files on the murders and attacks which took place during the time of the civil war."
"It is essential for the consolidation of this peace process that lawlessness is brought to an end, and that is why the perpetrators of this murder should be found and punished quickly."
"The so-called high level committee which has been set up by the government must work with speed and credibility."
"Maintaining credibility is essential for the progress of this same peace process."
"We think the murderer, or murderers, tried to upset this peace process."
"They must not be allowed to succeed."
"The EU must call upon the Guatemalan parties and support them in continuing down the road towards this difficult and lasting peace."
"The EU was there to condemn the civil war; now we must be in Guatemala to promote and maintain peace."
"Madam President, on behalf of my political group, I also want to express our most energetic condemnation of the murder of Bishop Gerardi and our solidarity with the Catholic community and the whole of the Guatemalan people."
"I think the compromise resolution satisfactorily covers not just Bishop Gerardi's worthy pastoral activities, but also his firm and resolute commitment to democracy, human rights and the peace process in Guatemala. The government of that country has expressed a strong desire to identify the perpetrators of this horrible crime and bring them to justice."
"In order to do so, as Mr Bertens mentioned, it has set up a committee, which we hope can act as quickly and diligently as possible."
"I think, Madam President, that if we were to ask ourselves who benefits and who is harmed by this assassination, there can be no doubt that it was a hard blow for all those people who have shown determination and commitment to the Guatemalan peace process, which was so difficult to achieve."
"So, Madam President, I believe the best way of paying a tribute of admiration and respect to the memory of Bishop Gerardi and the ideals for which he laid down his life is for the European Union to continue in its efforts - and now I am addressing the Commission and its representative here, Mr Marín - to carry on making all possible efforts to support the Guatemalan peace process, as it always has done."
"Madam President, I think we have talked about impunity many times during this session, and about the way these murders are sometimes directed against the people who defend human rights."
"I think Bishop Gerardi's report, which contains more than 5000 statements from people whose rights were violated during the previous era, is aimed precisely against that impunity."
"The objective of Bishop Gerardi's report is that acts such as those which took place in Guatemala should never happen again. In fact, when he finished his report, he said: ' Now I can die in peace."
"May nothing like that ever happen again in Guatemala' ."
"So the other speakers are right to say that the peace agreement should remain. It should remain, but in the absence of impunity."
"During the course of the afternoon we are also going to discuss human rights in Colombia."
"More than three human rights activists have been murdered, two of them after having spoken to Members."
"We think it is extremely serious that there should be this impunity, which allows the constant disappearance of the people who defend human rights in either of these countries."
"As Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra said, the Commission must make whatever efforts it has at its disposal to prevent this from happening."
"Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, during the night of 26 April, Bishop Gerardi, the auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of Guatemala was murdered in Guatemala City."
"In expressing our regret and condemnation of this crime, we must also express our solidarity with his relatives and collaborators, and with the Guatemalan people in general."
"As has been said, Bishop Gerardi had coordinated the documents reflecting the human rights violations which occurred in that country during the years of armed conflict, and the conclusions of that work had just been presented to the public."
"We must of course be somewhat prudent and not speculate at the moment, but we must demand that the Guatemalan government and judiciary complete their investigations."
"We are obviously keen to hear the conclusions of those investigations."
"Violent acts of this nature cannot go unpunished, and cannot be used cynically as a tool against the peace agreements for anybody's selfish interests. The Guatemalan government is committed to those agreements, as are most of the parties and civil organizations in that country, as well as the group of friendly countries which supported the dialogue which culminated in those peace agreements."
"The European Union must also carry on lending its political and economic support to the content of the Guatemalan peace process."
"Such an act, so painful and worthy of condemnation, cannot call a country's image into question, but we find it worrying as an expression of a violence still all too present within Guatemalan society."
"The people of Guatemala deserve the best possible future after decades of armed confrontation and violence."
"Peace in Guatemala also marked the culmination of a process of pacification throughout Central America."
"The Guatemalan people deserve our full support for the way they are relying on solving the conflicts through dialogue rather than violence."
"We trust that the investigation into the crime against Bishop Gerardi will have a more satisfactory conclusion than other processes underway, such as those relating to the murders of the politician Jorge Carpio Nicol or the lawyer González Dubón."
"Madam President, the authorities and the military in Guatemala should take responsibility for the serious and systematic infringement of human rights in that country."
"This was one of the main aims of the thousand-page REMHI report which was prepared under the direction of Bishop Juan Gerardi."
"As the latter said in one of his last interviews, this will not suit a lot of the people who are seeking to make a clean break with the past."
"Bishop Gerardi's brutal murder took place against a background of continuing impunity."
"Neither the armed forces nor the secret services have been exculpated as a consequence of the peace treaties."
"The report finally names the people responsible and calls for action to be taken."
"This includes the immediate disbandment of the military and civilian instruments of repression, the prosecution of paramilitary groups, an end to impunity and compensation for the victims."
"REMHI restores the dignity of the people."
"Project collaborators must be given protection, and this includes those working up-country."
"Europe supports many projects in Guatemala, including the build-up of new security forces."
"Here it is essential for the EU to ensure that no support whatsoever is given to human rights violators of the old guard."
"We should back the establishment of an international commission to investigate properly the fate of the people who have disappeared."
"Madam President, we all sympathize with the death of Bishop Gerardi, which has been a grave loss for the people of Guatemala."
"I believe, however, that even at a moment such as this we should be focusing on the fact that his work must go on."
"But international intervention certainly produces no results."
"The Guatemalan government has recently shown how anxious it is to establish peace and order."
"After 30 years of civil war, however, it is simply inconceivable that such a thing can be achieved overnight."
"However, given my experience of the Guatemalan people, which certainly does not compare with that of my friend Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, I continue to fear that if we intervene too vigorously they will do just the opposite of what we wish."
"Nevertheless, we should make every possible effort to administer the legacy of Bishop Gerardi, and do everything we can to achieve his aims."
"Colombia"
"Madam President, the murder of Eduardo Umaña Mendoza has shocked us all."
"This sudden, politically motivated crime is the worst attack to date on the human rights movement and on all the opposition groups in Colombia."
"This lawyer of many years' standing was known to some of us personally."
"He was even told that the recent cases he had been working on would cost him his life, for as Colombia's most distinguished lawyer he had for 20 years consistently and uncompromisingly represented the victims of human rights violations."
"It is an open secret as to which of the state and military forces were behind this murder."
"Furthermore, those who are promoting economic cooperation with Colombia and granting customs waivers through the GSP are accessories to a terrible spiral of violence which continues to be fuelled by those who benefit from it."
"Only yesterday afternoon some 30 soldiers with search warrants forced their way into the offices belonging to Justicia y Paz and other human rights organizations, allegedly in the hunt for would-be assassins."
"Such intimidation of human rights supporters is completely unacceptable, and the Council should distance itself unequivocally from such a policy."
"The Commission must review the terms of its entire policy of cooperation with Colombia, otherwise the people fighting for human rights in Colombia will soon not just be muzzled but murdered!"
"Commissioner, I would be pleased if you could for once give us answers to some of these questions."
"I know you are a master of diplomacy, but a response would be most appropriate in this case."
"Madam President, as a doctor, I can only deplore the development in Latin America of an aspect of epidemiology known as the epidemiology of violence."
"It is not an act of nature."
"It is not like the other diseases which are studied epidemiologically. Rather, the cause of this epidemic is the support given by North America to the dictatorships these countries have suffered."
"In contrast, Europe is constantly defending human rights, justice and equality, so I think it is our responsibility to ensure that people realize the difference between the North American influence, which sows corpses, and the influence of the European Union, which sows peace and concord."
"So the Commission should act forcefully to clarify and apply the necessary conclusions."
"Madam President, it is with sadness, regret and anger, and also a sense of frustration, that I rise once again in this Parliament to condemn violence - all the violence committed in Colombia, and the rest of the world too."
"This is a terrorist form of violence which is preying upon the defenders of human rights; which has murdered Eduardo Umaña Mendoza, just as two days previously it cut down the lives of María Arango Fonnegra and Jesús María Valle Jaramillo, and so on and so on; a terrorist violence which also murdered the former defence minister, MPs, lowly town councillors, journalists, peasant farmers, women and children - in other words, everybody."
"This violence is committed in the name of justice - what irony! - or to demand justice; a violence which blackmails and kidnaps; a violence which is fascist, drug-related, and mafia-like. It is a violence which threatens those who believe in democracy and the rule of law, and who do not resign themselves to this state of affairs because they believe there are ways to achieve peace, and who are so generous that they act as human shields in the fight for democracy, peace and liberty by means of dialogue alone."
"Madam President, as counterbalance and hope, I want to emphasize the efforts of thousands of Colombian women and men who, with profound democratic convictions and different ideologies, are providing a real lesson in human dignity and civil heroism in a difficult and complex situation."
"In a few days' time presidential elections will be held."
"It is important, necessary and essential for the process to take place peacefully."
"Peace cannot wait much longer."
"We must be vigilant and support these efforts. Most of all, we must call upon the violent groups to renounce violence, to realize that their time has passed and that, unless they want to kill everybody, they must understand that with democracy you win, whereas with violence you always lose."
"Madam President, like the previous speaker, I can only point out that yet again we have to draw attention to the atrocities - and how often have we already condemned such actions? - which are being committed primarily in Colombia, which, one regrets to have to say, is a land of violence."
"Eduardo Umaña Mendoza is the third human rights activist to be killed in a very short space of time."
"We really must demand that these human rights representatives are given better protection as they go about their work."
"The government is clearly unable to take decisive action, but violence is not the solution - certainly not for the people of the country, who have suffered most from it. Colombia can to all intents and purposes now be considered as a country where violence prevails and its citizens can do nothing about it."
"Nor will the elections of 31 May bring an end to the killings, as indicated by the murder of the former General Fernando Landazabal, who was advising presidential candidate Andrés Pastrana on various matters, including a future peace plan."
"Other candidates' names are also on the death lists, and this includes people on both sides."
"This is no way to achieve democracy. This is no solution."
"We call upon the government authorities, the candidates and all the parties to come to a peaceful political solution and at long last to bring democracy and peace to the people of Colombia."
"Madam President, in its recent report on human rights the US State Department called the situation in Colombia poor, and that is saying something."
"In particular, the culture of lawlessness was regarded as a deterioration in the situation there."
"We have seen what this can lead to."
"Human rights activists do important work, in Colombia as well."
"The Colombian government has an interest in this."
"I think the Commission and the Council must give another clear signal to Colombia that we are getting serious now."
"Today's motion for a resolution rightly calls for a Commission report on the human rights situation in Colombia."
"Our agreement with Colombia contains a human rights clause, and for good reason."
"I am also asking the Council, which is meeting on 18 May, to pay attention to this."
"We must be on our guard."
"Turkey"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, once again this House has occasion to express its concerns about human rights and freedom of speech in Turkey."
"We do so without any exaggerated view of our own capabilities and without belittling our own problems, even within the European Union."
"Nevertheless, the cowardly attack on Mr Birdal, the president of the Turkish Association of Human Rights, and the legal actions taken against members of the former Refah Party, in connection with political views which had been expressed, are quite dreadful events."
"Democratic states are convinced that banning political parties hardly constitutes a solution."
"It is certainly no solution to the internal arguments which have been waged in Turkey between those holding different political views, such as Erbakan's party or the successor Fazilet Partisi (Virtue Party)."
"Democratic states are quite rightly not very keen on banning political parties, for such bans soon get a reputation for being themselves undemocratic and for stifling political activity and freedom of speech."
"Turkey itself is undergoing the process of transition to a normal society, which is something the laical constitution of Kemal Atatürk cannot live up to, for in my mind this constitution does not allow sufficient scope for religious freedom and for the religious activities of its citizens."
"Neither a ban on political parties nor the threat of imprisonment can prohibit this process of transition, and this is a problem which Turkish society and the Turkish political parties themselves will have to solve."
"Respect for human rights has certainly improved in a number of areas in recent years."
"This is a fact which we should not conceal."
"Nevertheless, it is shocking that attacks on journalists and human rights activists are not prosecuted with the necessary vigour."
"Prime Minister Yilmaz has promised that firm action will be taken to find those responsible for the cowardly attack on Mr Birdal."
"We can only hope that this will be the case."
"The same applies to Mr Erdogan, the mayor of Istanbul, who was given a 10 month prison sentence for expressing his political views."
"In our opinion, this state of affairs cannot continue indefinitely."
"We are therefore calling on the Turkish government and Parliament at long last to grant its people freedom of speech and freedom of conscience."
"Madam President, like most of you I think, I had the opportunity to meet Mr Akin Birdal, president of the Turkish Association of Human Rights."
"He always had a certain sorrow in his eyes, a sorrow which is easily understood because in a country like Turkey you need not only courage, indeed foolhardiness, but also obstinacy to devote your life to the defence of other people's lives."
"The murder attempt of which he was victim does not surprise me."
"I think Mr Birdal expected it too."
"He had received several threats and he had never been able to receive any police protection whatsoever."
"I sincerely hope that Mr Birdal will survive and will continue his activities."
"I call upon the Turkish authorities to bring the perpetrators of this attack to justice."
"Turkey, a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, cannot continue with its policy of repression and persecution towards journalists, magistrates, parliamentarians, defenders of human rights, Kurds and ordinary citizens."
"The sentence pronounced against Mr Erdogan, mayor of Istanbul, is a further sad example, if one were needed."
"Turkey must understand that there will always be Birdals, Erdogans and Leyla Zanas, to shout loud and clear that we cannot kill freedom."
"Madam President, the assassination attempts, the incarceration of intellectuals, politicians and reporters, the immunity of the para-state and paramilitary organizations, the policing and penalizing of political life, the political prosecutions, the rigged incidents, the trivializing of politics and democracy, this is unfortunately the political reality of Turkey today."
"The assault on the president of the Turkish Association of Human Rights, Akin Birdal, is the product of an unwholesome political climate which favours and breeds violence, and the activity of the para-state against the democratic and human rights of the Turkish people."
"Moreover, on the pretext of an existent or non-existent Islamic threat, a pogrom of prosecutions has been launched against the political opponents of the regime, which has not hesitated to ban an entire party. Nor does it hesitate to fabricate legal rulings aimed at removing senior politicians, such as the mayor of Istanbul, Mr Erdogan, from public life."
"We are waiting to see what will be the fate of Recai Kutan, who was this morning appointed president of the Fazilet Party."
"The European Parliament must take urgent action and force the Turkish government to respect the rights of the Turkish people and to abide by its obligations, which arise both from the customs union and from its other international commitments."
"We call for the immediate unmasking of those guilty of the assassination attempt against Akin Birdal."
"We also call for the repeal of the ruling by the state security court against the mayor of Istanbul and the 16 businessmen."
"We call for the release of all political detainees in Turkey."
"Human rights are not simply an internal matter for a state."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are shocked and we are indignant, we are sad and we are enraged to learn of the brutal attempt on the life of Akin Birdal."
"My dear Akin, we hope you will be restored to health, we hope that for today, for tomorrow and beyond you will be, and you will remain, the old Akin Birdal, always courageous, always determined, always full of hope, the Akin Birdal who was at all times full of humanity, full of cheer and above all uncompromising."
"The attack on you, Akin, was an attack on democracy in Turkey; an attack on human rights; an attack on all those who are fighting for democracy in Turkey; an attack on all who are pleading for a political solution to the Kurdish problem. The democratization of Turkey is directly bound up with the political settlement of this issue."
"We call upon the Turkish government at this late hour to take the issue of human rights seriously, and not just to make proclamations at the prayer-wheel, but to create a proper and stable foundation for citizens' rights, human rights, basic rights in Turkey, and to grant freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom to establish political parties. This must apply to everyone, even members of the Fazilet Party."
"Finally, we call for talks to begin, because only dialogue can produce a political solution."
"The military way is no solution."
"What happened to Akin happens every day to many, many people."
"The violence has got to stop."
"Please, Akin, get well soon."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reason for today's debate and resolution is the conviction of a number of politicians who were members of the former Refah Party."
"It is bad enough for a country to think that it has to conduct its political arguments in a court of law, that political arguments with Islam, political Islam, fundamentalist Islam, have to be conducted in court and by application of court judgments."
"But what is even worse is that something even more inconceivable has now taken place with the attempt on the life of Akin Birdal."
"As has already been said by a number of speakers, Akin Birdal was, and is - and it is hoped will remain - a champion, an indefatigable and fearless champion of human rights, both in Turkey and elsewhere, because of the shining example he has set."
"He never gave up the fight for human rights, even though he knew and felt that something such as this could happen to him."
"That is why we are making a common appeal to Turkey."
"Turkey wants to join the European Union, and it could well be that there were a few hitches - and in my view there certainly were - in the talks which were held primarily with the Council last autumn."
"Nevertheless, the pure and simple fact remains that we can only accept Turkey into the EU when it decides to uphold human rights, among many other things."
"Turkey must take note of one thing: upholding human rights also means protecting those who speak up for human rights and protecting those who fight for human rights."
"I am convinced - for I am an optimist - that no-one in the government and no-one in the military was happy to hear of this attempt on Mr Birdal's life."
"But that is not enough."
"What Turkey should be doing, instead of just being ""not happy' about it, is taking every possible measure to prevent such outrages. That is what we need to see before we can welcome Turkey as a member of the European Union."
"The Turkish government must be absolutely clear about that."
"Madam President, the two issues we are debating today - the assassination attempt on Akin Birdal, the president of the Turkish Association of Human Rights, and the prison sentence of the mayor of Istanbul, Mr Erdogan - have one thing in common: the idiosyncratic conception of human rights held by the Turkish establishment, particularly the Turkish army."
"The assassination attempt against Mr Birdal is the culmination of a series of attacks and prosecutions perpetrated against him, often encouraged and instigated by the authorities, because of his sensitivity to human rights."
"Turkey's establishment cannot tolerate discontent, protest or a different outlook."
"The sentencing of the mayor of Istanbul, on the other hand, shows the attempt to impose a secular state by means of violence."
"It is undeniable that fundamentalism constitutes a threat to democracy. However, true democracy cannot be defended through persecution and violence."
"It is defended through reasoning."
"Excesses such as sentencing the mayor to prison for reading a poem strengthen rather than weaken his position in the eyes of the public, insofar of course as his position is indeed fundamentalist."
"It must therefore be made clear: Turkey's road to Europe has to pass through respect for human rights."
"Let us hope the Turkish government will be able to move in this direction."
"Madam President, however justified Turkey's criticism of the European Union might be - that they feel abandoned in the context of MEDA, in the context of the customs union and in the context of accession - it does not relieve us of the duty to continue to point out to Turkey that they must observe human rights. In this context, the attack on Birdal was a blow to us, as was the sentencing of the mayor of Istanbul to ten months' imprisonment for questioning the secular state in a political speech."
"It is unthinkable that someone should be given this kind of sentence for that, and we expect the Turkish authorities to make every effort to summons the person who carried out the attack on Birdal."
"We also expect the court's sentence with regard to Erdogan to be revoked."
"To conclude, Madam President, we urge the Turkish government to do something about the legislation needed for further democratization on the basis of the principle of free speech."
"In this respect, I have nothing to add to what Claudia Roth has said."
"Madam President, it goes without saying that I concur with the present resolution which rightly denounces the worrying violations of the most elementary human rights and freedom of speech in our neighbouring country of Turkey."
"However, I would like to add that, as far as freedom of speech is concerned, this is no longer always guaranteed in our European countries either, for instance when I stand up for my political beliefs."
"I hope you will allow me to say, nevertheless, that this resolution carefully avoids the crux of the matter, as is the case, for that matter, with that other subscriber to human rights violations, the People's Republic of China."
"The crux of the matter is that the European Union as a whole, and the Member States individually, have never ever spoken plainly towards Turkey, if this plain language were to mean more than a paper protest."
"This very same Parliament approved the customs union with Turkey some years ago, and also 14 to 15 billion francs in European aid until the year 2000, without setting even the least suspensive conditions."
"Yet at that time we knew just as well as we do today what the human rights situation was in Turkey. We knew that the Turkish army was occupying part of Cyprus, and that in Turkey cultural genocide, if not worse, was being exercised on the Kurds, to give just two examples."
"I must add that with this resolution we are once again missing an opportunity to say to the Turkish government and the Turkish people that we wish to maintain the best possible relationship with our neighbouring country and our neighbours, but that Turkey will never be able to join the European Union for the simple reason that culturally, historically, ethnically, and even geographically Turkey is not a European country."
"If we do not have the courage to say that, then problems will only increase in future, and I am thinking not least of the problem of the millions of Turkish guest workers and temporary immigrants in Europe."
"Malaysia-Indonesia"
"Madam President, the situation in Indonesia has been getting completely out of hand over the past few weeks, and in particular over the past few days."
"The regime is taking extremely tough action against the demonstrators, and this has led to dozens of fatalities."
"This is absolutely unacceptable."
"Suharto said for the first time yesterday that he would consider stepping down once he had lost the trust of the people."
"It is high time he did, then, because he has clearly lost this trust."
"The economic crisis, which this regime is responsible for, is being shifted onto the people of Indonesia."
"I must say in all honesty that the IMF is demanding measures from Indonesia which do not really improve the situation for the people, but which will lead to even greater poverty."
"Nobody is pointing out the responsibility borne by the regime and the clique of friends around it, who have seriously enriched themselves over the past decades."
"At the same time we are looking at Malaysia, where there are thousands and thousands of people from Indonesia, whether they have arrived there recently as refugees or not."
"Others have been there longer and these people are being deported wholesale back to Indonesia, without respect for the person and without looking at their motives for fleeing their country, where a number of them are bound to be at great risk."
"This situation really must come to an end."
"Madam President, decades of political omnipotence, familial enrichment and a complete lack of interest in the fate of the Indonesian citizens have rendered the latter helpless and desperate."
"They have nothing more to lose, except for a president."
"Let us hope, as Mrs van Dijk said, that Suharto is indeed drawing certain conclusions."
"His totally undemocratically arranged re-election already heralded a period of absolute terror."
"The financial problems have got worse as well, and as a result of the political unrest and the way Suharto's troops acted, it seems to me that the IMF and the World Bank might have to review their ideas."
"The European Parliament, as usual, needs to make a clear appeal to the Indonesian leaders, and perhaps also to Suharto's successors, to democratize. The Council and the Commission must stop all aid, except for humanitarian aid."
"Likewise, the American government must do the same, with conviction."
"Clear action to deal with the crisis will have the most effect. We are dealing with a huge country, and I think we will be able to avoid huge problems if we act in this way."
"Madam President, in January this year I was part of the European Parliament's delegation which undertook a fact-finding visit to Malaysia."
"We were there at the height of the financial and stock market crises."
"We sympathized with the Malaysian authorities as they struggled with the consequences of these troubles which include the plight of the immigrant workers of which there are some 1 million out of a population of 22 million."
"Imagine our sorrow therefore to learn of the unacceptable repatriation of tens of thousands of mainly Indonesian foreign workers as a response to the economic crisis and to be acquainted with the deaths of eight Indonesians under detention at centres for illegal immigrants."
"We were further disillusioned to learn of the threat of imprisonment of Lim Guan Eng, whose father we met in his role as opposition leader, for the simple reason of his articulating public concern over the treatment of a celebrated rape case victim."
"It is a violation of the tenets of democratic freedom to deprive Lim Guan Eng of his seat in Parliament simply because of his mild criticism of the Malaysian government."
"It also appears discriminatory that the Prime Minister's daughter, Marina Mahathir, has not, on the other hand, been targeted by the authorities although she too has been a critic of the government from time to time."
"In passing, I would say that our delegation was very impressed by her and her foundation's work in combating the AIDS epidemic in Malaysia."
"In conclusion, it must be right to emphasize that sustainable trade, investment and economic development cannot be achieved in the absence of the development of democracy, the rule of law, civil society and human rights."
"We will always be ready to be friends with Malaysia to try to achieve these worthy ambitions and aims."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a regrettable fact that the economic and political situation in Indonesia is getting completely out of control."
"The Group of the European People's Party calls upon the Indonesian government to stop immediately the attacks by police and army units on peaceful demonstrators, and also to protect the country's Chinese minority from attacks by looters."
"A number of murders have already been committed among the Chinese community and it is the responsibility of the police to put a stop to this."
"I fear, however, that the situation in Indonesia will ultimately only be brought under control when the political rulers of Indonesia step down in favour of a truly democratic government - and this means all those at the top, not just the President."
"Let me conclude by appealing yet again to the Malaysian authorities, and to the Supreme Court, to respect the right of freedom of speech - and particularly that of the parliamentary delegates."
"We have confidence in that court - we only hope our confidence is justified."
"Tibet"
"Madam President, we are deeply affected by the fact that a continually growing number of Tibetan activists have decided to make the extreme choice of dying in a hunger strike."
"It must be realized that all of this is the result of the desperation of the Tibetan people after 40 years of Chinese occupation and non-violent struggle."
"They want the debate on Tibet to be resumed on the basis of Resolutions 59, 61 and 65; a special envoy to be appointed to investigate the situation in Tibet; and a referendum to be promoted by China under the aegis of the UN, to ascertain the will of the Tibetan people. I believe we must show our solidarity with the Tibetan people and request with some insistence that the question of Tibet is placed on the agenda of the next General Assembly of the United Nations as quickly as possible, and that the Tibetan militants' other requests should be met."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of Tibet is now in the news more than ever."
"The United Nations, as has been said, can and must adopt at least three measures: firstly, to resume discussions on Tibet on the basis of its own previous resolutions; secondly, to appoint a special envoy for that region; thirdly, to ask China to promote a referendum to ascertain the Tibetan people's right to self-determination."
"These things were and are being requested by all the people of Tibet, and in particular the six hunger strikers, who have been prevented by the Indian police from continuing their protest on a pretext."
"The second measure they request is particularly important: the appointment of a UN envoy, to which should be added the appointment of an EU representative for Tibet."
"The European Union cannot continue to be strong with the weak and weak with the strong."
"Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our Parliament cannot help but notice that its policy and proposals are systematically ignored by the Council and the Commission, with the exception of Commissioner Marín's positive collateral measures and initiatives."
"We have had no follow-up to our requests on the liberation of all political prisoners in Tibet, on the liberation of the Panchen Lama, on respect for human rights, on setting up a committee of inquiry, on the appointment of an EU high representative for Tibet, or on negotiations between Tibet and China."
"Unlike our American friends, we did not even achieve the liberation or, even better, the expulsion of certain famous dissidents such as Mr Wei Jingsheng or Mr Wang Dan."
"The European Union is not achieving anything and after long months, or even years, of requests from Parliament, we notice that there is a genuine obstruction of Parliament's requests on the part of Mr Brittan and several members of the Council, at least."
"I believe we could easily put into Mr Brittan's mouth the words of Churchill at the time of fascism in Italy, if we were to paraphrase them slightly."
"He said: ""If I were Italian today I would be fascist' ."
"Mr Brittan, like his famous colleague Churchill, could say: "" If I were Chinese today I would be communist, or national-fascist' , which is the same thing."
"Madam President, I understand the reasons for preparing this text and I agree on the whole with the proposals."
"However, I should like to point out that at the moment the troika is visiting Tibet for the first time, and will be there for some time."
"We think it would be better to wait until this visit is over, and ask the Council to report on its results, because I think that might add something to Parliament's position."
"Once that has been done, our group is ready to discuss the matter with the Council and prepare a resolution which takes all these elements into account, a global resolution proposing the main point again - the request by the Dalai Lama for direct negotiations, without conditions - and many of the points stated by those who have spoken before me."
"I think it is important to look at the conclusions reached by the troika on this visit, because it is the first time it has gone there."
"That is the first point."
"Naturally, our group agrees with the activists who are currently staging a dramatic hunger strike, and we state our commitment to bringing the question of Tibet to the forefront, with political discussion and a more complete resolution."
"I would also like to say something on the subsequent text which relates to the organizations."
"We think there is nothing to evaluate for our part."
"We also wish to remind the House that in a few weeks, Parliament's delegation will be visiting China."
"Perhaps it would be appropriate, rather than voting on a resolution on which we do not have definite information, to ask the delegation to raise this question and try to acquire information during its visit."
"Otherwise, I do not understand what these delegations are being sent to do."
"When it returns, if these points are confirmed, we shall form a resolution on this subject."
"That is the position of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Madam President, the two resolutions submitted to the European Parliament join the fifty or so adopted since 1994 which accuse China."
"No other country in the world receives such treatment."
"The Commission and the Member States are anxious to develop good relations with China, which does not exclude certain disagreements, notably on the issue of human rights."
"Unfortunately, the European Parliament, under pressure from some of its Members, goes against this trend. Sadly, the majority remain indifferent, as there are scarcely twenty of us present."
"The resolution on Tibet is based on events in India."
"As for the resolution on the sale of organs, it is the result of a campaign without proof, orchestrated in the United States and Germany."
"The encouragement of separatist tendencies which inspired the resolution on Tibet, notably with reference to a Tibetan government in exile, calls into question a basic international rule: respect of the territorial integrity of each country."
"It is a dangerous attitude which will not in any way help to improve the situation."
"Peace, like dialogue on human rights, implies mutual respect, particularly when it is a question of a country with over a billion inhabitants such as China."
"That is why I call upon my colleagues to reject these two resolutions about China."
"Sale of human organs in China"
"Madam President, arbitrary arrests, death sentences, executions, removal of organs, this is the terrifying scenario which must, with the utmost urgency, cease in China."
"Executions of prisoners are increasing all the time, with 2100 executions in 1995 according to Amnesty International."
"For fear of compromising its investments, the international community refrains from condemning these violations of basic human rights, or does so half-heartedly."
"We know that the prison system in China remains largely impenetrable today."
"Organs are removed from prisoners to then be sold and transplanted without the consent of the person concerned or his family."
"As the Union is incapable of taking steps in relation to these violations, the parliamentary delegation which is due to visit this country soon must use all its powers of persuasion to put an end to these despicable practices."
"In the meantime, the Commission must examine the possibility of establishing European legislation to deal with the trade in organs."
"We ask that the Commission and the Council take all the necessary measures at an international level to put an end to this vile trade."
"Madam President, since Mr Colajanni raised the question of the European Parliament delegation's visit to China, I would like to ask my colleagues how many weeks there are in a year."
"Well, there are 53."
"And when did our delegation go to China?"
"The week of the anniversary of Tiananmen."
"This is due to our secretariat, our delegation for relations with China."
"This is our Parliament, this is its way of following up our request, our denunciation of the violation of human rights, the denunciation we are making today of an abhorrent fact - it cannot be called anything else - which is affecting Tibet."
"This is the response to Tibet, Turkistan, Inner Mongolia and the fate of one billion, three hundred million Chinese people who - until proved otherwise - do not live in a democracy."
"It is time to stop saying that we shall wait for something."
"The Tibetans have been waiting for forty years and have had no response. The Chinese have been waiting for fifty years, since the Long March, and have not seen any progress in human rights."
"We can continue to complain about India, and its nuclear experiments."
"No-one is in favour of nuclear experiments, but, like France and England, which were faced with a Nazi regime in the 1930s, India - which is an imperfect democracy, no-one will deny that - is faced with the largest totalitarian empire in the world, and someone wants it to give up the possibility of defending itself!"
"I would appreciate it if we began to reason a little on this point."
"Madam President, I believe we are faced with two very serious facts, which are occurring in several parts of the world: firstly, the continued use of the death penalty as an inhuman method to deal with crimes; and secondly, the international traffic in organs."
"These are two facts which exist in several parts of the world, but which are concentrated in the same country when we talk about China."
"If anyone has any doubts about the existence of the death penalty in China - but how could it be denied? - clearly for that person within this House, China still represents a beacon of democracy and communism."
"The other important point is that commercialization, which is a feature throughout the world, is clearly also seen in China."
"The information is sufficiently valid to show that, in China, along with repression, there is traffic in human body parts - a traffic which is spreading throughout the world and which we have favoured even within our own countries, with patents on living organisms."
"Mr President, I hope you will not mistake me for Mr Falconer if I now say something about the roll call."
"But first let me just point out that Mr Avgerinos is not present."
"It is he who was entrusted with the work of reviewing matters of topical and urgent debate."
"I myself am always present for the urgencies, but I rarely see Mr Avgerinos."
"So it comes as no surprise to me that some of the ideas contained in his proposals are rather confusing."
"Now to the urgencies. When one looks at what is going on in China, when one hears what previous speakers have said about the alleged trade in human organs, when one reads the reports presented by various organizations, such as China Watch and the Fresenius company, then it is like being in some kind of horror film."
"Death sentences are being carried out to order and the condemned persons are being executed in such a way that certain organs remain unaffected, so that they can be turned into cash."
"The number of death sentences, the executions and the methods used are treated as state secrets."
"The new code of criminal procedure has been drawn up so that court procedures can be handled in such a way that the legal defence of the accused is impossible and something so basic as the presence of observers at court trials is totally out of the question."
"The European Parliament has always pleaded for people sentenced to death, and has always spoken out against the death penalty."
"Naturally we cannot remain silent about the gruesome consequences of these death-penalty decisions."
"We have to adopt a clear position here."
"I therefore believe that it is only natural for us to make minimum demands, for example that practices of this kind should be stopped."
"The United Nations which, so we are told, this year at long last is to investigate the slave trade - an action which I believe has been inspired by a resolution from this Parliament - should also set up an international committee of inquiry, and the Council and the Commission should do everything in their power at least to put a stop to the activities of those European firms involved."
"This is an issue which should certainly be addressed by our delegation during its forthcoming visit to China."
"Thank you very much. I would only like to say that Mr Avgerinos and I were invited yesterday to a meeting and on that occasion he ask me to excuse him."
"I think he has had some problems recently."
"Mr President, on the issue of the death penalty and its macabre exploitation in the Republic of China, we are now confronted by an extraordinary phase of routine horror."
"On this issue at least, we appeal to this House to abandon its tradition of not letting the facts stand in the way of political and economic convenience."
"The facts - not propaganda, which nowadays is going in the opposite direction - are overwhelming."
"They show that thousands of executed people in the People's Republic of China are exploited in a most cruel fashion to meet the growing demand for transplanted organs by rich individuals in Japan and in the West."
"Last month, we asked to no avail the diplomatic representatives of China in Brussels, Mr Huang Daosheng, Mr Wang Wen and Mr Wei Min, to provide us with documented evidence disproving such ongoing horror."
"We are still waiting!"
"For us, the moment to act is now."
"Or shall we conclude that in this House, to act in moral equilibrium means our most sacred values must never be tested?"
"Capital punishment in Burma"
"Mr President, in Burma, too, people are being executed."
"Last week six prisoners, whom Amnesty International clearly regards as political prisoners, were sentenced to death."
"Before that, 20 other prisoners who should also be considered as political prisoners died in prison."
"From all appearances, this is actually another form of death sentence, or execution, which is being implemented."
"Moreover, the Burmese army takes tough action against ethnic minorities and also executes people without any form of trial."
"We would like to urge the Burmese government to abolish the death penalty, and, in any case, to stop the executions, whether or not these follow a sentence."
"Individuals have a right to a fair trial, and political prisoners ought to be released."
"It is high time we in the European Union urged the business sector to stop investing in Burma and start withdrawing investments."
"Mr President, the military regime in Burma continues to persecute political opponents without restraint."
"At the end of April two students were sentenced to death."
"These two were part of a group of 40 people arrested in January because of opposition activities."
"The other 38 were given prison sentences from 3 to 14 years."
"Over the past few years, more than 20 people have died in prison."
"So we know what this may mean."
"Last week another 6 death sentences were passed."
"They were all Burmese citizens who are regarded as political prisoners by Amnesty International."
"That makes 8 death penalties and 38 heavy prison sentences in the space of a few months, with all the dangers which accompany prison sentences."
"It is a good thing Commissioner Marín is present here."
"In 1996 we abolished the preferential system for Burma after a series of exasperating acts of violence by the military regime."
"The United States, and also the US Congress, want to introduce an investment ban."
"In February we asked this House whether we should not be coming up with more measures, including an investment ban."
"Is it not high time we implemented this restriction on investments, together with the USA? We would thus force the military regime in Burma to respect democracy and human rights, and above all, to give Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, the elected president, who has been imprisoned at home for six years, the right to take up the seat she is entitled to, namely the presidency of her country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has considered the dramatic problem of the death penalty more than once."
"We have always been inflexible with the United States of America, and we are also inflexible with the Republic of China, even if it does not appear to please some people. We must be even more inflexible with Burma, if possible."
"There are many reasons: firstly, the lack of respect for the least guarantees in terms of court proceedings, which should by right be recognized in all countries; secondly, the nature of the crimes with which the condemned are charged, which are purely political and a matter of opinion; and thirdly, the systematic use of this instrument, not as a penalty, but as a pure and simple repression of dissent, so that the army is accuser, judge and executioner at the same time."
"The European Union must do everything necessary, useful and appropriate, including the strictest economic sanctions, to put an end to this intolerable situation."
"Mr President, I am going to reply en bloc to the various resolutions on the different questions raised by the honorable Members."
"As regards Guatemala, the Commission shares Parliament's sorrow and indignation over the assassination of Bishop Juan Gerardi, whom I had the opportunity to get to know personally, as did many of you, because as you know, the European Union has been heavily involved in Guatemala's pacification process and now, recently, in the peace process."
"This crime, like others linked to human rights, is a frontal attack on the peace process itself, and all the more so because of the symbolism of murdering Bishop Gerardi when he had just finished his report on the truth about the terrible civil war in that country during the last 30 years."
"At the moment, the European Union has already made the appropriate contributions in terms of political cooperation with that country, and it is obvious that we need to reconsider a lot of issues, in general terms. This would be a good opportunity because the new consultative committee which accompanies the peace process is meeting in June."
"Above all, we also need to invite the Guatemalan government, the political forces and public opinion to make an effort, so that the peace agreements can really take shape and develop. In some aspects, these peace agreements are experiencing a really worrying delay."
"So we are going to continue to point out to the Guatemalan government the need, firstly, to identify the perpetrators of the crime, and then to gradually regain the spirit of the peace agreements, so that such murders are not repeated."
"What can I say about Colombia and the Umaña, Arango and Fernando Landazábal murders?"
"I agree with the speakers' descriptions of human rights in Colombia, especially the speech by Mrs Miranda de Lage."
"Colombia's problem is very simple."
"At the moment, elections are just about to take place - on 26 May - and really serious things are happening in that country."
"Human rights in Colombia will have to come as a direct result of peace."
"If there is no peace, I very much fear that this situation of domestic disintegration will continue."
"So the first obligation of the next president - not to the international community but, above all, to the Colombian people themselves - is resolutely to seek for peace, so there can be an end to all the causes which are provoking this sort of atrocity."
"Because there are atrocities by the paramilitaries; there are atrocities by the guerillas; and there are atrocities - I believe - in a situation in which it is now very difficult to say who is responsible, resulting in that spirit of impunity which creates this sort of situation."
"In any case, as you know, the Colombian authorities have created a special committee as part of the public prosecutor's department, and it is going to investigate these murders."
"We shall wait and hear what conclusions it reaches."
"Meanwhile, what should we do?"
"At the moment, the most we can do - and we want to do it, and have said so, even on our own account, without waiting for the United Nations - is to maintain the human rights office in Bogotá, which is in charge of monitoring the situation. That does not fundamentally alter the domestic situation, but it is no small matter to maintain an office to monitor events there."
"And in order to do that, as you know, we have taken the decision to renew for another year the EU's participation in that office, which is run by the UN representative, Mrs Robinson. We were not obliged to do that, because our commitment was only for one year."
"On the other hand, something we shall have to see about in the future is how to increase our cooperation with Colombia in the judicial area."
"It is true that the Colombian authorities have already made that request, but it would be quite interesting to see how, in this aspect of judicial cooperation, we can gradually make progress in the future."
"But I repeat, whatever happens in the elections, no matter who wins the Colombian elections, the first priority is to seek peace, which will require major negotiations. From then on, the priority will be gradually to reduce the current tension in that country, which gives rise to the situations we have seen there recently, which are so hard to understand."
"As for Turkey, the Commission also condemns the attack on Mr Akin Birdal, the Turkish human rights activist. Obviously, like Parliament, the Commission also wants the perpetrators of this crime to be found quickly and brought to justice."
"As you know, the Prime Minister, Mr Yilmaz, the Deputy Prime Minister and many other ministers and MPs have also condemned this attack."
"Furthermore, the Commission shares the European Parliament's concern about the repercussions of the judgement against the mayor of Istanbul in connection with freedom of expression in Turkey."
"We are equally worried by the events of January, sparked off by the decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court to order the dissolution of the Prosperity Party, to which Mr Erdogan belonged."
"And the Commission is of course concerned that this sort of decision may have adverse effects on democratic pluralism and freedom of expression in Turkey."
"As for the more general aspects of our relations with that country, the Commission of course fully abides by the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council, which restated that the consolidation of Turkey's ties with the European Union also depends on that country continuing with the political reforms which have been started, especially to bring its human rights regulations and practices into line with those of the EU."
"And despite Ankara's decision, in principle, to end all political dialogue with the EU, the Commission intends to continue to inform its Turkish partners of the EU's concerns in this area."
"As for Malaysia, the South-East Asian economic crisis has grave social consequences for the people of the countries concerned, mainly unemployment and emigration."
"During the last few months, the Commission has been fully engaged in a constant dialogue with the beneficiaries and other donors on how to increase our support for the region."
"At the moment, following the ASEM conference in London, we are reconsidering, within the Commission, our cooperation programmes with that area and that country, in order to target additional funds on the most severely affected countries."
"As regards the conviction of the MP Lim Guan Eng, the Commission's delegation to Malaysia will follow this case closely, along with the appeal which has just been lodged with the Federal Court."
"And as for the situation in the overflowing Malaysian detention camps, the Commission again shares Members' concerns about the reports of bad treatment and human rights violations."
"So I can assure you we are making sure that these concerns - about the refugee camps - are passed on to the Malaysian authorities, and we are going to urge the government to continue to cooperate with the High Commissioner for Refugees and the various non-governmental organizations in helping the refugees."
"Turning now to Indonesia, we are of course also worried and concerned about that country's current situation and the use of violence by the security forces to repress the latest demonstrations which, as you know, has already caused the death of a number of students in Jakarta."
"The Commission is still in contact with the government on the question of human rights. At last, we have managed to arrange for a jointly funded human rights seminar to be held in Jakarta in June, organized by the current presidency of the Council of Ministers and the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission."
"This will be the first open debate to be held on human rights in Indonesia with the joint participation of the European Union and the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission."
"It is only one step, but it is an important step."
"As for direct aid to the Indonesian people, because of the economic situation, there has already been an on-the-spot mission to assess the true situation."
"The first assessment which has been made - by this team working on the question - is that there is often a difference between what the media depict and what is revealed by in-depth study."
"Despite the images we have seen of people crowding round lorries to collect rice or other essential foodstuffs, in fact there is no general shortage of food."
"There are some localized areas suffering shortages of food and drinking water, and a lack of logistics and distribution, especially in the most vulnerable parts of the country, and affecting the most vulnerable sections of the population."
"We are already starting work there as regards emergency aid. But I repeat, in principle the situation does not seem to be as dramatic as suggested by the images we have seen."
"Turning now to Tibet, the subject of that country is raised regularly, and the religious dimension of the Tibetan identity forms a constant part of human rights talks with China, and will continue to do so."
"The Commission is going to evaluate carefully the results of the recent troika visit by EU ambassadors to Tibet, and will of course inform Parliament as soon as possible."
"As for the sale of organs in China, I shall first give the background."
"There is specific dialogue on human rights between the EU and China, which began in 1997."
"That dialogue has helped to achieve some concrete results, especially as regards China's participation in the UN human rights instruments."
"The question of the death penalty, and particularly the legal and administrative conditions governing executions, has been addressed in the context of this dialogue, and will continue to be raised in the future."
"As regards the trafficking in human organs reported by the international media, the Commission will raise this problem with the Chinese authorities within the context of the human rights dialogue, on the basis of a detailed analysis of the facts."
"Nevertheless, although this certainly does not mean we are not worried about it, the Commission would remind you that intervening in such matters is the responsibility of the Member States since, as you know, Article 129 of the Treaty does not confer legislative powers upon the European Community in this area."
"Nevertheless, I repeat that although the Commission does not have the institutional competence, we are closely following the work of the competent international organizations: the Council of Europe is working on this, at European level, and supports cooperation between the Member States on this point."
"As you know, the European group on ethics, science and new technologies - which has replaced the group on the ethical implications of biotechnology - will issue a statement in 1998 on the ethical aspects of human tissue banks."
"Lastly, once the Treaty of Amsterdam has been ratified, the Commission will be able to study the possibilities for work in this field - that is, as regards the regulations which should be adopted in relation to the distribution or transfer of organs."
"Perhaps that would be the right time to raise the problem generally, to consider not just the illegal circulation or transfer of organs from China - assuming the existence of such trade is confirmed - but also its occurrence in any other country."
"As for Burma, you know that we in the Commission have always deplored the widespread human rights violations in that country, and we are aware of the recent death sentences passed against six prisoners."
"Nevertheless, we think there is reason to be hopeful about these death sentences, insofar as no death sentence has been carried out in 1998."
"Let us hope the military junta continues along these lines, and at least does not decide to execute these six prisoners."
"As for the possibility of an investment ban, as suggested by Mrs Maij-Weggen, the European Union is not able to forbid private investment on the part of European companies. Apart from the moral and ethical judgements each one of us can form for ourselves, there is no instrument at the moment to allow us to act at that level."
"In any case, you know the state of our relations with Burma. There are no relations."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0502/98 by Mr Macartney and Mr Hory, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the arms export code of conduct; -B4-0505/98 by Ms McKenna and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the European code of conduct for arms exports; -B4-0520/98 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the PPE Group, on a code of conduct for arms exports; -B4-0522/98 by Mr Bertens and Mr Frischenschlager, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on a code of conduct for arms exports; -B4-0529/98 by Mrs González Álvarez and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on a code of conduct for arms exports; -B4-0546/98 by Mr Titley and Mr Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group, on an EU code of conduct on arms exports."
"Mr President, often in these so-called urgencies we are dealing with things which one might argue are not urgent."
"However, here we have a chance to put our point of view and make a decisive contribution to an urgent decision which will be taken in ten days' time when the General Affairs Council of the European Union will be asked to endorse a Franco-British initiative to have a proper code of conduct for the exportation of armaments."
"It is hard to imagine anything that is more important for the long-term future of a world which is beset by strife of all kinds."
"European weapons are responsible for the killing and maiming of many people."
"So we have to ask the Council to endorse that initiative and to extend it to all Member States, not just the two Member States which are proposing it."
"Equally, we have to say that the European Union cannot solve all these problems itself, and we have to look to support from the United States, Russia and China."
"It is far from being a futile gesture for us to put forward a European code of conduct."
"On the contrary, this is something where the European Union can lead the world."
"Mr President, at the beginning of the British Presidency Tony Blair was making great play of the fact that Great Britain was going to take action on a code of conduct on arms exports, and we, the Green Group in the European Parliament, welcomed this warmly."
"At last an initiative was to be taken at European level."
"When Belgium drew up its arms export act in 1991, the perennial argument on the part of Belgium for not going the whole hog was that this issue should be regulated at European level, otherwise Belgium would be at a relative disadvantage."
"So there was genuine hope that Europe would grasp this opportunity."
"Unfortunately, we have to conclude that the proposals which have so far been developed by the British Presidency in conjunction with France are frankly a disappointment."
"During the ACP meeting in Mauritius on 20 to 23 April we saw that a majority of both the Europeans and the ACP representatives also raised this issue."
"They clearly complained that the code in its present form will have no impact on the unstable regions, on countries which spend an excessive part of their budget on defence, and even on the countries which violate human rights."
"Also, the fact that the draft does not expressly include the sale of light weapons in the regulation - those light weapons which are wreaking such havoc in Africa - is the cause of much regret."
"On a procedural level there are also a great many snags, as a Member State which refuses an export licence must inform the others, but the length of time allowed for this is not defined."
"There is no common certificate of end use, so the multiplicity of certificates, which has always led to chaos, will continue to exist. The problem of arms manufacturers from third countries operating with a licence from a Member State company has not been considered at all."
"As far as we are concerned, we are calling very urgently indeed for this code to be made binding and meaningful after all."
"Mr President, when we learned of the Franco-British initiative for a code on the arms trade, we got the impression that we should be on our guard more than usual."
"I think Parliament's resolution indicates clearly that we are indeed prepared to be on our guard, and to strengthen this Franco-British initiative where possible."
"It is unacceptable, of course, that when some countries are behaving properly with regard to arms exports, in particular when they are desisting from exporting arms, others fill the gap."
"Then the outcome is zero, morally speaking."
"There is a great need to combat this cynicism."
"Earning money from misery is a serious business which Parliament must take a stance against. It is very good that this Parliament is firmly unanimous about this resolution, so that the Council knows, and others also know, that the representatives of the European citizens have no doubt about what should happen on that front."
"Hitherto the actions have always been very weak, for example against Serbia, which already manufactures excessive numbers of weapons itself."
"A ban on arms exports to Serbia is in fact one of those useless hollow gestures."
"It is much better to take a general line, with criteria which must be employed, including under those circumstances which make it economically less attractive to behave decently."
"Mr President, this sort of proposal often tends to be symbolic in nature, and that is why I am underlining that one of the last parts of the proposal talks about the need to combat illegal arms exports."
"It is all very well for us to organize everything by law, but if we do not ensure that the illegal export of arms is genuinely combated in an effective way, then we still do not achieve our objective."
"That is why I think it is good that this resolution concludes with that point."
"Mr President, the three previous speakers have already partly articulated what I wanted to say."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is disappointed about the outcome in practice."
"The Member States do not have to accept this as binding."
"It remains a political declaration of no value. There are no sanctions."
"They are merely obliged to inform each other."
"What are we gaining?"
"We are not gaining anything."
"This Parliament must make it clear here and now that this is not nearly enough."
"The present proposal does not deserve to be called ethical politics, as the British Presidency still referred to it at the beginning of the year."
"The scandal surrounding Sierra Leone and the American refusal - would you believe - to supply arms to the United Kingdom because of poor export controls, should send clear signals to Europe, as well as to the British, for that matter."
"Let us start putting some real effort into strict and binding European regulations on the arms trade."
"That is why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is pleased that this resolution adopts a clear position, and asks the Council to remove the weaknesses in the proposals."
"Transparency, Mr President, and multilateral consultation between all Member States are essential ingredients for a common policy."
"Any concession on this front to the so-called sovereignty of the Member States makes a laughing stock of the European rules."
"I therefore call on the Commission, as well as the forthcoming Austrian presidency, to continue the work of the British in case we end this presidency with a weak compromise."
"The Commission obviously also has a job to do in this."
"We are all awaiting with great interest what the Commission will do."
"In conclusion, I hope the G8 will conclude international agreements during its next meeting, and I definitely also hope that the EU Member States who will be present will support the proposals for adopting the OAS code."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to welcome the initiative by the British Presidency to establish a new code of conduct for the arms trade."
"There is no doubt that the code of conduct governing the sale of arms, so that weapons from the EU are not used for internal repression or external aggression, is long overdue."
"It is important in terms not only of enhancing human rights outside the Union but also of giving European defence companies a level and fair playing field in the sphere of arms exports."
"Undercutting, when one country's defence sector steps in to supply arms refused by another Member State, must become a thing of the past."
"The latest draft of the code, in addition to defining circumstances of internal repression or external aggression, which would trigger denial of exports, states that consideration would be given to whether 'the proposed export would seriously undermine the economic and social development of the recipient country' ."
"Furthermore, Member States would reserve the right to operate more restrictive national export policies while working to adopt the common list of military equipment covered by the code."
"It is, however, to be hoped that the envisaged annual reports to the Council will be used as a basis for discussion and scrutiny in the European Parliament."
"Further work needs to be done on countering the illegal export of arms."
"Arms brokers and end use will require close monitoring."
"The next step will be to extend the principles of the code to countries like Russia, China and the United States."
"Nevertheless, the fact that we are on the verge of agreeing a historic code of conduct on arms exports, which I hope will be agreed on 25 May, is a hopeful sign for all those seeking a safer world."
"Mr President, everyone in this House, with the exception of Mr Truscott, now understands that the British Presidency's solemn announcement of a code of conduct for arms exports is nothing but a carte-blanche for the arms industry."
"What all this is about is not the avoidance and prevention of arms exports, but the improvement of European arms cooperation, and especially an improvement in the position of the UK arms industry within this framework of cooperation."
"Even the focus of the British Presidency - namely the implementation of a policy for the protection of international human rights - breaks down when it comes to the protection of arms exports."
"The proposed code still permits exports to Turkey and even allows the UK government to send weapons to Indonesia and Sierra Leone, in spite of the embargo."
"In view of this new situation, the German Bundestag is currently deciding about easing national regulations on arms exports in order to improve Germany's position as an arms trader."
"The UK presidency has misled all those who have been pleading for an effective control of arms exports."
"We therefore call on the Commission to submit a draft proposal containing clear demands which are in line with those often expressed in this House and repeatedly voiced by the NGOs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few years there have been repeated calls both inside and outside the European Union for greater transparency in conventional arms exports."
"The EU has taken the initiative in this respect in establishing common rules, in the form of a code of conduct on the transfer of conventional arms."
"This draft code of conduct aims to establish a set of principles upon which to base all arms export decisions, and to provide a well-defined framework for action, as a context for discussions of each case of arms transfer."
"The draft code of conduct also establishes the criteria for use in evaluating all arms exports."
"Nevertheless, it must be made clear that the final responsibility for arms exports rests with the national governments."
"The European Union has a great interest in seeing these principles widely accepted, including by the world's leading arms exporters."
"And having an agreement which covers the whole of the EU and has a consistent internal approach is important when it comes to putting pressure on third parties to adopt similar practices."
"Progress has been made in drafting the code, especially in relation to the appropriate legal instruments for its adoption, and the future elaboration of eight criteria."
"We do not deny that serious obstacles remain, and the presidency has offered the possibility of holding other limited consultations between governments during the next few days, after which a report will be presented to the Council - on 25 or 26 May - assessing the situation, and I should imagine a series of compromise solutions will be presented by the presidency."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"Doñana National Park -B4-0492/98 by Mr Eisma, Mr Gasóliba i Böhm and Mr Vallvé, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the Doñana ecological disaster; -B4-0508/98 by Mrs Roth and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the severe toxic spill disaster in Doñana National Park, Spain; -B4-0521/98 by Mr Valverde López and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the environmental disaster affecting the Doñana National Park caused by the collapse of a dam for channelling mud from the Aznalcollar mines (Seville); -B4-0531/98 by Mrs González Álvarez and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Doñana environmental disaster; -B4-0548/98 by Mr Aparicio Sánchez and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the toxic spills near Doñana with serious economic and social consequences;"
"Italy -B4-0497/98 by Mr Bianco and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the hydrogeological disaster in the Italian provinces of Salerno, Avellino and Caserta; -B4-0530/98 by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the floods in Campania (Italy); -B4-0535/98 by Mr Fassa, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the tragedy in the Campania region of Italy; -B4-0549/98 by Mr Colajanni and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on floods in Campania; -B4-0551/98 by Mr Azzolini and others, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the flooding of 5 May 1998 in Campania (Italy); -B4-0559/98 by Mr Tamino and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the flooding in Campania (Italy)."
"Doñana National Park"
"Mr President, in my capacity as president of a Spanish national park - Aigüestortes y Estany de Sant Maurici - I can only lament the disaster which has happened, or which may happen, in a large part of the Doñana National Park, which is the biggest and most important national park in Europe and has been declared a World Heritage Site."
"Faced with this situation, I think the first thing to emphasize is the need for coordination in that region between all the authorities concerned, including those with responsibility for industry and mines - the precise cause of the catastrophe was the storage of waste water from mineral purification - as well as those directly responsible for the protection of the nature reserve."
"I think we must also mention the need to increase our solidarity with all the people concerned, who have suffered harm on account of the polluted water which has flooded the zone."
"In that sense I think that in future this sort of situation should be anticipated, and there should be no storage of dangerous substances which can damage wildlife areas such as Doñana."
"Mr President, once again an inconceivable environmental disaster has occurred, this time in a valuable and sensitive area of southern Spain, in Andalusia."
"The Doñana National Park, which was designated one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites, is now severely damaged."
"Large areas were flooded with over 5 million cubic metres of contaminated hazardous waste water from mining operations when a retaining dam burst."
"Over 2000 hectares of cultivated land has also been destroyed."
"The fact that it is a Swedish company that is operating the mine in Andalusia is distressing, but at the same time it is also a challenge."
"Green politicians from Sweden took part last Sunday in a large demonstration in Andalusia with over 10 000 participants."
"The demonstration was arranged by environmental and peace organizations."
"Together with the Greens in Andalusia, the Swedish environmental party demanded that the Boliden company should accept the economic and legal responsibility, compensate the victims and finance the remediation and regeneration of the area."
"However, it is not only Boliden that is responsible."
"In fact, many parties are involved in this incident, which is one of Europe's worst environmental disasters."
"In 1996 a local organization obtained a report smuggled out by a sacked technician about the problem with the dams."
"On 27 February 1996 the company was reported to the Commission, which decided, however, that there was no risk."
"The entire investigation was abandoned after having only heard from the local environmental authorities."
"Boliden had added to the dam without permission."
"Cracks had also been found in the dam, which were reported, but nothing was done."
"Now we must accept collective responsibility!"
"The Commission must take action and support the affected parties."
"Mr President, first of all I want to express my solidarity with the victims of the floods in Italy and add my support to that shown by all the political groups in drafting this resolution about the Doñana National Park."
"It is important for the European Commission to find the means to grant urgent aid, and to work in close collaboration with the Spanish government and the Andalusian regional government in order to reprogramme the structural and cohesion funds to support the plan being prepared to decontaminate, restore and strengthen environmental protection in the area around Doñana."
"And I think it is time to follow the advice of the committee of scientists which has been appointed and remove the toxic sludge as fast as possible, to prevent the irreversible spread of the pollution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as my colleague Carmen Díez de Rivera Icaza said at the start of this part-session, and as José Luis Valverde has just said, we deeply deplore what has happened in Italy because human life is the most valuable thing of all. There can be no doubt about that."
"But Carmen Díez de Rivera Icaza asked for attention to be paid to the Doñana catastrophe, and it is quite right that we should do so."
"We state here and now that we are going to vote in favour of the joint resolution, because it refers to Community law, shows solidarity with the people affected, requests expert assistance and financial aid from the European Union, and suggests that all the authorities should unite so as to be able to tackle the problem."
"Well, we are presenting three amendments, together with our colleagues from the Green Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party - Mrs Carmen Díez de Rivera Icaza and Mr Collins, the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"These amendments address aspects not covered in the joint resolution, and we thought it would be appropriate to include them."
"I am going to defend them even though I do not have much time."
"Firstly, environmental protection groups should be included in the committee of local authorities, experts and so on, because they have years of experience of protecting Doñana against dangers, and they know a lot about the reserve."
"Secondly, a committee should be set up to investigate and clarify responsibilities. Nobody is answerable here, but we can see a few people who should be."
"We think the Hydrographical Confederation has a responsibility."
"They say in the press today, in a study, that the aquifers which feed Doñana are at serious risk. We think the regional government of Andalusia has a responsibility, and the Spanish government."
"And in the third amendment, we also think the European Commission has a responsibility."
"The European Commission requested information from the Spanish government, trusted what they told them, and archived the complaint. So the European Commission also has a certain responsibility for what is happening in Doñana."
"I shall conclude by saying that we shall probably learn something from this catastrophe: that it costs far more to restore what has been destroyed than it would have cost to take preventative measures."
"And of course, the mining company had the greatest obligation to take such measures."
"Mr President, the Commission should put all its effort into helping both to correct a situation which still today continues to threaten the Doñana National Park - which is one of the most outstanding jewels of the ecological heritage of the whole Union - and to prevent similar disasters from happening in the future."
"In reaching a decision on this joint resolution which I have the honour of proposing on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Parliament should be aware of three things."
"Firstly, the bursting of the dam owned by the Boliden company near Doñana and the resulting spillage of toxic sludge is such a serious matter and poses such a threat that the Commission should not just implement its maximum financial and technical assistance, but should also ensure that such assistance is not discontinued as soon as the danger to the reserve is over, but should extend it in the medium term until the affected sectors have fully recovered in economic terms."
"Secondly, so far there has been no damage within the reserve, and the damage caused to the ecosystem is not yet irreparable."
"Thirdly, it is nevertheless extremely urgent that the leaked toxic matter be removed, because every day that passes without such removal being achieved represents an extremely high and growing risk."
"Mr President, the Spanish administrations are collaborating mutually to solve the problem, and are counting on dependable scientific advice to help them, but it is enormously important for the Commission's support - which the Commissioner has already announced in Spain - to be emphasized and extended along the lines suggested in our proposed resolution."
"Italy"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that the tragedy which took place on 5 May, when a mud slide destroyed several communities and produced hundreds of victims and thousands of evacuees, will be taken as a warning that a new land policy should be implemented, not only in Italy but also on a European level."
"I hope the Structural Funds can be used to restore and relaunch these communities. However, I can tell you that my greatest wish is for the European Union and the Commission to implement an adequate policy throughout Europe - where these tragedies have occurred, such as Doñana which we have just discussed - in order to avoid these disasters, which cause so may victims."
"Mr President, 145 dead and 135 missing: these are the first totals, which are increasing daily to give an even more tragic number."
"It is certainly not the task of this Parliament to establish what was immediately responsible for losses which have affected three Italian provinces: disorganization of emergency services; inadequate means; criminal behaviour on the part of the local and state administrations."
"That is a matter for the Italian judiciary."
"The European Parliament has the larger, more demanding task of mobilizing Community resources and technology in a preventive plan of hydrogeological restoration in a territory which for a quarter of a century has been devastated by abuse, corruption, and environmental neglect."
"But this is not only a tragic problem for Italy."
"As shown by the recent environmental disaster in Spain, other countries within the Community are exposed to similarly severe disasters caused solely by an insane and criminal exploitation of the land."
"The alarm for an Italian region should become the alarm for the whole of Europe. The institutions of this Europe, over and above their triumphalist self-praise for the single currency, must now - not tomorrow - defend the most basic rights of its people, who are threatened by a desire for profit and the theft of the environment."
"Mr President, I have come to this House today to express profound grief and remember the very serious disaster which affected not only the Italian community but also the European community."
"The natural events which recently affected the Campania region were certainly exceptional, but at the same time we cannot say with any certainty that they were unforeseeable."
"For many years, the local authorities had been told that the areas struck by the disaster we are remembering today were in complete hydrogeological disorder. The authorities themselves denounced the situation."
"The first is that people are looking immediately for political responsibilities, rather than legal responsibilities - which sometimes appeared instrumental - rather than being led by a real desire to shed light on the facts. Secondly, people are attempting to use the tragedy in Campania as a pretext for satisfying national party political interests, which risk having little to do with a real reorganization of land management responsibilities."
"I have said several times that the problem of southern Italy is not so much a national question as a matter for the entire European Union."
"The Commission must therefore take into consideration the possibility of allocating Community resources to the financing of programmes, both to reconstruct and to relaunch the productive activities of the area."
"But at the same time we cannot forget that Italy, which has recently entered the single currency with great emphasis - as stated by Mr Manisco - must show that it knows it truly merits the aid which, I am certain, will be given by the European Union."
"Mr President, the terrible extent of the tragedy in Campania has already been discussed: 150 dead, 150 missing - it is difficult to imagine that there will be any more survivors - four communities damaged and in confusion, two provinces - Avellino and Salerno - seriously affected, and destruction of the land."
"It is clear that responsibilities exist, and that they will be investigated."
"Now is the time, first of all, for grief - which the European Parliament has already expressed at the opening of the sitting. Soon afterwards comes the time for solidarity - concrete solidarity."
"I would like to emphasize this last point, because I was very pleased with what Commissioner Monti said, on the first day of Parliament's current part-session, when he stated the possibility of concrete intervention."
"This is the point I would like to emphasize, and on which I would like a response from Commissioner Marín - the possibility of using regional funds not used for their original purpose."
"Can we have a decision from the Commission?"
"Naturally, precise purposes must be established, and controls, as well as extremely clear agreement between the national, regional and community authorities, in the hope for clear management which is not excessively bureaucratic."
"This would of course represent the concrete solidarity of Europe with those areas which have suffered the disaster we are remembering here."
"We must try to provide this, and contribute to the rebirth of these very beautiful areas which have been so unfortunate in suffering the events which have occurred there over so many years."
"Mr President, after listening to my colleagues from Campania who spoke before me, I think it is only right not to repeat the same observations and considerations, which occur naturally to anyone who, like them and like myself, has been to those places and comes from there, and has lived with those people through their drama of despair, profound grief, and great human dignity."
"Anyone who saw it on television - and a great many people did see it, not only nationally but throughout Europe - could see great despair in the eyes of those people, but also great dignity. That is perhaps what most struck the journalists, who have become used to grief and profound sorrow."
"Now we have to respond to that dignity, because it is difficult now to give answers to the dead."
"We must answer the survivors, who need an answer, but I use a euphemism, because it would have been better for the Italian state, and the whole of the Community, to give an answer early enough, rather than have to count the missing as dead and the deceased as victims."
"My point is along the lines of what Mr De Giovanni said a moment ago, which is to help these people understand what help can be given to relaunch the economy of the area."
"I shall give one example. In Sarno, a hospital has been destroyed which is not only a central point for the health of the area, but a part of the economy, where 400 people live and work."
"This means that the area's economy will be repressed, if it is not immediately relaunched."
"With the availability expressed by Commissioner Monti, we should remodel the resources and structural funds which, like Objective 1, have more often been shown to be lacking in terms of cost capacity rather than planning."
"We need to help the region, the land and the local bodies to reprogramme these resources, using a simple procedure, which allows immediate and optimum use of investments, Obviously the affected parties would not be compensated in the immediate future, but a significant programme would be provided, to remove the anguish of tomorrow and provide more certainty and hope for the area, and a social aspect, which we must all be happy with when it is implemented."
"On behalf of my group and my colleagues in Campania, I am requesting commitment, which can be translated into realities rather than verbal solidarity."
"Mr President, we are certainly all deeply affected and wish to express our grief for the families of the victims, because there are nearly 300 people dead and missing, very many injured and thousands evacuated."
"But with this natural disaster as with others, it has to be said that bad luck has nothing to do with it. This tragedy is the result of human and political action, which caused the hydrogeological problem in Italy, which means that today small normal natural events can cause disasters."
"We are therefore faced with the situation that we must have a serious prevention policy to prevent similar natural events."
"For this reason we must ask the Italian authorities to provide stable and conclusive information, firstly as regards the persons evacuated. As soon as possible afterwards, however, we need information on preventive action, with an updated map of the risks in all the hydrogeologically compromised regions in Italy."
"Above all, we ask the government to complete the necessary reorganization of land management responsibilities. For this reason we also ask the Commission to examine the possibility of using Community funds, together with the national and regional funds, to deal with these problems."
"Mr President, I believe that the very serious tragedy which took place in Campania must be seen as a warning and an alarm signal for the European institutions and all Member States governments."
"It should be seen as a warning because I think it is now a matter of urgency to define Community instruments of civil protection which can intervene with the speed which unfortunately our country cannot provide on its own."
"On this point I agree with the call made by Mr De Giovanni, and I ask the Commission to respond."
"There is a tragic emergency in Campania; there is a request to use funds; these funds are needed to bring life back to a region of the European Union."
"I believe bureaucracy should be overcome, and we should try to resolve this problem."
"Another reason why it is an alarm signal is that what happened in Italy has made it clear that without a serious land protection policy - with, on the contrary, ruinous work being done on the land - the perfect conditions are being created for these tragedies to occur."
"I call upon the Commission to act as an intermediary, so that it can quickly do what has not been done in many of the EU Member States: to get to know the dangers in an affected territory, and monitor them properly, so that more tragedies do not occur on the scale of the one affecting my country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to a bureaucratic misunderstanding our group has not presented a resolution on this subject, but obviously we are happy with the arrangement upon which we shall shortly be voting. I think it is important to state not only our solidarity but also the need for these questions - which will undoubtedly become more frequent in the common European fabric which we are trying to build - to be dealt with on a European level."
"From this point of view, I believe there are two possibilities. Either our demonstrations become pure ritual, as is often the case, or the European Union must really show not just solidarity, but that in some fields - in particular in land management in Europe - it can draw up a policy to deal with the situation."
"In recent years we have destroyed the budget line which dealt with disasters and provided an immediate and concrete contribution in unfortunate cases such as this."
"I think these disasters must make us reflect in the short term, so that we can activate instruments which show the citizens that Europe is not an abstract entity, but can deal with these requests and needs. However, we also need to think about the medium and long term, so that we can implement concrete planning operations, for example in relation to defence and rigorous management of the land."
"It would also be useful sometimes for Member States to be able to resort to measures on a European level."
"Mr President, once again we are called upon to weep for the victims of natural disasters."
"In the case of the recent floods which hit some areas of Campania, the emotion is even greater because of the high number of victims and the fact that they included several babies and children."
"The National Alliance delegation supports the contents of the joint resolution and joins in the grief for the families of the victims. However, we can already imagine what the Commissioner will reply in response to the request for aid from the Commission: that there is no EU budget line for immediate and visible aid to affected populations."
"The National Alliance therefore hopes that in the next EU budget, which is already at an advanced stage, this line will be inserted."
"Furthermore, while deploring the fact that the joint resolution is incomplete - if our Italian colleagues in the other groups had had the sensitivity to consult us informally, we would have raised this point - we ask that the government and the region of Campania be allowed to transfer a part of that region's Structural Funds, for use in the reconstruction and restoration of the land."
"Unfortunately Italy's land is violated to a great extent by building speculation and regulatory plans at district, provincial and regional level, drawn up in many cases for the benefit of clients and parties."
"Also, hill and mountain areas are gradually being abandoned, because people find it impossible to live there. This is partly because there are not enough government programmes to support them, and because they are lured to anonymous urban peripheries by commercial strategies, sometimes shown to be based on false appeals, which promote the idea that city life is infinitely better than living in the country."
"To conclude, Mr President, how can anybody fail to see, in this violence and lack of attention to the land, a typical sign of our civilisation which has desecrated everything, and where everything tends to be seen in rational and scientific terms?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by addressing the resolution on the floods in Campania, in view of the fact that, compared with the other ecological disaster, there were human victims here, which we greatly regret of course. The Commission would like to express its most sincere condolences to the families of the people concerned."
"Having said that, I must now go on to explain exactly what can be done in the two cases."
"Firstly, for quite unconnected reasons, the fact is that in last year's budgetary debate it was decided to stop the budgetary line concerned specifically with urgent aid in cases of catastrophe."
"So that is the situation, and unless you decide to reinstate that budgetary line, as things stand at the moment it is not possible to act by means of the urgency procedure."
"Secondly, it is possible to act through the structural policies procedure."
"And in this case, as far as the region of Campania is concerned, I have to tell you that the Commission has in fact been discussing what can be done in that area, which fully meets the Structural Fund Objective 1 requirements."
"So the affected areas can benefit from the rehabilitation measures provided for in the multifund operative programme of the European Regional Development Fund."
"Furthermore, the guidance section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund can also help, with measures to promote rural development and combat the abandonment of farm land, and to address reforestation."
"Lastly, it is also possible that the Social Fund may be able to fund work-related training activities, especially in the field of prevention."
"As for the Doñana National Park, I want to say that at the moment the Commission is of course receiving information from the Spanish and regional authorities, in accordance with their areas of competence."
"In that respect, the first official meeting took place recently, in New York, between my colleague Commissioner Bjerregaard and the Spanish minister, Mrs Tocino, during the meeting on sustainable development."
"As to what can be done, my answer to you is that in fact the area around the Doñana National Park which has been affected by the disaster is also included in Objective 1 of the ERDF."
"However, you have to bear in mind - and we would like to make this point very clear in the case of Campania and of Doñana - that, because of the lack of a budgetary line for natural catastrophes, there may be a temptation to use the ERDF every time a catastrophe occurs, but the regulations do not make provision for urgency aid to be provided from this source."
"I want to make that clear."
"Nevertheless, it is possible, as Mr Valverde López said, to carry out an immediate reprogramming exercise so as to give priority to the disasters caused in the area around the Doñana National Park."
"It is possible to do that, and in fact the Commission is already in contact with the Spanish authorities and the regional Andalusian authorities with a view to carrying out this exercise, and letters were exchanged on the subject last week."
"So it will be possible to provide an answer to this situation too."
"As regards one of the amendments defended by Mrs Laura González Álvarez, my comment is this. The complaints system is always a contradictory procedure, not just in the case of Doñana or Campania."
"So in the case of Doñana, just as with any other complaint lodged under Community procedure, the Commission can never archive it unilaterally."
"It is always done by means of a contradictory procedure."
"What you said is right: a complaint was lodged by the organization you mentioned."
"The Commission conveyed that complaint to the Spanish government, and the Spanish government replied on 31 January 1997, describing the measures it had taken."
"The Commission conveyed the Spanish government's reply to the complainant, who accepted the explanation."
"Before the complaint was archived, on 25 March 1997, the complainant you mentioned still had two months, according to Community procedure, to reopen the case."
"They did not request to reopen the case."
"I am telling you this for your own information, and to point out that, in Community procedure, no complaint can be archived without there having been a contradictory procedure, as is quite right."
"The joint debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Votes (continuation)"
"Mr President, I only seek information: can you advise me whether, under the Rules concerning the 50 % voting, the roll calls for urgencies and the roll calls for the Pex report count towards that 50 %?"
"Yes."
"That concludes voting time."
"The Pex report on the European Union's communication policy announces with a surprisingly clear conscience that this policy aims to ""awaken European citizens to the cause of European integration' (recital A), that its effectiveness constitutes the ""conditio sine qua non for obtaining the support of most European citizens for the integration process' (recital B) and that it is necessary to step it up "" in view of the great events approaching the EU in the coming months' (recital C)."
"For our part, we see in this all the foundations not only of a reasonable information policy, but also of propaganda campaigns aimed at convincing the citizens that there are no options other than those defined for them by the Eurocrats."
"In our amendments to this report, which have been rejected by the European Parliament, we asked that a code of good conduct finally be drawn up to define, for purposes of information, the principles of transparency, neutrality and respect for pluralism and partnership."
"This code should consist of four sections."
"Firstly, European information campaigns must not interfere with national electoral campaigns."
"No information campaign funded by the Union or by bodies which it subsidizes should be able to be organized in a Member State during the six months preceding referenda or legislative European or presidential elections."
"Secondly, information campaigns must not involve the unilateral development of a particular opinion on a subject which is not supported unanimously."
"They must allow the expression of all opinions which reflect the political trends represented in the European Parliament."
"The institutions of the Union, their administrations, their offices and officials should, in exercising their duties, always provide neutral and objective information."
"They must not in any circumstances become involved in a national debate, either directly or indirectly."
"Finally, a committee on ethics, made up of representatives of all political groups in the European Parliament and representatives of the national parliaments, should give a prior opinion on European information campaigns."
"It should, in particular, peruse electronic information, radio communications and television advertisements before they are broadcast."
"Thirdly, information campaigns must be conducted in close association with all the partners."
"No campaign should be launched within the territory of a Member State without the prior agreement of the authorities of that state, and those authorities should be involved in it."
"No public meeting related to an EU information campaign should take place in a state without inviting elected representatives of all political leanings to participate in it."
"Papers, periodicals and documents of all types published by the European institutions, or by the bodies linked to them by contract, must, where they mention certain opinions, be fair in terms of the space given to the different theories represented within the European Parliament."
"Fourthly, information campaigns must adhere to the rule of financial transparency."
"At the end of each year the European institutions must publish the following, in separate documents made available to the public at no cost: an exhaustive list of the information campaigns which have been carried out, including their references and costs; an exhaustive list of the organizations which have been subsidized for the purposes of information, communication or education campaigns, or who have received funding which could be used for this purpose; an exhaustive list of experts who are remunerated in various ways and are involved in information campaigns where they do not appear officially as salaried staff of the European institutions."
"In conclusion, the European institutions should refrain from financing political parties, either at the national or European level, or associations linked to these parties, even for projects which are supposedly for simple purposes of information."
"They must also refrain from financing or subsidizing projects from which certain parties would benefit."
"The committee on ethics already mentioned should ensure with particular vigilance that the principles of transparency are respected."
"Had it addressed the core problem of the lack of openness within the EU then this could have been a very good and valuable report on the information and communication policy in the European Union."
"But information can be misused as an instrument of power in society, and can easily be replaced and exploited as propaganda."
"Reading between the lines, it is evident that this is the way in which people want information and communication to be issued from the institutions of the EU."
"Quite simply, the intention is to convey the vision of the EU's infallibility."
"I certainly agree that the EU institutions must be more open and less bureaucratic."
"A start could have been made by introducing the principle of public access to official records, proper filing routines and recording of incoming post."
"But this is not included in the report."
"In the light of the situation in the European Parliament's part-session this week, which saw proposals made to prohibit TV crews from filming during voting, it is clear that there are many who wish through censorship to prevent the political debate within the European Parliament from reaching the citizens."
"Instead, the intention seems to be that communication with the EU's citizens should take place in advance via arranged information campaigns."
"In my opinion this is entirely the wrong course to take."
"At numerous points in the report reference is also made to the fact that the citizens are ill informed about how the EU operates and are therefore negatively disposed to the EU."
"But surely it is not the institutions in themselves that are the major problem, but the policies for which they are responsible that leads to criticism of the EU."
"These are two separate issues."
"The report formulates an information policy for the EU."
"The first question asked is why such a policy is needed in the first place."
"Are the citizens not satisfied with the Union?"
"The report is totally unacceptable."
"It mixes up information, communication and propaganda."
"Proposals such as the one advocating that large sections of the population that have ""negative feelings about Europe' need to be informed evoke unpleasant reminders of the political propaganda of fallen empires."
"Of course there is a need for information, but it must be based on entirely different premises to those set out in this report if we are to succeed in converting distrust into confidence."
"I have therefore voted against the report."
"I am certainly in favour of any proposal which develops a policy of education rather than propaganda."
"In the information society in which we now live, propaganda is counter-productive."
"People want facts, not opinions."
"Regrettably, the European Commission does not as yet seem to recognize this."
"Recently a constituent drew my attention to a Commission publication for use in schools entitled 'What Exactly is Europe?' ."
"According to this publication, the United Kingdom has exactly no Protestants."
"Upon investigation, I discovered that this information had been sourced from the Guinness European Data Book."
"People of the Protestant faith in my constituency have been offended by 'What Exactly is Europe?' and this has only served to undermine the credibility of the EU."
"Not only do we need improved cooperation between the institutions in our information policy, we need to make sure that the information which is provided to citizens is accurate and will not give offence."
"In view of the fact that the President asked me to stand down at the end of my contribution to the debate, I should now like to complete my statement in writing."
"I have already said that pretty wrapping paper is not enough, but that the contents must also be right."
"If the information and communication policy of the European institutions is regarded in such a way that its content can be changed by the use of pretty wrapping paper, then it is not worthy of the name 'information' - we should change it to 'manipulation' ."
"I warmly welcome the rapporteur's view that this Parliament must pursue a policy of complete openness and transparency with regard to the way in which this institution operates (recital E)."
"Moreover, the rapporteur is absolutely correct in stating that information campaigns cannot simply consist in unilaterally developing a specific position on a proposal that does not meet with unanimous agreement (recital H)."
"It would be splendid if the EU institutions were to live up to this."
"For the EU institutions simply to canvass for more power for the EU, a United States of Europe, increased federalism, EMU membership and so on using the taxpayers' money is neither particularly humble nor democratic."
"To run a campaign using such devices as the comic-strip character ""Captain Euro' in order to convince people of the merits of the euro is to underestimate the citizens' intelligence and the ways in which they form their own political opinions."
"Many citizens are evidently suspicious of the EU."
"Increased bureaucracy, the increased divides between citizens and their politically elected representatives and wastefulness in respect of taxpayers' money make many citizens quite justifiably suspicious of the EU as a project."
"The citizens' scepticism about the EU is not based on ignorance."
"It is based, rather, on the fact that they cannot envisage themselves having any influence over the organization, and on fears that a federal EU will become profoundly undemocratic, bureaucratic and controlled by market forces."
"This is a question of political evaluations, not ignorance on the part of opponents of the EU."
"If those who hold the political responsibility within the EU's institutions do not appreciate this fact, then it will never be possible to develop an information and communication strategy that is capable of achieving two-way communication with our citizens."
"Unfortunately, the above points are, in my view, missing from the Pex report."
"Competition in the air traffic sector"
"The next item is the report (A4-0141/98) by Mr Scarbonchi, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for Council Regulations (EC):"
"I.amending Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87 laying down the procedure for the application of the rules on competition to undertakings in the air transport sector (COM(97)0218 - C4-0258/97-97/0137(CNS)); II.on the application of Article 85(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements and concerted practices in the sector of air transport between the Community and third countries (COM(97)0218 - C4-0259/97-97/0138(CNS)) (Draftsman of the opinion: Mr Ribeiro, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy ( Hughes Procedure)."
"Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome provided the Community with a legal basis for assessing alliances and mergers."
"Article 87 also provided for the adoption of any appropriate regulations 'to give effect to the principles' presented in these articles."
"The secondary legislation which has been built up since then gives the Commission the power to consider cases where the competition rules were being disregarded, but initially excluded transport."
"The first liberalization package adopted in December 1987 included Regulations 3975 and 3976, although their scope was restricted."
"The first allowed the Commission to apply the competition rules in the air transport sector, imposing penalties and granting exemptions, but only in respect of traffic between Member States."
"The second regulation allowed the Commission to adopt block exemptions for certain practices but under the conditions laid down in Article 85(3) of the Treaty."
"What justification is there for the Commission's proposal?"
"The Commission believes that a number of new factors have intervened since 1989: the liberalization of the aviation market since 1997, the weakness of external flights resting only on bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries, and the future development of agreements with the United States and the countries of central and eastern Europe all mean that a precise framework is needed more than ever to deal with the inconsistencies or gaps in the current system."
"These factors have to be added to the grounds put forward in 1989, regarding the legal uncertainty facing the airlines."
"So, in order to cope better with the new liberalized framework of rules, to protect consumers' interests, to protect small and medium-sized carriers and to ensure balanced competition between the various European and non-European operators, the Commission is calling for the same powers in respect of transport between the Community and non-Community countries as it has on intra-Community routes."
"The first proposal for a regulation will extend the scope to cover all air transport services, including international routes."
"A new article 18a has been added to resolve any legal conflict with Member States or third countries by obliging the Commission to consult the competent authorities before withdrawing an exemption."
"Nevertheless, the network of bilateral air service agreements between Member States, third countries and their national airlines pose a formidable legal challenge to uniform and compatible competition rules in the air transport sector."
"It remains to be seen how these conflicting powers will resolve themselves in practice."
"Secondly, the Commission proposes a regulation allowing the non-application of Article 85, for a limited period, in certain categories of agreement between airlines, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices on international routes."
"The Commission's decisions may relate to joint planning, the coordination of capacity and timetables, revenue sharing, consultations on tariffs, slot allocation and joint operation of services."
"These two proposals represent substantial changes as regards the application of Community competition rules in air transport, especially in its international aspects."
"They improve the Commission's powers to monitor alliances between airlines."
"Despite the reservations expressed by several companies, the Commission can already use its powers in accordance with Article 89 of the Treaty of Rome, and is indeed obliged to do so as guardian of the Treaties responsible for applying Community law."
"The main advantage of our proposals for all parties concerned - airlines, governments, legal services, the European Commission and, of course, passengers - is to set up a homogeneous framework, with definite legal guarantees, for the whole of the European Union, and to promote the position of civil aviation companies within the European Union."
"Of the amendments proposed, the three principal amendments accepted by the Committee on Transport - Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6 - aim for greater coherence in Community regulation by using the wording and scope of the regulation on competition rules in the maritime sector."
"Amendment No 4 limits the powers of the Commission to the application of competition rules only to routes which depend on a Community airport."
"This amendment defines the scope of the powers of the Commission, which would have no jurisdiction in a commercial alliance or agreement between two non-European companies which did not affect Community air traffic."
"Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to clarify the procedure to be applied where bilateral agreements between two companies, one from the Union and one from a third country, are in conflict with the European Community's competition rules."
"The present proposal for a regulation specifies simply that, in cases of conflict, the Commission must consult the relevant authorities in the country concerned."
"Amendments Nos 1 and 3 propose new recitals referring to air transport security, public services and duty free. I will not oppose them during the vote."
"I accept them because the sentiments expressed are shared by everybody although, legally, they do not seem to be really appropriate in the context of the two regulations."
"To conclude, I will briefly mention the three amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party."
"I am not in favour of these because they go against the European interest, against consumer interests, and against the interest of fair competition by which we must be guided, at least in the sphere of air traffic."
"The airlines are against this regulation because they judge it to be contrary to their own interests, with the provision for the European Commission's anti-trust authorities rightfully to prosecute any cartel involving the airlines of the European Community and a third country if the benefits contravene competition rules."
"I call upon my colleagues not to pass up the opportunity, once again, to grant the Commission clear and unequivocal procedures and powers to guarantee uniform application of competition rules throughout Europe, whatever the airline or the alliance in question."
"Those, ladies and gentlemen, are the reasons why we are making these proposals, which have been put to the vote and accepted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Mr President, being responsible for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, I am pleased to have taken part in this work, on which I compliment my colleague Mr. Scarbonchi."
"My pleasure derives from the fact that we have been able to contribute to the inclusion or strengthening in the proposal submitted to the House of some aspects of air transport which we consider to be of the greatest importance, and which are always relevant when proposing amendments to the regulations covering competition rules and approved agreements and practices."
"We refer to the question of safety, which in this type of transport must be given priority in the context of the Community and international competition rules."
"We also refer to the so-called services of general interest, with the support of Article 7(D) of the Treaty currently undergoing ratification. We think air transport services should be seen as public services in the case of peripheral and island regions, particularly the Azores, the Canaries and Madeira."
"We would further refer to our concerns about the effects the changes now taking place and the liberalization of the Community air transport market may have on jobs and workers' rights in the sector, and also on users, with particular emphasis on the position of small and medium-sized companies."
"Finally, we would also refer to the scope of the proposed regulations, which should apply to airlines operating out of or into one or more airports within Community territory, and the processes for consultations and the settlement of any disputes, which should not exclude the participation of representatives of the Member States involved in them."
"Mr President, air transport is a vital growing sector with more and more people flying each year."
"Thanks to increased competition, the level of fares in the EU - on some routes at least - continues to fall and more and more passengers are able to fly."
"It is our duty to protect the interests of passengers by encouraging more small airlines to set up and expand and by not allowing large airlines to completely dominate the market by wiping out all competition."
"We must therefore ensure that, in areas where air transport is an essential means of transport, it is not destroyed or damaged by excessive competition."
"The Commission, in my view, is to be congratulated on its efforts to persuade Member States to give up their bilateral agreements and to allow the Commission to negotiate for the Community as a whole."
"Consequently, on behalf of the Party of European Socialists, I am pleased to offer our support to the rapporteur tonight."
"The Commission has powers in these areas which we believe should and must be extended."
"Mr Jarzembowski's amendments, on behalf of the PPE, appear to support the Community approach rather than the Member State approach but we feel that they will have completely the opposite effect."
"The object of the amendments, in our view, would be to confine the Commission's competence to apply competition rules to its right to negotiate agreements."
"We believe that is not acceptable."
"One effect, for example, would be the omission of the Atlantic routes."
"Indeed, in my friend and colleague's report - Mr Seal's report on the effect of the third liberalization package - he pointed out that there were still a number of obstacles which would prevent the entry of new airlines."
"These would affect areas such as slot allocation and certain network alliances."
"We therefore cannot agree that Mr Jarzembowski is correct in wanting to limit the Commission's application of competition rules to its present mandate."
"This, as he knows full well, will restrict their ability to make progress to just Switzerland and the central and eastern European countries and we would regret that."
"We therefore support the Commission's demands to have more rights to negotiate, for example, the open sky agreements."
"Any limitation on the present Commission mandate is in contradiction of our request to encourage the mandate to be extended."
"In conclusion, we believe the rapporteur - and indeed the Commission - deserve our support in improving aviation in the European Union and beyond because we believe their proposals will ensure fair competition, they will be good for the consumer and they will be good for competitive airlines."
"I commend them to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the European People's Party think the Commission's proposals to extend the competition rules on air travel to include third countries are logical in principle because, Commissioner, internal and external regulations are bound together for practical reasons, which makes it essential to have one single regulation."
"Yet in some respects the Commission is trying to run before it can walk, for only when the Council has fully transferred to the Community the responsibility for negotiating air traffic agreements with third countries - a policy which we in the PPE Group support - does it become logical to transfer to the Community sole responsibility for competition rules governing our relations with third countries."
"You cannot do the second without the first."
"Is the Council really prepared, and - if I can put a direct question to the UK government, if Mr Watts wants to have a word with Mr Prescott - is your government ready, to transfer jurisdiction in this area to the Community?"
"We hold the view that in the complex field of international transport it would be logical for the Community to be in charge of air traffic agreements for all Member States."
"But the Council is not prepared to do this, and I have not seen the UK presidency submit any proposal to this effect within the Council of Transport Ministers."
"For years the Commission has been asking for jurisdiction in this very area, but even the UK presidency has failed to be moved."
"But if we deny the Commission its wish, then we will be unable fully to extend the rules of jurisdiction to our relations with third countries, because this would create a bigger overlap between the Community's competence and that of the Member States, and the airlines would suffer as a result."
"That is not something we wish to see."
"I would say to the rapporteur, Mr Scarbonchi, that if the AEA supports these proposals, as we do, then this will benefit all European airlines, for you know how difficult it is to get any kind of agreement out of the AEA, with British Airways, KLM, Sabena and Lufthansa always at each others' throats."
"But if the AEA adopts a common position, then there will be real support for this as the best solution."
"We are therefore asking the other groups to support our three amendments."
"In this connection, Commissioner, I would ask you to give us more details of your intended decisions on the cooperation agreement between British Airways and American Airlines."
"We support your efforts to apply certain conditions to this agreement, such as those which seek to reduce the dominance of both companies in the transatlantic route to and from London and to ensure that there is fair competition on the transatlantic routes."
"Commissioner, you have now suddenly decided to look again at the old alliances, and to do the same to the new ones, in order to establish how far they comply with competition rules."
"We think that is a good thing to do, we are not at all unhappy about it, in fact quite the reverse, for we believe these alliances all have to be investigated in the same way."
"However, you should present and discuss with us your guidelines for reviewing and handling inter-company alliances, and you should do so either today or within the next few weeks - as you announced in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"We know that competition law is your domain."
"All the same, I think it is important to discuss the guiding principles with one another."
"But whatever you decide to do, Commissioner, to remove and prevent distortions of competition, I have certain misgivings about it all. We want to open up the market for competition between airlines."
"We do not want to replace competition - deficient though this may well be - with state intervention."
"Above all, we should not distort competition by applying state intervention or even market allocation orders."
"In this respect, Commissioner, we are anxious to know if you can tell us something about the guiding principles you intend to use."
"By the way, you know we tend to support you in these things, which is more than the Council does."
"Mr President, the European Commission, when looking into alliances between airlines, should not lose sight of the global competitiveness of these European companies."
"Strategic alliances are now of fundamental importance in strengthening the international competitiveness of the European air travel sector."
"Our airlines should therefore be supported by their own authorities when going through the process of restructuring."
"Unfortunately, support of this kind is rarely forthcoming and instead highly expensive conditions are imposed on airlines for the licensing of alliances - such as the withdrawal of slots and flight traffic restrictions."
"The Commission should only intervene when a violation of competition law has actually occurred."
"Its competition policy should not involve measures which will only handicap the European air travel industry and jeopardize the future of European airlines, particularly the smaller companies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalization of air transport, which was completed in April 1997 with the introduction of rights relating to mainland-island connections, has caused profound changes by bringing this sector into line with market rules."
"It should be noted as an exception, however, that there is a set of conditions in the Community legislation which give Member States and the Commission the right to intervene in order to deal with certain situations and needs."
"In that respect, bearing in mind the importance of the sector to the European economy, to jobs and to internal and intra-European communications, and the fact that air transport plays a vital role in reinforcing economic and social cohesion, by providing rapid transport links between regions and, most particularly, access to peripheral island regions, Community legislation has allowed for the possibility of imposing public service obligations and joint operation agreements between airlines to ensure that these transport links are maintained."
"In spite of what I have just said, those obligations have not been complied with in some cases, as a result of labour disputes, among other reasons, and this has jeopardized economic and social cohesion and citizens' freedom to travel to and from the regions in question."
"To be specific, I refer to the events which have frequently affected the ultra-peripheral regions of Madeira and the Azores, as they did once again only a few days ago."
"For that reason, I consider that any airline which has exclusive rights to a specific route by virtue of its being a public service, and which is subsidized by the state on that basis, in the interests of economic and social cohesion and the accessibility of the region in question, must provide those services and serve those regions in a properly professional manner."
"In any event, regardless of the selfish and unbefitting attitude of the pilots, who are putting privileged interests before those of the public and other company employees, I think the government should open the sector up to competition between airlines, with the same quality and safety requirements and the same financial support, to compensate the islanders for their isolation and remoteness."
"I had asked the Commissioner to comment further on the policy which is to be applied to alliances between airline companies."
"Perhaps he can do this in writing or even speak to me on the matter sometime in the near future."
"Time is short, but the guiding principles for agreements in the air travel sector are of fundamental importance, in my opinion, and we need to have more contact on matters such as this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Code of conduct for computerized reservation systems (CRSs)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0089/98) by Mr van Dam, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 on a code of conduct for computerized reservation systems (CRSs) (COM(97)0246 - C4-0418/97-97/0148(SYN))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, computerized reservation systems, hereafter to be called CRSs, occupy a relatively unknown but powerful place in air transportation."
"These enormous, fast networks are responsible for the lion's share of the airlines' turnover."
"85 % of all seats on scheduled flights are sold globally via the five independent CRSs."
"The oldest CRS, SABRE, was set up in the past by American Airlines, but is now making even more profit than American Airlines itself."
"Airlines which do not participate in a CRS are strongly limited in their opportunities to sell tickets."
"CRSs also offer their subscribers - travel agents - and the traveller the advantage of speedy information and reservation."
"Guarantees are required, however, to ensure that the client receives objective information when he makes enquiries at the travel agency about the options."
"Since 1989 there has been a European code of conduct in order to guarantee this objectivity."
"CRSs and airlines are obliged to give equal treatment to all parties concerned."
"The Commission proposal we are discussing at the moment aims to improve the operation of the code of conduct."
"It includes the subscribers - in other words the travel agents - in this, in order to promote fair information and to prevent inaccurate reservations."
"A valuable new component is the possibility of integrating rail services, particularly high speed trains, into what is being offered."
"I regard it of great importance that, for short and medium distance journeys, travellers are made expressly aware of the alternative of the train."
"Flying consumes a great deal of energy and is a major cause of air pollution, so there is every reason to consider the train if the time difference is not too great."
"The integration of rail transport into the CRSs must be done with the necessary preconditions."
"Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6 and 10, which relate to this, aim to promote equality between flights and high speed rail links."
"Carriers and alliances will continue to be able to sell tickets independently, without having to give neutral information."
"However, in that case the traveller must be aware that he is buying from a particular supplier, hence Amendment No 1."
"This principle is further extended to the Internet in Amendment No 9."
"The opportunities to reserve tickets via this worldwide network are growing quickly."
"When browsing Internet pages, we should always remain aware of who is supplying the information."
"The CRSs have gigantic amounts of market information at their disposal, including travel agents' sales figures."
"They offer this information for sale in an electronic format, but because they only offer the complete package, it is only the wealthy airlines that can afford to buy it."
"So that gives them an advantage in negotiations with travel agents."
"They would like to have selective amounts of information, for example, just for the region they serve."
"Amendment No 7 opens up this possibility of selective acquisition of information, which thereby comes within the reach of the travel sector."
"A sticking point in the present division of costs is the fact that each reservation leads to costs for the airline."
"Amendment No 8 limits this to routes for which actual tickets have been issued."
"Amendment No 13 ensures that the link between ticket and route is safeguarded."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism proposes in Amendment No 11 that a distinction should continue to be made between travellers having to change aircraft, possibly including an interval, and situations when the aircraft is only making a stopover."
"Bearing in mind the overall picture, I would like to draw the following conclusions."
"The code of conduct has been fulfilling an important function since 1989, but there was cause for further improvement and for bringing it up to date."
"The Commission proposal contains a number of significant improvements which benefit travellers in particular, but also travel agents."
"The proposal rightly creates the possibility of displaying high speed rail links as an alternative to flights over shorter distances."
"In order to make the rail alternative feasible in practical terms, a number of preconditions must be met, such as an agreement between the CRS and the railway company."
"In order to avoid the customer wrongly thinking that he is getting a neutral offer, the fact that he is consulting an airline or a group of airlines must continue to be displayed."
"The Internet is developing as a new sales channel for airline tickets."
"In that case, what must also be shown throughout is which provider the client is logged on to."
"CRSs occupy a powerful position, both in the field of marketing and in marketing information."
"This should not be allowed to become a monopoly position de facto, just because it is only the financially very strong companies which can buy that information."
"My final conclusion is that there is still room for some improvement in the area of providing the best possible information for the customer, and in the area of combating double or fictitious bookings."
"I am grateful to the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their cooperation."
"Unfortunately Mr Kinnock is not able to attend this debate because of the time at which it is being scheduled."
"He was kind enough to write to me to say he considered my report to be of an extremely high standard."
"In any case, I have tried to treat this important matter with the greatest possible care."
"Besides, I think it is extremely important that in future travellers will be able to make a considered choice between the plane and the train."
"This will not only promote fair competition, but also help to protect the natural world and the environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it used to be when you wanted to travel somewhere that you would go and stand at a counter."
"You then had to wade through piles of brochures, a process which could often be complicated and not always successful, before you got to your destination."
"The computer has now taken over this work and has made the whole thing much less complicated."
"This new technology now gives us access to an unwonted supply of information and a wide range of choices, and what is more, at very competitive prices."
"As such, it has been very well received by the consumer."
"Now that the computer is with us, we really must stop hoping and believing that the computer is always an objective thing."
"On the contrary, the computer is a real box of tricks and there are now many thousands of people whose only job is to manipulate the computer to suit one supplier or another."
"The airlines, and even the travel agents, have tried to give customers the illusion of objectivity, while all the time they were only looking to increase profits."
"While there is of course nothing wrong with wanting to make a profit, this has done very little for the consumer."
"The proposals before us, including those of Mr van Dam, are very sensible and will lead to better consumer protection."
"I also see that we need this interconnection when it comes to the modal split with rail transport, so that at the push of a button the traveller knows which system is better, which is cheaper and, furthermore, which is more environmentally friendly."
"I believe that Members of this Parliament will also benefit from this, but that is just by the by."
"One final point: the review of these systems is not something which will be finished and done with today."
"It will have to be repeated at regular intervals, because you can be absolutely sure that there will always be someone in the know trying to get round the regulations."
"Mr President, I shall try to be brief."
"The important thing is really to thank the rapporteur, for he has submitted an excellent report which has been unanimously approved in committee."
"With quite a few countries in the middle of election campaigns, it is always very nice to be able to say that a report has been carried unanimously because of its absolute objectivity."
"Thank you very much, Mr van Dam, for this report."
"Reform of the code of conduct is very sensible, and it will increase the objectivity of the information provided."
"The most important thing now is to include high speed trains in this system, so that people are better able to recognize those routes where it is more practical to take the train than to fly."
"This is something we want to see for shorter trips - in other words, more journeys by train than by aeroplane - in order to decongest air space and preserve the environment."
"In this respect the advantages are enormous."
"Unlike the Commission, I consider the display of code share flights to be a sensible move."
"Here I agree with the rapporteur."
"This system has proved to be very effective."
"Finally, I think it is right to produce a consolidated version of the three pieces of legislation, so they can be more clearly understood by consumers."
"In this respect, codification is something the Commission should be following up."
"I believe we can reach a consensus here: we have a good proposal and this is now to be improved upon by Mr van Dam."
"I hope the Commission accepts the rapporteur's proposals and then everyone will be happy."
"Mr President, I would like to note by way of introduction that I have a somewhat sceptical attitude towards rules of this type as a phenomenon."
"I believe that we in the EU must beware of formulating too many detailed rules."
"We may, quite unintentionally, create a market situation without any fresh ideas, in which we preserve the status quo by means of legislation."
"I am fairly convinced that if the EU had not interfered in the problems concerning reservation systems, the market would have solved them automatically."
"Travel agents and airlines are well aware that customer service is one of their most important competition tools."
"This is my principal standpoint."
"At the same time, this cannot be said to be a new phenomenon, since the code has been in existence since 1989."
"On a more pragmatic level, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the very fine work he has put into this report."
"In spite of my basic standpoint, I believe that the Commission and Mr van Dam have both succeeded in striking an extraordinarily important balance in this matter."
"I feel that the positive aspect of this report is that the railways will be included in the reservation system."
"This is perhaps something one would not normally think about in this context, but this may actually be one of the most important steps towards a liberalized railway sector."
"The railways will in future be allowed to compete side by side with airlines, and consumers will be able to make a much clearer choice between trains and planes."
"This ties in with the fact that the railway companies will in future be operating in a much more competitive market than at present."
"A key question in this report must also be the matter of fares."
"I would like to emphasize that the railways must join in and bear their costs in order to be included in the CRS system."
"We cannot once again subsidize the railways but not the other forms of transport."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, on behalf of my colleague Neil Kinnock, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr van Dam, on his report."
"Not only have you managed to initiate yourself into the mysterious technical terminology of computerized reservation systems, but you have also managed to propose a series of amendments which substantially improve the proposal."
"Computerized reservation systems are extremely complicated databases which offer a wide range of subscribers - travel agents, tour operators, hotels, ferry companies, hire companies - the means to access information about air lines and other services and, at the same time, make it easier to reserve and issue tickets."
"Parliament will be interested to learn that computerized reservation systems are thought to be the world's largest users of computerized services, and offer instant access to the services of more than 140 000 travel agents throughout the world."
"There are four major systems in the European Union, and one of them has a market share of more than 70 % in 10 of the 15 Member States."
"Of course, this high level is what has provoked the concern of the legislative authority."
"But Community regulations also allowed this to be dealt with on the basis of competition rights."
"Although the code has worked very well, our recent review suggests that some improvements are needed, in view of the latest advances in the Internet or in high speed trains."
"And that is the basis of the Commission proposal to modify the code, as Mr van Dam has described in his report."
"As I said at the beginning, most of the amendments propose very constructive changes to the existing text."
"So the Commission can accept the amendments proposed by Mr van Dam, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, except on two points."
"Firstly, the Commission feels unable to accept the second part of Amendment No 8, dealing with billing information on magnetic media."
"As far as billing information is concerned, we think all billing media should receive the same treatment, and the amendment would treat magnetic media differently."
"Also, we think it is superfluous to propose that participating air lines should not be charged a fee for bookings they have disallowed."
"Secondly, the Commission does not find Amendment No 11, on the classification of flights, acceptable either."
"The Commission proposed a new classification, in order to take account of recent advances in the aviation sector."
"We think that to return to the old classification system, as Mr van Dam and his committee suggested, would be to fail to take these changes into consideration."
"Apart from these two points, as I said, the Commission thinks that Mr van Dam has done an excellent piece of work. I want to congratulate him, and also thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their helpful work on this subject."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Marketing of seeds - Implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1467/94"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development:"
"A4-0128/98 on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directives 66/400/EEC, 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 66/403/EEC, 69/208/EEC, 70/457/EEC and 70/458/EEC on the marketing of beet seed, fodder plant seed, cereal seed, seed potatoes, seed of oil and fibre plants and vegetable seed and on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (COM(97)0403 - C4-0459/97-97/0217(CNS)); -A4-0129/98 on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/94 of 20 June 1994 (COM(97)0327 - C4-0492/97)."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, the first report, dealing with the directive on the marketing of beet seed, fodder plant seed, cereal seed, seed potatoes, seed of oil and fibre plants and vegetable seed, or in short the seed marketing law, produced an amendment not that very long ago and also resulted in a positive debate with the Commission."
"The matter in question concerned the adoption of a simplified certification system for conservation seed which was intended at the very least to restrict the genetic erosion of threatened species of agricultural plants."
"You know that these directives on agriculture are dealt with in Article 43, in which the European Parliament has only a consultative role."
"If we submit our amendments to these directives and the Commission, after taking due note, states that it is regrettably unable to accept Parliament's amendments, and if we then put our proposal to the final vote, it will all be a pointless exercise as far as we are concerned."
"The Council can then ignore the substance of Parliament's submissions when drawing up its decision."
"However, if we adopt a different approach, in that we suspend the final vote and reach a compromise with the Commission, so that the Commission and Parliament have a common position, then we will be in a relatively strong position when it comes to agriculture, even with respect to Article 43, for then the Council will only be able to reject this common position unanimously."
"Unanimity in the Council is a rarity."
"This happened only once, when we wanted to change the legislation - and Mr Fischler, you will recall that this concerned the labelling of beef, when you conceded Article 100a to us and the Council again committed itself unanimously to Article 43, only then to reach compromise after compromise in the matter - and this was only done to achieve unanimity in the face of the Commission and Parliament."
"I hope we can also reach agreement over this small amendment and consequently get a good result, for this time the issue is not the simplified registration of conservation seed, that is to say old varieties and local varieties, but rather the adoption of a simplified procedure for the approval of certified seed or basic seed for propagation."
"The Commission has carried out tests over a period of time and has come to the positive conclusion that external examiners and inspectors can also be used for the official inspections, that inspection at a higher level, involving the agencies of the state, is only necessary under certain precisely defined conditions, and that the process of seed approval and quality certification will not suffer as a result."
"We have, for the most part, accepted this view."
"We have only made some slight amendments."
"For one thing, we would like to see a swearing-in procedure for those carrying out the inspections."
"Such a commitment should ensure greater personal responsibility."
"We have made proposals as to the size of the plant sample which should be taken by the official inspectors, and have also proposed measures to be taken in the event of violations."
"I expect we can agree with the Commission on this."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has tabled an amendment which concerns the swearing-in of inspectors, but I prefer the amendments which we approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The second report which I am presenting here is connected with the seed marketing law."
"After two years of negotiations with the Commission, focusing in particular on the certification of seed which is severely affected by genetic erosion, we were able to achieve success."
"The matter in question concerns a Community programme for the conservation, specification, collection and use of the genetic resource base in agriculture."
"Parliament submitted this programme to the Commission in 1993, after it had been established in Rio that the great diversity of plant life which we have constitutes one of the most important elements for future civilization on this planet."
"We therefore launched a programme, with its own budget heading, which was designed to account for the genetic diversity of agricultural plants and animals."
"It was also intended that efforts would be made not only to ensure the safety and protection of this genetic diversity - and even to extend it - through databanks and gene banks, but also if possible to strive for genetic diversity in farming practice."
"Unfortunately, the Commission adopted a somewhat hesitant approach to this programme."
"Of the ECU 20 million which was made available over the following five years, the budget for 1997 was even cancelled completely."
"The problem clearly lay in the insufficient availability of manpower."
"This is incomprehensible, because obviously staff are available in other areas and they could have been redeployed. Clearly - and the Commissioner will no doubt soon enlighten me - this programme is not one of DG VI's more spectacular achievements."
"I would be happy to stand corrected on this."
"The programme in question has acquired a considerable reputation at international level."
"When the WHO held a conference on genetic diversity in Leipzig in 1996, the EU was the only region in the world which was able to present such a programme."
"It was interesting to see how the Commission vaunted this about, and indeed with justification. I supported this at the conference."
"But surely the necessary steps then have to be taken in the pursuance and execution of this programme."
"Let me just add one more comment. We must create a closer link between this programme and those which have been set up under Regulation 2078, or with programmes associated with the environmentally friendly use of the countryside, so that we get a complementary effect and the in situ conservation and support of genetic diversity can be secured via these programmes."
"If, as Agenda 2000 intends, we then provide economic backing for these programmes in the form of structural aid, and if we see to it that those products which are made from the great variety of plants and animals available continue to be in demand as quality produce in the local markets, then and only then will we achieve a form of stability which is not limited - if I can take a drastic example - to conserving genetic diversity in museums and in some botanic garden in the countryside, but actually constitutes an economic basis for the farming industry. I am convinced, when applying all those compensatory measures which can and should be taken, that the focus of our efforts must lie in safeguarding the economic basis for agricultural activities, and this includes those special varieties of plants and animals."
"That is the only way in which we can achieve the necessary long term stability."
"Madam President, I should like on behalf of my group to congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for his two excellent reports."
"There are a lot of things that irritate our citizens about the EU when it is perceived to be imposing new rules or removing ancient rights without justification."
"Usually these perceptions are misconceived - the result of gross distortion of facts by tabloid newspapers."
"However, the proposal to limit the availability of traditional varieties of seeds, particularly for fruit and vegetables used by amateur gardeners as well as those used commercially by smaller farms, has led to deep opposition being expressed by such well known and respected bodies as the Henry Doubleday Research Association."
"Many concerns have been expressed that the great wealth of varieties which still exists within the countries of the European Union could be reduced as a result of official Community policy to a few standard strains of seeds throughout Europe."
"The Socialist Group therefore welcomes the Commission proposal to facilitate the addition of new species to the list of recognized species."
"Commercial farmers have also been concerned that they too could lose out and be forced always to buy a limited number of expensive seed strains from big seed breeding companies."
"I represent several such companies in my constituency and recognize the value of their work in developing pest resistant crops and seed varieties that are especially suited to particular climates and terrains."
"However, the right balance needs to be struck between their interests, those of the commercial and non-commercial growers and the need to certify conservation seeds, that is, seeds of plants useful for biodiversity."
"The proposals by the Commission to simplify the inspection process of these seeds are to be welcomed in principle but the Socialist Group shares the concerns of the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as a whole that there should be additional safeguards to ensure that inspections are carried out by qualified objective personnel."
"Madam President, Commissioner and those ladies and gentlemen who have remained patiently with us, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has already said something about the decision making side of things."
"I would like to restrict myself to the subject of seed and seed marketing."
"As we all know, seed is an important resource for agriculture and it is also the basis for foodstuff production."
"The provision of good seed is ultimately a prerequisite for a secure nutrition system."
"What is more, the quality of the seed has a decisive effect - a very decisive effect - on the quality of the food produced, in many cases even regardless of the various processing stages."
"For these reasons, the inspection of plant and seed stocks naturally assumes great importance."
"Most countries today are accustomed to having their seed crop certified mainly by public bodies."
"However, such a system has made the inspection process somewhat more cumbersome."
"Against such a background, the Commission has now submitted its proposal for the simplification of this inspection process."
"There is already a substantial need to create a greater sense of responsibility in this sector."
"Seed breeders and cultivators have to be incorporated more closely into the seed recognition procedure."
"Simplification in this area is indeed desirable and would also mean that unofficial inspectors could carry out the prescribed examinations."
"Here the spotlight will naturally fall on the employees of seed producing companies, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has repeatedly pointed out."
"These people, with their knowledge and experience, are absolutely made for the job of seed inspection."
"Admittedly there is a risk that this will lead to conflicts of interest, and this is something which we shall have to counteract."
"On the whole we in the Group of the European People's Party can accept this report, retaining as it does the necessary amendments."
"Thank you very much, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, especially for your pertinacity."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to compliment Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on his first report, at least. It is positively excellent."
"I agree that there should be controls to ensure that seeds coming into the market are of the right quality and meet requirements."
"My question to the Commissioner is, can a seed firm now have its analyses carried out in any recognized laboratory anywhere in Europe - that is, not only in that particular country's own state controlled laboratories, as certain countries are claiming?"
"Furthermore, I have a couple of comments on the diversity of our seeds."
"I must distance myself somewhat from Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's statements, because if we want a seed market, then there has to be a certain level of quality, and there should be close scrutiny to ensure that seeds on sale are of the declared quality."
"Therefore, we should be a little cautious about the existing great diversity."
"We need to be careful to avoid a situation whereby whatever is in the gene banks comes into our market and destroys it - the world market and the European market alike."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of one of the two regulations we are debating today in the context of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report is to coordinate, support and promote, at Community level, the conservation, characterization, collection and utilization of genetic resources in agriculture."
"These genetic resources are made up of all traditional plant and animal varieties which correspond, in general, to clearly defined geographical areas or soils."
"They represent a great variety, a great diversity of genetic heritage, of hardy and robust plants and animals."
"They are in all cases much better adapted to the implementation of sustainable development in agriculture, something to which many of us are attached. They are much better adapted than some new creations - I am thinking in particular of genetically modified organisms - which are linked to the sole objective of ever greater profitability and, let us not deceive ourselves, increased profits for certain large industrial groups."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report, of which we approve and which I congratulate, in passing, on behalf of my group, rightly underlines our interest in preserving varieties of plant or animal species to conserve the genes which could be useful for agriculture in the future."
"This report also underlines, albeit more indirectly, the role which these banks and conservation networks play in the service of the Community, which is, a priori , a good thing."
"Having said that, I cannot help thinking that with the legal protection of biotechnological inventions which Parliament adopted on Tuesday, we will paradoxically be helping both to bring into the Community system costs related to gene conservation and, by means of technological patents, to privatize the profit from these same genes, which will have been conserved using money from the European taxpayer."
"But you will doubtless think I am trying to cause trouble."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on both reports."
"They have certainly given us a lot to think about."
"Some experience in my own constituency leads me to say that we must produce seed of the highest quality."
"To achieve this we must have strong inspection measures in place."
"While no-one likes to have inspection measures, it is the only way in which control can be accurately implemented."
"But while we must have inspection measures, they must not be overly bureaucratic, because that is one of the problems that aggravates farmers most."
"The measures must be so structured that they gain the confidence not only of the producer but of all involved in the industry."
"And we must ensure that there is a balance between the commercial and the non-commercial producer."
"I certainly feel that random sampling is something we are going to have to learn to live with. It is not going to be nice; it is not going to be easy; some people will object to it; some people will not like it; but that is part of life, that is the way things go at times."
"We must also be sensitive to the needs of the seed producers, so I would certainly appeal for the careful and sensible implementation of this particular regulation."
"Madam President, I am delighted that the Commission is simplifying the certification procedure for seeds intended for propagation."
"The Member States will have to show themselves worthy of each others' confidence and the confidence of the Commission, the guarantor of the Treaties, by the care they take in exercising the controls for which they are responsible."
"Absolute accuracy in exercising the various controls will have to rid us at last of our phobia of fraud of all kinds which, like a cancer, eats away at confidence in the construction of our Europe."
"We often hear it said that Europe is involved in too many things."
"I believe that Europe is facing up to its responsibility by ensuring control of the conservation and safeguarding of seeds, our joint world heritage."
"Furthermore, in the decades and centuries to come, these seeds will need to be used as a standard to restore certain characteristics to the plant species which have undergone genetic modification. In some cases it is impossible to predict the harmful or perverse effects which could result from these practices, which are not always necessary for the wellbeing of mankind."
"Once again, we must remain vigilant to ensure that mistakes do not become irreparable, for lack of caution."
"It is therefore incumbent upon all the people responsible to be precise regarding inventories and the management of collections so that no basic species or important variety of these species is forgotten."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that this sound report puts us on the right track."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur and, indeed, the Commission for bringing up this issue again."
"It is very important that we prepare an up-to-date inventory of the state and nature of the genetic resource base in agriculture."
"It is also necessary to conserve and protect these valuable resources of both seeds and animals."
"Many varieties of seed, both cereal and vegetable, are no longer in everyday use."
"We must make every effort to protect and save them for the possibility of future use."
"I give you the example of the now famous International Rice Bank where research into cross-breeding of many out of use and local strains of rice has led to the development of a new variety which is now showing up to a seven-fold yield improvement."
"Similar possibilities apply to animals."
"For example, some rare breeds of cattle, now almost extinct, may provide disease resistant traits and food producing improvements when cross-bred with conventional breeds."
"So we must make the investment, not only in records and inventories, but also in gene banking and conservation of what still remains."
"Also, it will be necessary to encourage interested people to continue to breed these rare animals."
"This will require financial support, as this activity is a labour of love and not economic."
"In conclusion, in my opinion, one of the most important aspects of conservation of seeds and animals is the ever increasing possibilities in the area of biotechnology which these genetic resources may provide for the absolute benefit of a rapidly growing world population, much of which is already undernourished in many regions of the southern hemisphere."
"The approach to research through biotechnology will also give us seeds and plants with the ability to survive and produce in arid, infertile areas with above normal temperatures and shallow soils."
"Biotechnological research must continue and must be properly funded."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a successful report."
"It is important for common regulations to be drawn up in the area of certification as regards seed types and approved inspectors."
"However, we must guard against losing confidence in the certification system by allowing absolutely anything under the sun to be accredited."
"Firstly, it would be far too expensive, because the certification process for new seed types is long and costly."
"Certifiable seed types should be those intended for cultivation."
"Secondly, the processing time for certification would be lengthened unnecessarily if all types of wild grain were to be certified."
"One of the purposes of certification must be to test out new types of seed that are resistant to plant diseases in order to reduce the use of crop sprays."
"In my view, another important aspect is to obtain an assurance that inspection will be carried out under reliable conditions."
"Inspectors will have to be authorized by the state."
"We must ensure that farmers in all Member States are treated equally by the inspectors."
"There is some cause for concern at developments tending towards the random awarding of inspection contracts."
"That would not be in the best interests of either farmers or consumers."
"Madam President, in Amendment No 1 the rapporteur suggests that the new inspectors should be sworn in before they are officially licensed."
"I personally cannot support this proposal."
"I do not know exactly what the situation is in other countries, but in the Nordic countries there is only one professional group that swears an oath of office, and that is the judiciary."
"Unfortunately, it would only invite ridicule if we were also to oblige inspectors of potatoes and flower seeds to swear such oaths."
"Moreover, it would make no difference as regards the possibilities of imposing penalties for offences such as incorrect or fraudulent inspection."
"Requiring inspectors to be sworn in would unfortunately, I believe, merely over-complicate the whole situation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for the very constructive way in which the Commission's proposal has been handled."
"The task before us was to secure the amendment of seven seed marketing directives, dating back to the late sixties and early seventies, in order to clarify, simplify and facilitate the marketing of seed within the European Union."
"The Commission proposal has three basic aims. Firstly, to extend the scope of the current provisions for the carrying out of temporary experiments, by which alternatives can be explored for improving the provisions laid down in these directives."
"Secondly, to facilitate the inclusion of new plants in the catalogue of plants covered by the directive, and thirdly, to lay down provisions on the suitability of plant names."
"The Commission's proposal also simplifies the procedures used for the official recognition of certified seed in respect of the clause by which plant stocks which are to be used for seed production do not necessarily have to be inspected by the official agents of the seed certification authority, but may also be certified by other inspectors."
"Independent persons, appointed by companies engaged in seed production, seed propagation, seed processing and seed distribution, could in future also act as seed inspectors."
"In this connection I should like to point out that the answer to Mr Kofoed's question is 'yes' ."
"The broad agreement which the proposal has received in Parliament is a clear sign that we are on the right path."
"I should therefore just like to say something about the only aspect which has given cause for slight controversy, namely the on-site inspections."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf referred to the procedure laid down in Article 43."
"Each institution has to be fully aware of its function."
"But it is not my personal wish, nor that of my colleagues, to disregard the procedure on position taking simply because it is only a position and nothing more."
"On the contrary, where it is possible and when it is justified for practical reasons, we shall of course take appropriate account of the amendments which are being submitted here in Parliament."
"I am therefore pleased to be able to inform you that the Commission unreservedly accepts Amendment No 4 for the evaluation of the new procedures within a period of four years."
"The Commission also accepts Amendment No 1, relating to the swearingin of inspectors, in the form proposed by the rapporteur, and likewise Amendment No 5, with a small alteration."
"However, we are of the opinion that both amendments taken together fail to convey the right meaning."
"Amendment No 2 is acceptable to the Commission provided it is extended to take account of the amended decision of 1995, which further provides in certain cases for a reduction in the level of official inspections to 5 % and 15 % respectively."
"Amendment No 3, which contains the proposal that action shall be taken in the event of contravention by licensed inspectors of the rules governing official examinations, can also be accepted in principle by the Commission."
"However, since it is the view of the Commission that the measures contained in the amendment could be lacking in balance, it is thought that these should be reviewed further in a comprehensive study."
"Furthermore, for legal reasons the amendment should be edited and an appropriate wording employed throughout."
"Let me now move on to the second item in this joint debate."
"At this juncture I also wish to thank the rapporteur for the keen interest shown in Regulation 1467/94 and I can assure him that the European Parliament's position will be of great value to the Commission in its deliberations on how to proceed with this regulation."
"In addition, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the generally positive way in which they have received the Commission's report."
"This report shows that the regulation in question is already allowing important work to be done in the Member States, and that this is contributing to the objectives of the common agricultural policy, particularly in respect of the relationship between agriculture and environmental protection."
"Thanks to this regulation, Europe can now coordinate the efforts which are being made for the preservation and environmentally friendly use of the genetic resources of the agricultural industry."
"The results of this are already being disseminated, primarily via the Internet."
"This is acknowledged throughout the world, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has already pointed out."
"The important work which has been done towards the conservation, specification, collection and use of the genetic resources of the European agricultural industry, which has been funded within the framework of Regulation 1467, has significantly strengthened our position in the international negotiations taking place on species diversity in agriculture and on genetic resources for the agricultural industry."
"In his report, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf indicated that the budget funds for Regulation 1467 must be increased and that greater manpower resources must be deployed in this sector."
"The Commission is very aware of the problems which exist in this area, and as far as staffing levels are concerned I can only point out once again that in DG VI we are still experiencing major difficulties in providing the appropriate level of cover for all the tasks in hand."
"As regards the comment often made in this House that all these tasks could easily be attended to by redeploying personnel, I should just like to record that I stand by what I have already said, namely that we are willing at any time to have the offices of DG VI undergo public screening."
"Then everyone can tell us which operations are to be cancelled or postponed."
"We have a problem here and I can therefore only appeal to the budget authorities, in view of the acknowledged importance of this regulation, to provide adequate support for the Commission's proposal."
"I should, however, like to express my thanks to Parliament once again for the interest it has shown in this report and for the positive manner in which it has been received."
"Thank you, Commissioner Fischler."
"The rapporteur has asked for the floor."
"Madam President, I should like briefly to pick up on two points."
"The first concerns the matter of swearing-in."
"In our country it is customary for persons taking up public positions to be sworn in."
"This practice may possibly be unusual."
"It is intended not only as a commitment to duty but also to ensure impartiality in cases involving mutual interests."
"There are indeed inspectors who also work for seed companies."
"The report makes a reference to this and indicates that inspectors have to be given greater independence to carry out their work without pressure from other quarters."
"My second point is a question for you, Mr Fischler."
"The second report states that we think it would be sensible for this programme - and I am now also extending this to programmes covered by Regulation 2078 - to be made available to those countries in the transitional phase of membership."
"I am not looking here for a promise which you cannot give us at this juncture."
"But the fact remains that we now have to look at this issue, because in the countries concerned such resources could well be lost partly through changes in agricultural practice, and we would then have an awful lot of catching up to do."
"Proposing to those countries undergoing transition that they apply measures which are in line with the objectives of this and other programmes, whose aim is to promote an environmentally friendly agricultural industry, therefore seems to me to be eminently sensible."
"Madam President, I would like to look at this question once again, for it seems to me to be an important one."
"Within the framework of the accession procedures and the new funding packages which are to be provided from the year 2000, it is planned to give priority to developing the processing sector and to creating a stronger management structure and a more effective environmental policy in agriculture, with ECU 500 million to be made available to the 10 applicant countries for agricultural purposes."
"I am quite prepared, particularly now when there is a need for programmes to be drawn up in talks with the countries concerned, to bring this matter up during these discussions and to make the applicant nations aware of the importance of this issue."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Bureau a question arising from the Minutes."
"The vote on my report took place yesterday afternoon under the direction of your good self. I would like to thank the 225 Members who voted, 168 of them backing my report."
"Over 400 of those present this morning were present for voting yesterday morning."
"Votes have often taken place at half past one, even at a quarter to two on some occasions."
"Before voting commenced yesterday morning, it was reported that voting would be suspended at a quarter past one."
"I would like to ask whether the Bureau intends to introduce variable voting times."
"Sometimes we vote until one o'clock, other times until a quarter past or half past one."
"It all seems rather arbitrary."
"I feel I am the victim of voting being suspended at a quarter past one."
"I would like to ask the Bureau to put forward concrete proposals on fixed voting times so that this sort of thing cannot happen."
"We have fixed voting times but not fixed subjects for the voting period: we cover as many items during the voting period as we possibly can but, if we run out of time, the reports not voted on are carried over to the next voting session."
"Mr President, I would just like to make a point which may perhaps have escaped Mr Pex."
"For some time now, the agenda has made provision on Thursday evening at 5.30 p.m. for votes on topical and urgent subjects and the continuation of the morning's votes."
"I can understand that that might have escaped you, Mr Pex, but I think it is very important and that in future we will have to plan our work according to the agenda."
"As President of the Thursday morning sitting, I could in theory have closed the sitting at 1.00 p.m. sharp, but thanks to the flexibility of the House, I was able to let it continue until 1.15 p.m. I sincerely hoped to put the Pex report to the vote but this was not possible."
"Everyone knew, however, that if the vote had not been held by 1.15 p.m., it would have taken place the same evening."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, I have no comment to make on the Minutes but would like to draw both your attention and that of fellow Members of this House to the fact that we have a lady in our midst today who is celebrating a very important birthday."
"The lady concerned is Mrs Ursula Schleicher who often chairs the Friday sitting here."
"I think it might be nice, Mr President, to offer her our warmest congratulations."
"Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"Many Happy Returns, Mrs Schleicher."
"Votes"
"Amendment No 1, which has been approved and tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Amendment No 5 from Mr Fantuzzi contradict each other; they are not compatible."
"I prefer Amendment No 1 which was adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The Commission has indicated that although it could live with both of them, if I have understood matters correctly, the amendments are incompatible and cannot be supplemented either."
"So we have to make up our minds, and I am in favour of Amendment No 1."
"After the vote on the amendments"
"Mr President, before the vote on the legislative resolution I should just like to confirm again that the changes which the Commission has made to Amendments Nos 2 and 3 are of an editorial nature rather than a substantive one - insofar as an amendment represents a supplement to the existing legal text - in other words, that these changes are in accordance with what we are voting on here, so that we shall then have a common position from Parliament and the Commission."
"If you nod now, we can vote!"
"The Commission has nodded."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Report (A4-0129/98) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/94 of 20 June 1994 (COM(97)0327 - C4-0492/97)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, the European Commission would like to extend the application of the rules on competition to international air transport services."
"If the Council decided to do so, the Commission would be given the exclusive right to assess the cooperation agreement between European and foreign airlines."
"The Commission currently shares this right with the Member States."
"According to the Commission, this gives rise to legal uncertainty amongst the airlines concerned."
"European rules on competition for the air transport sector are designed to prevent unlawful constraints on competition between airlines on the liberalized internal market."
"Tariff agreements are not, for example, permitted within the European Union."
"On an international level, there is however no liberalized market."
"On the contrary, international air traffic is generally based on detailed bilateral agreements."
"In a situation such as this, it would be impossible to apply rules on competition."
"In bilateral negotiations, air transport is often just one part of an entire package."
"Package deals are the norm."
"In my view, it would be better to keep things as they are with powers shared between the Commission and the Member States."
"Member States would, within certain limits, then retain the right to conclude air transport agreements with third countries."
"Article 89 of the Treaty states that the Commission may intervene by arrangement with the relevant Member State if an agreement would have the effect of overly restricting competition."
"Better cooperation between the Commission and the Member States would significantly reduce the legal uncertainty amongst airlines."
"I freely admit that the two do not appear to be working very well together at present."
"This is because both the Member States and the Commission have been staking out their own territory in the new situation created by air transport alliances."
"I am sure that cooperation between the Commission and the Member States will improve over time."
"These are the reasons why I voted against the Commission's proposals."
"We are all aware of the importance of the principle of subsidiarity. It allows Member States to solve their own problems, if their action is likely to be more effective than intervention by a European institution."
"In my opinion, and in that sense, the question of air transport agreements between Member States and third countries should not make it necessary to extend the scope of the Commission's powers too much."
"However, in these two proposals for Council regulations, the Commission wishes to extend its powers to enforce Community competition rules on air transport between the Community and third countries."
"May I remind you that, at present, the Commission only has the Council's mandate to enforce competition rules with regard to air transport services provided inside the European Economic Area."
"If the Commission's proposals were adopted as they stand, its powers to influence relationships between Member States and third countries would be extended."
"For my part, ladies and gentlemen, at the very least I think it would be premature to extend the Commission's powers in that way."
"In fact, at the present time, we have no common external policy in the area of air transport."
"Furthermore, the background debate on this subject has only led to a limited number of negotiating mandates."
"Furthermore, I would also like to say that no agreements have yet been signed with any country which does not belong to the European Economic Area."
"To conclude, it would be a pity if the Commission tried to extend its powers by what I would call devious means, using proposals for regulations to get involved in an area which is at present within the sovereign competence of Member States, except in cases where the Commission has a negotiating mandate."
"I believe it would be more appropriate initially to extend the Commission's powers only to countries for which the Council has given the Commission a negotiating mandate."
"Graefe zu Baringdorf report (A4-0128/98)"
"The proposal which the Commission has submitted to us simplifies the procedures for the certification of seed for propagation."
"The methods envisaged provide for greater involvement of seed firms in inspection procedures."
"Official inspections undertaken by seed certification authorities will be partly replaced by inspections for which seed producers will themselves be responsible."
"In principle, we approve of this simplification."
"Nevertheless, it will be necessary to ensure that self-monitoring procedures are properly implemented, so as to avoid possible discrimination between seed producers in different Member States."
"It will therefore be essential to ensure that inspectors responsible for supervising the implementation of self-monitoring use standard procedures in all Member States."
"It will also be necessary to apply serious penalties in case of fraud or rigging of inspections."
"It will be necessary to ensure that inspectors have greater personal responsibility and that seed firms and producers do not put pressure on inspectors."
"This group supports all the amendments, particularly the amendment which provides for the supervision of inspections by sworn inspectors."
"In fact, because of the seasonal nature of agricultural products and the need to use temporary labour to carry out self-monitoring procedures, it is necessary for supervision to be carried out by sworn inspectors."
"Indeed, that is the only way of increasing the personal responsibility of inspectors, in case of fraud or manipulation of inspections."
"I would also to point out an inconsistency."
"In the Rothley report on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, we adopted the principle of the patentability of seeds whilst restricting the 'farmer's privilege' . Parliament now has to vote on a report on the promotion at Community level of the activities of conservation, characterization, collection and utilization of genetic resources in agriculture."
"The aim of the report we are considering today is to promote centres for the conservation of genetic resources and to facilitate information at a European level."
"Does this not mean that, on the one hand, we are going to prevent or reduce the production of agricultural seeds and, on the other hand, finance and promote centres for the conservation of genetic resources, for the sole benefit of multinational seed firms?"
"Payment card crime"
"The next item is the report (A4-0164/98) by Mr Schmid, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the draft joint action adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union concerning arrangements for the better exchange of information in respect of payment card crime between Member States' law enforcement agencies and between those agencies and the payment card industry, where such information is required for the investigation of offences (5683/98 - C4-0136/98-98/0906(CNS))"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, alongside unemployment, the fear of crime has become a major concern for many people."
"In this context, organized crime is increasingly perceived as a problem."
"Mind you, there is a widespread but inaccurate assumption that organized crime essentially manifests itself in spectacular serious crimes."
"There is an equally widespread misconception that organized crime is essentially committed by organizations which do not share our nationality but come from abroad."
"Both these views are wrong!"
"Organized crime is basically just the systematically organized committing of repeatable criminal offences, even minor ones, to make a profit."
"Most people think of drug-dealing in this context."
"Drug-dealing should certainly be included, but it is only part of what we are concerned with."
"Systematic theft or the systematic counterfeiting of credit cards, for example, should also be included."
"I want to illustrate this by means of an example."
"If a pocket is picked, for example in Brussels, we may be dealing in some cases with a drug addict acquiring money so that he can buy his drugs."
"But we may also be dealing with specialist pickpockets who are flown into the city and spend a whole day there working systematically."
"In the evening they are back on the plane, on their way to another continent."
"As for the stolen cards, they are flown to somewhere in Asia."
"They are used to buy things there and the goods purchased are turned back into money by fence organizations."
"That is organized crime."
"Organized crime is increasingly involved in the area of credit cards."
"The loss is estimated by police authorities at some US $1 billion per year."
"That is a lot of money!"
"The techniques that are used range from misuse - the forging of signatures - through tampering with credit cards, to complete counterfeiting."
"This sum of US $1 billion which I have mentioned is initially smuggled back into the criminal money circuit and, after moneylaundering operations, it eventually ends up in apparently respectable businesses."
"The British government has now put forward a proposal for joint action to facilitate the work of the police in this area."
"The objective of this proposal is to ensure more rapid exchange of information about credit card crime, for example about new modi operandi and such like."
"This swift exchange of information would take place not only between police authorities; there would also be better arrangements for the reciprocal exchange of information between the credit card industry and the police."
"Both of these initiatives are right."
"That is why our committee pronounced itself in favour of this proposal."
"But at the same time we also say that it makes little sense to build up a separate information system for every type of offence in the area of organized crime."
"It would be more logical - my colleague, Mr Schulz, will go into this in more detail in a moment - to get Europol involved in this matter as soon as possible instead of building up parallel structures."
"That would only lead to confusion."
"Secondly, what has been proposed is good, but it does not go far enough."
"If we are to proceed effectively against credit card crime we need at least two more measures."
"On the one hand, we need a standardization of security markings on credit cards."
"Most of you may not be aware that every credit card has its own security markings by means of which it is possible to determine whether it is a forgery."
"Some of these markings are not visible, sometimes they can be seen under ultra-violet light, and some of them are known only to the initiated."
"The problem is that every credit card organization that issues a card uses different markings."
"That means that those who accept credit cards in a shop would have to learn 8, 10 or even more different security markings, but no-one does."
"What we need is standardization, along the lines of what happens with banknotes, where there are two or three markings which are known to every cashier."
"To this end we in the European Union at least need proposals from the Commission; the matter will have to be legally regulated."
"There is also a common belief that the credit card industry voluntarily takes all manner of steps to prevent the misuse of credit cards."
"The truth is that there is a cost-benefit analysis, not unlike the calculation which you may yourselves make when you consider if it is worthwhile taking out insurance or running the risk of damage, because in the long run it works out cheaper than paying for insurance."
"Credit card organizations act in a similar way."
"That is why so far we do not have the safest basis that there could be, namely not paying with your signature but following the same procedure as with cash dispensers, whereby there is a chip on these plastic cards and you sign with a sequence of four numbers which only you know, in other words a chip and a PIN."
"However, the pre-requisite for such an approach would be the availability in restaurants and shops of machines where the code could be entered."
"This has for a long time been possible with the use of the Carte bleue in France but not in other countries."
"It was done in France not for reasons of security, but to skim off the market."
"But that does not matter, it is the result that is important."
"The credit card industry is resisting this approach partly with the argument that a silver shop in India would never raise enough money to buy such a machine."
"The industry argues that the introduction of such an approach would hinder the further spread of credit cards."
"So the industry is not automatically interested in the highest standard of security."
"But society does have an interest."
"It must be of major interest to us that organized crime should be fought wherever possible, because ultimately it represents a danger to society."
"That is a further reason for legal proposals in this area."
"In conclusion, I would repeat that what the British government has suggested is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough, and the Commission is required to act in response to our far-reaching demands."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Schmid, very sincerely for submitting this report."
"His statements have shown that we are dealing with a true expert in the subject."
"At the start of my own statements, allow me to remark in jest that, having read Gerhard Schmid's report, I would easily be in a position to try my hand at things other than being a Member of the European Parliament because, if it were not illegal, you could make a lot of money that way!"
"Mr Schmid has completed a very precise analysis of the technical pre-requisites for this type of crime."
"His report highlights a quite significant danger, namely the fact that as a result of technological progress, notably in cashless payment transactions, new dangers of misuse emerge at the same time and in the same areas where simplifications appear to have been achieved. This is the case unless clear definitions are made of the limits and frameworks within which comparable standards are developed to make it easier to control the usability of this new technology, not only for the user but also for the manufacturer of the technical pre-requisites."
"In doing so, Mr Schmid has pointed to the crux of the matter."
"As the example of France shows, the credit card industry is interested in simplifying the buying of goods by means of credit cards and in encouraging as many people as possible - that is after all the purpose of credit cards - to be able to buy goods with greater ease in an economy which is becoming more and more entwined internationally, so tempting them to buy goods."
"But in that case the party which derives most profit also has to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected."
"Mr Schmid has just made use of a classic example to demonstrate how, although sealing off one Member State's market within the internal market benefits both the Member State and its consumers on the one hand, it amounts on the other to a contravention of our Community's rules on competition."
"This only goes to show that the development of a new, integrated economy in the European Union brings a host of dangers in its wake."
"One of the dangers which I want to address is the fact that we have not as yet developed a coherent security system in the European Union."
"If the collections of data which are needed to create comparable security standards are now to be fed into a new, separate system yet again, it will be the umpteenth system that we have developed in the EU."
"In order to provide protection against organized crime, there is not only a security system in the area of credit cards, but also, for example, the Schengen information system or the customs information system."
"And then there is also the European information system which collects a range of data from other systems."
"So there is a danger - and there has often been critical comment about this in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs - that we shall see the development of several different systems which to some extent collect the same sets of data."
"In this case it would make more sense for us to transfer protection against misuse, and the development of strategies for such protection, to the institution which is in fact responsible for such matters, namely Europol."
"If Europol is really to be developed as the European Union's data collection body and as the organization which is to carry out the exchange of data while at the same time checking thoroughly that data protection is being respected, then it makes no sense if Europol is not involved with credit card fraud of all things, one of the growth industries for organized crime."
"That is why I make the following demand, as an essential supplement to what my colleague, Mr Schmid, has said: instead of overloading Europol politically with issues - for example, nuclear smuggling - which really have nothing to do with it, as often happens, it would, for example, be better to transfer to this body competence for the area described by Mr Schmid."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Schmid very sincerely for an excellent report."
"We should not be surprised; he does after all come from Bavaria, and all sorts of good things come from Bavaria."
"This report yet again illustrates in a particular sector the extent of the problems caused by internationally organized crime."
"The latter has a decisive advantage."
"At a time when there is really an explosion of knowledge, when new technologies appear virtually every day, there are still governments which always arrive on the scene too late, like Dad's Army."
"They clamp down only long after the matter has been resolved."
"They shut the stable door only after the horse has been stolen."
"That is the real problem, and it is good to highlight it in an area which directly affects our citizens, namely credit cards."
"We have a completely new dimension today, with a world-wide struggle against internationally organized crime which is obstructed by political conditions."
"Before the Second World War there were perhaps 20 countries in the world that were of any great significance."
"Today we have 190 in the UN alone."
"Many of us - I know because I used to be on the Committee on Development and Cooperation - do not even know their names."
"These countries are increasingly and deliberately being targeted and bought up by international crime and certain dangerous sects, so that a new situation is emerging in international relations as a whole."
"In addition, we are also dealing with the problem of major international speculative capitalism."
"According to a report from the World Bank, these groups have at their disposal nowadays a sum of between 800 billion and 1 trillion dollars."
"If you believe the news, we shall shortly experience another great international crisis like the one in 1992."
"That is why we have to proceed on the widest front."
"Today it is a question of creating security in the area of credit cards."
"But we should not stop there; we should go further, because there are even greater dangers in store."
"We face a major international struggle against international forces which are criminally organized and which respect no laws, because they are always quicker than those who are law-abiding."
"I would like to thank Mr Schmid for pointing this out."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the sign against crime campaign when we dealt with crime in Brussels, today we come to the ""vote against crime' ."
"We would like to give our full support to Mr Schmid's report."
"I think that it is urgently necessary to proceed consistently against organized crime."
"Indeed, we ought also to have had a debate here this week, which has had to be postponed because of the urgency of another topic."
"I am confident that we shall be able to have this debate with the Council and the Commission in our next Strasbourg sitting."
"In Germany we have heard that gangs of children were shipped into Germany from Romania with the job of picking pockets."
"If they had not picked a certain number of pockets by the evening, their lips were burnt with cigarettes or their lower legs were slashed with razor blades."
"The organizers were caught in this case."
"We can see that our cities face entirely new dangers in the area of crime."
"Credit cards were also stolen in the course of these pickpocketing incidents, and were used for fraud, with enormous sums being lost. This is quite unacceptable to us."
"That is why I have made the proposal - and anyone who travels can see this in the ASEAN countries for example - that like the German railway pass, credit cards should automatically incorporate photos of the credit card owner, so that you can immediately tell whether the person in question really is the owner of the card."
"These cards should also perhaps incorporate a fingerprint so that trained personnel could quickly identify, alongside the signature, whether a credit card was being presented by the legal owner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two reasons why the Commission welcomes today's debate on Mr Schmid's report."
"Firstly, it is important that the European Parliament should be able to express its views in matters of cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs before the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into effect."
"Secondly, by virtue of their quality, Mr Schmid's report and the amendments it contains should give the Council cause to consider it carefully."
"In short, the Commission welcomes this proposal for a joint action."
"It should be seen as a practical instrument which facilitates the work of all those who deal with investigations in connection with payment card fraud, and one which respects privacy and human rights."
"We are particularly pleased that this initiative is based on a project that was financed with budgetary funds from the European Union, or, to be more precise, with funds which Parliament and the Council made available to assist initiatives in the fields of justice and home affairs."
"In addition, I should also like to point out that this initiative should be regarded as a concrete measure to implement the European Union's action plan to fight organized crime, which has been extensively discussed in this House."
"At present, the Commission is concluding its considerations in connection with the task with which it was entrusted in the context of the action plan, of elaborating proposals for measures against fraud and against the forgery of all types of means of payment, including credit cards, and of examining inter alia the introduction of harmonized bases for punishable offences in relation to certain actions."
"All these initiatives, among which we should also include the entry into force of the Europol agreement which is expected this year, and which will mean that Europol is at last fully able to act, show that the European Union intends to proceed with determination against criminal wheeling and dealing in the area of the European Union."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"g. (SV) We certainly feel that it is important for action to be taken to combat crime within the payment card industry."
"It is absolutely clear from the explanatory statement accompanying the report that the proposal should concentrate on such areas as the production of payment cards, their distribution, production of card readers and other payment card-related services. All of these areas are important."
"We are wondering, however, whether this is a specifically EU-related problem."
"We believe it is not."
"The measures mentioned here are all international."
"Quite clearly, payment cards do not exist only in EU countries."
"Consequently, we do not feel that these matters should be entrusted to Europol, but instead that Interpol, the international, intergovernmental police commission, should take the matter up."
"Fraudulent payment card transactions are international and therefore a job for Interpol."
"We have thus voted against the legislative resolution."
"Use of antibiotics in animal food"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"B4-0286/98 - O-0075/98 by Mr Olsson, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, to the Commission, on regulation of the use of antibiotics in animal food; -B4-0287/98 - O-0082/98 by the following Members: Aelvoet, Roth, Schörling, Gahrton, Hautala, Graefe zu Baringdorf, Lindholm, Holm, Lannoye and Tamino, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, to the Commission, on the use of antibiotics in animal feed; -B4-0289/98 - O-0084/98 by Mr Barthet-Mayer and Mr Vandemeulebroucke, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, to the Commission, on antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs; -B4-0388/98 - O-0098/98 by the following Members: Cabrol, Pasty, Azzolini and Santini, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, to the Commission, on antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs; -B4-0463/98 - O-0102/98 by the following Members: Sonneveld, Goepel, Böge, Funk and Schierhuber, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to the Commission, on the rules governing the use of antibiotics in animal feed; -B4-0468/98 - O-0113/98 by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, to the Commission, on the rules governing the use of antibiotics in animal feed; -B4-0470/98 - O-0115/98 by the following Members: Roth-Behrendt, Fantuzzi, Iversen and Hulthen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Commission, on the use of antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are aware that the problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is growing."
"This is a problem within human health care, above all in cases where diseases that were previously relatively harmless are today tending to become extremely hard to cure using standard antibiotics."
"One of the reasons for this is the widespread use of antibiotics in both human and veterinary healthcare."
"But it is also due to the fact that we often use antibiotics routinely in order to prevent diseases or to cure ""minor' diseases, by mixing antibiotics in feedingstuffs and giving them to animals on a daily basis."
"Instead, we could employ good herd management and a good environment for the animals."
"Then it is possible to forgo the use of antibiotics in animal feed."
"It is also probably true to say that we must not hide a poor animal environment by curing the animals daily with a dose of antibiotics."
"This is the wrong way to handle the means we have at our disposal."
"But aside from the fact that it is justifiable to remove antibiotics from an animal welfare perspective, we must also restrict their use as far as possible so that in future we shall be able to use antibiotics to combat bacterial diseases in humans."
"We must therefore strive to prevent the routine use of antibiotics - and also other medicinal preparations - in feed either as growth promoters or to prevent disease."
"I believe it is important that we should obtain more research and produce more evidence in this field."
"We already know a great deal today, but we can never be too sure."
"One argument that I often hear is precisely that there is no conclusive proof."
"But even if some people think that we do not have sufficient knowledge, the duty of care should be applied in this context, in other words, even the suspicion that this might in the long term lead to difficult human health problems should mean that we now stop using antibiotics in feedingstuffs."
"Some Member States introduced this type of ban long ago."
"We know from experience that this has been successful: production can be equally efficient, even if more care is exercised with regard to the animals' environment."
"Once again I would like to put this question to the Commission and to Commissioner Fischler: What does the Commission intend to do to increase knowledge about the link between in-feed antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria?"
"Does the Commission intend to prepare measures to reduce or prohibit the use of in-feed antibiotics within the Union?"
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, antibiotics are a good example of the way in which an invention that was a blessing can turn into a genetic time bomb."
"Invented and used in the Second World War, at first on the Allied side, it was a blessing in their care for the wounded, then used in the case of serious illnesses and in operations on people to save lives by using a medicine ""against life' - antibioticum which is equal to anti-life - subsequently spilling over into veterinary treatment as well, but finally generating a flood of prescriptions now that doctors resort to antibiotics whenever anyone gets a cold."
"What is interesting is that dangerous bacteria are not on the retreat as a result and are not checkmated over the long term by this medicine."
"Instead these bacteria are reacting, they are reacting with mutations, they are reacting with resistance."
"In turn, the response to this has always been to develop new antibiotics, and the wheel turns faster and faster."
"And then things go completely mad: now people have begun to make use of this means of prolonging life, that is so important for injured and ill people, as a prophylactic or preventive ingredient in animal food, because this medicine overcomes latent illnesses in herds of animals and above all does so in herds which are not kept in an appropriate and ecological manner, where serious mistakes are made in stock-keeping."
"In these cases, the antibiotics exercise their greatest effect in improving yield because they suppress illnesses which would otherwise break out."
"Now the circle is being closed even more quickly."
"We are observing the development of resistance here as well, in the case of animals, in the prophylactic field."
"New antibiotics are being invented with ever greater speed, at ever shorter intervals."
"We have a great raft of antibiotics which are no longer effective in the case of most animal illnesses."
"A time bomb is ticking away because, although there is no direct connection between antibiotics in animals and in human beings, there is an indirect one in the way in which ""life' becomes resistant to applied medicines and then threatens us in the shape of disease germs."
"Commissioner, all this could take on the same dimensions as BSE."
"I think that there is an urgent necessity for the Commission to turn to scientific work and in the first instance to take the preventive action that Sweden has already taken, namely banning prophylactic use in animal food, and for us to develop scientific bases in order to hold our own in WTO negotiations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, approximately 80 % of the antibiotics produced around the world intended for animals are administered in animal feed."
"That is the conclusion of a report by the ""Commission Interprofessionnelle et Interministériel de l'Alimentation Animale' in France, a body responsible for animal nutrition."
"In other words, almost all complete feedingstuffs for animals are supplemented with antibiotics."
"Since the BSE crisis, consumers no longer find it acceptable for animals to be systematically fed with foods that invariably contain antibiotics. The risks are obvious according to recent WHO studies which show that, as we have already heard, the systematic use of antibiotics during fattening can have harmful effects, such as the emergence of strains of bacteria which have become resistant to antibiotics and are very difficult to eliminate."
"The joint resolution therefore asks the Commission to take advantage of the experience of the Member States which have prohibited some antibiotics in order to check if all antibiotics used in animal nutrition are harmless."
"At the same time it also asks the Commission to define stringent scientific standards possibly prohibiting the use of such substances as food additives, or even as drugs, and to ensure that the prohibition also applies to imports from third countries."
"This all arises by virtue of the crucial precautionary principle. Compliance with that principle must be formally stated in the revised directive, in order to protect not only the health and safety of consumers but also the interests of farmers."
"That is all I have to say with regard to the content of the resolution, but I would like to add that, for this approach to be completely logical, it is not enough to stop using antibiotics in animal feed in order to protect the health and safety of the consumer."
"It is also necessary to enforce the directive on maximum residue limits in meat. Even if animals are not regularly fed on foods supplemented with antibiotics, the maximum admissible antibiotic doses may possibly still be exceeded during treatment of these animals."
"So it is also necessary to reinforce the tests for antibiotic residues in meat and carcasses produced in the European Union and imported from third countries."
"This is based on the same understanding which leads us to oppose countries which, for example, continue to allow the use of hormones as permanent growth factors in animal husbandry, which European consumers do not want."
"I therefore believe we would do well to support amendments which complement the resolution in that respect."
"Finally, I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler a question."
"I understand, Commissioner, that the Commission has arranged for studies to be carried out on the antibiotic resistance of micro-organisms and on antibiotic residues in meat, and this, if my information is correct, within the framework of promises of veterinary transparency made during the work of the committee of enquiry on BSE."
"Would it possible, Commissioner, for us to see those reports?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having witnessed the havoc caused by mad cow disease and the great feeling it rightly aroused in our fellow European citizens, we no longer have any right to compromise on what is called the precautionary principle."
"It is absolutely necessary for serious research to be carried out with the greatest despatch in order to establish whether antibiotics used in animal feeding, in hospitals and for medical purposes are in any way responsible for the disquieting antibiotic resistance that is emerging."
"In fact, tuberculosis is reappearing all over Europe and anxiety is being expressed at a scientific level."
"If a serious bacterial epidemic were to occur tomorrow, we would perhaps no longer have the means to combat the disease and the risks it represents."
"It is therefore necessary to speed up the work currently being carried out by the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition."
"Pending the adoption of European regulations, each country should also organize epidemiological surveillance of antibiotic resistance, according to the use of antibiotics in animal production. This would encourage the reasonable use of antibiotics until more stringent regulations are adopted and would restrict the overall quantities used, as recommended by the World Health Organization."
"Above all, it would encourage efforts to improve hygiene in animal production, as Mr Olsson said earlier. Antibiotics must not be used as a means to compensate for bad production methods."
"Furthermore, it is also necessary to control the use of antibiotics by general practitioners in hospitals, because we all know that the total quantity of antibiotics used in human medications is far greater than the quantity of antibiotics used as additives in animal food."
"We must also ensure that the proposed regulations put an end to existing distortions of competition within the single market."
"Mrs Barthet-Mayer has very opportunely reiterated the need to make the testing of residues in meat standard at European level."
"And, of course, we must work within the World Trade Organization to ensure that the rules we impose upon ourselves in the interests of human health are not only applied in Europe, but also in third countries which supply us with meat and cattle feed."
"Under these circumstances, and as these opinions are broadly shared by all the Members who have spoken, this group, which is joint signatory of the joint resolution, supports it and will also support the amendments tabled by the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations which Mrs Barthet-Mayer moved earlier."
"Mr President, I participated fully in the drafting of this joint motion for a resolution on antibiotics in animal feed."
"I would hope that, after this debate, the House will give it its full support."
"Medicated feed or feed containing pre-mixed antibiotic additives have one very definitive purpose on large units: to treat sick animals."
"Such feed should only be used for this therapeutic purpose; they should only be used under strict licence and under strict supervision."
"This is the only practical way to administer treatment in the case of a disease outbreak in large units."
"For example, it would be almost impossible to treat a pig-breeding and fattening unit of, say, 5 0-10 000 pigs in any other way than in feed and drinking water."
"It would not be possible to catch and inject thousands of pigs every day for perhaps a week."
"So applying treatment through the feed is the only way in practice."
"However, strict rules and codes of practice must apply to all such use."
"Indeed, I am happy to say that in most Member States I know this system already applies."
"I feel there are many elements in such a code of conduct, a few of which might be outlined as follows."
"Medicated pre-mixes and compounds can only be manufactured by registered compounders on receipt of a veterinary prescription from the state veterinary services, giving full details of the numbers of animals to be treated, the withdrawal periods and the sizes of the batch."
"Only the tonnage specified on the official prescription should be manufactured."
"Batch numbers of this feed must be carefully recorded from manufacturer through to final farm delivery and use in order to ensure maximum traceability."
"Medication must not be incorporated into feed to be used for animals within one month of slaughter."
"The locked-box or locked-store system must apply to the manufacturer and on the farm where the feed is to be stored and used."
"All transporters, lorries and storage bins must be fully flushed before reuse with unmedicated feed."
"Residue testing, pre mortem, through urine and blood samples, and post mortem, through kidney and meat sampling, must be carried out by the competent veterinary authorities to ensure maximum food safety."
"The use of medicated feed for prophylactic or growth-promotion reasons cannot continue to feature in management, as is the case in some feeding systems and in some Member States at present."
"These farms should be given a limited period to change this practice and find alternative methods."
"Medicated feed must not be used to support or underpin poor farm management or weak animal health and welfare standards."
"It should be noted that the overuse and misuse of antibiotics is not confined to farmers and the agricultural industry: there is plenty of evidence that the medical profession does not have clean hands when it comes to over-prescription."
"Nevertheless, the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry should never compromise or put at risk the health of human beings."
"Misuse of antibiotics in prophylactics or in therapy can never replace good management."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, antibiotics are used in animal husbandry in two forms: by introducing antibiotics into animal feed and by using antibiotics for therapeutic purposes in veterinary medicine."
"With regard to EC regulations, we already have a directive which establishes a list of authorized additives for use in animal feed and a regulation which defines a Community procedure establishing the maximum residue limits for veterinary drugs in foods of animal origin."
"As it is quite conceivable that the excessive use of antibiotics can lead to the development of resistance to antibiotics, not only in animals but also in humans, it is necessary to implement a policy limiting their use to an absolute minimum."
"For that purpose, it is therefore necessary not only to control the use of antibiotics in nutrition, but also their use for therapeutic purposes."
"We must therefore take into account maximum residue limits for pharmacologically active substances in foods of animal origin, including meat, fish, milk, eggs and honey."
"These maximum residue limits must be established on the basis of the precautionary principle, in order to protect public health."
"In this respect, I condemn the ambiguous attitude which is prevalent in the European Union."
"For example, some antibiotics authorized by Community regulations as coccidiostat are prohibited in Sweden as additives in foods intended for animals, but are authorized as veterinary drugs, and do not comply with Community regulations relating to the evaluation of maximum residue limits."
"Those maximum limits are essential to ensure that veterinary drugs are used correctly in accordance with veterinary prescriptions, whereas the use of additives is tightly controlled by regulations and checked within foodstuffs."
"Consequently, we ask the Commission immediately to demand the enforcement of the maximum residue limits in all Member States."
"The enforcement of these standards must also be ensured with regard to all imports of foods of animal origin from nonCommunity countries, including meat, fish, milk, eggs and honey."
"The residue standards must be clearly defined within the framework of international agreements and particularly in the WTO agreement."
"I repeat that animal production has a very important place in European agriculture, and production conditions must not be imposed on producers which render them no longer competitive with imported products from third countries which do not comply with the same conditions or constraints."
"In this matter, we must not restrict ourselves to examining the use of antibiotics in animal food, but rather adopt a more global approach and include in our analysis the antibiotics used in veterinary medicine."
"If scientific research shows that the development of antibiotic resistance is due to the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry, we will have to ensure that everyone complies with resistance standards in order to protect the interests of European farmers and European consumers, and that means not just producers in all the Member States of the European Union, but also all imports from third countries."
"Mr President, during the part-session in Strasbourg in February, a significant step was taken towards healthier feedingstuffs."
"This was secured by the European Parliament voting in favour of an amendment - of which I was the author - to the Poisson report on a ban covering the use of antibiotics in feedingstuffs with specific nutritional purposes."
"The many reports on the possible health consequences are too serious to be ignored."
"As stated earlier in this debate, the use of antibiotics carries the inherent danger of bacteria becoming resistant."
"They become resistant to medicines used to cure sick people."
"We are courting a situation where many people will die from diseases that could easily have been treated with antibiotics."
"Further, it is a recognized fact that as long as farmers ensure high standards of hygiene in animal husbandry, the use of antibiotics is completely unnecessary."
"An important point for future agricultural policy reform will be to ensure that regulations on animal husbandry will render the use of antibiotics superfluous."
"Currently, several Member States have already banned the use of antibiotics in feedingstuffs, in some cases on the basis of analysis results available from the WHO."
"These analyses demonstrate that the use of antibiotics can be extremely costly in terms of treating human diseases."
"The WHO therefore recommends stopping the use of antibiotics."
"One of the EU's distinctive marks is the free movement of goods."
"All Member States should be free to sell their goods within the EU."
"This implies that we have a responsibility and a duty to assure consumers that goods are produced responsibly."
"Consumers should be able to choose EU products confidently without having to worry about whether production methods could wreak havoc on citizens' health, a catastrophe that could result in many more deaths than the BSE crisis, with far more widespread impact."
"In this regard, we must not forget that the EU is part of the world market, too."
"It is a matter of concern that in many parts of the world large doses of antibiotics are used in feedingstuffs as growth stimulants for animals."
"Of course it is important to tighten up EU regulations."
"However, we should also focus on improving regulations in the global market."
"I have three main requests."
"The first is to ask the Council to take note of the recommendation by the House for a ban covering the use of antibiotics in feedingstuffs with special nutritional purposes."
"My second main point is that at the earliest possible opportunity, the Commission should prepare a list of the most harmful types of antibiotic growth stimulants and have them banned."
"Eventually, all these types of antibiotics should ideally be put on the list of banned substances so that we can put a stop to the use of these health hazards."
"I would like to encourage the Commissioner and the Commission to begin focusing on alternative methods of animal husbandry to replace and render superfluous the present consumption of antibiotic growth stimulants."
"These are steps that must be taken if we are to be able to look European consumers in the eye."
"The European Parliament must help ensure that healthy food will not become a meaningless phrase."
"Finally, allow me to ask the Commissioner to explain firstly what is going to be done to promote more sustainable and humane animal husbandry."
"Secondly, when can we expect tangible results from research into the use of antibiotics in animal feed?"
"What types of monitoring and preventative measures has the Commission introduced in the meantime?"
"Thirdly, is the Commission currently working on a revision of the relevant directive on the use of antibiotics in animal feed?"
"Fourthly, as a consequence of this, is the Commission currently considering proposing a ban on the use of antibiotics in animal feed?"
"Today, we are voting on a joint motion for a resolution."
"I would like to encourage everyone to do so."
"We are taking a somewhat cautious step, but it is a step in the right direction towards better, healthier food."
"However, it is also absolutely crucial for the Commission to understand the issues involved and to come up with a positive response."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to present the position of the Commission in relation to the problems of medicinal residues in animal foods and the use of anti-microbial medicines - I am referring in this context to a larger group of medicines, not only antibiotics - in animal nutrition."
"The recent report from the National Consumer Council entitled ""Farm policies and our food - the need for change' was mentioned in the questions."
"That report is known to us and is currently being studied in detail by the Commission's various services."
"As you know, measures for the monitoring of certain substances and certain residues in live animals and their products are regulated by Council Directive 23/96."
"This requires Member States to draw up residue plans every year as certification of veterinary medicines, including anti-bacterial substances, pesticides and environmental contaminants."
"Compliance with maximum values for the above-mentioned substances, set on a Community-wide basis, has to be monitored within the framework of these monitoring plans."
"The directive provides for targeted controls specifically in relation to the use of antibiotics for fattening animals."
"Article 8 of the directive provides that from 1998, in other words from this year onwards, Member States must publish the results of their investigations of residues."
"In the coming year, the Commission will present a report to Parliament and the Council on the basis of the results submitted by the Member States."
"If the specified maximum values are exceeded in the case of animal foods which are imported from third countries, Council Directive 675/90 provides that a strengthened and targeted check must be made of several successive consignments from the same origin at the external borders of the Community."
"Now to the question of anti-microbial medicines in feedingstuffs."
"The ban on antibiotics which has been called for by the Parliament has already been explicitly incorporated into the proposal for a directive on feedingstuffs for particular nutritional purposes, so that the use of antibiotics is now regulated solely by the directive on additives, Directive 524/70."
"In the intervening years, this directive has been modified five times in the interests of increasing consumer safety."
"I shall not go into the details of the many and often complicated requirements which have been laid down for the production, trading and use of additives."
"One thing is clear in relation to the question which we are discussing today: when manufacturers make an application, they have to give not only technical information but also details of residues and indicate whether risks to human health may arise from the use of antibiotics."
"Before the Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs gives its approval to any use, manufacturers' applications are also examined by the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition."
"The following medicines are currently approved on a Community-wide basis for certain types of animal: Pacitracin, Spiramycin, Virginiamycin, Flavophospholipol, Thylosin, Monensin, Salinomycin and Avilamycin."
"Virginiamycin for piglets, Pacitracin for chickens and piglets and Avilamycin for turkeys may be approved by Member States, but do not have to be."
"Although these three substances do not yet fulfill all the criteria for use with these types of animal, there is so far no indication that the substances mentioned represent a risk to animal or human health."
"The Commission has proved in the past that it will ban additives if there is a scientifically justified suspicion of a risk to human beings or animals."
"That has been demonstrated inter alia by the fact that we have banned 16 antibiotics in all since 1970."
"Those most recently banned were, as you know, Avoparcin and Artacin."
"The Commission will continue to examine carefully any indications that resistant strains may be formed and that these may be transferable from one animal to another or from animals to human beings."
"The most recent modification of the additives directive provides that all substances approved before 1988 will have to undergo a systematic re-examination from September 2000."
"This applies in all to six of the eight substances mentioned."
"Moreover, from 1 October 1999, approvals will be given only for a maximum of ten years, and will be Community-wide."
"There will then no longer be national approvals as are currently possible in the case of Virginiamycin, Pacitracin and Avolamycin."
"In its accession treaty, it was conceded that Finland could maintain its ban on Spiramycin and Tylosin until 1997."
"Under its accession treaty, Sweden may maintain its general ban on antibiotics and other anti-microbial substances in animal food until the end of this year."
"Before the expiry of these deadlines, the Commission will decide on a possible Community-wide ban, on the basis of scientific arguments to be submitted by Finland and Sweden."
"I am afraid that I have to inform you that the arguments so far submitted by Finland have failed to convince the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition."
"The arguments put forward by Sweden for a general ban in animal feedingstuffs are currently being examined by the multi-disciplinary working group on ""anti-microbial substances' ."
"On the basis of the protective clause in Article 11 of the additives directive, Virginiamycin was banned in Denmark in January of this year."
"However, the same Article 11 provides that appropriate and detailed arguments are to be put forward in relation to such bans by the Member States concerned, and that the Commission's Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs will decide on these arguments."
"It is clear to the Commission that neither our animal fatteners nor the additives manufacturers would accept a ban without appropriate scientific arguments."
"The fatteners would feel that they were at a disadvantage vis-à-vis their competitors outside Europe, and the manufacturers would overwhelm us with an avalanche of law-suits if the validity of our action could not be proven."
"International law also obliges us to apply scientific criteria."
"At the same time, we must take the fears of consumers into account."
"That is why we need a scientifically correct basis for our decisions."
"In well-founded cases of doubt the Commission can apply the precautionary principle, as indeed it did in the case of Avoparcin."
"In the context of its research programmes, the Commission is encouraging science to develop alternatives which might replace these antibiotics in animal feed in future."
"I would mention the term probiotics."
"A proposal for a first project is currently being considered by the relevant experts."
"I also expect a great deal from improvements to the conditions in which animals are kept."
"If these could be raised to the level of the best, the use of antibiotics for animal feed would a priori be of no economic interest."
"For its part, in order to acknowledge growing concern among consumers, the feedingstuffs industry has made known its readiness to carry out a programme to monitor developments in bacterial resistance."
"This monitoring, which is to begin over the next few days, will look at whether and to what extent there is any increase among economically useful animals in agriculture in bacterial strains that are resistant to medicines which are also partly used in veterinary medicine and some of which are part of the same family as antibiotics which are approved for human medicine."
"Some ECU 900 000 are being made available for this programme in the current year."
"In April 1998, in relation to the subject of resistance development, the Commission's Scientific Steering Committee agreed on the appointment of an inter-disciplinary working group which will probably submit relevant findings at the end of this year."
"In particular, the working group will deal with the problem of the increase in resistant strains as a multi-disciplinary task."
"In the process, there is to be a critical examination of all the fields of application in which antibiotically active substances are used, namely in human and veterinary medicine and in animal feed."
"The working group will look in detail at the following questions, inter alia: firstly, the use and misuse of anti-microbial medicines in animal and human medicine; secondly the use and misuse of anti-microbial medicines as additives; thirdly, the question of resistant and multi-resistant germs; and, finally, the factors responsible for the increase in resistant strains."
"In pursuing this initiative, the Steering Committee is following the direction which the World Health Organization suggested for this subject at its conference in October 1997 in Berlin."
"The working group's concluding scientific assessment will put the Commission in a position to assess the applications by various Member States relating to a ban on antibiotics in animal feed, on the basis of a solid scientific foundation."
"At the same time, consideration is to be given to the concerns felt by representatives of health-related professions and of consumers in relation to the development of resistant strains of bacteria."
"In those cases where the scientific risk assessment is uncertain or defective, the Commission will in any case allow itself to be guided by the precautionary principle."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his statement."
"However, there remains a great deal still to be done to allay the growing concerns amongst citizens across the European Union about the emergence of strains of bacteria resistant to most antibiotics due to overuse both for animals and human beings."
"When I wrote the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the Commission Green Paper on food legislation, this concern was reflected in the fact that not only was there no opposition to my proposal that antibiotics should only be used to treat illness in animals and not routinely as a prophylactic, but the wording was actually strengthened in the committee."
"It was agreed that high standards of animal welfare and husbandry are essential to eliminate any need for such prophylactic use of antibiotics."
"For the Party of European Socialists the essential issue here is human health rather than the possible effects on the meat market."
"We have all seen what can happen to the meat market when the safety of consumers is neglected, allegedly to protect the market."
"My group was nevertheless prepared to accept the joint resolution in its entirety, including paragraph 5, although not totally happy with that paragraph, in the interest of reaching the widest possible consensus."
"However, since the Europe of Nations Group has broken the consensus by putting down a number of amendments, the PSE feels justified in voting against paragraph 5 so that the joint resolution concentrates on the real issue concerning this House - the need to reduce the use of antibiotics in animals in the human food chain to the absolute minimum required to treat specific cases of disease in individual animals and herds whilst further research and exchange of information are carried out."
"Mr President, I also would like to thank Mr Fischler."
"Nothing reassures people so well as lengthy scientific discourse: doubts remain, nonetheless."
"It is a fact that antibiotics are used widely throughout the EU both for medical purposes in respect of animals and to speed up the growth of animals."
"As has been stated, bacteria become used to antibiotics after years of use and build up a resistance to them."
"In recent years the hypothesis has been put forward that these resistant bacteria can get into a meat-eater's bodily system and weaken that person's immunity to infectious disease."
"Although at the scientific level there is some dispute concerning this problem, which is difficult to examine, we must tackle the matter now."
"Some vets think that the use of antibiotics as a growth stimulant must be unconditionally prohibited."
"There is no real water-tight proof as yet, but it is true that a person who is treading warily at one end of the food chain does not really know how many boxes of antibiotics he is about to savour the taste of when he orders his Chateaubriand or his McDonald's hamburger."
"Finland and Sweden, in their negotiations on joining the EU, received a special dispensation in respect of banning certain antibiotics in animal food."
"In many other countries, however, they use the so-called safe antibiotics, as listed by the Commission."
"The Commission realizes, as the Commissioner said, that it cannot ban all antibiotics without sufficient proof of serious harm to health."
"But just who can define what sort of harm is serious enough to adversely affect people's health?"
"Is not merely the fact that there is doubt enough?"
"The citizens of the Union move freely from one country to the other, on business or for pleasure."
"It is hard to believe that it is only the Finns and the Swedes that could have strict requirements pertaining to the quality of food."
"Consumers cannot be treated differently from one country to the next."
"I think the EU should most definitely adhere to a principle of caution, especially when it is a question of protecting the health of our citizens, and be strict in the use of antibiotics in animal feed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the issue dealt with by Mr Olsson and others of the use of antibiotics in animal feed is a timely one."
"The dispensation made in respect of Finland and Sweden is about to come to an end and the whole EU area must now consider how to approach the problem."
"I wish to thank Mr Fischler for his comprehensive response."
"Antibiotics are drugs which are this century's best discovery in the war against disease."
"All humanity has derived enormous benefit from them."
"However, microbes have the property to rapidly develop strains that are resistant to certain antibiotics."
"For that reason, drugs are constantly being developed to overcome the problem of such immune strains."
"With modern factory farming methods, however, the conditions of growth for animals are difficult."
"Very often the size of the rearing unit is large, space is cramped, and disease can easily spread."
"So there is an attempt to prevent the outbreak and spread of illness by, for example, introducing even more antibiotics into the animals' feed before any really serious disease manifests itself."
"This kind of indiscriminate use of antibiotics is common in the EU, but is even more so in powerful countries that practise industrial agriculture, like the USA."
"The result of this is that the use of antibiotics is so widespread that immune strains of microbe are being born at an ever increasing rate. This is considerably harmful to public health."
"That is why this issue is such a very important one at this time."
"The issue actually means taking a position on reforms for the whole of EU agricultural policy and the creation of a European agricultural policy."
"The question is whether we want to copy the American agricultural production model, with its large-scale use of antibiotics and hormones, which would mean pushing the issue of public health aside."
"Or do we want to evolve a European agricultural system which is both ecologically and ethically based on a sustainable programme, and produce, through broadly approved methods, high quality and healthy foods?"
"These are the alternatives that will be weighed at the AGENDA 2000 talks."
"The use of antibiotics in animal feed is a big problem that is tied to sustainable development."
"It is a shining example of how contemporary greed, in this case the desire for cheaper food, is seriously endangering the ability of future generations to combat illness caused by bacteria."
"That is why I give my support to the joint motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, the issue here is the problem of factory farming."
"Production is carried out in large units and economic considerations are thus often more important than people's health."
"Especially problematic in the EU is Holland's pig and chicken economy."
"We should now debate the use of antibiotics for fattening up animals."
"We have evidence that there is scanty scientific foundation for the use of growth hormones to fatten up animals."
"The use of growth hormones is forbidden in the EU area, but one and a half billion ecus worth of them are sold."
"The Nordic countries' line in this is a better one than that in the EU as a whole."
"The internal market is not protecting people's health."
"We have to recognize that the Commission does not have the resources to solve this problem."
"Surveillance is in the hands of the Member States and the Commission should in no way obstruct it."
"Mr President, we now know that antibiotics are our most important medicine and often the only means of curing bacterial diseases."
"At present, one of the greatest threats to public health world-wide - and also in the EU - comes from bacteria that have developed a resistance to antibiotics, due to incorrect and extremely liberal application of antibiotics. This applies especially to use in animals, but also, of course, to humans."
"The bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics and are spread from animals to humans, also via foodstuffs."
"I do not fully understand why the Commission cannot use the same arguments with regard to antibiotics in animal feed as are used on the question of hormones in the discussion with WHO, that is, that the precautionary principle should apply."
"We all know, of course, how incredibly difficult it can be to prove something by means of research, in other words, there has to be solid evidence, as stated by the Commission."
"Nevertheless , reports have been produced, one example being a WHO study in the autumn of 1997, which highlights four resistant bacteria - among them Salmonella and Coli bacteria - that cause major public health problems."
"It is said that these bacteria have had too much contact with antibiotics and have developed a defence and undergone genetic changes."
"We therefore have four exceptionally hazardous bacteria that are thriving here in Europe."
"We also know that the Swedish government and Swedish researchers, with support from international colleagues, have shown that at least one of these groups of bacteria - the Enterococci - has demonstrably acquired its resistance because of antibiotics in animal feed."
"I have now also read that the British parliament's agriculture committee has recently presented a report recommending an outright ban on antibiotics in animal feed."
"It is said that virtually conclusive evidence has been obtained that resistant bacteria can be transmitted to humans."
"I believe that this is an opportunity for the Commission to apply the precautionary principle, which I feel it should do."
"In the light of BSE, etcetera, there is no reason for us to accept the major risks that are posed by antibiotics in animal feed."
"In Sweden such use of antibiotics has been prohibited for the past ten years."
"So what have the farmers been forced to do?"
"Well, they have been forced to invest and work on a long-term basis to improve the environment and management of animals."
"The Commissioner did not directly mention animal production in Europe."
"And that is where the whole problem lies: the industrial manner in which we treat animals, the poor housing conditions, the large herds."
"It is clearly in this area that work must begin."
"In my opinion, this is what the Commission should be taking up the cudgels for: whether we are to have confidence in your agricultural policy for the consumers and for those who must eat the products that agriculture supplies."
"Mr President, the large-scale use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is giving cause for concern."
"Microbiologists have for some time been warning about the possibility of resistant bacteria finding their way into the human body through meat consumption."
"This might have the effect of making people resistant to human antibiotics."
"It is a very worrying development, particularly in cases where only one group of antibiotics will help."
"It is therefore very important that we restrict the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry."
"I am well aware that little is known about the possible risks posed by certain substances."
"The knowledge we have gained about the risk of resistance arising from the use of substances such as avoparcin does however mean that we should exercise caution in our dealings with other substances."
"Antibiotics must be available to fight sickness."
"What we need to do is question the continued administration of these medicinal products via animal feed, particularly substances that are closely related to human antibiotics."
"Restricting the use of antibiotics in animal feed must be accompanied by increased research into alternative feed savers."
"We should not forget that feed savers play a useful role."
"Research has shown that the Dutch livestock industry produces 6.5 % more nitrogen and phosphates without feed savers."
"Growth and feed conversion also drop 4 to 8 %."
"The industry itself has begun to develop alternatives such as organic acids and oligosaccharides."
"Europe should lend its full support to this type of research."
"It is also very important that we switch to a less intensive breeding programme that is less dependent on the prolonged use of medicinal products."
"The approval procedure for the use of antibiotics also needs to be tightened."
"In the light of all that has been said, it is remarkable that antibiotics can still be approved for use as a prophylactic without being tested for any risk of resistance."
"Whether they are used as a prophylactic or to treat illness, there are and there will remain antibiotics that carry a risk of resistance."
"Although antimicrobial agents to stimulate growth are necessary in the fight against infection, I would like to see them registered as medicinal products and therefore tested for resistance."
"Finally, the battle against resistant bacteria is not a lost cause."
"Research has shown that reducing the use of antibiotics brings a drop in the number of resistant bacteria."
"We should tackle this problem energetically - not least for reasons of public health."
"Mr President, we in the Socialist group warmly welcome this resolution, even though we feel that it could have been a little stricter."
"This debate has dealt mostly with the risks of antibiotic residues being transmitted to humans, but of course it is the animal 's health that is the major problem here."
"There are at least three reasons for restricting the use of antibiotics."
"The first reason has in principle been touched upon by all of the speakers here, namely that the excessive use of antibiotics can result in the development of resistant bacterial strains."
"This has been quite clearly proven from a medical viewpoint."
"There is, however, another reason that should be noted."
"This concerns the impact on immunological defence mechanisms in both animals and humans."
"For example, an increased incidence of allergies has been observed in humans in recent decades."
"The precise reasons for this are not known, but one conceivable theory is that it is due to the increased use of antibiotics in young children."
"This means that diseases that were previously left to the body's natural immunological defences to combat are now tackled with antibiotics."
"In this way, the immune defence is weakened."
"It is clear that the long-term effects of this process are completely unknown."
"The third reason for not using antibiotics is more speculative, but people have genuinely begun to wonder whether this too could in the long term impact on the genetic structures."
"There is, of course, no direct effect of antibiotics on the genes, but there is an indirect link insofar as antibiotics can affect natural selection, that is, nature's own evolutionary process."
"The longterm consequences of this are totally unknown."
"As many speakers have already stated, Sweden and Finland have for many years very wisely had a ban on antibiotics in animal feed."
"I genuinely believe that this resolution should include a few appreciative words about this wise policy."
"The only reference to be found in this resolution is in point 5, which contains a proposal from the Union for Europe Group that the Commission should investigate whether our ban has damaged the market for meat."
"I must say that this point - which we Socialists shall be voting against - quite clearly means that we look first and foremost to the interests of the market, with public health taking second place."
"It is evidently the case that both our citizens and everybody here believe that public health must be the prime consideration."
"I would like to conclude by saying that there is clearly a growing body of opinion within medical science against the use of antibiotics."
"The best solution would be a general ban on this use, failing which the next best option would be at least for those countries that already have such a ban to be permitted to maintain it in future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, as many have already stated, that the matter under debate poses even greater health risks than BSE."
"Besides discussing the fact that bacteria have become resistant, we might also note that they have, in certain cases, become more aggressive, for example in hospitals."
"Economics must not take precedence over health."
"The Commissioner brought both good and bad news in his speech."
"The good news was that once again we heard that the precautionary principle is to be observed."
"But the question is, exactly when and how will it be observed?"
"I believe that it is important to renew the directive on feed additives, starting with the aims that are set out in the resolution."
"Secondly, I applaud his comments on the interdisciplinary committee, which is to work through until the end of this year and look into the misuse of antibiotics."
"I only hope that the question will not be buried there, meaning that there is a delay in the overhaul of the directive on feed additives."
"The bad news was that Commissioner Fischler once again stated that Finland has unfortunately not produced sufficient evidence."
"Commissioner, might we not here too apply the precautionary principle in respect of the continuation of the bans imposed in Finland and Sweden?"
"A further piece of bad news, which was noted by the previous speaker a moment ago, was that there was no mention of a good animal environment."
"Is it not valuable in itself to ensure that animals have a good environment?"
"It is a political decision that is needed."
"History is being repeated: we pay general lip service to good animal health and the precautionary principle, but when it comes down to money and legislation this ceases to apply."
"We have heard an extremely comprehensive enumeration of various mucins."
"We must not forget, however, that there is also a risk of cross-resistance."
"We cannot place our trust in a technical classification which states that certain substances can be prohibited and others permitted."
"Finally, I would like to thank all of the other groups that have so ably given their support to the initiative taken in this debate by my colleague Mr Olsson and the ELDR, enabling us collectively to put pressure on the Commission in this matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to express my sincere gratitude for the fact that the position which I have presented here on behalf of the Commission has generated so many positive reactions."
"I believe that through the policy which it has pursued over the years the Commission has proved that it is ready to take account of the precautionary principle."
"It will naturally continue to do so in future."
"I should like to deal only briefly with a few things."
"Firstly, several speakers have raised the question of multi-resistance and cross-resistance."
"In this connection I would like to stress that these phenomena in particular have a great deal to do with the manner in which antibiotics are sometimes used in human medicine, to which for example Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf rightly referred."
"We should be in no doubt that it is important to avoid the occurrence of additional risk as a result of the use of such substances in feedingstuffs."
"But the impression should not be given that the use of antibiotics in feedingstuffs is the sole cause of the problems which we face today."
"Secondly, I would like to remind you - as I already explained in my statement - that an evaluation is under way of what was conceded to Finland and Sweden in the accession treaty, and that there will be a conclusive evaluation during the current year."
"Thirdly, I would like to remind you that the Scientific Steering Committee has appointed a multi-disciplinary working group which is to deliver scientific results by the end of this year."
"The Commission will of course subsequently submit an overall evaluation of the opinion of the scientific committees to Parliament as quickly as possible."
"All the scientific results will, of course, also be accessible to you."
"We want to be transparent, and that is why there are no problems at all with this."
"I believe, however, that we should certainly not give the impression that we now want to put the scientists under pressure; the scientists need a certain amount of time in order to be able to carry out this evaluation."
"We must ensure that they have this time."
"Finally, I would also like to stress that the example of Avoparcin in particular has demonstrated our readiness to act appropriately whenever any cause for suspicion arises which prompts such an action."
"We would be truly ill-advised to act without a scientific basis, because if we did we would probably fail and in the process do great damage to agriculture and also the food industry."
"In conclusion, I would like to stress the following: whenever we are considering the extent to which such additives may be used, we should not overlook the true cause of the problem which is to be found at least in part in the mass rearing of animals."
"For that reason, in connection with the proposals which we have put forward in Agenda 2000 for the area of investment assistance for agricultural businesses, we shall pay particular attention to the principle which we have embodied there, namely giving greater assistance to especially animal-friendly and species-appropriate animal-rearing, in the development and elaboration of rural development programmes."
"As far as possible, we must jointly take this approach into account because the use of these types of anti-microbial substances will then become less and less interesting from an economic point of view."
"Mr President, please allow me to put one more brief question to Commissioner Fischler."
"I would like to know whether this multi-disciplinary working group which is being appointed by the Steering Committee will also deal with the problem that, as a result of genetic manipulation, resistance to antibiotics is being produced willy-nilly, and more or less as a waste product."
"There are investigations which demonstrate that a bacterial strain which is resistant to antibiotics is being specifically developed in milk processing to ensure that residues which may possibly occur in the milk are not effective."
"Will these problems be investigated by this working group as well?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first of all to thank Commissioner Fischler for his replies."
"They were, in my view, extremely comprehensive and, on certain points, quite satisfactory."
"As far as the residues problem is concerned, I believe that we are, for the most part, in agreement."
"I would also like to thank all of those Members who have made extremely positive contributions to this debate."
"It appears that there is a large measure of understanding in Parliament with regard to what we are doing here."
"I am, however, at the same time a little uneasy."
"I would therefore like to put one question to the Commissioner."
"The fact is, he said that a good animal environment may mean that we do not need to use antibiotics."
"I have great respect for scientific research and share the Commissioner's view that we must have this, but the choice between having a good animal environment or making use of research is actually a political choice."
"This question needs to be pursued both in Parliament and within the Commission."
"Does the Commissioner not back this point of view?"
"Mr President, I wonder if the Commissioner would be so good as to answer the following question?"
"If Sweden and Finland - and Denmark, too, where these matters have also been considered - wish to maintain a ban on antibiotics, will the Commission permit the EU Court of Justice to judge in these matters, or what exactly did you have in mind?"
"I have the impression that you not exactly enamoured with the idea of applying the precautionary principle."
"Mr President, I shall deal first of all with the question raised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. A definitive decision is currently being taken in this multi-disciplinary working group about all the subjects which can and should be dealt with."
"The list of subjects is already extensive."
"The identification of the factors involved in anti-microbial resistance is one of the questions which needs to be clarified."
"It would be entirely appropriate to deal with your concern under this item."
"I shall pass the point on to the relevant units in DG XXIV."
"Secondly, our aim is not to have the European Court of Justice decide; rather, we want to have both the Swedish and the Finnish application evaluated by scientists in the first instance."
"We should not pre-empt the result but wait to see what result emerges from this scientific evaluation."
"Now, I will consider the question from Mr Olsson. I do not believe that this is really a matter in which research is necessary."
"I believe that there is already a great deal of knowledge in relation to the conditions under which animals are kept."
"It is more a matter of creating an economic environment which makes it possible for farmers to put these animal-friendly rearing methods into practice."
"In my view, the truth is that the more species-appropriate a system of animal rearing, the lower the vets' bills are, although there are higher investment costs to be faced."
"If we therefore provide for greater assistance to these methods of rearing compared with other methods in the context of our new Agenda, the incentive to switch to such methods will be greater."
"However, insofar as additional research is necessary within the framework of the current research programmes, if appropriate projects are submitted by the Member States and by the different research bodies, there is, of course, nothing to prevent further investigations being carried out."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Joint motion for a resolution on antibiotics in animal feed"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Audit of certain aspects of German reunification measures (Court of Auditors report)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0144/98) by Mr Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 4/97 concerning the audit of certain aspects of German reunification measures involving EAGGF compensation payments and export refunds, together with the Commission's replies (C40348/97)."
"Mr President, Mr Garriga Polledo cannot be with us today for medical reasons, so he has authorized me to present his report on the Court of Auditors' Special Report, auditing certain aspects of German reunification, in relation to compensation payments and export refunds made during 1992."
"The Court of Auditors' Special Report analyses the measures taken to integrate the agriculture of the former German Democratic Republic into the common agricultural policy in three sectors: the eradication of leucosis; export refunds in the beef and veal sector; and the reduction of milk production."
"The Court of Auditors comes to the conclusion that there has been, firstly, a cumulation of subsidies in the three cases, although it does not quantify the amounts involved."
"A simple example of this cumulation of subsidies is provided by analysing and listing the measures adopted in order to eradicate enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL)."
"Let us examine the refunds paid for beef export and the compensation granted for the reduction of milk production, as a consequence of applying the quota system. The animal suffering from the disease is slaughtered and compensation is given."
"Similarly, the slaughter of the animal is entered into the accounts as reduction of milk production, and payment is provided again, on this basis."
"Lastly, since the animal had not developed the disease and is considered fit for sale outside the EU - to prevent falling prices in the Community market - it is exported and another payment is made for export."
"Mention is also made of irregularities in the leucosis eradication programme."
"In the financial checks on the EBL eradication programme in the new Länder it was found that animals slaughtered prior to 1991 had been included in the programme, compensation claims had been submitted for animals which had not been slaughtered, double claims had been made for the same animal, and claims had been presented for animals slaughtered at the wrong time."
"I would emphasize that the Commission has imposed the appropriate financial corrections."
"In analysing the situation, Parliament's resolution of 4 April 1990 has to be kept in mind. This underlines the role the Commission should play to facilitate unification, and its participation in the expenditure for the reconstruction of the economy of the Federal Republic of Germany, so as to display solidarity with its people."
"The Court of Auditors overlooks the political objective decided upon by Germany and approved by the Commission and the Council: to integrate the five new Länder into the Community."
"That implies the full application of the common agricultural policy, retrospectively and with no transitional period, all of which should be done at the least possible cost to the Community and without disrupting the common market."
"The market situation in the Federal Republic of Germany was serious, especially in the beef and veal sector."
"The task was not at all easy, but there can only be one conclusion: the operation was a success."
"And the leucosis eradication programmes have been investigated and the correct fines imposed. Also, financial corrections have been made for the exports and for certain irregularities."
"As for the cumulation of subsidies, there is no objection to providing compensation for the slaughter of an animal and again for exporting its meat."
"In the first case the aid goes to the owner and in the second, to the exporter."
"The same is also true of counting the slaughter of the animal as reduction of milk production."
"The allowances are intended for different purposes in the three cases."
"By coincidence they are juxtaposed, but it is clear that each form of assistance has its own legal base and objective."
"Finally, throughout the whole Court of Auditors' report the point of view is much too narrow."
"Many specific considerations have not been taken into account, such as the absence of a transitional period and the retrospective nature of certain measures."
"For all those reasons, Mr President, we must congratulate Germany and the European institutions, since the political objective has been achieved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, on 15 May 1998, we are dealing with a historic event that took place over eight years ago: German unification."
"This was and remains a historic event."
"Let us deal with a quite minor side issue which came about only as a result of this situation."
"We have often dealt with matters which took place long ago, but it only really makes sense to do so if there is a danger that the event with which we are dealing constantly recurs in a similar form because there is a failure in the system."
"Such a danger does not exist in this case, according to the information from the Commission and the Court of Auditors, which we have discussed at great length and in considerable detail in committee."
"The Court of Auditors itself has said, in response to a question from the chairman of our committee, that it is very improbable that a similar situation will arise again."
"To that extent, the whole matter is of historical significance, even if the report itself does not fully attain the historical significance of German unification, without wishing to offend the rapporteur."
"What we are dealing with is the past."
"But I should like to offer a few observations, to the Court of Auditors rather than to the Commission. If you are dealing with this type of occurrence - and you cannot just sweep everything under the carpet because of the particular historic situation - you ought instead perhaps to complete the reports a little faster."
"It is typical that we are only now dealing with it."
"The reason is not that we were so slow, but that it took an infinite amount of time to progress from the first criticism of events, which cannot be denied, to a report from the Court of Auditors, and to the completion of this report and its submission to us."
"That happens quite often, and that is why I really want to criticize this aspect alone."
"If the Court of Auditors wants to make a sound contribution to our work, it must, like Parliament, have an interest in ensuring that our discussions take place as near to the time concerned as possible, so that justified criticism is not rejected with the argument that everything happened at some point in the past, and that it has all changed since then."
"It is not always as easy, as in this case, to check whether everything really has changed since then."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, even though he is not here today, for the work that he has done."
"Now we can all draw the same conclusions from it: if we had received the report somewhat sooner, we could have dealt with it sooner, and there might have been greater interest in it than there is today."
"The report was unanimously approved in committee."
"There are no amendments."
"I would say that Mr Fabra Vallés has given us a thorough presentation of the facts of the matter, and we can only endorse that presentation."
"Mr President, I understand that Germany is a big net payer to the EU."
"I quite understand that the Germans would like more out of the EU for their membership subscription."
"It is natural that if eleven billion ecus of German money goes on the needs of others, they should wish to make a smaller contribution to the EU budget."
"What I do not understand is why Germany is swindling the EU out of its money."
"The basic contention by the Court of Auditors is that the same cows have been paid for twice over."
"I think Mr Garriga Polledo is splitting hairs in his report."
"He says that those who have received overlapping funds have not necessarily been the same people."
"The main problem is that the same cows have been paid for twice over."
"Policy has to be implemented under the terms of EU regulations."
"It is still unclear to me whether leucosis-infected beef is being sold to Russia or other trade partners of the former GDR."
"This has not been denied either in the Court of Auditors' report or in this one."
"If it has been going on, which I doubt, it is an absolutely reprehensible matter."
"I would have liked the report to enlighten me on this."
"We know how, after the BSE slaughter, much meat at compensated prices was exported from Britain."
"In Holland ten million pigs have died from swine fever, and in Germany one million."
"I wonder what happened to the meat after the swine fever slaughter."
"Did the Commission monitor the proper use of this meat?"
"I greatly appreciate Mr Fischler's work in this matter, and I will leave it up to him to explain what happened to the meat after the swine fever slaughter."
"I do not understand how the report could have been accepted in its present unsatisfactory form."
"The rapporteur does not know why Germany does not have to pay back the eleven million ecus demanded by the Commission, but only one million."
"This ought to have been cleared up before the report was approved."
"Mr President, we should undoubtedly acknowledge that certain objectives which are listed in this balanced report have been achieved without major additional expenditure being incurred by the Community."
"I should like to emphasize the fact that, in this case, the Community has made a welcome contribution to integrating agriculture in the new Länder into the structures of the common agricultural policy."
"The fact that the Community has shared in the costs of re-structuring the economy of the GDR and has provided proof of its solidarity with the people of the GDR in this way is very much to be welcomed."
"It is all the more regrettable that the report by the Court of Auditors also indicates certain tendencies towards mismanagement on the part of the Commission in this very delicate area."
"In addition to considerable delays in controls and wrongly paid subsidies, individual assistance programmes were not even properly coordinated with one another."
"The Court of Auditors thus complains in its report that farmers could have claimed three different subsidies for the slaughter of one of their animals, which would have made multiple payments possible."
"Such cumulations of subsidies must be avoided at all costs in the future, particularly bearing in mind the massive organizational challenges which the Union will have to face in the near future."
"How can citizens in the Member States otherwise be expected to gain confidence in the European Union in the face of the serious shortcomings that constantly occur?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Garriga Polledo sincerely for his report on the Court of Auditors' Special Report on the audit of certain aspects of German reunification measures in 1990 and 1991."
"There is no need for me to emphasize how difficult and complex German reunification was in its entirety."
"I am sure that there is no need either for me to emphasize that reunification was the only correct decision in this historically unique situation."
"We had to integrate the new federal German Länder into Community law without a transitional period."
"As far as the common agricultural policy in particular was concerned, the process was far from straightforward, as you can imagine."
"I am grateful to Mr Garriga Polledo for his explicit recognition of this fact in his report."
"In all, three measures were adopted for the integration of the former GDR: firstly, funding of the programme for the slaughter of cattle which were infected with enzootic bovine leucosis; secondly, the introduction of a regulation on the disposal of the meat through special export refunds, since this meat is quite suitable for human consumption; and thirdly, compensatory payment for the slaughter of animals to comply with the milk quota."
"These measures fully accorded with Parliament's resolution on reunification in April 1990."
"In its report, the Court of Auditors puts forward the view that there was a cumulation of subsidies and irregularities in the application of the programmes because the measures overlapped."
"It also finds fault with the fact that there was no qualitative differentiation in the special export refunds."
"However, it has to be borne in mind in this respect that the stock of East German cattle was simply too big for it to have been possible to comply with the milk quota regulation from the outset."
"The stock was also partly affected by bovine leucosis."
"The Commission had to get to grips with the difficult situation quickly, and implemented the three measures which I have mentioned."
"Different assistance conditions applied in each case for the measures in question."
"As a result, the number of animals affected was clearly not always the same, and similarly the number of those receiving assistance was not the same."
"The fact that all three measures benefited some animals does not constitute a contravention of the provisions of Community law."
"That is why, in the Commission's view, the Court of Auditors is totally unjustified in its conclusion that there was an inadmissible cumulation of subsidies."
"As far as the irregularities are concerned - this also applies to point 5 of the draft resolution - the Commission has provided for a financial correction for Germany in the sum of DM 6.9 million after considering all the available data."
"The Commission is currently in the process of collecting this amount from the German government and in December 1997 it deducted half of the amount - to be specific, DM 3.4 million - from payments for the eradication plan for 1996."
"The other half will be deducted in the same way in the second half of 1998 from payments for the eradication plan for 1997."
"As regards the failure to differentiate qualitatively in the export refunds, the Commission points out that healthy and normal commercial quality is the only available criterion for export refunds, so that there was no case for any more detailed differentiation."
"I am glad that the rapporteur largely supports most of the Commission's arguments, particularly in relation to the cumulation mentioned by the Court of Auditors, and that he has endorsed them."
"In order to prevent delays in on-the-spot financial controls in the framework of the EBL eradication plans, the Commission immediately introduced special controls after learning of possible irregularities in this area."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has at its disposal only limited resources for on-the-spot controls from programmes which are cofinanced."
"However, it has set itself ambitious objectives in this area."
"I should also like to add that systematic administrative controls are being constantly carried out, particularly by comparing technical reports from the Member States with the final financial reports."
"In conclusion, I should like to offer the rapporteur my sincere thanks for his acknowledgement of the problems which the Commission had to overcome in this difficult situation in connection with the integration of the former GDR into the common agricultural policy."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Combined heat and power"
"The next item is the report (A4-0145/98) by Mrs Estevan Bolea, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a Community strategy to promote combined heat and power (CHP) and to dismantle barriers to its development (COM(97)0514 - C4-0596/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and heat, or electricity and steam, and I think it is very important for the problems we constantly address in this Parliament, such as the pollution of the atmosphere, which is the most fragile of the ecosystems which form our planet Earth and our life upon it."
"Cogeneration allows a lot of energy to be saved, and I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the cleanest energy of all is the energy which is not used."
"So Europe has to move towards using more cogeneration."
"This technique has been used for many years."
"The paper industry has been using cogeneration for more than 50 years."
"What has changed now is the technology."
"We now have greatly improved technologies, with higher efficiencies, which is why we can say we should greatly promote cogeneration."
"Furthermore, in the European Union we are trying to promote the use of gas for many reasons. For example, it is a cleaner technology than coal or oil."
"Also, we have to buy gas from the new producers, such as Russia, Azerbaijan or the United Arab Emirates, because the world contains large reserves, and the efficiency is higher."
"At the moment, cogeneration accounts for 9 % in the EU."
"In its communication, the Commission says it would like to achieve 18 % within a few years, in about 2005."
"That is not an easy matter, ladies and gentlemen."
"We have to remove the barriers."
"And if cogeneration has so many advantages - such as high energy efficiency, less pollution, and energy savings - why is it not more highly developed?"
"Well, because nothing is easy in today's complex world of globalization, economic development and the liberalization of the electricity and energy markets, so we shall have to see how we can promote all of this."
"There are a lot of auto-producers, but the electricity companies are also powerful. So what is the key to the whole situation?"
"As always, ladies and gentlemen, the key lies in the prices."
"In previous years, in order to promote these technologies - which, as I say, offer every advantage and hardly any disadvantages - those kilowatt-hours fetched a very high price, an aboveaverage price."
"But obviously, the electricity companies have their plants, and they cannot be paralysed so that we can just use the energy from the auto-producers."
"So I want to draw your attention to paragraph 8 of the resolution in my report, where it says two things I think are very important."
"Firstly, Mr President, it says that in the liberalized electricity markets, electricity produced in these industrial installations should be given priority but, at the same time, it also says that this should be at market price, not subsidized, because we are already subsidizing national coal, renewable energies and other aspects of the components of electricity prices."
"So the auto-producers, who use cogeneration, will have to compete in the markets."
"We have just approved the directive on gas liberalization, during the last sitting, in Brussels."
"The electricity market has also been liberalized."
"And the auto-producers will have to function within that market."
"Energy from gas is a clean form of energy - though not to the same extent as hydraulic energy, for example, or other renewable forms such as wind energy - and we need the Commission to provide a stimulus."
"We also need that for renewable energies."
"The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy approved all the amendments which were tabled, Mr President, apart from one. That was one which Miss Ahern retabled, and I am not going to support it because it is unrealistic."
"We can wish for anything we like."
"But if it is out of step with physical reality, it will not make much sense."
"So I am not going to support the Green group's amendment to paragraph 11, but I am going to support the rest of the amendments."
"I also want to say that one of the advantages of cogeneration is very important: the desalination of seawater."
"The electricity companies already get high efficiency from gas using combined cycles, which is the second part of cogeneration, but we should make use of gas and these techniques to desalinate seawater."
"This represents a great technological market for the EU."
"The whole of the Mediterranean and the world will need water, which will be the big problem of the twenty-first century."
"Mr President, my group also very much welcomes the Commission's intention to provide greater assistance to combined heat and power."
"The technology has, after all, long been well known, although for a long time it was deployed only as emergency unit technology in hospitals etcetera. Far too little use has been made of it in the area of town planning and local authority development plans, and in this context it still runs up against obstacles because of certain minimum running times."
"However, the advantages are obvious."
"Alongside the necessary demand for renewable energy, this is a very good contribution towards the better achievement of Kyoto's political energy targets."
"It has rightly been said that combined heat and power is sensible because it leads to better utilization of primary energy and to a reduction in atmospheric pollution."
"Above all, it offers interesting new possibilities for combination with bio-mass utilization in agriculture and industry, and particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It holds out very interesting prospects of reducing the burden of energy costs on small and medium-sized enterprises and of contributing towards self-sufficiency in energy supply in Third World countries as well."
"I should also like to stress that there are very interesting models for the better use of agricultural waste, mainly in winegrowing, in a combined technology of bio-mass utilization and combined heat and power."
"I am glad that it has now been possible to reach agreement on the fact that the operators of CHP plants will be recognized as qualified generators of electricity."
"I must say to my colleagues in the PPE that I regret the fact that you rejected such recognition a little while ago in the case of the gas directive when it was a question of putting it on a proper legal basis."
"Mr President, the Commission's announcement on the promotion of a combined heat and power industry in the EU area is an important step forward for energy policy."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Parliamentary report, Mrs Estevan Bolea, for her work in producing it."
"The added benefit of combined production is that it gets us much closer to the aims set out in Kyoto."
"Thus, the time has at last come when we can raise the strategic profile of this issue at EU level, especially as we cannot afford to let slip away any means we have available to us to reduce and eventually rid ourselves of the damage caused by the greenhouse phenomenon."
"The growth of the use of the combined system is still being hampered by the reluctance of the electricity market to open up."
"Producers of electricity can still restrict the number of new players entering the market."
"This makes many otherwise commercially viable projects unprofitable."
"Furthermore, producers of combined heat and power of any size must have the right to gas in a free market."
"Free access to gas is a key factor in profitability when it comes to constructing private or smallscale power stations."
"Combined production of heat and power can be fuelled by coal, gas or using biomass."
"The Union should, however, try to promote the idea in its entirety and provide it with a market where decisions could be made as to what might be the most competitively-priced fuel."
"The method is said to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by raising the overall efficiency of the power plant."
"It must be remembered that that will happen especially if and when renewable carbon dioxide-free biomass is used."
"I am afraid the lobbying of gas as a fuel will not be enough, especially as the directive on gas expresses the desire to restrict the entry of small plants into the market."
"The combined production of heat and power has been a feature of industry for over fifty years."
"Today it is found, at least to some extent, everywhere in the EU."
"However, it is only in Finland, the Netherlands and Denmark that it accounts for more than 30 % of all electricity produced."
"Its promotion is tightly bound up with the national aims of different Member States."
"Despite this, we also need input both at Community level and from industry."
"As it says in the report, the combined production of heat and power provides a strategy whereby, in the short or medium term, we can promote the effective use of energy in the EU both significantly and cost-effectively, and have a positive impact on EU environmental policy."
"Mr President, in the EU area we can discern certain mega-trends in the field of energy."
"Firstly, the demand for energy is growing by around 1 % per year."
"That means that gas emissions will increase if nothing is done about it."
"Secondly, the EU's level of self-sufficiency in energy will have gone down from the present figure of 70 % to around 30 % by the year 2020."
"Thirdly, electricity accounts for 40 % of all energy produced, and that figure is rising."
"Fourthly, it is realistic to suppose that the use of gas, and specifically imported gas, will increase rapidly."
"All these large-scale trends can be influenced positively by increasing the combined production of heat and power."
"It will improve the efficiency of energy usage in EU countries, it will save on energy resources, it will reduce gas emissions and it will lessen the growing dependence on imported energy."
"The production of energy, however, is not the affair of the EU."
"It is mainly up to the Member States, which may derive support from the Commission."
"The support has so far been modest and that has been mentioned in publications and speeches."
"The CARNOT programme, which aims at improved fuel efficiency, simply does not have the resources, and there are even fewer to spread the word on the combined production of heat and power."
"The EU is no more than a paper tiger in this matter; the responsibility lies with Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am rather disappointed with the motion for a resolution submitted to us on the subject of combined heat and power and the barriers which are still being placed in the path of its development."
"What is required in order to promote combined heat and power?"
"First of all, we need guaranteed access to the supply network for electrical energy produced by means of cogeneration, and secondly, a minimum price guarantee."
"This resolution only proposes guaranteed access to the network at the market price."
"I am pleased to inform you that Luxembourg, my native country, already has very progressive legislation on this subject. In 1994 we adopted a law which gives alternative energies, that is, solar energy, wind power and so on, and cogeneration, the possibility of access to Cegedel, Luxembourg's electricity company, with a minimum price guarantee from that company."
"In addition, the government of Luxembourg also contributes 1 Franc per kilowatt/hour."
"I think this is a very good example of how combined heat and power could be promoted in the European Union. I call on the Commission to resist the lobbying by oil companies which are naturally not in favour of cogeneration because it will reduce the amount of fuel they sell."
"Mr President, I ask for the support of the Commission to enable those who produce combined heat and power to obtain guaranteed prices."
"Mr President, we have reached the end of a century in which we have squandered more energy resources than in the entire previous history of mankind."
"War has been waged, and is still waged over these resources."
"Even today there can be no mistaking the consequences for the environment."
"It is high time that we radically re-structured our entire energy system."
"Success in this endeavour will assuredly be one of the central issues for the next century."
"At present Europe is dependent on other countries for 50 % of its energy, a state of affairs which presents a problem not only in ecological and social terms, but also in terms of peace policy."
"That is why the development of combined heat and power systems is an essential step in the right direction towards energy self-sufficiency in the European Union."
"However, the efficiency of these measures in terms of energy policy will become really effective only if importance is attached in this development to giving priority to renewable sources of energy over fossil fuels, with the eventual aim of full substitution."
"This would have to be guaranteed above all by fiscal incentives and fair access to the electricity market."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we dealt with an urgent motion in relation to energy policy here, and we tackled safety issues in the area of nuclear power."
"We all know that the acquis communautaire must be applied in the internal market, so that the decision on whether to operate nuclear power stations is a matter for each Member State itself."
"However, I consider it important that the European Parliament should repeatedly stress safety and should above all focus on its commitment to alternative forms of energy in relation to energy generation."
"We believe that energy generation in the future is a very special issue to which we must pay a great deal more attention."
"This also includes combined heat and power."
"I should like to thank Mrs Estevan Bolea most sincerely for her report which points out very clearly how important production is in this area, as well as use in power stations for heating."
"I believe that entirely new dimensions are possible in this area."
"The prospects of increasing from 9 % to 18 %, in other words of doubling the present contribution of combined heat and power to the Community's overall energy generation gives me confidence as far as the economical and appropriate use of our resources is concerned."
"That is why I have to support the course pursued by the Commission in the White Paper ""Energy policy for the European Union' ."
"For some time there has also been an intensive liberalization of the internal market for electricity. We have had not only the internal market for energy but also a liberalized gas market for a few days."
"Combining these two areas with each other naturally opens up entirely new possibilities."
"This framework creates largely free access to the market and welcome competition."
"This competition means numerous advantages for the economy."
"I believe that, as a result, Europe can be significantly more competitive on the international stage and that, as a result, there is the opportunity to create many new jobs, but in the process, special status must be accorded to combined heat and power."
"It is in particular the combination of electrical energy and heat, which occurs in the case of combustion in engines, that has the advantage of double use and thus a very high energy output."
"That is why the distribution companies should also accept this form of energy as a matter of preference, and I consider this passage in the report to be of special importance."
"Combined heat and power guarantees efficient and ecological energy generation."
"Whatever economic, legal or administrative obstacles stand in the way of its development should be removed as quickly as possible to ensure that it occupies a fitting place and acquires a sufficient market share in the internal market."
"But I must not forget to stress that renewable energies overall and energy saving are a quite central issue and are an entirely new opportunity for Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mrs Estevan Bolea, for the important contribution which she has made to the discussion on the Commission communication which is the subject of this debate."
"Global climatic changes present us with new and comprehensive political challenges."
"In Kyoto in December 1997, as several speakers have rightly mentioned, agreement was reached on intensifying our commitment in this area by laying down quantified targets for emission reductions."
"The European Union committed itself to achieving an 8 % reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases by the period 2008-2012 in relation to the 1990 level."
"If this target is to be reached, the Community will have to exhaust all the possibilities which are available to it."
"Combined heat and power is one of the possibilities for improving energy efficiency and thus reducing emissions."
"However, only limited use has so far been made of CHP's potential for electricity generation in Europe."
"Currently, combined heat and power holds a share of only 9 % of overall gross electricity generation."
"The Commission has proposed a doubling of this share by 2010."
"If the Community truly intends to achieve this target, the strategy presented in the Commission's communication is of the greatest significance."
"The internal markets for electricity and for gas are on the threshold of being fully realized."
"The European Parliament has made valuable contributions to this."
"Overall it can be expected that liberalization will have a positive impact on combined heat and power, although certain problems can arise for the operators of plants which work according to the principle of combined heat and power, as a result of increased competition and the accompanying lower electricity prices."
"That is why it will be absolutely necessary in the years to come to monitor closely the consequences of the competition rules applicable to the energy markets and, where necessary, to introduce appropriate measures."
"The Commission is pleased that the rapporteur agrees with the proposal to lay down a provisional target."
"This is one of the main elements of the CHP strategy."
"There is scope to discuss the exact value."
"What matters to the Commission is to have a target that is both ambitious and realistic."
"The idea of raising the target by the year 2010 not to 18 %, in other words a doubling, as proposed by the Commission, but to 25 % seems to us to be too ambitious."
"I am also pleased to be able to confirm that the rapporteur agrees with the Commission on the need for CHP to be assisted while fully upholding the principles of the internal market."
"In this connection, there is a range of different instruments and procedures which can assist CHP without leading to distortions in competition."
"As regards the amendment which has been tabled, I would like to point out that energy efficiency and assistance to renewable energies are priorities in the proposed regional funds regulation."
"The definition of these priorities for Objective 1 areas and for the measures to be implemented there is, however, a task for the Member States who have to submit their detailed proposals to the Commission, and not vice versa."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has completed its agenda."
"Today's Minutes will be submitted for Parliament's approval at the start of the next sitting."
"Before drawing our work to a close, it is my pleasant duty to thank Parliament's services - the ushers, the interpreters, Parliament's secretariat and the translation and publication services, who work at a slightly greater distance from us - for their help and hard work."
"Without a shadow of a doubt, ladies and gentlemen, it is no exaggeration to say that the two sittings we have had this month, in Brussels and here, have been historic sittings."
"We have opened the door to the single currency with a large majority and, again with a large majority, we have approved the executive board of the European Central Bank."
"The importance of that is not lost on anybody."
"As our President, Mr José María Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado said so succinctly, from now on the citizens of Europe will carry Europe in their pockets, and we all know how important that is."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, although that is important we do not think it is enough."
"We must ensure that the people of Europe carry Europe in their hearts too, and to do that, ladies and gentlemen, we have to carry on working together with wide majorities so that they are not disappointed in their hopes of democratic participation and social justice."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure we shall continue to work along those lines. So I bid you farewell, and wish you a pleasant and well-deserved weekend."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.00 noon)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 15 May 1998."
"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is with profound emotion that I have to honour the memory of our colleague Francisco Lucas Pires."
"Professor Lucas Pires had been a member of our Parliament since Portugal joined the European Union and was twice its Vice-President. He brought a brilliant and cultivated mind to the ideal of European construction, and enriched our Parliamentary debates by contributing the historical experience of one of the oldest European nations."
"The example of Francisco Lucas Pires, whose last public act was to open the European Union pavilion at 'Expo 98' , will remain with us as a model of European citizenship, and as a man deeply committed to his country's causes, but always able to understand and defend the imperatives of European construction."
"The flag of the European Union is being flown at half-mast in his honour."
"I would ask you to observe a minute's silence in his memory."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Friday, 15 May 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would just like to have recorded in the minutes that during our last week in Strasbourg the French police did a splendid job of guarding the European Parliament, and that they were visibly present in the proximity of the Parliament."
"Mr President, the employees of the company Air France have announced that they will be on strike for two weeks, starting from next Monday."
"If this strike takes place, we MEPs will not be able to get to Strasbourg for the next part-session."
"Has the Presidency taken any precautionary measures, in view of this possibility?"
"Mr Medina Ortega, all I can do is constantly remind the French authorities of the regrettable state of transport provisions to Strasbourg. I am doing this, and last week I spoke to the minister concerned."
"Of course, in view of the strike announcement, I will contact him again, and ask him to take the necessary special measures."
"Mr President, I am also pleased that the French police guarded us so well, of course, but I want to ask Mr Rübig if he has another record in his repertoire, and if he will stop boring us with this rubbish!"
"Mr President, I am sure that you are going to mention it and I am sure colleagues will share our joy in Ireland at the ratification of both our referenda."
"(Loud applause) It was a stunning victory for the Belfast Agreement, a slightly less stunning but nonetheless sixty percent victory for the Amsterdam referendum and we hope now that we will see a similar result in Denmark in the next couple of days."
"Mrs Banotti, you expressed it much better than I could have."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Annex V of the Rules of Procedure, Article 1(1)(b)."
"This deals with the reproduction and distribution of reports from the Court of Auditors."
"Let us remind ourselves of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It frequently refers to transparency but in the last few days I have had to ask myself what the actual state of transparency and openness is here in our House!"
"Firstly, it is absolutely preposterous that an official interim report from the Court of Auditors on the reimbursements and allowances of Members of the European Parliament has been available to the President for about a month, according to our information, that it has been available to the Bureau since 13 May, but that not all the groups have been informed. Moreover, Members of this House have not received this important document, and have had to obtain details from the press!"
"I have to tell you that I think that both the President and the Bureau have behaved in a really irresponsible way in this matter and that such behaviour leads to mistrust on our part."
"(Heckling from Mr Wijsenbeek) We call for the immediate publication of the report, both internally and externally, and demand information on whether there are further reports or whether there is an annex, for example."
"Secondly, it is completely unacceptable - would you please shut up, Mr Wijsenbeek - if a subject which affects all members of all groups is discussed and decided upon by the EDU behind closed doors and excluding our group, the ARE Group."
"Our Secretary General was expelled from the room this morning."
"That is why we are calling for a special session of the Presidents' Conference because it is inadmissible that such decisions, such debates whose scope really affects each and every one of us should be handled in a body on which all of the groups in this House are not represented!"
"(Applause) Thirdly, our strongest criticism is directed at the way in which necessary reforms which have long been called for are being systematically delayed and obstructed in this House, reforms which are desperately needed if the European Parliament wants to be credible, if it wants to be accepted, if it wants to seek more rights for itself."
"(Noise) The report from the Court of Auditors tackles precisely these shortcomings..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mrs Roth, when you quote an article, you must read it first."
"The article you invoke states that the Court of Auditors' special reports must be printed and distributed, together with the replies from the institutions."
"The document you are referring to is not a report, but consists of preliminary observations."
"So this Parliament's Bureau, which is the competent body, has not yet issued its replies."
"Secondly, Mrs Roth, all the political groups received a copy of the document yesterday."
"Those preliminary observations have been sent to all the political groups."
"So if you want to communicate them to the members of your group, you can of course do so, just like any of the other group chairmen."
"It is up to you. It has not been kept secret: it is in your hands."
"What I cannot do is give out a confidential document, which has to be examined by the Bureau, before the Bureau has seen it."
"The VicePresidents have to see it first, which is what has happened."
"Read the Rules of Procedure - not what the Green Group wants to read, but what the Rules of Procedure actually say."
"And if you want to change them, then do so through the appropriate channels."
"Unless they are changed, I do what they say."
"Mr Brinkhorst, are you going to comment on the Minutes?"
"Mr President, to react to what you were just saying: I understand that the Bureau would like to discuss this but I believe that we have a right to know soon what is happening."
"The press is constantly attacking us in Germany, the Netherlands and in other countries."
"So from that point of view I hope you have some understanding that there is a concern about these issues."
"I appreciate what you say, but my first obligation is to apply the Rules of Procedure."
"In accordance with those rules, I first forwarded the observations - which, I repeat, do not constitute a report - to the Bureau, which is the body responsible for such matters. Secondly, when there were questions about that report, it was given to all the political groups."
"So, the report will be printed and distributed once it is in its final form, not in its current provisional form."
"Speak to your group chairman, who will give it to you."
"Mr Wijsenbeek requests the floor, to reply to personal statements."
"What statements are you referring to, Mr Wijsenbeek?"
"Mr President, I should like to make a statement pursuant to Rule 108 on grounds of personal remarks:"
"If we are talking here about people shutting their mouths, we all know whose mouth is always open and who arouses suspicions in respect of hard-working and honest colleagues because the Greens would like to base their election campaign on these suspicions, and that is why I open my mouth."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Agenda"
"I would remind you that in our sitting of 12 May, Parliament decided that the report (A4-0188/98) by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme, would be included as the last item of today's agenda."
"Mr President, it appears to me that a communication from the Commission on some urgent and very important political issues has been cancelled."
"I would like to ask a question."
"In view of recent events in Indonesia, there is an urgent need for the situation of all political prisoners to be dealt with here, especially Timoreans and their political leader, Xanana Gusmão."
"My question, Mr President, is: has this subject - the first one on the agenda - been cancelled or postponed until a more convenient date?"
"It is indeed postponed to another day, because at this time the Commission prefers to make its statement on urgent matters relating to the preparations for the European Council meeting in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June."
"So, if there are no further comments, we shall approve the amendment to the agenda and proceed to debate that matter."
"Preparation for the European Council meeting in Cardiff"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparation for the European Council meeting in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June 1998."
"Mr President, at the start of my address may I say that I should offer my apologies if what I have to say about Cardiff is not as interesting or as exciting as the points of order you have just heard."
"I regard it as a privilege to be able to listen in to such an exciting and robust exchange of views."
"It is a tribute to the health of democracy in our continent."
"I am here this afternoon because in just two weeks' time the European Council will meet in Cardiff."
"This will mark the culmination of our presidency."
"We have sought to use the presidency to demonstrate the changed approach of Britain towards the European Union."
"The government of Britain came to power determined to show that Britain was now a committed and constructive partner within the European Union."
"I believe that our presidency has underlined our success in making that transformation of Britain's approach to Europe."
"Two of our key priorities were to get enlargement off to a flying start and to get the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union under way."
"Both of those key priorities have already been achieved."
"I suppose that prompts the question whether there is enough left for us to do at Cardiff to avoid the summit of our presidency being an anticlimax to the achievements that have already marked the historic milestones of our presidency."
"I am pleased to say to the European Parliament that there will be full, busy and important agendas before us at the European Council in Cardiff."
"In the course of the summit we will examine economic reform, Agenda 2000 and the future of the European project."
"We will also explore some of the ways Europe can make a difference in the areas that directly affect our people: on crime and on the environment."
"We will also at that summit welcome - and welcome for the last time - President Mandela who will be joining the Heads of Europe for lunch on the second day of the summit."
"At his request we are meeting with him in order that before he leaves office he may say farewell to the leaders of Europe who have worked so closely in partnership with his leadership of South Africa to achieve one of the major gains for democracy and ethnic tolerance that we have seen in our generation."
"Before we get to that point in the Council we will have completed a large amount of business."
"Let me start with the issue of economic reform."
"We came to the presidency determined that throughout our presidency jobs would be a key theme and a high priority."
"At Cardiff we will be completing much of the work that we have been putting in place over the past five months."
"We will be reviewing the progress that Member States have been making on the single market and will be agreeing to further actions to help take us towards an effective, competitive economy which includes within it an inclusive society in which everybody has the opportunity to contribute and participate through work."
"We also plan discussion of the competitiveness agenda."
"If Europe is to prosper in the long term we need to create an environment in which small and medium-sized enterprises can flourish."
"They need to be able to have access to the finance that will enable them to flourish."
"They need to be free from unnecessary red tape."
"Europe has no shortage of creativity and imagination."
"We must provide the opportunity for that creativity and imagination to express itself through entrepreneurship which will bring Europe prosperity and jobs."
"Also we will be reviewing the employment action plans drawn up by Member States since the special Luxembourg Council."
"This will be the first European Council to have in front of it action plans from every Member State on how they intend to promote employment and to reduce unemployment."
"We will want to see what conclusions and lessons can be learned from those plans."
"We want to make sure that every Member State can share the best practice of other Member States on their policies on employability, adaptable labour markets and on equal opportunities in the marketplace."
"There are, of course, difficult policy questions raised by those action plans: questions on how we reform our tax and welfare systems so that it pays to work and how we can make it possible for women to combine work with family."
"If we are to get it right, we need to make sure that we share the best practice in each of those areas."
"The European Council in Cardiff will also give high priority to an interim discussion on the Agenda 2000 issues: reform of the Structural Funds and reform of the common agricultural policy; on discipline in our budget procedures and on how we adapt the European Union so that we ourselves are prepared for the enlargement for which so many aspiring candidates are now preparing their economies and their societies."
"Since the Commission published its detailed proposals on Agenda 2000 in March, as the presidency, we have set up an intensive work programme to carry forward discussion on the Commission proposals."
"Ministers throughout a number of the Council meetings have reviewed that work and have discussed how they relate to each other."
"At the General Affairs Council only two days ago we had a two-hour discussion on the presidency's report of the work in progress on Agenda 2000 and that extensive discussion, in which every Member State took part, will be of great value to the presidency in preparing a text for the European Council which can provide authority and direction to both Commission and Council officials in carrying forward the Agenda 2000."
"We are very mindful that the European Parliament would like to see decisions taken on these matters before the next elections to the European Parliament."
"It would be our aim to achieve successful conclusions at Cardiff consistent with a timetable which would enable a special European Council in the spring of 1999 to reach final decisions on Agenda 2000."
"I would also stress that a key theme of Cardiff will be to demonstrate how, throughout our presidency, we have sought to make Europe work for the people, to make sure we focus on issues that our people care about and the issues that affect them directly."
"If the European summit is a success, it will only be so because the people watching what the Heads of Government perceive that what they are talking about and what they are deciding has relevance to their lives."
"We must not portray an image of the European Council meeting to discuss matters that are only of concern to top politicians."
"They must be seen to take forward an agenda that is relevant to the concerns and the lives of the ordinary families of Europe."
"There are two particular issues on which we will be focusing attention at Cardiff: improving the environment and fighting crime."
"The joint Transport and Environmental Council meeting which we held in April - the first such joint meeting between environment and transport in the history of the Union - showed how we can integrate environmental concerns into the development of other European policies."
"At Cardiff the Council will discuss a Commission report on how we can make sure that precedent of bringing together environmental strategy with transport policy becomes the norm across the work of the European Union and not the exception."
"The Council will also discuss the progress we have made in fighting crime together, in particular in the work we are now carrying out through the European Conference with all the applicant countries to make sure that existing Member States and future Member States work together now - not after they become members of the European Union, but now - on the common problems of cross-border trafficking in crime which affect both the existing members and the future members."
"So, there will be a busy agenda for Cardiff."
"There will be a lot of ground to cover and I hope I have demonstrated that much of the agenda will be on practical, specific measures which demonstrate to our peoples that real progress is being made."
"But, while we take forward that practical agenda, it is important that we also keep in front of us the vision of the kind of Europe we are trying to create."
"Having brought together all the heads of government of Europe, it seems only right that we should find space in that crowded agenda for them to address the question of what kind of Europe we are trying to build."
"And that is why at this European Council, unlike most recent European Councils, at the lunch for heads of government they will have an open discussion on the type of Europe we want to see for the next century and what its model might be; on what more we need to do to create a Europe which can function and function well with 26 members as opposed to the 6 members with which Europe started. And, in particular, how do we take forward those institutional issues which were not completed at Amsterdam but which are necessary if we are to reform the structures and the decision-making processes of Europe in order to make it fit for the new larger Europe which we will see in the first decade of the next century."
"That is an exciting task."
"I do not think that many people in our own countries have yet grasped the immense historic step which enlargement represents for Europe."
"Very few of our own people yet understand that sometime over the next ten years we will see a Europe which will stretch from Portugal to Poland, from Scotland to Sicily, a Europe which will be almost half as large again in land area and a third larger in terms of population and in terms of consumers within the single market."
"That is a tremendous quantum leap for Europe."
"That is why it is right that when we meet in Cardiff we should find space to reflect on what that means for Europe and what type of Europe and model for Europe we can best offer that will meet the continuing vision of those who are present members and the hungry aspiration of the new members to join in the democratic family of nations we have built."
"If we have a successful discussion on that theme we will have an agenda for Cardiff with the right balance between practical, detailed progress and visionary discussion about the model of Europe for the future."
"I look forward this afternoon to hearing the input of the European Parliament as to how we can take both those parts of the agenda forward at Cardiff."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Members of this House, this afternoon, with an eye towards the forthcoming European Council in Cardiff, I would like to conduct a brief survey of the current state of European integration and also raise the major political topics to be tackled at the summit in Cardiff, before outlining a few avenues we might explore for the future."
"First of all, my message to you today is one of optimism."
"It seems to me, as we approach the Council meeting in Cardiff, that a wind of success and progress is blowing through the Union, stirred by the imminent introduction of the euro and Economic and Monetary Union."
"Again, as the Cardiff meeting approaches, it seems to me that confidence is being restored and is growing; in effect, the macroeconomic balance sheet is healthy and forward-looking, interest rates are down, inflation is minimal, public expenditure is under tight control, the upsurge is making itself felt in many sectors, economic reform on the supply side is beginning to produce results and the first signs of drop in unemployment are beginning to make themselves felt."
"Add to that the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam should be ratified shortly, that the detailed proposals we submitted within the framework of Agenda 2000 are now at the negotiating table and that enlargement is under way. Is this not proof positive that the European Union is up and running, that it abides by its commitments, that it keeps to its deadlines and that it is on the right track?"
"Mr President, I am delighted that this programme submitted by the Commission should now be under scrutiny."
"In close cooperation with the Parliament and successive presidencies of the Union - I will take this opportunity to thank the British presidency for having devoted so much effort - our institutions are now performing their motivating function to the full in this powerful movement towards increased integration."
"The political message that Europe would like today to send out to the rest of the world is crystal clear: it can take action and is taking action."
"From a political standpoint, we should seize the day."
"But there is one item that seems to me to be even more important: in truth, I detect an increasing political consensus, both here and in the Member States, concerning the resources required to tackle the remaining structural problems."
"The national employment plans, approved by the European Council in Luxembourg, are especially important in this context."
"These alone bear witness to a wealth of exciting ideas, the convergence of policies to combat unemployment constructed around common guidelines, and joint mobilization with social partners."
"I also sense the existence of a common political will to bring the domestic market swiftly to a successful conclusion, in accordance with our plan of action in favour of the single market."
"I am also especially pleased to note that the incorporation of Community regulations is improving and deservedly so."
"I note too that we all feel the need for a more enterprising Union, a Union able to take new technologies and ideas on board and to expand upon them within the Union: able to help small enterprises take off, grow and prosper and capable too of eliminating red tape and allowing our creative talents to flourish; able, finally, to take job creation and rising prosperity in its stride."
"These subjects will certainly be uppermost in the minds of those in Cardiff."
"To conclude, I also feel that the majority of us are aware that we could do better in terms of justice with regard to domestic matters and the CFSP; we simply need to establish the necessary collective political will."
"The debates planned for Cardiff will address the matter of economic reform, Agenda 2000, enlargement and our external priorities."
"We will also have the opportunity to speak about the environment, in particular the way in which we might incorporate environmental issues when drawing up other Community policies."
"All our institutions should swiftly build upon the progress already made towards achieving this objective. I assume, too, that this touches upon the question of progress made by the Community and Member States towards fulfilling the commitments they have made under the terms of the Kyoto protocol with regard to reducing gases generated by the greenhouse effect."
"In addition, I am extremely glad that time has been set aside for a debate on the future direction and development of the European Union, the challenges it must face, the need to gain the trust of our people and the vision we need to attain that goal."
"The debate on economic reform will span the entire range of policies needed to reinforce and maximize the advantages of Economic and Monetary Union."
"Obviously, the aim is to further employment prospects through increased competitiveness and social cohesion in a stable macroeconomic environment."
"Amongst other subjects, our discussions will also focus on the approval of our major economic policy guidelines with a view to rounding off this excellent procedure by intensifying microeconomic control for closer monitoring of the extent of integration of products, services and capital markets throughout the Union, in order to boost the gains of a single currency."
"The European Council will also examine progress made in terms of national plans of action to promote jobs."
"Of course, we are still at an intermediate stage, but I am impressed by the determination of all our Member States to get the process off the ground."
"In Cardiff, we will brush up on the main topics that emerge today: increasing the capability for vocational integration, promoting equality of opportunity, improving the adaptability of job markets, creating a favourable climate for the development and growth of the spirit of enterprise, especially with respect to small companies."
"This constructive process will give rise to a mutual, multilateral development and communal emulation through peer pressure."
"Between now and the meeting in Vienna under the Austrian presidency, we have four stages to work through in order to improve employment strategy."
"In effect, from the outset, we must define common indicators and a specific terminology."
"Secondly, we must encourage the Member States to incorporate their job action plans in their national budget."
"Thirdly, we must bolster cooperation and implementation with our social partners and, finally, establish links between the national plans of action for jobs and the projects financed by the European Social Fund."
"On 18 March last, the Commission submitted its legislative proposals for Agenda 2000."
"This autumn, those proposals will be accompanied by a report on the operation of the own-resources system."
"All the individual elements will then be examined together to reach a decision regarding all of these measures with full knowledge of the facts, since we require legislative decisions before the new European Parliament is elected."
"Furthermore, we should seek practical methods enabling the Parliament to perform its function fully, as it did last time, within the tight schedule imposed on us."
"The initial intensive negotiations, under the British presidency, have already begun."
"The various opinions I have heard strengthen my conviction that our basket of measures is fair and balanced."
"In Cardiff, we will take note of the progress achieved."
"Either the agreement is absolute, or there will be no agreement."
"However, I hope that we will be able to record the existence of a significant convergence of views in several areas: the need to intensify reforms of the common agricultural policy, the need to reform the Structural Funds based on the concentration, simplification and clear demarcation of responsibilities; substantial pre-accession provisions in the agricultural, structural intervention, investment aid and administrative aid sectors, inculcating a sense of community spirit amongst all the candidates; a balanced financial framework to finance the reforms and pre-accession assistance, within the budgetary discipline and leaving a sufficient margin to finance the first new membership wave; finally, we need to negotiate a new interinstitutional agreement based on the same fruitful cooperation that governed relations between the two budgetary bodies during the last period."
"If we find that we can proceed on this basis, we should be able to take major steps forward during the course of the year."
"I hope that the European Council will take on this commitment in Cardiff and will set a timetable for the entire process."
"In Cardiff, we shall assess the considerable progress made in the implementation of the Luxembourg conclusions regarding enlargement."
"Since the last European Council, the overall enlargement process has taken off successfully."
"The European Conference met in London on 12 March, thereby officially opening a forum seeking to bring together the Member States of the European Union and those European States wishing to secure membership and sharing internal and external values and goals."
"The European Commission regrets that Turkey has still not confirmed its intention to take part in this Conference and hopes that that country, a most important partner, will be in a position to decide that it can participate in the near future in the work in progress in this context."
"Aside from this, eleven candidate countries have committed themselves to the accession process and negotiations have already begun with six of them."
"We believe that a major breakthrough has been made through development of the accession partnership with the ten candidate countries from central and eastern Europe."
"As with the national strategies deployed in those countries, the accession partnerships have opened the way to successful future negotiations and, hopefully, their eventual integration in the European Union."
"In Cardiff, the European Council will also take account of the many events that have taken place during the last six months externally."
"I shall confine myself here to summarizing the encouraging result obtained during the last summit between the European Union and the United States of America on 18 May last, in London."
"The political agreement concluded at the highest level will enable us to settle the trade conflict generated by the Helms-Burton and d'Amato Acts."
"We hope that the commitments undertaken by the government of the United States will be fully endorsed by the Congress."
"Mr President, when I announced my 'Less action, but better action' policy at the beginning of my mandate as President of the Commission, I intended to make it a broad guideline for our future work."
"In other words, I hoped to focus our efforts - the right of initiative of the Commission - on key priorities, in total compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"The Commission will submit a report on the situation to the European Council."
"This report is entitled: ""The facts' and it records a very serious decline in new legislative proposals since 1990."
"Our consultations with partners of the Commission have increased, we have improved the quality of our legislation, we have also simplified that legislation, we have kept our citizens better informed and incorporation is steadily improving."
"But this report also notes that too frequently we are compelled to take action in areas that should not lie within the jurisdiction of the Community, that the pressure on us to legislate, exerted mainly by Member States - sometimes by the European Parliament itself - is unceasing, especially in technical fields, mostly from those Member States waving the flag of subsidiarity most ardently."
"Finally, the simple, extremely sensible proposals we put forward are subsequently converted into instruments of a complexity that I would willingly qualify as ""Byzantine-kafkaesque' ."
"(Laughter ) The Commission must continue to play its political role forcibly and quite independently."
"It must remain the custodian of the Treaty."
"We shall submit proposals seeking to intensify and expand European integration in the field covered by the Treaties."
"This is our role, confirmed yet again, I might say, by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Nevertheless, we should be aware of the direction we seek and we must also find the means and the opportunity to persuade other institutions that we are on the right track."
"In effect, if we look closely at our political balance sheet, one thing stands out clearly: it is generally in those areas where the Commission performs a motivating and stimulating function based on its right of initiative, that real progress is made."
"This is why I say yes to subsidiarity, yes to a more political and better-defined European Union, but I say no to those who wish to use subsidiarity to slow down the process of European integration and I say no, even more vehemently, to those who seek to upset the institutional balance of our Union."
"Mr President, I would like to make the European Union the first world platform for trade and international investment."
"I would like to think that together we are building a European model of growth and prosperity of a truly universal nature, offering opportunities, partnerships and stakeholder status to our social partners and all members of society, based on equality of opportunity and fairness."
"To achieve that goal, we must continue to move forward and I feel we need to think again in terms of reinstating the dynamics of social dialogue and establishing a social Europe; fresh ideas about what we understand by the ""public interest' ; new conceptions regarding the relevance of the world market as an economic reference point; new methods for incorporating ethics, science and the environment in our policy-making process; a broader view of trade, encompassing the environment and social rights, an intensification of the multilateral nature of the Union since it has always been to our advantage in the past and will continue to be so in the future; a strengthening of our ability to act with firmness."
"I also believe that the time is ripe for us to reflect once again on our collective roles: that of the Commission, of course, but also the Parliament and the work of the Council."
"The stakes have never been more obvious; we need to create, for the European Union, an institutional system that is better than any other in the world, in other words a more flexible and responsive system, better adapted, more efficient, democratic and wholly transparent that meets the expectations of our citizens, that can attract their interest and encourage them to take a deeper plunge into the process of European integration and, finally, a system that can tackle without delay the numerous decisions arising from the immense European interests."
"In conclusion, Mr President, we need an extensive body of legislation, external relations and cooperation, which represent for the Union a genuine institutional asset in the coming new millennium."
"I am convinced that the European Council in Cardiff will mark an important stage in the process towards these bold objectives."
"(Applause )"
"Mr President, at the beginning of the British presidency, the British Prime Minister called for a Europe that works together as a team."
"Tony Blair said that the mission of the UK presidency was to 'make Europe work for the people' ."
"As we approach the Cardiff summit and the end of the British presidency, we in the Socialist group firmly believe that the British Government has been true to its word."
"Jobs and employability have been given the attention they deserve."
"Agreement has been reached for the launch of a single currency on 1st January next year."
"The process of enlargement has begun and the presidency has not flinched from ensuring that a firm start has been made on difficult issues like the reform of the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds."
"But I would hope that all the legislative procedures with regard to Agenda 2000 will be implemented by June 1999 and that this European Parliament is fully involved in all of the procedures."
"Mention should also be made of the progress towards a creation of a more effective Common foreign and security policy."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Cook in particular on his initiative with regard to a code of conduct on arms exports."
"Progress has been made on these and indeed on many other areas but I would particularly like to refer to the fact that the British presidency really has had a very real physical presence in the European Parliament."
"For example, I have been doing a little homework and I have been very pleased to find that British ministers have appeared at every plenary session during the presidency."
"There have been sixteen appearances covering thirty separate debates; there have been forty eight presidency appearances before committee and by the end of the presidency over eighty British Government ministerial appearances will have taken place."
"That is a very good example and if anything marks a clear break with the previous government, it is that very material presence of this administration with the European Parliament."
"As we approach the Cardiff summit, we must not only take stock of what has been achieved but perhaps more importantly we need to look to the future."
"We need a focus on the issues which will take us from Cardiff to Vienna and for the Socialist group top of the agenda has to be the issue of the economy and employment."
"We warmly welcome the fact that following the Luxembourg job summit employment plans have been submitted by national governments."
"The urgent task now, however, is to ensure that both plans are implemented as quickly and effectively as possible."
"The plans, of course, will vary from one Member State to another but it is important for us all to recognize the need for common themes among our various approaches."
"For example, if Europe as a whole is to prosper in the global economy we have to compete effectively in that global economy."
"Competitiveness is not a take-it-or-leave-it option, on the contrary competitiveness is an essential prerequisite for sustainable economic success."
"At the same time, we need to recognize that there are a number of factors which determine whether or not we can compete effectively."
"Amongst these are the skills, adaptability and the motivation of our workforce, the extent to which we can develop an entrepreneurial and innovative culture and a degree to which we can invest in our economy for the future."
"It is therefore essential that we all recognize the importance of research and development and of science generally."
"I would in this regard urge the Council to make available appropriate funds for the Fifth Framework Programme on research and technological development."
"Finally, as the Member of the European Parliament representing Cardiff, I am immensely proud that the European summit is being held in the capital city of Wales."
"Today, Cardiff is emerging as a truly European city."
"It is a city proud of its traditions but also a city optimistically looking towards a future."
"Indeed, given that this summit will come at the end of a presidency which I am sure will be judged as a resounding success, there could hardly be a better host city than Cardiff."
"Mr President, we in the European People's Party are looking forward to a great success in Cardiff."
"We want a great success because, let us face it, the presidency at the present time needs a success."
"As a British Member it is with a certain sense of sadness - not anger, not political antagonism - that one hears repeated references to the lack of success of this presidency in leadership of the European Union."
"The key to all successful presidencies is leadership."
"To what extent can a Foreign Secretary, whose standing in his own country has fallen to a relatively low point, have any claim to speak on behalf of the European Union?"
"So far, this presidency has done little to combat the Union's lack of influence, even on our own doorstep."
"We have not achieved very much in Algeria, Israel, the Middle East or, as the President of the Commission referred to, in Turkey."
"This presidency, unfortunately, will go down in history as having been responsible for the worst-managed senior appointment in international terms ever made, that of the Presidency of the European Central Bank."
"This could have been avoided and far-reaching damage could have been avoided if, when the problem was obvious, the need for compromise had been recognized earlier."
"The EMU project as a whole would not have been made to look as ridiculous as was done on 2nd and 3rd May."
"Indeed, the whole political system in the European Union was made to look ridiculous at that time."
"Let us be more positive, we want to see a success."
"What could be achieved at Cardiff to redeem this sadly discredited presidency?"
"First we need to see real progress on Agenda 2000."
"Agenda 2000 is important as everybody has so far mentioned."
"It is important because the World Trade Organization and its negotiations will be starting in early 1999, as was agreed in Geneva last week."
"It looks at the present time as if the European is awaiting pressure from outside in the World Trade Organization talks to force CAP reform."
"Well, we have been talking about CAP reform for many years and it is time we actually started to make progress so that enlargement can take place."
"Enlargement is probably the most important single issue facing Europe at the present time We need to hold out our hand of friendship because it is nine long years since the Berlin Wall started to crumble."
"Not only do existing policies need to be reviewed but also how decisions in the European Union are going to be taken in the future."
"Those are important issues, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that the Council can move them forward in Cardiff."
"The third really important aspect, as the President-in-Office of Council has mentioned, is employment."
"We need an inclusive society and that means that we have to tackle some of the current heavy regulation."
"Twenty million unemployed is not a good record and the record of job creation is also lamentable at European level."
"We need flexibility, lower taxation, freer trade and a reduction in social costs."
"President, I hope we can look forward to success at Cardiff."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we expect three major policy guidelines from the next summit in Cardiff."
"Firstly, a political revival, a wish expressed by Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac during the last Franco-German summit, of the institutional reform of the European Union, which was totally sidelined when the Amsterdam Treaty was adopted."
"Not only must this reform take place before the current accession negotiations are completed, but if it yielded clear policy guidelines quickly, it would greatly assist the Amsterdam Treaty ratification procedures currently in progress."
"In truth, it is difficult to impress upon public opinion the need for new delegations of power to European institutions until their ultimate architecture has been defined, whether this relates in particular to the weighting of votes for a qualified majority, linking national parliaments to the drafting of policies concerning the second and third pillars or, indeed, the phasing-in of a credible mechanism aimed at guaranteeing compliance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Finally, the summit in Cardiff must formulate policy guidelines concerning the negotiations known as Agenda 2000."
"Agricultural workers in the European Union need to be placated regarding the future of the CAP and its financing."
"But, to date, they have not received the reassurances they wanted."
"They are not opposed to a reform of the CAP in the sense of a fairer distribution of aid, but they do not wish to be sacrificed to the world free-trade ethic or the financial constraints imposed by enlargement."
"Similarly, the existing beneficiaries of the Structural Funds seek some sort of guarantee regarding the implementation of policies pursued to reinforce social and territorial cohesion in the European Union."
"Finally, with a view to the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty on the convergence of employment policies, the summit in Cardiff will need to examine the action programmes tabled by the individual Member States."
"It is important that this should not be seen as a purely formal exercise and that the President-in-Office of the Council confines himself to collecting the essays handed in by individual pupils in the class of Europe and leaves the teacher to allocate the good and bad marks."
"What we need is the introduction of a common strategy with regard to job creation that should be steered towards a significant reduction in the burden hampering those least qualified in the labour force, the harmonization of VAT rates which should be reduced in the case of activities shouldering a substantial share of the wages and welfare costs, and seriously encouraging the development of job creation sectors, such as small and medium-sized enterprises, craftsmen, the liberal professions and ancillary services."
"It would seem that a huge consensus exists regarding all of these matters that are actually on the agenda for the summit in Cardiff, but we note, from one Council to the next, that this consensus is not actually translated into tangible implementations that can be seen to reflect those good intentions."
"So we look forward finally to a firm response to the considerable expectations of our European fellow citizens."
"Let us hope that the summit in Cardiff will not be, for them, a further cause for disappointment."
"In January the President-in-Office told us that every new presidency brings its own new national drive and new range of experience and a new determination to make its mark."
"Cardiff will be the defining moment of the new UK presidency. Will it bear the hallmark of the new drive and the new determination of New Labour's new presidency?"
"On the economic front your agenda is substantial: liberalization of capital and labour markets, new initiatives on venture capital, a new agenda for training and employability and employment action plans."
"Indeed, in its presidency, as at home, your government has pursued economic policies of which your monetarist predecessors would have been proud."
"I ask simply whether in Cardiff at the issue of the Welsh valleys which nourished socialism in Britain they will remember the face of their father as he walked back home from the mine."
"Unemployment remains the scourge of our continent and while we welcome the work done we need more than training schemes and tax cuts."
"Where are the measures to cut red tape for small businesses?"
"Where are the plans to shift the burden of taxation away from the things we want more of like jobs and investment and on to the things we want less of, like waste of natural resources and pollution?"
"Where is the investment in Europe's transport network which would literally get our economy moving?"
"Prime Minister Wilson said: ' A week in politics is a long time' ."
"Six months in politics is a presidential era."
"What will you have to show for it?"
"The British presidency has been bolstered by the proficiency of the Foreign Office and by its willingness to engage with the European Parliament."
"It can celebrate progress in some areas like accession preparations and monetary union."
"But, even here, it is hampered by the UK's indecision in joining monetary union - its unwillingness to take the plunge, its failure even to set a date for a referendum and its complacency in educating UK public opinion about Europe."
"Beyond the economic arena why has the Cardiff agenda nothing on the Europol convention, on the energy tax as agreed at Kyoto, on the reform of the EU institutions agreed at Amsterdam?"
"No doubt you have generous aspirations and ample faith."
"No doubt you have the disciples ready and the church organized."
"But you cannot wait for the gospel to make its appearance while you are doing a photo call with Nelson Mandela."
"In our debate in January I reminded you of the words of Sir Francis Bacon: ' Hope makes a good breakfast but a rather poor supper' ."
"Liberal Democrats in this House expected more of the UK presidency."
"You may have swapped the politics of the handbag for the politics of the Gucci briefcase."
"But what is important is less the container than the contents."
"That great British Labour politician, Aneurin Bevin, once accused his opponents of putting flamboyant labels on empty luggage."
"Unless much is achieved in the coming months, those words may yet rebound upon his successors."
"Mr President, inclusion of the employment problem on the agenda of the summit in Cardiff tells us that we can no longer ignore the social and democratic needs that manifest themselves in our countries."
"Whilst we have been told for decades that prosperity abounds, our peoples note with bitterness the continuing encroachment of unemployment and poverty."
"What is good for the financial markets is not good for them."
"I shall confine my address to the recommendations concerning employment and growth, which mark a leap forward that we should greet with enthusiasm."
"But they are gripped in the vice of the single currency market which seeks to lower the cost of labour and public expenditure."
"This is why the measures incorporated in national plans oriented towards adaptability, in other words flexibility, or even deregulation, take precedence."
"In our opinion, we should follow a different direction, giving priority to social viability rather than financial viability, thereby giving the lead to human development and replacing competition with cooperation."
"Some of the measures proposed by the Member States foster this approach."
"Thus, in France and Italy, we have a commitment to reduce working hours."
"In France too, jobs for the young."
"At European level, we have the EIB decision to introduce subsidized interest-rate credits for jobs."
"To this end, we are proposing three series of measures to promote genuine competitiveness based on sound premises."
"Firstly, of course, a reduction in working hours without loss of wages, but also upward harmonization of welfare protection legislation, the development of lifelong training and the organization of qualifying courses, vocational routes and the promotion of public services."
"We propose financing resources to alleviate corporate financial overheads, not loan charges."
"Mr President, you spoke of red tape."
"Or course, such bureaucracy exists, but what a burden financial charges impose on company accounts."
"This is why we are tendering the notion of a selective-rate credit policy for employment, a method of taxation that militates against speculation with the Tobin levy, a democratic check on public employment assistance to ensure that they do not lead to lay-offs, firm action against social dumping and relocation, now even more urgent following the campaign against child labour."
"We believe that the margins allowed in the current financial year should foster social progress rather than be devoted exclusively to cutting public deficits, which hinders growth and therefore public revenues."
"Finally, new rights, real powers for workers, their trade unions and the citizens at large must be established."
"European works councils, for example, must have the power to intervene rather than simply the right to be informed."
"We believe that these proposals face up to the major challenges of our day. We think that awareness is growing, where misfortune is not fatal."
"And our group intends to make a contribution by relaying the social movement to the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, as I listened to your speech I thought of the saying from my country: ""Nimm dir nix vör, dann slei dir nix fehl' - in other words, if you never try your hand at anything, you'll never have any failures!"
"There has been an abundance of subjects for initiatives and events during your Presidency, as Mr David has said."
"I would be happy to contradict Mr Provan on the matter of implementation, but the longest lunch was an implementation disaster!"
"Let us take the convention on arms exports. I congratulate you on seizing the initiative, but the results are nothing to be proud of."
"There was nevertheless an agreement on annual meetings and we can only hope that there we will be able to make appropriate improvements and arrive at binding multilateral regulations."
"My impression is that there has been a great deal of fuss about speeding up procedures, but at the expense of political substance."
"The Presidency also carries some of the responsibility for the state of the Union and cannot just settle for its skills of packaging and word-spinning."
"The central problem is simply this: if we want to offer ordinary people something, we have to offer them politics which affect their interests."
"We have to show them that European politics satisfy their interests better, and geographical lists do not help them."
"Geographical lists of who is who in Europe will not feed the unemployed, or create jobs, and they will not open up any new prospects either."
"The British Presidency, as your speech made clear, has no clear project, which of course also means that there is no failure to be recorded."
"In employment policy, there has been no clean break with the failed neoliberal policy model, which Mr Provan - I can contradict you on this point - has offered here once again."
"Deregulation, wage reductions, are supposed to create more jobs and stimulate growth at some point and in some miraculous way."
"You yourself no longer believe any of this!"
"Luxembourg saw a fall from grace when employment policy was largely confined to labour market policy."
"France and Italy were left out in the cold."
"The creation of new jobs by reductions in working hours, a new economic policy, or tax restructuring by means of eco-taxes, none of these is on the agenda."
"There is clearly the danger that some Member States will revert to the Essen procedure, under the national action plans which have now been submitted."
"This is a matter in which the Commission, in my view, Mr Santer, has an obvious responsibility: in its evaluation it should spell this out clearly and also demand improvements so that we really do arrive at a binding procedure, and so that the objectives do not just appear on paper but are implemented and supported with measures and not just with philosophical reflections."
"Nor do we need measures which are already being implemented in any case, or which other bodies, such as local authorities, are supposed to implement."
"At the very least, we need an energetic response to youth unemployment, and we are not getting this in the present state of affairs."
"We are taking very seriously the ""no' which the Commission's President has formulated in this case; the misuse of the principle of subsidiarity for the purpose of re-nationalisation fundamentally serves the interests of the right-wing and ultimately its unsavoury representatives."
"We must join forces against this."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office said that in two weeks time a very important event takes place."
"I do not have to remind you that event of course will be watched by the whole of Europe, millions of viewers, when Scotland takes on Brazil in the opening match of the World Cup."
"I am sure the President-in-Office will join me in wishing the best to the Scottish team."
"I applaud his enthusiasm for the Cardiff summit, which follows that event."
"Perhaps I could make a point that the challenge for us as politicians is to make the Cardiff summit as important to the citizens as the World Cup."
"You may say that this is a tall order but there are many aspects of the decisions which will be taken over the next year or so which are going to be of profound importance to the citizens."
"The challenge for the British presidency and the Austrian and every other one that succeeds is acceptability."
"How do we make the Europe that we are trying to build acceptable to the citizens?"
"I believe the choice of Cardiff as a summit location is an inspired one."
"The people of Wales demonstrated last year that they were prepared to exercise their democratic right of self-determination and so Cardiff will become the home of a democratic assembly for the first time in its history."
"The people of Ireland just last weekend voted again for major steps forward in democracy and I believe we are at the beginning of a new development which includes my own country of Scotland."
"Before the Cardiff official summit takes place there will also be an alternative summit of some of the stateless nations of Europe who are deriving inspiration from the example of Wales and Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and Scotland."
"They will be putting forward an alternative vision of Europe but it will not be confined to questions of constitutional change because we believe there are some very important issues which unite the many peoples and regions of Europe."
"I am very glad to see the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission stressing the importance of Agenda 2000."
"This could have a very profound impact on both the people of Europe and the acceptability of the whole European project."
"The plea I would make is that whatever comes out of Cardiff gives us plenty of time, in the European Parliament, to study the implications of the outline that is proposed at that time."
"I know it is a thankless task for the Commission as for the Council but we need to get this one right."
"Unemployment, and I could not agree more with the President of the Commission, is the key task which faces us."
"If we manage to crack unemployment and solve it and produce a growth economy in Europe, then the whole euro project will prove to have been worthwhile."
"If we fail, people will wonder what it was all about."
"Just two last points, the resolution which is before the House tomorrow commends the international criminal court as an important reform which my group has been very active in pursuing, I hope there will be support for that."
"The last point I would make in summing up the challenge for the UK presidency and echoing the points made by Mr Pasty and others, is that institutional reform cannot stand still and I believe that it will be a great fillip if during the Cardiff Summit we are able to come up with a common statute so that Members of this House are not discriminated against by nationality."
"We all should have the same terms and conditions; we were elected on the mandate."
"Mr President, Minister, in this Chamber we have celebrated the single currency."
"When will we be able to celebrate achieving political union, the only way to make Europe no longer just an area of free trade, run by individual countries and their interests or by certain multinationals, but a true citizens' Europe with common objectives and a more certain and peaceful future?"
"At the Cardiff Summit we urge that some concrete progress finally be made towards the achievement of political union, and for this reason the debate must be opened on reorganizing the European institutions: certainly more decision-making power should be given to the European Parliament, but we also need to identify a body that can represent all the Member States, initially at least, for matters relating to common defence, the fight against major crime, the defence of twenty million unemployed and forty million new poor, a body which may also begin to consider how to craft the Union's foreign policy."
"Indeed the Council of Ministers represents the individual governments and does not represent a common European will."
"Today, in the absence of this body, foreign policy should be determined not only by the Council but above all by the European Parliament, the voice of Europe's citizens."
"The fight against major crime can never be achieved if Europol, for example, continues to be blocked by the failure of the Member States to achieve a coherent view."
"If Cardiff turns out to be a carbon copy of the other Summits or makes absolutely minimal progress, we risk having a Europe no longer made up of citizens who see hope in the euro, but of citizens who at the same time worry about a lack of political direction that gives the economy certain objectives to be achieved: in fact, the lack of political direction even makes economic recovery very uncertain."
"It is not enough to say that Maastricht imposed stability and that stability now enables the application of rates which are clearly lower than before if we then find banking systems in the various Member States which operate in some cases in a way that is completely different from what we declared with so much enthusiasm and emphasis in this Chamber on 2 May."
"If the lack of political union risks, because of the electoral results of one country or another, bringing back the cyclical problem - Europe exists or does not exist as a supranational entity or it is not always..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by personally congratulating the President- in-Office on his success in achieving a code of conduct on arms exports."
"This code of conduct establishes some important principles which represent a major leap forward in the EU's contribution to peace and stability in the world."
"The code of conduct will also provide a clearer framework for the rationalization of the European defence industry, which in turn will lead to the greater interdependence which will make national undercutting obsolete in the future."
"I would also like to congratulate him on the way he has never failed to take forward the human rights agenda during his term as President-in-Office."
"In particular, the success he had in taking that agenda to the Chinese and moving forward the Chinese agenda has been one of the successes of this presidency."
"Clearly the major success has been carrying forward the Luxembourg conclusions on the enlargement process."
"Not only was the very complex negotiating process begun on time but the European conference was launched in such a way as to ensure that it immediately got down to discussing matters of direct relevance to the European citizens, particularly drugs and crime."
"These were considerable achievements but it is important, now we have launched the process, we do not allow other political priorities like a single currency to push enlargement into the background where it would be in danger of becoming bogged down in technical discussions."
"So it is important, in my view, that the Cardiff summit sends out a number of clear messages."
"Firstly, it should send out a clear signal of our continuing political commitment to the enlargement process."
"Secondly, it should reiterate the Council and the Commission's commitments to keeping the Parliament informed of the enlargement process and of recognizing the important role the Parliament can play."
"I would to commend to future presidencies the meeting that Mr Henderson held with the bureaux of the joint parliamentary committees as a way forward."
"Thirdly, we have to assess the progress which has been made on the screening of the acquis and on the evolution of the pre-accession strategy."
"I would hope that special attention can be played to the social dimension in central and eastern European countries which is of particular importance."
"We must ensure that the Commission's first annual report, which is foreseen for later this year, is on time and on schedule."
"Finally, as other speakers have said, we must take forward the Agenda 2000 proposals because it is very important if we are to keep enlargement on track that we complete the legislative procedures before June 1999."
"Therefore we have to have political agreement by the Vienna summit."
"Elsewhere, I would congratulate the British presidency on taking forward the Luxembourg conclusions on the Middle East peace process."
"The Socialist group recognizes the tremendous efforts made by the British Foreign Secretary and the British Prime Minister to restart that process and to carry out the conclusions of Luxembourg, particularly in drawing to the attention of the Israeli Government the lack of wisdom in proceeding with these settlements and of the need to develop economic strategy on the Palestinian side."
"Finally, I would hope the Cardiff summit looks forward to the Bosnian elections."
"This is another step in the process of peace and stability in the former Yugoslavia and I would hope that we will support those elections to the fullest."
"I would compare the presidency of the European Union with the British Grand National, or the Derby."
"It is important to success to be able to finish the race."
"It is even more important to success to finish, as the British Government is doing, in style and with panache and with still something to spare in the tank."
"Mr President, the current context for employment policy debates is obviously not the same as in previous years."
"Monetary union is now a reality."
"The national employment plans have now been presented, and economic convergence has created a climate of confidence, which is encouraging for the growth of employment."
"This presidency has had the luck to come at the end of a long process in the construction of Europe."
"Some countries, such as Spain, having adopted rigorous economic and social policies, are already seeing the results of their governments' actions. The formulae for creating employment - which will always be better than sharing it out - have been stated and repeated often enough, from the Essen Summit to the one in Luxembourg."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are on the threshold of the twenty-first century."
"The technological revolution, the globalization of the economy and the large markets demand that Member States make a great effort in the field of education and training."
"Being able to guarantee jobs depends on qualifications and training, and also on educational establishments awarding professional qualifications which meet the demands of the labour market."
"I also want to emphasize how essential it is to ensure that social dialogue provides the context for updating the organization of work, as regards job stability, lifelong training or the reorganization of working hours."
"For example, I do not think it is right for governments to decide to reduce the working day. In fact, it is the actual dynamics of a company's productivity or size which can provide a guide, enabling workers and management to come to an agreement on such matters."
"Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the whole of society needs to be involved in creating jobs. The employment plans presented by countries such as Spain and Italy emphasize that regional or local authorities also need to be given responsibilities here."
"The employment services should adapt to the needs of management and workers. They should also scour the new sources of employment for opportunities to provide jobs for the people desperately looking for work."
"Unemployment and under-employment lead to exclusion, poverty and despair."
"People have heard enough speeches and promises."
"The euro and the employment plans are a way of turning people's right to work into reality - their right to work in that society of prosperity and solidarity we all want to create in this new Europe we are building."
"Mr President, firstly I welcome the opportunity of congratulating the United Kingdom presidency on its success on behalf of all of us in the European Union."
"I wish them continued success for the next couple of weeks and that Cardiff will be like the finishing of the Grand National, as was said by Mr Titley."
"The fact that the President-in-Office is red-haired does not in any way mean we should compare him to Red Rum who was one of the best stayers on the Grand National course."
"If my memory is correct, he won three times in all."
"I should say that the United Kingdom presidency brought with it great enthusiasm, energy and a high quality of organizational ability which we all very much appreciate."
"In particular, I am glad that at all times they fully respected the role of Parliament and its Members."
"I would like to thank the United Kingdom Government and its Prime Minister for their tremendous effort in guiding the peace process in my country to where it is at the present time."
"As everybody knows it received massive backing by all the people on the island of Ireland only last week."
"The summit meeting in Cardiff provides an ideal opportunity for the European Union to assess how best it can aid the process of peace and reconciliation which was given this overwhelming support by the Irish people and the referendum."
"The Union has given considerable political and practical support to this process over the years and I very much hope that the British presidency will ensure that the important developments of recent weeks are given due consideration in Cardiff."
"Recently, the Commission put forward a package of proposals which, amongst other things, called for a reform of the CAP, the Structural Funds and the entire budgetary policy of the Union."
"The summit should concentrate on elaborating broad political guidelines concerning this package of proposals which will have a major impact, not just on the functioning of the European institutions but also on the daily life of the citizens over the coming years."
"It is important, for example, that European leaders reaffirm their commitment to the central role of the family farmer in agricultural and in rural development policy."
"Any reform of the CAP should be geared towards preserving and encouraging the continuation of the family farm as the foundation of the European agricultural sector."
"It is equally important that the reform of the CAP should be considered in parallel with the reform of the Structural Funds because an essential component of structural policy throughout the Union should be the preservation of present population levels in rural areas and in the relatively isolated areas on the periphery of the Union."
"This can only be achieved by recognizing that agriculture will continue to play the pivotal role in rural areas for the foreseeable future and that structural policy should be geared towards the maximizing the development of allied sectors such as agri-tourism, food processing and the preservation of environmentally sensitive areas."
"Finally, again I say to the UK presidency: keep up the good work, two weeks left and remember the last hurdle is also an important one to negotiate before you successfully make the finishing line which I am sure you will."
"Mr President, when national leaders meet in Cardiff, public interest will clearly focus on how unemployment can be reduced and what is going to be done about it in practice."
"It is good that we will in future be able to assess employment schemes better than before."
"We need reliable and comparable data, for example, on whether unemployment among young people and the long-term unemployed is coming down in EU countries."
"Merely examining national programmes will not necessarily be sufficient to tell if the strategy for growth and employment is working at the pan-European level."
"I believe we need a European contribution to programmes to reduce long-term unemployment and unemployment among young people."
"There should be a principle arising from the Cardiff summit that the creation of new jobs in the Agenda 2000 programme should provide a more important basis than it does now for the granting of assistance by the EU."
"The success of an active employment policy is ultimately the yardstick by which we can gauge whether Europe can solve the mass unemployment crisis of post-industrial society."
"Mr President, in the short period of six months it is hardly possible for a Council Presidency to have a strong impact on the European political process."
"That is why continuity and cooperation between successive presidencies are all the more important."
"However, our citizens are given the impression, conveyed in part by national media, that each Presidency functions in historical isolation."
"Every six months Europe is invented anew, so to speak."
"My question to the British Council Presidency, therefore, as an Austrian Opposition politician, is this: in July, do the Austrians start again from scratch, as seems to be the case, or is there genuine co-operation between the British Presidency and the future Austrian Presidency which will ensure that processes already begun will continue to run smoothly?"
"If the answer is yes, in which areas is there agreement, and where can Austria build on preparatory work by Britain?"
"Mr President, when the Presidency announced that it already intended to review the plans for employment in Cardiff, counting myself among the sceptics, I thought that rather precipitate and even unkind to Vienna, where the process would have to take place."
"Now that I have a clearer picture of the situation, I am actually extremely glad that the Presidency did that, thereby giving an extra boost to the process of the Luxembourg Summit."
"When you look at what has now been achieved by the Member States since the Treaty of Amsterdam and since the Summit, you see that it is in fact many times greater than what everyone expected then."
"I myself was afraid that the response to the Presidency would have been: we need more time, just wait a while."
"The situation now is that they have all done their job."
"However that does not mean that we are already there because, when you come to assess the plans, there are still a lot of points to consider."
"I hope that a contentbased approach will be adopted in Cardiff."
"Too many Member States are sitting back and taking the attitude that the guidelines apply to the other Member States, but they are measuring up."
"That is nonsense."
"Not one Member State can claim that it already conforms to all the guidelines."
"I would point out that those national plans must be more than a technical operation in which sheets of paper are neatly filled in; they must focus on the quality of measures taken, on renewal and reactivation."
"Also it must not be possible for Member States to pick out two pillars from the four that have been decided and leave aside two really important ones, namely equal opportunities and adaptability, in order to concentrate on re-employment or employability and entrepreneurship."
"The last two, for me, smack too much of attitudes on the lines of: you are out of work and you only have yourself to blame for that."
"You should be more employable ."
"Or, do not be so apathetic, go and set up a business!"
"I think the other two are immensely important to the Member States, because they challenge the responsibility of the Member States and the social partners."
"It is not by chance that these two have been disregarded up to now."
"One last point."
"Both Amsterdam and Luxembourg focused on a balance between a macroeconomic policy approach and an active labour market policy."
"Up to now there has been no real content-based consensus."
"Another feature of the process is that different Directorates-General and different Councils are dealing with those matters."
"I call upon the Presidency to take a first step in Cardiff towards joint action by the various parties involved, in both preparation and decision-making."
"Mr President, during this discussion, as the Chairman of the Catholic Workers' Movement in the Regensburg Diocese, I have found myself thinking of something that Cardinal Cardyns said: every single young worker is worth more than all the gold in the world."
"This is an old saying, but its message is still relevant."
"Jobs are important, but hitherto there has been too much talk, and here I would agree with my colleague Wim van Velzen, and not enough success."
"Now there are action plans."
"I only hope that they will be implemented quickly and successfully, otherwise even the best action plans will be of no use."
"Best practice is fine, but I hope that it is quickly adopted in those countries which have not hitherto adopted it."
"We are always hearing about assistance to SMEs but no Council Presidency and no Commission has yet been able to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises have simple requirements so that they, too, can put them into practice."
"Taxation and welfare systems should bring about a reduction in accessory costs to wages, but they must also be fair so that employees do not again bear the burdens alone."
"Structural reform, Agenda 2000 - Commissioner Santer, rural areas seem to me to have been treated very shabbily in this goulash Objective II."
"Something more has to be done in this area."
"As regards the environment, allow me to say that we need both people and nature, and not nature without people!"
"I also have a question about the operation of the own resources system: why do we have no money for computers when at the same time we are giving away billions of marks in own resources?"
"Perhaps for once you could do something about this."
"Please implement the social market economy as quickly as possible in the new accession countries so that we are not confronted there by problems which are the same as our own."
"Do not forget subsidiarity even if as a central government you sometimes are not so happy about it!"
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the British presidency for their participation in the peace process in Ireland."
"As far as Mr Blair is concerned I believe he is the first British Prime Minister ever to make Ireland a priority."
"I would like to thank the British Government for rejoining Europe because we badly need them in Europe."
"I and many Members of this House admire very much Mr Cook's stand on the armaments industry and control."
"I want to pay tribute to him on that."
"In Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic still remains in situ in former Yugoslavia and he has much to answer for."
"The European Union stood by and watched the genocide in Yugoslavia;"
"I hope we will not do the same in Kosovo."
"We must call Milosevic's bluff."
"I admire Mr Cook for his condemnation of the slaughter in Kosovo."
"I know Robin Cook is a moral man and is sincere in his condemnation of the slaughter and ethnic cleansing in that country."
"He is, of course, outraged as we are in this House at what is happening there."
"We must stop the Serb minority in Kosovo. I also hope that he will raise the issue of East Timor at some stage as a matter of urgency, perhaps in Cardiff."
"The horrors of Algeria and the lack of response from the government in Algeria to an independent human rights Commission to visit Algeria to see what is happening there is something that should also be raised."
"I want to congratulate the British presidency."
"It has been a marvellous presidency and I want to pay tribute to you personally, Mr Cook, for your courage in taking on very major issues."
"Mr President, the motion for a resolution which I support contains a number of proposals to promote employment."
"However, there are a number of points which need to be retabled and emphasized."
"I refer to the reduction in working hours, which the thirty-five hour week merely symbolizes. We all know that, if there are no accompanying measures, companies will easily be able to use leading-edge technology in order to make up the hours lost."
"Perhaps, therefore, we need to discuss more drastic reductions in working hours."
"I would also like to highlight the emergence of new professions which meet real social needs but which are not recognized on the work market."
"These could be promoted by providing healthy financing, as suggested in the Delors White Paper or as introduced on an experimental basis by the French government."
"Lastly, Mr President, we need to retable the question of investment in the famous trans-European networks which would, we were told at the time, lead directly and, more importantly, indirectly to new jobs throughout Europe."
"This plan has been undermined by ministers of finance in Member States throughout the Union, some of whom will most likely attend the Cardiff Summit, Mr President, without giving so much as a second thought to the contradiction which that represents."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome the reference Mr Cook made to the need for economic reform."
"Many of us in this House believe that, in completing the process of Economic and Monetary Union, it is now very much the job of the European Union to turn its attention to economic reform."
"With the euro area accounting for around 20 % of the world's output and the world's largest importer and exporter, it is essential that we have economic reforms within the European Union that are going to make the single currency a success."
"Our shared task is to ensure that our economies work not only effectively but in a way that combines economic dynamism with social justice."
"It is essential that in Cardiff the presidency and the heads of government launch a new European way in bringing about economic reform."
"This must address the issue of pro-enterprise and a pro-opportunity agenda with measures to encourage enterprise combined with policies that ensure economic employment and educational opportunity for all, building on our long-standing strength of stability and cohesion."
"This Parliament strongly supports an economic reform agenda balanced with the process of monetary union."
"The Socialist group has identified three specific areas which I hope the President-in-Office will take with him to Cardiff."
"The first is the reform of the labour markets."
"Europe has 18 million unemployed and while 10 % of the unemployed in the US have been unemployed for more than a year, nearly 50 % of Europe's unemployed are long-term unemployed."
"The US is more successful at getting its long-term unemployed back into work."
"We need a new way, recognizing that in a fast-moving world of constant innovation and technological change, governments can help to equip people to cope with inevitable change."
"While there is far less that government can do to stop people losing their last job, there is a lot more that government should do to help people gain their next job."
"We are very concerned about the capital market and there needs to be capital market reform."
"The US has a huge capital market and equity market to help in venture capital."
"Europe has a fragmented and inadequate equity market. We need to make sure that there is venture capital available for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In Cardiff it is essential that we start the process of building a Europe-wide equity market for venture capital and for investment."
"The third area which needs reform is in the product market."
"We have a single market but it is still fragmented."
"We still need steps to build the internal market of the European Union."
"Cardiff is a marvellous opportunity to accept the process of monetary union and to begin the important and essential job of economic reform."
"If that is the aim of Cardiff, Mr Cook has the full support of this House."
"Mr President, Amsterdam is still being ratified but already we are beginning to talk about institutional reforms again."
"I must say that I was very happy to hear, today, both the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission recall the importance of institutional affairs for the future of the European plan; moreover, signals have also been coming from beyond the official institutions: various personalities - from Jacques Delors to our President Gil-Robles, to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Blair, a few days ago - have expressed concern about the difficulties that may arise with the Union's decision-making mechanisms in an enlarged Union."
"I do not want to go into the merits of these reforms here or voice any opinion on the matter; I just want to try and understand why we are returning to the subject of the institutions, with Amsterdam still in progress."
"In my view it is for one fundamental reason: because the challenges facing the Union require these institutional reforms."
"The challenge of monetary union: monetary union is pushing us towards political union - no one denies that - but we are in great need of a political-institutional will, because nothing in history happens automatically."
"And then enlargement: no one has any real doubts about the institutional consequences of enlargement, because it is clear that the emergence of two types of Europe is possible: a much more diluted Europe could be formed, very similar to a large market, and there could naturally be a political Europe."
"That is therefore the reason why institutional reforms are increasingly unavoidable, whatever their merit."
"How should we proceed from there?"
"That is what I would like to say briefly in the second part of my speech."
"There is a resolution of the European Parliament of November 1997."
"We propose a particular route: we ask the Commission to produce a document on the institutions before the end of the year, and we ask the Commission to do this because we respect its role of initiative and because we consider that the role of the institutions is fundamental in resuming the debate on them."
"And we ask the Council to give the Commission a mandate for this initiative."
"That is the fundamental point!"
"Once again I will not go into the merits, but I'd like to recall that only by clearly defining a relationship between institutions and the objective to be achieved can we respond to the question of Europe's future, what kind of Europe we want, what plan we want to achieve."
"I think it is extremely important that this Parliament send a message to the future Parliament - the Parliament which will be elected in 1999 - a message that there must necessarily be innovations to the institutions."
"Mr President, Mr Santer, colleagues, there have been several treaties - the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty - in which we have repeatedly expressed a commitment, for example in Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, namely the demand that environmental policy and protection should not only be included, but should also be a high-level objective in determining and implementing Community policies."
"I have been in this Parliament for nine years. I know what we say we will do, but I also know what our achievements are."
"What we say we will do is always splendid, and the British Presidency's achievements have been outstanding, but now, in common with this House and also, I hope, with the Commission, Mr Santer, I have high expectations as regards the Cardiff Summit."
"If it is our conviction - and, as far as I know, it is the conviction of the British Presidency - that environmental policy is an important Community objective for the people of this Union, and if, at the same time it is our conviction that fighting unemployment is the most important task that we have to face, we should be sufficiently intelligent to link these two objectives."
"If we can prove - and we can do so - that environmental policy, higher environmental standards, new environmental standards, developed with the Commission, with the European Parliament, but also with our partners in industry and the trades unions, that these new policies can create jobs, that is what we have to do."
"Are we doing it?"
"No, we are not!"
"Unless we finally start to incorporate environmental standards and protection and the checking of environmental compatibility and sustainability into all other Community policies, we can forget all the other speeches here."
"Then Mrs Bjerregaard can give up her work, I can do the same, and so, too, can large parts of the Union too."
"So we have to change things."
"What will we change?"
"We must have binding framework legislation which says that environmental policy is part of transport, energy and economic policy, as Mr Donnelly has already explained."
"It is no longer enough for this to appear in Article 6 of the Treaty."
"I am tired of reading treaties - I have done so long enough as a lawyer - and I also know what they can amount to."
"I would like to see the Commission being supported by the Council Presidency, by you, Mr Cook, by the British Council Presidency and by the new German Government after 27 September of this year in ensuring that the integration of environment policy into other Community policies is obligatory."
"I would like to see a binding commitment to this end, that means I would like to have from you, Mr Cook, and from the Cardiff summit an obligation on the Commission to submit framework legislation, and I do mean legislation which imposes an obligation, not another meaningless commitment!"
"In conclusion, allow me to say the following. When I was a child, I liked to play with soap bubbles."
"You can blow them up and they get really big, they shimmer with all the colours, they're very impressive, then they lose their colours, burst and disappear."
"I have no desire to see yet another summit lose its colours, burst and disappear."
"Please, Mr Santer, please, Mr Cook, make sure that after the Cardiff summit we have obligatory legislation and that environmental policy is an integral component of all other Community policies!"
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am the last speaker in this debate but I hope that the topics that I shall address will be placed high on the Council's agenda."
"I would like to make two requests, to you, Mr Cook, and to you, Mr Santer, two requests to take an urgent inquiry from the European Parliament with you to Cardiff."
"Fighting organized crime is one of the absolute priorities of the Council and of the Commission, and also of the work of the European Parliament."
"We know that wherever it is possible to do business without frontiers, it is also possible to do illegal business without frontiers."
"That is why, as a strategy to counter the freedom of having no frontiers which those who are able to misuse our economic system enjoy, we also need cooperation, which as far as possible is not affected by frontiers, between the police and our justice systems whose role it is to pursue the criminals who operate their network on a panEuropean basis."
"The trouble is that this process, which can be so compellingly described, is not advancing as fast as the European Parliament would like."
"In our view, this is in part due to the fact that, after the finely turned phrases of the summits on European integration have faded away, an integration which must of necessity be implemented in areas of the third pillar as well, the national sovereignty reserve, especially in the case of police and justice co-operation, weighs more heavily in the balance than the pragmatic necessity of co-operating at the European level."
"That is why I want once again to formulate precisely the European Parliament's request which is contained in innumerable resolutions, and which was drawn up by us specifically in relation to the initiatives and the common measures subsequent to the report from the high level group on fighting organized crime, the request which is expressed in these opinions: show greater courage and go beyond the level of national governments; do more to remove obstacles especially in the case of cooperation between the police - but also between justice systems, which is no less important."
"Show greater courage as the Commission and demand of the Council that more competence and authority under Community law for fighting organized crime should be transferred to you!"
"I consider that one of the top priority tasks in the immediate future is that we should learn to integrate Europe not only in the economic sphere, and that we should learn to organize the instruments that we need to fight misuse not only at the national level."
"Unless we remedy this divergence, organized criminals in Europe will continue to have an advantage over the police."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Common foreign and security policy for 1997"
"The next item is the report (A4-0169/98) by Mr Spencer, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the role of the Union in the World: implementation of the common foreign and security policy for 1997."
"Mr President, under the Treaties we are required as a parliament to hold an annual debate on the development of the CFSP."
"My report discharges that duty in the same format as we did last year."
"There is a tabular comparison of the details of the use of joint actions, common positions and declarations over a four year period."
"There is a review of the CFSP on a regional basis, starting with our near abroad and moving outwards."
"There is nothing of particular interest to note in the use of these instruments other than their continued failure to address the real challenges which Europe faces in the world."
"In fact, in 1997, apart from the Amsterdam Treaty, the most interesting thing to happen was the interinstitutional agreement on the financing of the CFSP and on parliamentary involvement."
"That involvement is going to depend for its effectiveness on good cooperation between the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"Also, from that agreement, flows the commitment from the Council to provide us with a document on 'the main aspects and basic choices of the CFSP' ."
"That is a minimalist document stripped of meaning by pre-publication editing in Council working parties."
"It is historical, it is narrative, it devotes only a page and a half to the future and then in the vaguest of terms."
"It needs to be improved next year."
"Observant colleagues will have noticed that we have changed the title of this year's debate to 'the role of the Union in the world' so that we may look at the whole period to draw lessons from the past and project them into the future."
"Europe's role in the world is more than just the limited and, as yet, undeveloped activities covered by the CFSP."
"It encompasses the commercial and other competences of the Commission, the role of this Parliament, its presidents, committees, delegations."
"It must also encompass the foreign policies of the Member States."
"As I say on page 9 of my report, we are creating a common foreign policy, not a single foreign policy."
"The parallel with the common currency and a single currency may be instructive if not exact."
"A common policy magnifies effective influence."
"A single foreign policy would be the product of a single state which the Union is not."
"In my view we should be striving to maximize Europe's influence in the world for our own good and, I would argue, for the good of the world."
"To do so we should use all our resources in all the institutions and in the Member States."
"The period of 18 months that we are looking at covers three presidencies conducted in three very different styles with three very different degrees of experience."
"I can assure the President-in-Office that I am not going to engage in either the public puffing of the presidency by Mr Cook's PPS and sous-chef Mr Titley, nor indeed, Mr Provan's public pricking of the presidency's pretensions."
"I am going to stand back and look at all three of those presidencies as regards common foreign policy."
"And I have to conclude that it is currently impossible to run an intellectually or politically satisfying presidency, given the tensions between the current institutional structures and the overblown and ambitious rhetoric of the CFSP itself."
"Time and again we see Europe accepting that the real decisions are taken by the Americans."
"We tamely follow them around, voting funds and troops into situations such as Bosnia where we have abdicated from effective decision-making."
"They say and we pay."
"That is not good for them and it is not good for us."
"An optimist would say that post-Amsterdam the CFSP is in transition."
"Surely the position will be improved when, instead of sending the President-in-Office on a one-day administrative errand to Ankara which fails to persuade the Turks to turn up even to their own association council, we could instead send the High Representative."
"Surely the existence of an analysis and planning unit would improve our state of preparedness."
"At the moment we manage to be ill-prepared not just for the predictable, such as the Indian test, or the perennial such as Saddam Hussein, but even for the frankly overdue such as Kosovo."
"At the moment we have the worst of all worlds."
"We are too proud to hand over Europe's interests lock, stock and barrel to Uncle Sam."
"We are too vain to remain decently silent."
"We have too much memory and not enough vision to create our own foreign policy."
"So, what do we settle for?"
"A peacock diplomacy that is for display and not for use."
"The prime role of this Parliament and the foreign affairs committees of national parliaments is not to control the executive in their conduct of foreign policy."
"It is to encourage them to have a foreign policy worthy of the name in the first place."
"To have a Europe which is impotent in the Middle East peace process, silent on the sub-continent and sidelined in the Balkans is quite simply not good enough for the European Union."
"I commend the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee to the plenary."
"Mr President, I should like to respond to Mr Spencer's observations and may I say to him straightaway that there are formidable problems in forging a common foreign and security policy."
"I fully understand the frustration which he has very well expressed and I can understand that must be a frustration that is widely shared throughout the European Parliament."
"It does not help us, however, to come to terms with our sense of frustration if we do not understand the very formidable problems that are engaged in forging a common foreign policy among fifteen Member States who have different histories, different historical ties born of those histories, who have different linguistic and cultural links to other countries which bring them with different attitudes to conflicts around the world, who have today different conflicts with neighbouring countries which are not shared necessarily by all the other fifteen."
"That is why when we meet in the General Affairs Council it is not unusual - as we found on Monday on two occasions - for one country to be standing out against the other fifteen."
"It is not always the same country."
"I am not seeking to particularize or to put any individual blame on any one Member State."
"From time to time most Member States sometime or other say that this issue is of fundamental importance to us and we cannot achieve a consensus that the other fourteen can agree on."
"I want to put it to Mr Spencer that the problem and the frustration which arises from it is indivisible from the assumption that each Member State has the right to maintain its own foreign policy as an attribute of the fact that it remains a nation state in its own right, with its own participation in international forums."
"Mr Spencer's party is not suggesting that we change that principle nor, frankly, are the governments that are represented in the European Union, members of whose parties are here in the European Parliament."
"Therefore, if we have recognized that starting point, we have also to be realistic about what can be achieved on a common policy starting from that particular difficulty."
"I am entirely prepared to accept as a broad caveat on our common foreign and security policy that we are seeking here to forge common positions among fifteen Member States who may not approach each problem with the same perspective, the same historical background or, indeed, the same pressures of public opinion."
"If the European Union is to be a success we have to make sure that it has the flexibility to recognize the differences of history, culture and public opinion."
"Against that background and with that very large qualification, I would submit that if one looks back over recent months, there is much that the European Parliament and the Council can take satisfaction in, having built common positions, built a common approach to the world outside and upon occasion - because we had that common approach - making an impact."
"If I might start with the agenda of human rights and democracy which is high on the agenda of our own domestic policy in Britain and has therefore been high on our agenda of the presidency, it is the case that on Monday we achieved agreement on a code of conduct on arms exports."
"That code of conduct represents two significant steps forward."
"It establishes common standards by which each Member State will judge applications for a licence for an arms export."
"The nations of Europe will certainly still compete against each other for these orders but they will compete against each other on price and on quality."
"They will not compete against each other on standards of observance of human rights."
"Secondly, that code includes a notification mechanism by which any Member State can notify all the others that it has decided to turn down a contract on grounds of human rights and any other Member State who wishes to pick up such a contract must first notify and consult the country that first refused it."
"That is an entirely new mechanism which can give some confidence to Member States that if they turn down a contract on grounds of human rights, democracy, or concern about fuelling aggressions, no other partner is going to take advantage of their decision by picking it up or, at any rate, cannot do so without first telling them, which will be an effective deterrent."
"I do not think that the code is perfect."
"If I may say so, I regret that it was only possible for us to get consensus on the code by dropping some of the objectives we had for achieving transparency."
"I am prepared to think Mr Spencer and others would be perfectly entitled to voice criticism of that code."
"But in voicing that criticism we should not overlook the fact that it represents a significant step forward."
"One of my domestic critics said I have only got half a loaf but I should at least be congratulated on having got half the loaf."
"That may necessarily be the condition in which we take forward a common policy among fifteen Member States."
"Secondly, Mr Spencer refers to my visit to Turkey."
"The problem we have in Turkey is not actually a problem we have in Europe."
"Europe is ready for an association council with Turkey."
"Turkey has taken the view that it is not ready for that association council and that is a view we must respect."
"Turkey is not a member of the European Union."
"It is not a party to the common foreign and security policy."
"It is not part of any internal discipline that we may ourselves have as Member States of the European Union."
"I think Turkey made a mistake."
"There is a chasm between us which it would be important for Europe and for Turkey to bridge but we cannot build that bridge simply from one side of the divide."
"Turkey must also assist us by being willing to build a part of the bridge from their side of the divide as well."
"I would also report to the European Parliament that while I was in Ankara I visited Akin Birdal, the chair of the human rights association, on whom there was an attempted assassination two weeks ago."
"I found Mr Birdal in amazingly good spirits and in a state of courage and determination that I found both inspiring and humbling."
"Mr Birdal was shot at close range and had fourteen entry and exit bullet wounds."
"When I saw him only seven days later he was sitting up in bed, lucid and determined and expressed to me the view that it is people like him who are urging the path of human rights and good governance and open transparent democracy in Turkey and putting Turkey on the true European path."
"That is a view which everybody within the European Parliament would surely wish to echo."
"I would also like to pick up the observation made by Mr Spencer about our role in the former Yugoslavia."
"I would put it to Mr Spencer that he undervalues what has been achieved in the last year."
"There has been a significant shift in Bosnia towards implementing the Dayton process."
"When I was last in Sarajevo earlier this year the Foreign Minister of Bosnia said: ' Nobody won the war, we all lost the war' ."
"It was a statement that was absolutely and plainly true but it is also a statement that no senior Bosnian politician would have made until the last few months."
"There is now a sober recognition across a large part of the political community in Bosnia that the way forward is to accept the Dayton agenda of ending ethnic confrontation rather than trying to recapture the ground that each different ethnic groups feel they lost during the years of conflict."
"Europe has played an important part in that process."
"Firstly, we played an important part in that in the recent months we have shown a renewed robustness towards the war criminals."
"In my own strong view there can be no meaningful reconciliation and ethnic justice within Bosnia unless those who were responsible for the worst atrocities in the conflict are seen to be brought to justice."
"I am pleased to say to the European Parliament that because of that robust approach we now have half the indicted war criminals awaiting process before the tribunal."
"This is something we would have had difficulty hoping for a year ago."
"Secondly, Europe has made a major contribution through the High Representative in enforcing open and fairer standards of access to the media."
"It was the robust approach which the High Representative took towards television within the Republika Srpska that played a very important part in the election of a government in Republika Srpska which, for the first time, since the end of the conflict is now committed to the Dayton process and in taking it forward."
"As the presidency of the European Union, I was the first foreign minister from outside Bosnia-Herzegovina who had the opportunity of addressing the assembly of the Republika Srpska and encouraging them on the path towards ethnic reconciliation and towards implementation of the Dayton process."
"So there is progress within Bosnia - slow progress, inadequate progress - but there is progress which is in part a result of the work of the European Union, of the Council and of the Commission who have responded to the election of that new government of the Republika Srpska by packing it with additional resources and aid."
"The problem in the former Yugoslavia is that the two neighbouring countries to Bosnia still remain countries dominated by politicians who often do not appear to have the commitment to the Dayton process one would expect from people who signed the Dayton Agreement."
"In Croatia the Council has condemned the repeated failure of President Tudjman and his government to make more serious progress towards refugee return."
"That is why at the most recent General Affairs Council we requested the Commission to review whether Croatia can retain its autonomous trade measures while it continues to be in default of its commitment under Dayton."
"In Belgrade the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is still dominated by President Milosevic whose conduct towards Kosovo has dominated so much of our international discussions over recent months."
"I regret to say that all our efforts at those international meetings both at European level and at contact group level have as yet failed to produce stability and an end to the violence in Kosovo."
"Indeed, the violence in recent days has been particularly acute."
"Several villages have been destroyed and there has been a sharp increase of several hundred refugees a week now seeking refuge outside Kosovo across its borders with Albania and with Montenegro."
"The great tragedy of this situation is that the only people who are benefiting from the conduct of Belgrade within Kosovo is the Kosovo Liberation Army for whom President Milosevic is the best recruiting sergeant."
"I welcome the fact that Belgrade and Pristina are now in dialogue but I have great doubts as to how successful that dialogue can be against a background of continued violence."
"President Milosevic has engaged in dialogue but that engagement is unlikely to be successful while he continues to use violence against the Kosovans themselves."
"For those reasons, the European Union moved fast after the contact group decisions to put in place a battery of measures against Belgrade - an arms embargo, a visa ban, a freeze on their assets outside the Federal Republic."
"Those measures are now fully in place and Europe put them in place within ten days of the contact group meeting."
"But there is also another side to our dialogue with Belgrade and that is our repeated willingness to end those measures and to offer to the Federal Republic the same embrace within the European Union we have offered to many of the other countries of the region."
"The great tragedy for the people of Serbia is that President Milosevic has now left them more isolated than any other country of that region of the continent."
"I have met some of the younger generation in Belgrade, for instance those who run the B92 independent radio."
"They are cosmopolitan, forward-looking young people such as you will find in any capital in Europe."
"It is with them that the hope for the future of Serbia lies."
"It is important that while we put maximum pressure on President Milosevic, we also make it clear to those who would wish an alternative form of politics that we are on their side and there will be a welcome for them if they can succeed in the internal political debates within Serbia."
"I will concede - and it is fair to do so after Mr Spencer's introduction - that we have not solved the problem of Kosovo but I would certainly very firmly assert that, in responding to the Kosovo crisis, the European Union has shown more urgency, more solidarity and has achieved a common position much more rapidly and firmly than it ever did in the early years of Bosnia."
"Had we shown that urgency and that firmness in the early years of the Bosnian conflict, we might not now be starting to claw back from such a far deeper problem in which we now find ourselves."
"I should also like to illustrate the success we have shown in a common position by reference to a number of the other problems of the world beyond our own continent."
"Tom Spencer mentioned the Middle East peace process."
"The peace process remains in deadlock."
"Every Member present in this Chamber must be alarmed at the fact that deadlock remains in place."
"I have grave concerns that some in the Government of Israel imagine that there are two choices."
"One is between making progress in the peace process which may be of disadvantage to their interest and the other is status quo with the present deadlock which does not require them to make further compromise."
"I fear that is a false perception of the two choices."
"The choice in reality is either we make progress on the peace process or we slip back into confrontation and violence and instability within the region."
"The status quo is not sustainable in the medium to long term."
"But although everybody present has every right to be dissatisfied that there has not been more progress on the peace process, I would robustly assert to Parliament that we have never had a moment in the whole of the last three to four years since the Oslo peace process began in which the European Union presidency has been more engaged in the process."
"The recent London talks were hosted in the capital of the presidency."
"Both the Americans who took the initiatives on the package on the table and the partners to the talks throughout those two days met repeatedly with the presidency."
"Indeed, the presidency can claim considerable credit for having persuaded the Palestinians that they should attend those talks and should accept the American package, thereby putting the pressure on the government of Israel also to accept the package."
"The presidency has also provided a security advisor to the Palestinian authority and through our special envoy, Mr Moratinos, we have created a permanent security committee with the Palestinian national authority in which we are directly and in practical terms addressing the security issues."
"It is the European Union which has put most resources into making a reality of the Gaza airport and it is the European Union and European companies which are investing most in the Gaza industrial estate."
"If we can get the breakthrough on the question of the further redeployment it will be the European Union that will be the leading party in making sure that both those interim agreements are up and running with very real value to the economy of Palestine."
"Similarly we can claim credit for the fact that we have achieved a very successful summit with the United States two weeks ago with a very real breakthrough of immense importance to Europe in that the United States administration has signed with us an agreement on sanctions legislation which explicitly rejects extraterritoriality which is of great importance to us."
"We now have the basis on which both sides of the Atlantic can achieve a common position against Iran rather than Iran becoming a basis of division between the two powers on the different sides of the Atlantic."
"On Africa, as recently as last Monday we adopted a common position within the General Affairs Council which stresses our commitments to good governance, human rights and development."
"This is in itself a very important step forward because, if we are candid, one of the problems that Africa has had, even in the post-colonial era, is the rivalry between European powers who previously were the colonial powers in Africa."
"The historic achievement we made on Monday is to finally put that cast of mind behind us and to agree that we actually have common interests in Africa and should achieve a common position in which we advance those common interests rather than pursue the mistake that we have different interests as different national powers within Europe."
"So, on all those grounds, I would robustly assert that there has been progress towards common positions, common shared objectives to the world outside and a lot of solidarity shown among the nation states."
"There have been other areas where I could have wished that we could have achieved a more robust and a more united approach."
"I will be frank with the European Parliament and say that, although I welcome the fact that, on Monday we were able to get a clear statement condemning the recent Indian nuclear tests, it would have been better if that statement had been backed up by a more robust set of measures to give substance to our words."
"But there is no difference among the Member States as to where we stand in relation to the nuclear tests."
"We are dismayed by them."
"We believe they are damaging to the international nuclear proliferation regime."
"We believe they will fuel regional tensions and we believe also that it would be far better for the security of India and the other countries of the subcontinent if we could find a solution to Kashmir which would be much more productive for an easing of tensions within the subcontinent than any amount of nuclear tests by either side."
"To sum up, given the difficulties and given the realities, we have made very real progress towards achieving a common foreign and security policy which is having a marked impact on the world outside."
"I want to close by saying that as we approach enlargement, we should also recognize that not only will that enlarged Europe offer us a capacity for more prosperity, it will also offer us more capacity for more influence in the world."
"We will have more power in the world."
"The question we have to ask ourselves is how do we use that power?"
"How do we make the European power of an enlarged European Union a power for good in the world?"
"One of the things we must do is make sure that we use that power to reinforce and support the values of the European Union and the values expressed by the robust democracy of the European Parliament."
"Until recently it was fashionable to see a tension between a commitment to human rights and good governance on the one hand and a commitment to trade, exports and prosperity on the other."
"It is still possible among some British politicians who have not moved with the times and fail to perceive that they are still trapped in the time-warp."
"I am bound to say that after the recent Asian financial crisis that dichotomy looks very wide of the mark."
"What has been fascinating in the recent Asian financial crisis is that the countries who have been best able to respond to financial pressure have been those countries with the most transparent and accountable systems of government and freedom of speech."
"Those countries which had the most allowance for individual liberty and initiative have been better able to seize the new technologies and to cope with open transparent financial markets."
"Conversely, those countries that have been more reluctant to share power with their people, to share knowledge with their people, to share liberty with their people have found themselves having most difficulty in responding to the pressure of financial markets."
"There is no longer a tension between those objectives of promoting our values and promoting our prosperity."
"They go hand in hand."
"Therefore, we should make sure that first recognizing the problems we continue to build a common foreign and security policy and make sure it is a common foreign and security policy that projects our common interests as Europeans and also projects our common values as Europeans."
"If we achieve that we will have achieved a common foreign and security policy in which we can all take a common pride."
"Mr President, of course I thank Mr Cook for that particularly detailed response to Mr Spencer's report, but I am surprised that there has been absolutely no reaction from the Presidency, and I would like to know why not, to the debate on Cardiff."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ample and well-drafted report that we have just heard from the British Presidency should be of great comfort to us all."
"It is commonplace to say that the European Union does not have a foreign policy, despite the many rhetorical statements and statements of hope which are often made; but the Presidency of the ""Foreign Affairs' Council tells us that significant progress has been made on a number of points, underlining the role of the European Union."
"All of this is, in my view, a condition which we can define as necessary but not sufficient."
"In other words, we are now faced with a series of quantitative increases in EU foreign policy, due to a certain euro-enthusiasm and the fact that we have approved the single currency. But despite this greater effort to craft and to want to have a common foreign policy, we think there is still a lot to do."
"And there is still a lot to do in terms of the quality of foreign policy."
"As a Member of this Parliament, I believe that we must hope that foreign policy becomes a constant and common theme of all the political forces in the next European elections."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that extensive report."
"One of the problems while discussing the Spencer report has been that we are looking backwards to the working of the CFSP in the last year, knowing full well that the world we are discussing is going to change."
"It will change when Amsterdam is ratified."
"Amsterdam will be seen as a turning point in the working of the common foreign and security policy."
"Amsterdam recognizes, in a way that Maastricht did not, that we are now operating in a completely new security situation following the end of the Cold War which requires broader instruments and broader measures to maintain European and world security."
"In this debate we should really be looking at the implications of those changes and how we can maximize their effectiveness so that some of our concerns about how the CFSP has operated in the past will not be replicated in the future."
"In particular, I would hope that the Amsterdam Treaty will mark a point where we stop becoming obsessed by the harmonization of the process and become rather more concerned about the effectiveness of the outcome."
"It is not whether there is a common foreign and security policy worth its name that exercises my constituents, it is whether or not we are able to achieve peace and stability on the European continent."
"Amsterdam takes us forward in a number of ways."
"The policy planning and early warning unit allows us at long last to analyse what we mean by a common foreign and security policy."
"The existence of a High Representative who will be able to deal with the day-to-day issues and the establishment of common strategies will enable us to start to have a more coherent approach."
"We also have to look at some of the challenges created by Amsterdam."
"For example, this Parliament is extremely supportive - and quite rightly so - of the Petersberg Tasks."
"But the British Army, relative to its size, is now more heavily committed than at any time since the Second World War."
"What are the implications, therefore, of developing the Petersberg Tasks for our national foreign policies and our national capacities to fulfil our ambitions?"
"One area where we need to move forward is the link between the Council and the Parliament."
"This Parliament, in its approach to Algeria, and to Albania, in the establishment of the conflict prevention network, and in its approach to the interinstitutional agreement on the financing of CFSP, has always shown that it is capable of developing a mature dialogue with the Council and the Commission."
"I would therefore urge that, when Amsterdam is ratified, the Council works more closely with Parliament in the future to develop the CFSP."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur sincerely for the work which he has presented to us."
"I would like to deal with two items, both from the viewpoint of my group and from the viewpoint of the Committee on Development and Co-operation."
"We are talking about a common security and foreign policy."
"The question arises in this context of how we should deal with conflicts."
"The rapporteur stressed this in his report, but it continues to be the case that we come up against unpleasant surprises in this area."
"We have already invoked conflict prevention several times, and I would like to acknowledge in this context that we have now arrived at a code of conduct for the arms trade."
"We shall need to examine the document carefully as well, although we should not overlook the fact that none of this will have any effect on the illegal arms trade - which continues to be our major problem."
"It has been a source of some regret to me that the Council Presidency has not now dealt with some points in the report which are essential in my view."
"In the interests of brevity, I shall do no more than quote the numbers, namely paragraphs 10, 14, 15 and 17: these are the questions that need to be addressed."
"Although the Council Presidency has said it is a matter for Member States, and has passed the buck, it would have been interesting to hear whether there are any approaches which it would be worth pursuing."
"There is one more point that I would like to mention, namely the question of the human rights clause which is to be incorporated into treaties with third countries, a demand which has in fact largely been realized in the development sphere, and for which the legal bases have also been created."
"This shows that foreign policy can sometimes learn a thing or two from development policy."
"Mr President, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has drafted an extremely detailed report, which was discussed at length by the Committee and approved unanimously."
"Every year the European Parliament examines the progress made towards a common foreign and security policy and every year we are forced to admit that progress has not exactly been decisive, to put it mildly."
"Mr Spencer's aim was to bring a greater dimension to this question and to look at it from a broader perspective."
"Bearing in mind that the common foreign and security policy is at a transitional stage and that foreign policy differs in nature from the other policies of the Union, he stresses - and he emphasized this in his speech earlier - the need for a common, rather than a single foreign policy which also highlights the role of the European Parliament, a role which is the subject of a great deal of discussion but which has yet to meet our expectations."
"In addition to specific references to the mechanisms for preventing conflict, for which provision is made in the Amsterdam Treaty, the rapporteur has included an extremely balanced reference in his report to the recent nuclear tests in India and the thorny problem of the code of conduct for controlling the sale of arms."
"There is insufficient time to comment on these questions individually."
"I merely wish to say that the report examines all the crucial questions which occupy the Union and that, generallyspeaking, our group as a whole supports the report, with just a very small reservation of minor significance as regards the idea of converting the Commission's offices abroad into embassies."
"Mr President, 1997 was not a good year for the CFSP."
"The Council does not seem exactly prepared to make active use of the instruments of Community foreign policy."
"What was achieved in Maastricht as the great step forward to a real common policy in that area has turned out to be a damp squib."
"The Union must learn to refrain from making grand promises."
"That is a great pity for its relationship with the ordinary citizen."
"The figures in Mr Spencer's excellent report speak volumes."
"The number of Community actions even decreased in comparison with the previous year."
"The Union is withdrawing into its shell."
"That surely cannot be true."
"In the Middle East, in the Great Lakes area, or in Latin America the Union is allowing others to run rings around it, and is paying for them to do so."
"Last year was also the year of Agenda 2000."
"I still fear that the Commission's financial perspectives are built on quicksand, but this is not a time for short-sighted penny-pinching."
"Enlargement of the Union is after all one of the most important international challenges it faces in this decade."
"These years are years of transition."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam is being ratified."
"Progress has been modest so far, however."
"Experience will show how much Amsterdam has delivered."
"The right of veto could set us back even further."
"I hope that the Member States can look beyond their short-term interests and understand that their common interest lies solely in an effective common policy."
"The obstructive tactics by which the French Government has prevented a genuine improvement in the code of conduct on the arms trade is a glaring example of the effects of the veto threat."
"I only hope that ordinary citizens will understand that it is their governments, not this Parliament, which are responsible for this manifestation of impotence."
"Mr President, in a process of transition towards a new world order characterized by unipolar attitudes and globalization, unfortunately the European Union is still not up to it."
"This is because the political will and the appropriate mechanisms are lacking."
"Unquestionably, what we already have is not being used enough. Also, the Treaties have not been adequately reformed in this respect."
"Albania, Kosovo and Algeria, as well as the latest Iraq crisis, are examples of what the public is understandably so dissatisfied about."
"The political and economic aspects are out of balance, and the terms undoubtedly need to be changed."
"What should be the objectives of an EU common foreign and security policy? First of all, security in Europe."
"Secondly, for human rights and reduced poverty to be the main focus of external action, bearing in mind also the impetus provided by enlargement. In my opinion, we must first make sure that Member States' foreign policies are not too disparate."
"Secondly, we must adopt more common positions and actions. And, of course, we need to anticipate events, using what could be termed ""preventative diplomacy' ."
"There are obvious priorities."
"I have already mentioned Kosovo, but we should not forget the Mediterranean, Cyprus and Turkey, the Middle East and Western Sahara."
"This Parliament has requested that a common position be adopted on this."
"I should like to know the Council's view."
"And the matter of the International Criminal Court is still pending."
"We should congratulate ourselves on the arms code, but not on the understanding reached on the Helms-Burton Act and the extraterritorial laws between the British presidency of the Council and the United States."
"Personally, I think this understanding goes against our own interests and does not abide by the principles underlined so many times by this Parliament and the Member States themselves."
"I think the report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is along those lines."
"Mr President, I think that the picture painted in the Spencer report is a fairly realistic reflection of the way citizens in Europe view Community policy."
"The reality is that every time a major confrontation develops - remember Bosnia, think of Kosovo today, think too of the nuclear tests in India - the general impression is that the European Union seems powerless to act and fails to reach a consensus on how to react to actual developments outside its borders."
"On that score it is and remains the case that, if one asked an ordinary citizen whether we have a credible and effective common foreign policy, there is no doubt what the answer would be."
"Yet I think that the answer from Mr Cook contains a large element of truth, in that the core problem is a lack of political will among the Member States actually to achieve a common foreign policy."
"We could also see that in the Barcelona process, not only in connection with the stalling of the peace process, for which of course Israel currently bears the greatest share of responsibility, but also in the laggardly way in which partnership agreements are concluded. What we see are often blocking tactics which have everything to do with petty-minded national interests but nothing to do with a common foreign policy."
"Mr President, the debate on the common foreign and security policy for 1997 evoked some quite contrasting opinions."
"To begin with, I endorse entirely the report from Mr Spencer which clearly outlined the positions adopted by our Commission with regard to foreign affairs."
"In other words, the report is excellent in that it contains justifiably strong criticisms concerning the current state of the CFSP."
"In effect, and this is my second comment, we have scant reason to congratulate ourselves on the development of the CFSP since last year."
"The situation is, to say the least, not encouraging, even if the President-in-Office of the Council endeavoured, with a measure of clarity and skill, to illustrate what has been achieved."
"I would stress a number of items."
"Institutionally, we are still waiting for the Amsterdam Treaty to be ratified, to the extent that we have still not achieved unity in terms of planning or vigilance, nor even a senior representative in the form of Mr or Mrs CFSP."
"As regards the role of Parliament, within the context of the institutional agreement on the methods of financing the CFSP, whilst we may be delighted to see some progress with regard to the means of parliamentary control over the actions of the Council in this respect, we cannot help but notice that the documents supplied by the Council to date are somewhat short on detail and too lame to excite any enthusiasm in the more demanding parliamentarians."
"Indeed, Mr Spencer deplored this situation in his address."
"With regard to the substance of foreign policy questions, an assessment of the past year leaves us with something of a sour after-taste."
"Many statements were made but few common positions and actions were pursued."
"Moreover, the major dossiers were hardly surveyed by the European Union."
"I might cite the case of Turkey."
"Frankly, our relations with this major partner have not been conducted with consummate skill, with the result that today we find ourselves at a dead end."
"Turkey continues to maintain a hostile stance, Greece and our Parliament continue to block the financial protocol, the Cyprus dossier has been sucked under and the Fifteen choose to assume different positions whereas we need to adopt a clear and consistent common position."
"With regard to the Commission, we are still waiting for it to advise us of the document relating to the strategy to be adopted towards Turkey, which we have now been awaiting for some years."
"This example shows us the dangers inherent in a lack of a genuine common foreign policy."
"We are flying without instruments and this is not very effective."
"If I may refer to the excellent report from Mr Tindemans, adopted a fortnight ago, I would make the same comment with regard to the security policy."
"In fact, it is all a question of political will, others have said this and I would like to stress the point, nothing important will happen if we do not want it to."
"Mr President, the annual report on progress achieved in implementing the CFSP, irrespective of those who drafted it, relates less to an assessment of the specific results of actions conducted in this context than the progress achieved towards promoting a shared Community responsibility, gradually eroding the intergovernmental nature of the CFSP as defined in the treaties, whereas the latter offers the only opportunity to exist and is the only measure of its effectiveness, as we point out in our Amendment No 10."
"Regretfully, the report fails to mention, for want of effectiveness, any individual action by a Member State to the benefit of the whole of Europe, as in the case of Italy with regard to the Albanian crisis."
"We might have hoped that the moderating role played by France in avoiding a disproportionate military action in the face of Iraqi obstruction could be invoked yet again in 1998."
"No, the only genuine progress worth mentioning must be freed of any link with an individual Member State."
"So the report prefers to linger on the major breakthroughs achieved by the Amsterdam Treaty which are, in its opinion, the shared Community responsibility for operational expenditure on the CFSP and the ability to take certain foreign policy decisions on a majority vote and, under that impetus, to advocate the institution of a common European diplomacy, beginning with the conversion of the Commission delegations into genuine diplomatic representations of the Union."
"On the contrary, we consider it essential to reaffirm clearly that this is the purpose of our Amendment No 11, drawing a distinction between Commission delegations and the embassies of Member States, which latter enjoy only diplomatic status, as the main source of information required for initiatives undertaken within the context of the CFSP and which constitutes the main vector of their deployment."
"On this unambiguous basis, close cooperation could be possible between the individual services and might prevent damaging confusion arising in the host countries."
"Depending on the profile adopted by the CFSP in the future, whether serving a modest complementary function or a maximalist function as a replacement for national diplomacy, depending on whether it tends towards a variable geometry or multiplies the votes by majority, it will prove either effective or unrealistic."
"Consequently, the ignorance of national parliaments, the ill-defined extension of its jurisdiction with regard to CFSP matters as sought by the European parliament, backed by the abuse of intergovernmental agreements already practised, do not bode well."
"It is not in anyone's interest that the intergovernmental nature of the CFSP might soon assume a false front that conceals a quite different reality."
"It would then slide in the direction of a purely declaratory and abstract exercise of an artificial and superficial nature."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the excellent words of our colleague Mr Souchet allow me to set aside the speech I had prepared and instead tell you how, in light of the minimalistic, realistic way in which our colleague Mr Spencer dealt with the subject under discussion, I would like to respond to Mr Cook's long statement and, whilst not seeking to reply individually to each item he raised, I would like to make the following points."
"With regard to Yugoslavia, I appreciate the way in which he pointed out our sluggish response to the problem."
"But we should bear in mind that we were motivated mainly by a belief in the legitimacy of the federal, Serbo-communist, Serbo-bolshevik yoke, as I prefer to call it."
"With regard to the refugees, I understand his denunciation of the dilatory response of the Croatian and Serbian governments but, for my part, I also believe that it would have been better than forcing them to return to the place where they lived, where their houses had been destroyed, which only creates further cause for conflict."
"I myself have helped house more than 300 orphans from Croatia and Bosnia with the help of the Christian solidarity group I chair. I know these countries very well."
"I have passed through them and I believe that wisdom suggests that if we can keep Serbian refugees in Serbia and Croatians in Croatia, that is the way it should be."
"Let us keep our dreams of a totally integrated human race for another time."
"With regard to the Middle East, it is almost impossible to ignore the fact that nobody today speaks of the Lebanon."
"But the problems existing in Israel and Palestine are closely related to those in that very country."
"We have been told that the Syrian president Hafez-el-Assad is to arrive in France in July."
"As I understand it, these are inter-state relations, but Hafez-el-Assad is a dictator just like Saddam Hussein."
"He is probably an even worse dictator: the destruction of the town of Hamra, the assassination of the French ambassador Delamarre, the assassination of our paratroops from Drakkar."
"Mr Hafez-el-Assad is coming to Paris, although Lebanon does not yet know freedom, occupied as it is in the south by Israel, in the north by Syria, and Samir Geagea has just experienced his 1500th day of detention, along with the majority of the Christian resistance forces."
"There is a great deal to be said."
"I just do not have the time."
"Mr President, may I join with previous speakers and, in particular, the Presidency in thanking Mr Spencer for the very comprehensive and expertly produced report he has presented on the implementation of the CFSP in 1997."
"He has considered every aspect and on many points I can agree with his analysis."
"Mr Spencer himself points out that 1997 should in fact be viewed as a year of transition."
"A year of transition in the sense that in Amsterdam new elements were added to the Treaty which would bring about changes in the foreseeable future to the effectiveness of the foreign policy pursued by the Union."
"The picture that emerges from the reports shows that further improvements are needed on many points."
"When it comes to more geopolitical questions, the Union is practically always able to reach common policy agreements."
"I refer here in particular to the CFSP in the wider sense and have in mind the policy that has been and is being implemented in respect of, for example, enlargement of the European Union, which is also an important area of external policy."
"I would also mention the initiatives in the field of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, the deepening of cooperation with Russia, the Ukraine and other CIS countries, attention to the Baltic region and the regional approach to countries of South-Eastern Europe."
"The Commission has also produced, among other things, communications on relations with China and the new Trans-Atlantic agenda."
"Initiatives which will all be followed up by consultations in a Council framework."
"At the same time it is positive that the Union is playing a major role in the matter of more horizontal questions of human rights, democracy, nuclear safety, nonproliferation and mine clearance."
"The Presidency has also given a number of examples of those."
"I do agree with the report in that perhaps too little attention is being devoted to developments on the African continent."
"No doubt a common position has been adopted on the prevention and resolution of conflicts in Africa, but the individual disputes in that area, with often terrible humanitarian consequences, perhaps do not feature sufficiently in the deliberations of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs."
"Perhaps they are still inclined to regard Africa more as a subject for the Council of Ministers for Development and Cooperation."
"But this time too it has to be noted, just as last year, that the Union is still in fact failing to react adequately when it comes to acute crisis situations."
"When prompt decisions need to be taken, national reflexes often take over or, at most, consultations on the strategy to be pursued take place in a limited framework, that is, involving a small number of Member States."
"Yes, I agree with Mr Cook: the political will to make use of existing instruments is sometimes lacking and, as I already pointed out in the debate on Mr Tindemans' report on the Union's defence policy last year, when a crisis arose in Albania following the pyramid scandal, we missed the opportunity to play a recognizable role by making use of the possibilities of the Western European Union in bringing the chaotic situation there under control."
"I think it must also be said that we have perhaps again been too hesitant in deploying preventive resources in order to avert a spillover in the crisis surrounding Kosovo."
"There have not even been the beginnings of a discussion on a possible request to the Western European Union to undertake an analysis of the situation and to make recommendations which would then be examined by the EU and used as a basis for any decision to be taken by it."
"In fact the EU waited until NATO took responsibility for the matter."
"The Western European Union remains more Sleeping than Beauty."
"Will the Treaty amendments agreed last year in Amsterdam, once they are ratified, mean a change in the stance of the EU in such crisis situations and contribute to an increase in the effectiveness and visibility of our foreign policy?"
"The appointment of a Mrs or Mr CFSP, who would bring more continuity and cohesion into our external policy, may indeed be a major step forward."
"The establishment of planning and analysis capacity, drawing upon the combined knowledge and information of the Member States, the Commission and the Western European Union, may certainly represent value added."
"The weak point remains of course the decision-making process."
"Certainly the European Council can formulate a general basis for policy by voting unanimously, on which the General Affairs Council can subsequently decide by qualified majority, but the question remains of course how well such a concept would work in the particular case of more topical and acute questions on which decisions must be taken rapidly."
"Fine, experience will be the test, and the next report will no doubt take a view on that."
"I do entertain a certain optimism in my hopes for the new approach based on the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It is an approach capable of promoting greater involvement of all the Member States, hence offering scope for the development of a broader support base for a common foreign policy."
"A major contribution to this support base will be provided, and I emphasize this, by the European Parliament, not only by holding debates on current political situations and adopting resolutions, but also by being directly involved."
"I am thinking here of visits by parliamentarians to third countries and of activities, such as election observer missions and the like, performed by parliamentarians."
"This support base is of great importance, particularly in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union."
"In addition I take the view that, as has already been stated, monetary union will exert a cohesive influence."
"The common monetary policy will undoubtedly have a positive effect on other policy areas."
"By giving concrete content to the new Treaty provisions, but also by then actually carrying out certain Petersberg Tasks, the Union can at least make a start on developing a common security policy."
"In the longer term a common defence policy could evolve, through which the Union would be able to play a role in the European security architecture on an equal footing with other actors."
"The current assessment is that, even where conflict situations are being played out within Europe or at its borders, we are not yet able to perform a key role on an equal footing."
"That vacuum is quickly filled by others and the European Union is then usually approached exclusively in terms of its financial resources, as Mr Spencer has rightly pointed out."
"Only a well prepared and implemented common foreign and security policy can bring about any change in this situation."
"He has managed to avoid that rather nagging tone which sometimes characterizes parliamentary contributions on foreign and security policy, which simply recite our growing list of failures. On the contrary, I think Mr Spencer has managed to achieve a positive tone."
"The Presidentin-Office of the Council, Mr Cook, has assessed the British presidency's performance in this field, now we are halfway through the year, and I think he did it well. Allow me to contribute to this topical debate by saying that I agree with the President-inOffice of the Council that we really are very different, with different histories, and sometimes we are engaged in disagreements, but the fact is that there is a major contradiction between foreign policy and what we are doing in other fields."
"In the context of Economic and Monetary Union, we have decided to launch the euro despite our great differences. This was even done under the British presidency, which is a good manager despite the fact that the UK is not taking part at the moment."
"Nevertheless, in foreign policy we always bring up differences and problems. To sum up in a very fundamental statement, I believe that foreign policy projects and develops a country's domestic strength."
"I would add that there is a clear demand for the EU's presence on the world stage. We are present and, despite our failures, we are developing our presence, for example with enlargement and with Russia."
"Furthermore, they are there all the time, not just when the television cameras are there, and they even try to act with a certain amount of consistency. I welcomed the bravery of Mr Cook, the President-in-Office of the Council, in Jerusalem."
"As for the United States, there was an example today of the sort of things that happen. In the Knesset , the speaker of Congress, Mr Gingrich, referred to the US Secretary of State as ""the agent for the Palestinians' ."
"I believe improvements are needed, and we are continuing - I think - to consolidate everything, but some important instruments are missing. I do not think we went far enough at Amsterdam."
"We have appointed a president of the European Central Bank, we have extended the troika, consolidating the Commission a bit, but then we have a Mr or Mrs CFSP which, at the moment, is an invisible post. Parliament has managed to join in, in budgetary terms."
"Nevertheless, we are not taken into account when it comes to forming an interinstitutional agreement in order to listen to our recommendations and suggestions. I think there is still time, not by changing the Treaty of Amsterdam but by trying to improve our relations."
"So I welcome Mr Spencer's proposals in this respect."
"Mr President, unfortunately the European Union's common foreign and security policy continues to be more a matter of wishful thinking than a reality."
"That is why the Spencer report is quite right to stress that the public has not been given the impression of progress in the development of a European foreign policy."
"The lack of an inter-institutional agreement on the right of the Parliament to be informed and consulted is also a weakness."
"We can only observe with regret that there continues to be a mismatch between the EU's foreign policy and its trade policy activities."
"Given the major foreign policy challenges of the European Union resulting from the enlargement process, the citizens of Europe must be allowed to participate in this process through the involvement of the European Parliament, not in order to throw a spanner in the works but to strengthen the acceptance of enlargement in Europe."
"The European Union will be tested repeatedly against the yardstick of its ability to act in foreign policy matters."
"It is important for the EU not only to speak politically with one voice but also to have available the necessary security policy instruments in order to take peace-keeping or peace-making measures, for the purposes of crisis prevention, whether it be in Albania or Kosovo."
"The deteriorating situation in Kosovo is a priority for Austria as the next Council Presidency but as long as the political will is lacking to exercise real influence here, all initiatives threaten to become a demonstration of impotence, and the European Union runs the risk - as has already happened in the Balkans - of becoming an onlooker at an uncontrollable development and of letting slip the need to act."
"Mr President, the title of the report, ""The role of the Union in the world' , is nothing if not grandiose."
"This grandiose title is followed by a total of 9 headings and 26 points."
"And all of them are peevish, whingeing statements of the obvious, not one of which is bold enough to get to the heart of the matter. Relations between the European Parliament and questions of foreign policy: there is no interpretation, Parliament's opinion is sought neither by the Council nor the Commission, decisions are not taken at a cross-institutional level which would make the demands of the Treaties binding."
"And what about the common foreign and security policy itself: this has progressed from non-existence to inadequacy."
"As the report says: public opinion does not value it."
"There is no coordination in arms exports."
"But the report does not say why or how coordination can be achieved."
"My third point relates to the Community values which it preaches; the following are not included as a sine qua non in the individual clauses of agreements with third countries: human rights and everything else which one could include in these agreements."
"It makes no reference to the typical example of Turkey, which has no respect for anything but which...."
"(The president cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike my colleague who preceded me I congratulate the President on his excellent report."
"It is an important and well-written document because this debate is not resolved in the usual annual meeting but instead it is a great opportunity, firstly, for an analysis and in-depth clarification of the state of foreign policy and the role of Europe in the world; secondly, for a clear and strong awareness on the part of the European Parliament of its role, its prerogatives and its strength; and thirdly, for a precise and specific indication of proposals and suggestions which may lead to real progress in matters of foreign policy."
"On this point, the European Parliament's claim of its right to be informed and consulted on international negotiations and bilateral and multilateral commercial agreements is significant and important."
"Our Regulations, Mr President, should be adapted as soon as possible to reinforce the role and powers of Parliament, to guarantee information and consultation which are efficient and detailed."
"At present, the Council and the Commission snub Parliament: with the information given intermittently to the Parliament they are not fulfilling their obligations with regard to the Treaty, and above all, their duties with regard to the citizens of Europe."
"This is a Parliament which represents 300 million citizens, it was elected by direct universal suffrage in fifteen Member States and it is the strongest democratic Assembly in the world."
"Given this democratic strength, we must demand a greater role for the Parliament to contribute to giving the European Union an authentic foreign policy which, today, as we are all aware, is lacking or is completely insufficient."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commission for their statements this afternoon and Mr Spencer for his report."
"May I begin by congratulating the President-in-Office on securing a ground-breaking agreement on the EU code of conduct on arms exports this Monday."
"I welcome the strengthening of the eight criteria agreed at the Luxembourg and Lisbon European Councils which mean that arms exports from the EU must not be used for internal repression, external aggression or supporting terrorism."
"The code of conduct will enhance the effectiveness of the common foreign and security policy."
"Can I, however, make the plea that the Council's annual consolidated report on the code is published, so strengthening transparency and giving the European Parliament an opportunity to debate and comment on the code's implementation."
"On the operation of the CSFP in 1997, it is fair to note that there have been a number of successes including democratic consolidation in central and eastern Europe."
"The creation of a policy planning and early warning unit and the office of the High Representative, outlined in the Amsterdam Treaty, and already mentioned this afternoon will help improve the visibility of the CSFP."
"However, further work will have to be done on creating closer organizational links between the WEU and EU which under the protocol on Article J VII of the Amsterdam Treaty must be in place within a year of the Treaty entering into force."
"This is necessary to make the CSFP, the Petersberg Tasks mentioned by the Commissioner and the European security and defence identity a reality."
"An inter-parliamentary delegation between the WEU Assembly and the European Parliament would assist in this task."
"In 1998 we have witnessed further progress under the CSFP and many of these have been outlined by the President-in-Office, particularly, I would say, the successful launch of the historic enlargement process."
"Over the coming year, I hope the Council will establish an ever closer working relationship with the Parliament as the CSFP continues to evolve."
"Mr President, with reference to Mr Spencer's report, the House has in fact been in general agreement that little progress has been made."
"I, too, concur with this."
"I can also agree with a further three points."
"Action is notable by its absence when it comes to the will to prevent conflicts, for example in the Balkans, as we have heard."
"Further, there is the matter of interinstitutional collaboration and formal regulations."
"I, too, would like to draw attention to the importance of proper Parliamentary involvement, if this is to be considered a project of the people."
"I agree with the comments made regarding CFSP and the analysis unit, but I would like to emphasize that I regard this analysis unit as a support to the Council, not some lofty new institution."
"However, there are points I must disagree with."
"As a Dane, I am somewhat alarmed at the good intentions described in the report, overshadowed as they are by armament and proposals to integrate the WEU into the Union."
"Naturally, I must distance myself from that."
"The Petersberg agreement is accurately represented, and I endorse this."
"The Amsterdam Treaty describes what could practically be called the prospects of welding together the foreign policies of Member States - as Mr Cook, the Foreign Secretary, said previously - while respecting the wishes of each individual country."
"We must beware of being so ambitious that the project will become untenable."
"New security structures alone do not produce results; the crucial factor is the will of the Member States."
"Mr President, Mr Cook made an impressive statement about the achievements during the British presidency."
"He forgot to mention that the football championships will start in June; maybe that is also due to the British efforts."
"There is an abundance of talkative well-wishers within the Union; the Council issued 124 declarations during 1997 on foreign policy."
"Did they change the reality?"
"The answer is No."
"In the Spencer Report as it stands today there is the wish to integrate the WEU into the Union."
"Maybe some people will have a clear conscience after that."
"Everybody is talking about the weather, nobody is doing anything about it."
"Everybody is talking about foreign policy but where is the substance?"
"If too much time is consumed by secondary matters there is less time for crucial issues like enlargement and the partial inability to act."
"General politics remains the heart of the matter within the Union."
"Everybody wishes to preserve peace and stability but the willingness for joint action remains limited as was shown in Albania."
"One example, as the Middle East peace process slowly dies - thanks to Mr Netanyahu - despite heavy Union investment in the area, the whole prospect of a common, foreign and security policy must be re-examined including, in this case, economic and other sanctions."
"The Spencer Report clearly shows that there is almost no progress in the foreign policy field."
"Congratulations to Mr Spencer for stating the obvious."
"- Mr President, I find myself in sympathy with most of the objectives that have been expressed in the course of a very full debate in which all those taking part spoke with vigour and obvious commitment."
"If I can straight away dispose of the one speech with which I did not agree."
"I could not find myself in agreement with what Mr Anthony said about refugee return in the former Yugoslavia."
"Let us not forget the basis on which those refugees were created."
"They were created by vile, violent and ethnically-based confrontation."
"It is a very important as we construct a new Europe that we construct a new Europe on principle of ethnic pluralism and tolerance of minorities; that is after all one of the standards we apply to countries seeking to be members of the Union and it should also be a standard we apply to countries that seek to be in trade agreements with us."
"I said earlier this afternoon how much we welcome President Nelson Mandela coming to Cardiff."
"We cannot celebrate the abolition of apartheid in Africa, only to tolerate it being created at home in a corner of Europe."
"Otherwise, I find myself in much agreement with many of the objectives stated here."
"The one point that I did feel running through the discussion is that there was sometimes a failure to grasp that it was not enough to state the aspiration in order to deliver the outcome."
"I was particularly impressed at Mr Carnero González listed as failures of the common foreign and security policy: Albania, Algeria, Kosovo, Western Sahara, the Middle East peace process."
"There are immense problems in the world and there are some severe cases of conflict."
"I believe we are setting ourselves a totally impossible task which is bound to leave us all with a sense of frustration if we make the test of a common foreign and security policy whether it has resolved all conflicts within the world."
"First of all, that is unattainable."
"Secondly, I would also counsel colleagues against a modern form of imperialism by thinking that the solutions that we ourselves decide are the right solutions in Europe are necessarily acceptable to those who are involved in conflict in other continents of the world."
"We have an obligation to offer our best offices to assist them in finding a solution and to take measures against those who willfully and irresponsibly prolong conflict or prolong violence."
"Within those two objectives of seeking to achieve a resolution of conflict and to deter people from the use of violence as a means of resolving conflict, we should ourselves find a common position among our countries."
"That will not always produce the solution but we certainly have an obligation to find that common position."
"If you look back over the events of recent months, on a number of these conflict issues, Europe has indeed adopted a common position, has sought to seek to achieve solutions."
"It has not always succeeded and in those cases where we have success, like Bosnia, the process of clawing back from the bitter hatreds of recent years is inevitably going to take time if not a generation to complete."
"I would ask the Members of the European Parliament, whilst they are perfectly entitled to demand a common concern and common action from the Council, to recognize that will not necessarily produce outcomes and will certainly not produce outcomes that will be acceptable in the immediate short term."
"Finally, can I pick up one or two colleagues who have referred to the mechanisms provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty to improve the common foreign and security policy."
"It is indeed the case that when we have the planning and early warning unit and when we have the High Representative in place, we will have a better mechanism for giving expression to the common positions we adopt."
"They will, of course, not have any legal basis until the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified."
"That is up to the Member States."
"Colleagues within the European Parliament can go back to Member States to make sure that they are achieving all possible speed in making sure that they do ratify."
"I am pleased to report to you that we have now almost completed the parliamentary processes in Britain for ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"If other Parliaments achieve the same timescale, we can achieve ratification within the next few months and that will give a legal basis to these steps forward in common foreign and security policy."
"In the meantime, we have used our Presidency to take forward the preparation so that from the moment we have the legal basis to proceed we can proceed quickly with the changes in personnel, the arrangements, the provision for resources in place so that within the legal basis we can act immediately."
"I end with one plea to all Members, I have listened with great interest to a number of speeches this afternoon demanding a common foreign and security policy and condemning the Council for lack of political will in achieving it."
"I am bound to say that in each of the countries from which I heard speakers speak eloquently and passionately this afternoon, I could recite lists of cases in the past five months when their Member State has held out against the others in achieving a common foreign and security policy; particularly in the case of Madam Lalumière who made the most rigorous demands for a common foreign and security policy."
"Building such a common position is not easy, it requires compromise all round."
"We will never get a common foreign and security policy by one nation demanding that the rest of Europe adopt their common foreign and security policy."
"It will require trade-offs between us and if we are going to achieve it our best prospect of achieving it is if we go into it openly recognizing that all countries are going to have to work for the common good and at times are going to have to abandon their own national positions in order to do so."
"Sometimes, and my own country reserves that right, we will have to say no we cannot abandon this particular national perspective because it is too important."
"We have to retain that right to defend a national interest."
"That makes it difficult, of course, to oppose a common foreign and security policy but I would submit to Parliament that it is also an essential part of making sure that we get the popular agreement and the popular support for the legitimacy of the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"South Africa"
"The next item consists of the statements of the Council and the Commission on the situation in South Africa."
"- Mr President, I should like to say how pleased I am that Parliament has chosen to debate this important subject at this important time."
"As Parliament will know, since 1994 the European Union has made a series of commitments to help South Africa through its transition from the apartheid regime."
"We remain determined to continue to help South Africa during the economic and political transformation in its society."
"We in Europe have seen how achieving common goals of economic development and prosperity binds societies together."
"We would all recognize that trade and cooperation between nations is much more likely to bring them closer together."
"The best way for the European Union to help South Africa is to allow South Africa greater opportunities for trade and economic development that will help that country to heal the divisions in its society caused by so many years of hatred and oppression."
"I also believe that South Africa has the potential to be one of the catalysts for growth and development in Africa as a whole."
"The European Union must continue to do everything it can to help to build on that potential."
"Many of the European Union's commitments which I mentioned earlier have already been fulfilled."
"One undertaking we made was to offer South Africa qualified accession to the Lomé Convention and I am pleased to say that this accession will finally enter into force on 1 June now that it has been ratified by all Member States."
"I look forward to South Africa's full participation in the political dialogue between the ACP and the European Union that lies at the heart of the Lomé relationship."
"The European Union and South Africa also concluded a science and technology agreement in November 1996 and talks on separate agreements covering fisheries and wines and spirits continue to make progress."
"In terms of aid, the European Community has committed substantial development assistance of over ECU 100m per year to South Africa through the European programme for reconstruction and development which will continue at least until 1999."
"I can tell Parliament that it is a UK presidency priority to make as much progress as possible in the negotiation of a trade and cooperation agreement with South Africa and on the related agreements on fisheries and wines and spirits."
"In the last few months we have come a long way but I believe that there is a political will to go substantially further before the end of June."
"The trade negotiations have been slow in the past but they gained a renewed impetus last autumn with a detailed South African offer."
"Chief negotiators on both sides believe that a deal which is fair and beneficial to both sides is within reach."
"Indeed, on 30 March the General Affairs Council asked Coreper, together with the Commission, to examine options for improving the European Community offer."
"Talks are now at a critical stage."
"Efforts will be needed on both sides to show flexibility."
"The presidency has remained in close touch with the South Africans throughout as well as working closely with the Commission and other Member States."
"I am encouraged by the repeated statements from South African ministers of their determination to conclude an agreement."
"Both sides will need to look again at areas such as increased coverage of overall trade in order to reach a WTO-compatible agreement."
"Any agreement will also have to meet the concerns of both sides about their offensive economic interests, for example in the agricultural and industrial sectors."
"Naturally, taking account of Community sensitivities and economic interests remains a key objective for our negotiators."
"Throughout the negotiations the Council has been very aware of the potential effects an agreement may have on the neighbouring countries of the South African Development Community."
"Both the European Union and South Africa have repeatedly made clear that the concerns of those countries will be taken into account during the negotiations."
"The European Union/South Africa Agreement must be positive for the whole region."
"With this in mind the Commission has said that it will consider technical assistance to countries of the Southern Africa Customs Union during any economic adjustment period and I strongly believe that the economic benefits an agreement would bring to South Africa will be shared by South Africa's neighbours."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank honourable Members for the interest they have shown in the Council's efforts to reach an agreement with South Africa."
"In particular, I would like to thank members of the delegation for relations with South Africa whom I met earlier in the presidency and whose expressions of support for the negotiating process have been extremely welcome."
"I hope all honourable Members will continue to support these efforts during the critical weeks to come and in the future when the final agreement will require the assent of this body."
"The European Union will have a further opportunity to show the importance it attaches to relations with South Africa at the European Council in Cardiff when President Mandela will be having lunch with the assembled heads of state or government."
"I would like to reiterate my belief that with hard work and good will on both sides a satisfactory result to the trade negotiations can be achieved."
"I hope we can continue to make rapid progress towards concluding the agreement and honouring the commitments we have made to South Africa."
"I again thank this House for its continued interest and support and sense of urgency and priority that a trade agreement is reached with South Africa."
"Mr President, it will soon be three years since we launched an ambitious set of negotiations with the new South Africa, after the Union had set itself a unique goal: that of establishing a long-term framework for cooperation with this important partner, that would underpin its historical transition to democracy and reflect the dual nature of its economy."
"ln April last year, we had the pleasure to welcome South Africa as the 86th member of the Convention of Lomé."
"At the ACP/EC Council of Ministers in Luxembourg, a special protocol was signed which gave South Africa qualified access to the Lomé Convention."
"This fact marked the conclusion of the negotiations on the first track of the envisaged framework for EU/South Africa cooperation."
"But after three years of hard work, we have to note with some regret that the second track, that will lead us to a bilateral trade, development and cooperation agreement, is not yet finalized."
"We have made a lot of progress and tentatively agreed on most sections of the future agreement."
"But work remains to be done in several important areas before we can conclude."
"Last month we had our 18th round of negotiations and a further round is planned for 10 and 11 June."
"At several points the gap between the EU and South Africa remains to be bridged."
"This being said, I believe that there is still a good chance to finish the work soon."
"There remains a window of opportunity for us to use."
"The Commission is making every effort to complete these bilateral negotiations with South Africa before we enter into the post-Lomé negotiations next autumn."
"On the South African side, we also understand that there is a wish to conclude the agreement with the EU before the start of the electoral campaign for the country's next general elections that are due to take place in the first half of 1999."
"What are the main outstanding issues?"
"Firstly, a few problems remain on non-trade issues, notably on the wording of our proposed non-execution clause and on the question of the future financial resources that will be available for development cooperation with South Africa."
"No financial amounts will be mentioned in the agreement, but the Community is called upon to give the political reassurance that financial assistance to South Africa will indeed be continued beyond the year 2000."
"Secondly, several issues are still outstanding in the area of trade-related aspects, which are essential to any free trade arrangement."
"Further discussion and negotiation will be necessary to agree on precise undertakings in the areas of anti-dumping, safeguards, competition policy, government procurement, intellectual property and maritime transport."
"Finally, some real obstacles need to be resolved in the trade sector in order to arrive at an agreement with South Africa that meets the principles which the Community considers essential, and to which I will refer briefly."
"The first principle is its full compliance with WTO requirements."
"As you know, it is widely understood that a free-trade agreement should cover not less than 90 % of total trade between the parties in order to avoid possible interpretative discussions in the context of the World Trade Organization."
"The current EU offer covers 89 % of imports from South Africa."
"The South African offer proposes to liberalize 81 % of its own imports from the European Union."
"Both offers therefore represent a significant step towards improved market access, but they are not attractive enough to the other side, and they may not be sufficient to secure the WTO compatibility of the agreement."
"The time has come for both sides to increase the coverage of their respective trade offers."
"We know it is not an easy step to make, because it touches on sensitive sectors and interests on both sides."
"But we need to move in this direction while bearing in mind the two principles of reciprocity and asymmetry which underpin our trade talks."
"Tariff elimination on the European Union side will in principle be quicker and achieved within 10 years."
"The South African offer is based on a 12 year transitional period."
"If we can move towards additional trade concessions, we would secure deeper improvements in market access and, at the same time, a significant element of differentiation that would take account of the differences of development between the two sides."
"The second principle is coherence with EU common policies."
"The trade agreement with South Africa must be coherent with existing European Union policies such as the European Union's common commercial policy and, in particular, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy."
"South Africa is the first case in the Union's history of a preferential agreement where the objective of free trade also applies to agriculture."
"The bulk of the European Union's agricultural concessions to South Africa are scheduled to begin after 2003 or 2005, so that they can dovetail with progress in the CAP reforms."
"Some agricultural products will, for the time being, remain excluded from tariff elimination."
"But even for these products, partial liberalisation may be considered in certain cases and a regular review should be foreseen."
"Tariff concessions are also envisaged on fisheries products but they remain conditional upon the progress achieved in the negotiations for a separate fisheries agreement."
"The third principle is the coherence with the provisions of agreements with other preferential partners."
"Our agreement with South Africa must also be consistent with the European Union's existing external agreements, with particular attention to Mediterranean countries and the countries of the ACP group."
"Fine-tuning will be necessary in order to protect the key export interests of these countries at the European Union market, but also to assure that the terms of SA access to the EU market is comparable with that of countries in a similar position."
"Consistency will also be sought in the area of rules of origin."
"Finally, the fourth principle is that we must have a strong developmental dimension, for the benefit of South Africa and its neighbours."
"It is our definite objective to ensure that the EU/SA agreement will have a positive developmental impact not only for South Africa itself, but also for the southern African region and the ACP group at large."
"From the outset of the negotiations two years ago, we began a process of regular consultations with the ACP group and various sub-groups whom we meet regularly. Based on what we have heard during this process, we are confident that, if successfully worked out, the agreement between the European Union and South Africa will be of benefit not only to both parties, but also to many others that have strong economic ties with South Africa."
"How can we assure the positive impact that we are aiming for?"
"I would say that the answer is in political commitment informed by sound economic analysis."
"The political commitment is there."
"We are still working on the analysis."
"In our view the impact of this European Union/South Africa free-trade agreement will be felt in three concentric circles."
"First, there are benefits to accrue to the BLNS countries - Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland - the four neighbours of South Africa which belong to the South Africa Customs Union, SACU."
"Second, there will be benefits for the SADC region - the broader circle of 14 countries covering the whole of Southern Africa."
"And third, we have to look at the wider ACP family."
"We expect ongoing studies to confirm that the free trade agreement will bring significant gains for consumers and entrepreneurs alike."
"The business community will have access to a cheaper and more diversified range of supplies for their inputs and capital goods and they will thus stand better prospects for investing, exporting and hiring additional staff."
"Job creation and an investment drive in the region are expected to be the main positive effects of our free trade agreement with South Africa, and will be enhanced by a more intense economic cooperation."
"The principles which guide the Union in its negotiations with South Africa give no ground for controversy."
"They echo the ambitions of the new South Africa, which has placed itself at the forefront of an 'African Renaissance' ."
"As the European Council prepares itself to greet President Mandela in Cardiff next month, it is essential for us to ensure that the Community translates its commitments into a generous and innovative agreement that will foster trade, enhance development and promote peace and stability in the region."
"As we enter into a decisive phase of these ambitious negotiations with South Africa, we are fully aware that the agreement we shall reach is of importance to many others and will be seen by many ACPs as a crucial test for the future of Lomé itself."
"It is for us to demonstrate that free trade can take place in a developmental context and to reconcile mutual interests with solidarity."
"I hope our Member States will join us in expressing these views and if this is so in Cardiff, I am confident we will succeed very soon."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate the UK presidency on the clear commitments they have made to these trade and development talks."
"I would also like to thank the Minister of State himself for his willingness to prioritize this matter with us in the European Parliament."
"As they have both said, we have reached a very critical stage in these negotiations."
"Neither of them actually mentioned the fact that we have had the postponement of the nineteenth round which was due to take place this week."
"This is a very worrying delay in a very difficult process."
"It is one that I have been aware of since I was the rapporteur on the interim agreement."
"However, in the light of the South African negotiating team's willingness now to put forward a new - and significantly improved - offer of possibly 85 % product coverage, does the Council anticipate that there will be commensurate adjustments coming from the Commission in the negotiations on our side?"
"Let us be clear."
"The South Africans now are saying that they are willing to make substantial adjustments themselves in order that we can see some clear progress."
"Unless the European Union is prepared to take clear initiatives to revitalize these talks, we risk jeopardizing the whole process."
"I do not want the President-in-Office to think that I am alarmist but the reality is that the EU has only two weeks to prepare an appropriate response which can ensure that the essential elements of the trade components of the negotiations are concluded and ready for discussion in Coreper the following week."
"Naturally, we do not anticipate a final or complete agreement but we should aim for 'fine-tuning' and no more during the Austrian presidency."
"This will happen if we have substantially agreed the main and most contentious trade issues."
"Obviously asymmetry has to be taken out of the cupboard and given a good dusting down and has to be discussed very fully in the negotiations."
"The Commission has mentioned that already."
"In the context of a global changing market, any agreement on the liberalization of trade set to take place in the timescales envisaged would be unlikely to survive."
"There is the reform of the CAP, there are the new GATT negotiations, so is it not likely that they will be both outdated and meaningless in the timescale being dealt with?"
"Let us be prepared to get back to basics."
"Let us stop getting bogged down by product-by-product wrangling."
"We need to be generous."
"President Mandela is approaching the end of his presidency after showing courage and unrelenting determination to ensure a better future for South Africans."
"We have a clear part to play."
"The President-in-Office may recall that in January I asked him in Strasbourg if it was possible that we could invite President Mandela to Cardiff to sign an agreement."
"He is now coming to Cardiff to say farewell to heads of state - and to savour the delights of the capital city of Wales!"
"Would it not be icing on the cake if we could acknowledge at that time that broad agreements had been reached between the European Union and his country of South Africa?"
"Mr President, I also want to have a more global approach to this problem and step back somewhat from the details of the negotiations."
"When I was a minister, I myself had to take part in various negotiations in the Council of Ministers, including those relating to transit agreements with Austria and Switzerland, and I know how you can get bogged down in details if you lose sight of the whole picture."
"When South Africa, after a long, dark period of apartheid, achieved a very honourable return to democracy the Western World rang with laudatory declarations and promises for the future of the country."
"The European Union too rallied behind those declarations and promises."
"The economic boycott which South Africa had had to endure was to be transformed into economic cooperation, and South Africa was to get generous aid from the European development funds."
"That was the picture shortly after the achievement of majority rule."
"And, happily, it came to fruition."
"That has all been detailed again by the President-in-Office of the Council and by Mr Pinheiro."
"South Africa receives considerable financial aid to overcome the effects of apartheid and those projects are faring well, as far as I have heard."
"The major problem, however, is in the trade agreement, which has been dragging on for three years now."
"Precisely that agreement is of great importance to South Africa because, after the years of economic boycott, South African agriculture and industry need a chance to grow and export, to Europe as well."
"That is indeed the only real way to fight poverty in South Africa and to stimulate employment, also for the black population."
"There is 40 % unemployment in the country, especially among young people."
"That is far too high."
"We have to realize that."
"It represents a grave danger for stability and perhaps even for democracy in that country."
"The increasing crime rate is also bound up with that."
"Against that background it is hard to understand why the negotiations are dragging on so long, and it is also hard to understand why they have got bogged down in such details."
"Of course South Africa has also had problems."
"We are well aware of that, particularly in relation to the surrounding countries, and that is also a serious point."
"But the real brake on the negotiations is in the hands of the Member States which have refused to make concessions, particularly in the area of agriculture."
"That is the nub of the problem."
"My group considers that it is high time to put a stop to that insidious process of detailed negotiations and to make a gesture towards South Africa."
"This means that every Member State must give some ground."
"But the result can be a real agreement."
"We think that when President Mandela comes to Cardiff - I have had the pleasure of meeting President Mandela several times - that generous gesture must be made to him."
"Perhaps the heads of government must have the courage simply to draw a line under the negotiations and say ""let us go ahead and do it' ."
"We want to reach out a hand to Mandela and we want South Africa to be able to conclude good agreements with Europe and thereby gain a chance to develop its economy."
"We need that, Mr President."
"Hence my general political appeal, avoiding the endless details that are being dished up again now."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the statements they made before Parliament today."
"We are all disappointed at the rate of progress in the negotiations for the trade cooperation and development agreement with South Africa but it is important that the end result of the negotiations is an agreement which is beneficial to the long-term interest of both parties to these negotiations."
"South Africa is the major economic force in sub-Saharan Africa and the European Union is its principal trading partner."
"It is clear that any agreement will have far-reaching implications, not just for our future relationship with the Republic of South Africa but also with its neighbouring countries."
"Parliament should take the opportunity presented by today's debate to reaffirm its commitment to the political aim of reaching a wide-ranging and comprehensive agreement with South Africa which is fair to the interests of both parties."
"I would like to express my full confidence in Commissioner Pinheiro and his team of negotiators who I know will make every effort to conclude an agreement in line with the negotiating mandate they have been given by the Council of Ministers; a mandate which did not reflect the public statements or commitments given by heads of state or government to President Mandela which, of course, raised very highly the level of expectations in South Africa."
"In April the Commission officials put forward a series of proposals which would allow a level of openness of 95 %, a significant improvement on previous European proposals."
"I hope that South Africa will shortly be able to respond to this improved offer and that every effort will now be made to conclude the negotiations as near as possible to the target date of mid-1998 or at latest by the end of the year."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to say in my capacity as chairman of Parliament's delegation for relations with South Africa, that I and my delegation colleagues have had extensive discussions with South African government ministers and representatives of NGOs concerning the European programme for reconstruction and development in South Africa."
"It is my belief that this aid programme continues to make a valuable contribution towards the promotion of the economic developments of the disadvantaged within South Africa and I hope that this programme will be continued after 1999."
"I will conclude by inviting the Commission to submit a proposal for the continuation of the EPRD to Parliament and the Council as quickly as possible for our consideration in good time before the end of the present programme."
"Mr President, what began as the start of a new era has in reality been a malodorous affair up to now."
"The dual approach of South Africa involving qualified membership of the Lomé Convention and bilateral negotiations geared to free trade is the right one."
"The results in practice have been less appealing."
"Exclusion of 45 % of agricultural products is in conflict with the spirit of that approach."
"The Union must make a generous gesture."
"What is at issue here is an asymmetric agreement with a country in which, for the moment, everything is not as it should be."
"The Union must prepare a follow-up reconstruction and development programme. When the current one runs out in 1999, it merits immediate continuation."
"I should like to hear from the Council and the Commission whether more attention can be devoted in the aid-giving process to the security aspects of development."
"South Africa is ravaged by crime, and a culture of violence has taken a grip on the country."
"There must be more control of arms flows."
"Perhaps the Council can also comment on the action programme of the Union on small arms and the conference it recently held in South Africa."
"Mr President, the advancement and the conclusion of negotiations between South Africa and the Union marks, in our view, a vital step forward."
"The stakes, as the President-in-Office of the Council reminded us, consist in consolidating the human and democratic progress achieved in that country to contribute to a development generating business and jobs and to promote, through South Africa and its extensive influence throughout southern Africa, stability, peace and the future development of an entire part of the African continent."
"To this end, we hope that the next meeting between President Mandela and European Union leaders may record not only further advances in the negotiation process, but also the ability to bring them to a conclusion."
"To achieve this, the Commission and the Council must provide evidence, as their representatives have just confirmed, of the generous spirit that spurs European governments forward in their relations with South Africa and provide a measure of the mutually advantageous consequences that might derive from the furtherance of economic relations between the European Union and South Africa."
"Of course, the promotion of interactive relations with South Africa must not cause us to sacrifice a production sector in the Union, particularly agriculture, which too often serves as a common currency in agreements between the Union and Third World countries."
"But in this case, the problems are not comparable."
"Not a great deal of our production is truly competitive, due to the problem of distance and the reversal of seasons which may contribute towards promoting complementarity as opposed to competition."
"We must pay great attention to these matters."
"So, within the context of a necessarily asymmetrical approach, we must spread the spirit of solidarity that binds us through all production sectors in the Union."
"In addition, by reviewing the product exclusion list on an annual basis, we will better understand the competitive situations and will be able to restrict the number of products concerned from the outset."
"To conclude, I would say that our co-development and solidarity actions should be expressed through other instruments of the Union, such as direct financial aid or the Lomé Convention."
"With this in mind, I would hope that the Commission and the Council might seek in the coming weeks to conclude an economic agreement which would reflect the support of the people of Europe for those who conquered apartheid."
"Madam President, I would like to express the grave concern of my group over the state of the negotiations between the Union and South Africa."
"Years ago the European Parliament had already formulated very precise proposals taking account of the legacy of apartheid and of the need for regional integration, and making a clear appeal for asymmetry for the benefit of South Africa."
"The Union proposals that are still on the table make no response whatsoever to the demands which had been very clearly formulated by the European Parliament."
"I would like to focus attention on four points."
"Firstly, the problem of inadequate access for South Africa's agricultural products to our market, while at the same time heavily subsidized farm products from the Union wreak havoc on the South African market."
"Thus, on the point of consistency with other EU policy sectors, the European Union must examine its own conscience."
"Secondly, protectionism with regard to certain finished products from South Africa."
"Thirdly, concessions which mean very little in the short term or come into effect so late that by that time the exporters have long been forced off the South African market."
"Finally, the point of loss of income from customs revenue, for Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland: no satisfactory proposal is currently on the table from the European Union."
"Hence my appeal: let us indeed be generous."
"Let us be innovative, for up to now this has by no means been the case."
"Madam President, when South Africa achieved the impossible and had a peaceful transition to democracy, the whole world applauded the inspiration which President Mandela gave us."
"The whole world also applauded the sacrifices made by the front line states in leading up to that achievement: Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia and the other states."
"All of them have a very specific vested interest in the outcome of these talks because those countries are locked in to a protectionist regime which benefitted them."
"It was not that they wished it but that was the system."
"I am not convinced yet that the proposals from the European side are going to replace that dependency which they have been landed with."
"I would echo the sentiments from all sides in the House for generosity and I am very encouraged by the unanimity with which this is being approached."
"This is a time when Europe can come to a conclusion and sweep aside some of the detailed objections from vested interest and come to Cardiff and say to President Mandela: we applaud you, we salute you but not just with fine words but with action."
"I echo the spirit of the House and I ask the Council and the Commission to take this as one of their top priorities."
"Madam President, it is regrettable that no real progress has been made in the important negotiations between South Africa and the EU on trade policy."
"For more than three years South Africaʼs democratic government has had to fight against a discriminatory trade policy on the part of the EU."
"The EU is South Africaʼs major trading partner."
"Nevertheless, some countries are pursuing a protectionist policy with regard to products such as wine, fish and agricultural produce."
"For example, the EU subsidizes tinned tomatoes and thus completely ousts South African tomatoes from their own market, resulting in growing unemployment."
"This is particularly damaging because it is primarily women that are affected, each of whom, by working in this industry, supports 7-8 people."
"The white population continues to own 87 % of all land."
"One-third of the population is unemployed, one-third has work and one-third has informal work."
"The problems facing South Africa are substantial."
"It will, for example, take at least 20 years to get to grips with the housing shortage."
"South Africa is a country that has risen from apartheid and political oppression."
"There is a broad-based political movement that is resolutely fighting to create a new South Africa - something which none of us who for many years worked in the antiapartheid movement dared even to dream about."
"It is especially important that the EU should support this young democracy in its battle for peace and stability and that it should help to increase the prosperity of the country."
"South Africa has now made further concessions in the negotiations."
"The Presidency has a special responsibility for ensuring that the EU is now finally ready to sign this agreement."
"It would be both significant and fitting if Nelson Mandela were to be permitted to put his name to this important agreement for South Africa while he is still President."
"Olof Palme once said ""Politics is a question of the will' ."
"Now is the time for the EU to show that will!"
"Madam President, now that South Africa has become a model of democracy, an exception in that part of the world, we in the European Union should do everything to support that process."
"Let us also be clear: at this time when the Truth Commission under the chairmanship of Archbishop Tutu is working to dispel frustration, hatred, violence and oppression, a word of support and appreciation, admiration even, is worth a lot."
"Certainly, when we hear Mr Cook, as President-in-Office of the Council, in his speech earlier saying that we must do everything to promote democratization in the world and we then proceed in a childish, indeed, petty manner to refuse to allow access to our market and to sign an association agreement, then I think there is only one thing we have to add for the British Presidency: no Presidency has more to do than the present Presidency in Cardiff, when President Mandela, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, comes to speak to all the members of the European Council, in order to hand him an agreement ready to sign."
"We are counting on the British Presidency to know clearly how to play things, but we also know that the resistance does not emanate from the Commission and it is not Parliament that is resisting the agreement. It is the fault of the Council and the Members of the Council that no agreement can be reached and that does not do you credit, Mr Cook."
"Madam President, I too welcome the steps that have been taken to conclude a trade agreement under the British presidency and the personal commitment of the President-in-Office but I hope that these efforts will be rewarded so that when President Mandela comes to Cardiff he will not simply be thanking European leaders for help in the past during the apartheid years but will be able to thank them for taking steps to achieve a full and fair trade deal."
"Commissioner Pinheiro said that the need was for a political commitment informed by sound economic analysis."
"I have to say there is also a need here for a moral dimension; a recognition that business-as-usual EU agricultural protectionism is causing real suffering in South Africa."
"Mr Henderson mentioned the work of the EU South Africa delegation but what are we to say when we meet South African Parliamentarians who tell us that surplus EU beef in Namibia is destroying beef production in Southern Africa or that subsidized EU fruit and vegetables are undercutting domestic production and destroying the South African canning industry."
"Earlier this year the largest canning firm in South Africa laid off two thousand seasonal and four hundred permanent workers."
"High tariffs in the EU and cheap EU subsidized exports to South Africa were cited as the major factors."
"In the context of up to 50 % unemployment, the impact of those job losses is clearly disastrous."
"If the EU had been more forthcoming three years ago, this might have been avoided and those jobs saved."
"One could go on product by product, category by category."
"There are also as the President-in-Office I am sure knows, serious problems with regard to dairy products and the South African Government needs more time to conclude a regional strategy before it opens its markets to further imports of subsidized products from the EU."
"The problem really has been this going on category by category, this book-keeping attitude and what is obviously now needed is the generosity and goodwill that various Members have spoken of."
"I should say in conclusion and with regard to Mr Wijsenbeek's remarks about the problems in the Council, that if some of the Members here had been able to convince their own national governments of this attitude we might be having fewer problems now."
"It is at least heartening that this House is united."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union shares in the responsibility for the democratic and economically prosperous development of South Africa."
"Given the tussle over questions of detail which are at times hard to explain, it may reasonably be asked what market disruptions the European Union has to fear."
"It is the largest trading community in the world."
"Millions of jobs in our countries are accounted for by export activity which makes a major contribution to European prosperity."
"However, with 373 million consumers the European Union is also an exceptionally important import market which should not be subject to any protectionist barriers, and certainly not in relation to developing countries which are dependent on access to world markets and which urgently need the income from exports in order to deal successfully with their transformation processes."
"South Africa also urgently needs a trade policy outlook in order to secure sustainable development in peace and stability."
"This will be to the benefit of the entire region of southern Africa, as has rightly been said a number of times."
"Truly it is time to launch a non-discriminatory trade system with South Africa and to settle any unresolved questions without further delay, so that the negotiations on the free trade agreement can be concluded favourably at the Council meeting, without any smallminded restrictions."
"There is an old saying: where there's a will, there's a way."
"If the European Union has the genuine will - and this applies to the Council in particular - to arrive at a positive conclusion, it will also strengthen the readiness of its negotiating partner to compromise."
"I rely on the good will of the British Presidency to achieve a breakthrough and so to set the course for the positive development of Africa and thus of the whole area of southern Africa."
"Madam President, I begin where Commissioner Pinheiro finished, namely on political commitment."
"What has happened to the European Union's pledges of support to the process of consolidating South Africa's fragile democracy?"
"When they meet him in Cardiff, can European leaders look President Mandela in the eye and say we have fulfilled that promise?"
"South Africa in the past year has made tremendous strides and tremendous efforts in transforming and opening up a closed economy."
"What has the EU done?"
"The EU has continuously changed the parameters on the basis of which South Africa entered these negotiations."
"From a five-year transition period to no transition period at all, from an FTA based on maximum asymmetry to an FTA in strict conformity with WTO rules."
"The European Union still insists on parallel dismantling of trade tariffs in certain key sectors."
"I am rather struck by the irony of the Commission now using South Africa as a model for future Lomé trade negotiations."
"This will be the test after South Africa itself was refused Lomé trade access as it was not a typical Lomé country."
"We cannot be complacent about the consequences that these negotiations are having and will have on the people of South Africa."
"In Capetown this Friday over 30 representatives of South African trade unions and members of the South African parliament will be meeting to discuss the impact of the agreement on the livelihoods of the South African people."
"It is their duty to find out what their concerns are and I hope they will be addressed in the coming months."
"Also, parliamentarians from the SACU countries recently presented their written submission to Commissioner Pinheiro and to the UK presidency."
"We need to look at these concerns and I would ask that copies of this document be made available to all Members of this House."
"As far as regional strategy goes, I would suggest to the Commissioner and to the UK presidency that we consider a statement of intent signed by the Commission and South Africa, which would address how regional concerns would be addressed in the future."
"Finally, until this proposed free trade agreement is acceptable to our parliamentary colleagues in South Africa and in the SACU countries, I, for one, will consider that this proposed agreement is not acceptable and I would urge this House to vote the same way."
"Madam President, I share the general concern over what already seems to me to be the excessive prolongation of negotiations with South Africa."
"And, like all my colleagues, I consider that the European Union should honour its responsibilities and support the consolidation of a non-racial democracy in South Africa by means of economic development."
"That economic development will also enable South Africa to deal with the crime and lack of security that have been mentioned."
"I also agree that the European Union should support Nelson Mandela, that great world figure, whom we look forward to seeing soon in Cardiff."
"But I would like to know, and I therefore ask Commissioner Deus Pinheiro, who will have no difficulty in replying in Portuguese, what is happening?"
"What is holding up an agreement which will bring a fair deal both to South Africa and, of course, to European producers?"
"Is it just a matter of groundless European protectionism or are there serious reasons?"
"Which agricultural and other products are causing most problems, and what alternatives might we find to exclusion, pure and simple?"
"Another thing: what effect will an agreement between the European Union and South Africa have on its neighbouring countries?"
"And how can the Lomé rules be applied to South Africa without detriment to most deprived ACP countries?"
"That is to say, how can we help South Africa to fulfil its role as the driving power of economic development in Africa, in our mutual interest, genuinely but without undue domination, and with due consideration for other states in the region?"
"- Madam President, I should like to make one or two remarks in conclusion."
"I do not propose to cover the points I made in my initial remarks or in the remarks made by Commissioner Pinheiro. One thing I would like to say is that I am impressed by the sense of priority given to this issue from all quarters in this Parliament and to the need to conclude a trade agreement."
"It is very important to have that bedrock of support."
"I am pleased to see that support also extended into the important area of agriculture, one of the more difficult areas in negotiation."
"A number of participants in the debate raised the question of what kind of flexibility will be shown?"
"Is the Commission in a position where it can show flexibility?"
"The starting point is that there needs to be more flexibility on all sides if negotiations are to proceed more swiftly to a conclusion."
"In the event that more flexibility is shown by the South Africans - and I hope that will be the case - on the basis of the Council discussions on this matter at an earlier stage this year the Commission has some flexibility to be able to respond to any initiative which might be forthcoming from our South African colleagues."
"On the matter of the South African Summit and President Mandela's visit, I would think that all of us would very much welcome that visit in the broadest political context."
"My honourable friend Mrs Kinnock said that it would be icing on the cake at Cardiff if an agreement could be reached by then."
"I agree that it would be icing on the cake but the importance of President Mandela's visit is that it can act as a vital spur to us all to proceed as swiftly as possible through the issues, not making concessions where we cannot make concessions and not ignoring issues which need to be addressed."
"But it is a spur to us all to tackle those issues in a positive and constructive way so that even if the icing cannot be on the cake at Cardiff, it can perhaps be there by the autumn."
"- Madam President, I think we are all agreed that the moment of truth is at hand for both sides, and within the European Union this means the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"Let me be clear that the British presidency has been extremely important and of great assistance in pushing forward this dossier in a manner which I would like to emphasize publicly."
"As we have all heard, Parliament has been pushing and putting all its political weight behind getting more flexibility and more generosity."
"Having said that, I should like to touch upon two or three points which might be important."
"Firstly, this round of negotiations was not postponed because of the Commission but because the South Africans were not ready."
"They wanted a further postponement which we refused for one simple reason."
"If we have our meeting on 10 and 11 June, there is still a possibility, if we work hard, of reporting to Coreper."
"We must do our utmost in order at least to give the British presidency a broad draft of what we would be seeking a blessing for in Cardiff."
"We cannot miss that opportunity."
"I have consulted my colleagues who have been more involved in the negotiations and they are prepared to work 24 hours a day if need be in order to push it as far as possible and give the British presidency a chance."
"This is not easy but we know it is willing to take it."
"Secondly, regarding BLNS countries, of course we have been looking at it very seriously and I would like to tell Parliament that as we did for economic union in UEMOA we are prepared to devise a similar programme in which for a transitional period the loss of income from customs will be compensated."
"In the medium and long-term there is an automatic compensation but in the short term problems may arise and we have told the countries we are ready to assist them during that period."
"Another matter I should like to touch on is that it may have been true a few years ago that beef exports from the European Union were competing unfairly in South African market but not for in the last two years."
"What is happening now is that the cheap beef from Argentina comes at such a price and with such devious ways of entering the country that this is really the problem now."
"We have slashed export subsidies by nearly 80 % in order to make sure that is not the case as regards South Africa."
"As regards wine, imports from South Africa have increased 150 % even with the current tariffs so you will understand that having excess wine production in Europe there is some concern about liberalizing the market."
"This is not some kind of book-keeping."
"We are talking about serious issues and we have to be coherent in the different aspects of our policies."
"Finally, regarding asymmetry, this has nothing to do with WTO."
"We can have whatever asymmetry we want."
"What we cannot do is come up with an agreement and afterwards WTO tell us it is not compatible."
"So, we must make sure that what we propose to WTO is compatible so we will have legal security with regard to our agreement."
"My final point is that the political commitment made by the European Union to South Africa justifies the kind of flexibility the Commission has proposed."
"I sincerely hope the Council will approve what we proposed which is a significant step forward as regards the European proposal."
"Unfortunately, it is up to the Council to decide."
"Many thanks, Commissioner Pinheiro."
"I have received six draft resolutions in accordance with Article 37 paragraph 2 ."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Economic policy guidelines of the Member States and the Community"
"The next item is the debate on the report (Doc. A4-0193/98) by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the Commission's Recommendation for the Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States and the Community (drawn up in conformity with Article 103 (2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(89)0279 - C4-0291/98))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the broad economic policy guidelines ensures proper transparency and participation in relation to the correct framework for the management and direction of the euro and the first steps and guidelines for monetary union."
"The broad economic policy guidelines are essential for defining the European dimension of economic and monetary policy, as demanded by monetary union and the euro."
"The report I have the honour of defending before the honorable Members expresses a broad consensus on the part of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, where it was approved virtually unanimously with no vote against."
"This consensus should be adopted by all the European institutions too - the Council, the Commission and Parliament - because the construction of monetary union and the euro requires very extensive, firm agreement, precisely in order to guarantee the necessary solidity and strength of the European currency, and sustainable growth of the EU economy. That can lead to higher employment levels and thereby allow us to resolve our most serious problem, unemployment."
"The report emphasizes and respects the prime objective of maintaining price stability, but it also gives important indications about aspects essential to orienting the European economy and guaranteeing steady growth with high employment levels."
"So it stresses the importance of investment, which will be favoured by an economy with a low inflation rate and low interest rates. Everybody knows that favours investment, and also saving."
"The report also recommends that the conditions set out in the Stability and Growth Pact are adhered to as rigorously as they deserve to be, and in accordance with the agreement made when that pact was established. That means reorganizing public finances and continuing with the processes of convergence and economic coordination between the Member States."
"The report does not envisage an increase in fiscal pressure because we believe that could distort investment. However, investment is taken into account as an important factor for growth in the European Union."
"The wage factor plays an extremely important role in this growth, and is considered essential in order to ensure a better level of employment."
"So there is a proposal to decrease the non-wage costs which penalize job creation."
"Social security benefits must be maintained, but consideration has to be given to their funding, based on economic growth itself and on appropriate agreements between the economic and social players, so that these agreements can offer positive results thanks to fruitful social dialogue."
"The report also stresses the need to increase the competitiveness of the European economy in an open and globalized situation, such as we have at present."
"The report mentions several important aspects for obtaining these increased levels of competitiveness."
"The development of infrastructures which favour an improved system of production, education and workrelated training, and research and development are key elements to ensure the success of the European economy in the immediate future."
"Wider competition is also important."
"Finally, I should like to emphasize that there are still barriers in the European internal market which should be removed. There are inflexibilities and major distortions in basic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, so we must attain greater flexibility and liberalization."
"It is important that, right from this initial point, the proposals made by the Commission and by Parliament in this report are borne in mind. So I think it is important to give prior notice that tomorrow we will present an oral amendment to insist that when Ecofin adopts the broad guidelines for economic policy, they take full account of the proposals made by the European Commission and Parliament."
"We do not see them as the end of a process, but as the start of a new stage which should see the participation and coordination of all the powers of the EU. Obviously, it should also lead us achieve a new political and monetary dimension for the European Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we view the recommendations of the Commission as balanced and fair."
"They seek a measure of compatibility between the requirements of a balanced budget and monetary stability on the one hand, and the aims of sustainable growth and increased job opportunities on the other."
"They contain specific appeals to certain countries and certain operators in the economic world."
"All this is fine, but what concerns us and what concerns the entire Parliament, I believe, is the outcome we should expect from these recommendations."
"Some commentators and keen observers of political life have already pointed out that the entire system does not meet expectations, in the form of an economic government or coordination procedures which genuinely ensure that the Member States will adopt these recommendations."
"There is therefore considerable room for anxiety."
"In fact, this would not be the first time that bold announcements by statesmen at the highest level, at the summit, whether in Amsterdam or Luxembourg, have been gradually and insidiously stripped of their content by concerted action, an unnatural alliance if you wish, between national administrations to retain power and since the recommendations of the Commission must pass before this body, the Monetary Committee, we can be sure that everything they contain that is relevant, with perhaps a few rough edges too, will be peeled away by all those despots who wish to retain their powers and who, between them, assume they have a duty to offend no-one."
"In this way, they prevent the Commission applying recommendations that might be misunderstood or ill-received by one or other of the Member States."
"This is a type of conspiracy with which I have been very familiar for some time and which, unfortunately, is unlikely to change even though we have made a further concession."
"Article 103 was formulated a long time ago and we might hope that this article, which today should be interpreted in a wholly different way since we now have the Central Bank and we now have a single monetary policy, might make a contribution towards coordinating economic policies."
"I believe the device on paper could be good if the recommendations from the Commission were actually Commission proposals."
"We are well aware that when a Commission proposal is stripped of its real meaning by the Council, the Commission can withdraw it."
"Here, we are talking of a recommendation and it cannot be withdrawn."
"The result is that we do not know what the ""Ecofin' Council will do, or which document it will be working on."
"But we might reasonably fear that this document does not contain any of the more relevant recommendations."
"Madam President, I would like to welcome the Commissioner to the House and thank him for the communication on the broad guidelines to economic policy."
"I would also like to pay particular tribute to our rapporteur who has brought forward a very balanced document which recognizes the new reality in which we now operate."
"We are dealing with a global market."
"It is important for us as a Union to take account of our competitiveness as well as creating new opportunities for employment and growth."
"On top of that I believe the present Amsterdam Treaty for the first time underlines the importance of employment within the overall European Union development."
"It is important for us as a Parliament to recognize our role in bringing to fruition the ideas of what the people of Europe want to see."
"They do not want to see broad economic guidelines debated here once a year, having no effects to them on the ground."
"They want to see positive developments and I am suggesting tonight that there is a number of positive things that we can do within this Parliament."
"Firstly, we can look at our own role - look at the legislation that we bring forward and make sure that it does not impact negatively on the employment creation and on encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship within our Community."
"Secondly, there is a vast wealth of experience and knowledge of different systems, of different methods of employment and employment policy within this Parliament."
"May be instead of dividing ourselves into the left and the right or the free marketeers and the laissez faire or whatever, we should come together and try and bring the best practices from all those ideas into one united policy."
"Thirdly, as the budgetary authority we should be more focused in how we allocate funding in the social fund and the Structural Funds to reward those that are achieving the most with regard to meeting the guidelines as laid down by this House."
"Let us not forget that we have within our ambit a raft of powers and a series of measures which we can utilize."
"Our rapporteur has already mentioned a couple of them in his own speech and in his report."
"I would like to focus in particular on the SME sector and on the kind of supports that we can put into place at Community, national level and at local level."
"The biggest engine of growth and employment in economic terms should be given extra support."
"Finally, could I point very briefly to where we should go in the future."
"For the 21st century our motto should be giving our citizens the tools to cooperate and to work within the new Europe."
"Madam President, both the broad economic guidelines and the rapporteur's work once again reveal that a number of measures need to be taken by the Member States and by the European Union as a whole after EMU comes into effect."
"I would like to follow on from Mr Herman when he said that in fact we already know what has to be done but that we lack the resources to bring about real coordination."
"Precisely now that EMU must be helped on its way, it is extremely important that the Member States take the necessary measures, in particular to regulate the labour market in such a way that unemployment is brought down."
"In this connection I would point to a number of developments in the Asian world, where events are governed by factors completely different to those in Europe."
"We cannot sit on our hands and look on."
"We must be very active indeed in implementing the proposed measures."
"However, we have been proposing these measures for a number of years and, in my opinion, things are not moving fast enough. I therefore ask the Commission to urge the Council to implement the proposed measures as soon as possible."
"Madam President, this proposal by the European Commission is confirmation and proof positive of the hardline, in our view, single-minded approach which colours all Union policy and which is perfectly illustrated in the Stability Agreement, the application of which is already speeding up apace."
"The new form in which the policy guidelines have been presented is our first confirmation of the official division of the European Union into a union of fast- and slow-track Member States."
"This division by the European Commission is wholly unacceptable."
"The Commission, in its proposals, insists on even stricter economic policy, on continuing and hardening political austerity, on promoting privatization, on deregulating industrial relations, on reforming the national health system and on reducing state funding for the national health system."
"And yet it is precisely this approach which is responsible for the unacceptable social ills and unemployment in the Union."
"The report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy takes the same approach."
"Not only does it heartily accept the findings, conclusions and guidelines of the European Commission; on several points it even outshines the Commission by demanding yet tougher measures to the detriment of the workforce and to the benefit of private-sector profitability."
"It demands that individual and collective wage increases be subjugated to monetary stability and profitable investment, it seeks a flexible wage structure which depends on productivity, region and sector, it calls for the abolition of state aid, it suggests that privatization should be speeded up, that private-sector capital should be injected into public-sector investments and that intervention is needed in pension funds and is indifferent as to the consequences which this will have on social protection in the Union."
"Mr President, we intend to vote against this report, which, unfortunately, does not record our ""no' vote to the Commission."
"We refuse to accept and endorse a policy which sacrifices the rights of the masses to the interests of a handful of bankers and monopolies."
"We support the plight of the workers, which is taking on ever-increasing dimensions, and we shall continue to do so."
"Madam President, this report had to be produced hastily, and that may be the reason for its general nature."
"All Parliament can certainly unite in the opinion that the coordination of economic policy is now, with the birth of the euro area, more important than ever."
"This will certainly stand us in good stead for continuing cooperation with the Commission."
"The Commission has for the first time taken a genuine step forward in the direction of concrete targets for employment with these broad guidelines which they have laid down for the economy, and our group is very satisfied. We wish to emphasize that employment must really be the focal point of the coordination of economic policy in the future."
"The costs of unemployment are a heavy drain on national economies."
"We must absolutely ensure that national economic resources are targeted at growth and sustainable action."
"Our group naturally wishes to stress that growth, which is what we are aiming at here, should be more purposefully sought in connection with the preservation of the environment."
"It is quite astonishing how hard it has been to move along in this direction, although the formulae are pretty well-known to all."
"We should be able to make it more and more costly to pollute the environment by fiscal means, and correspondingly be able to then lower income tax."
"Hopefully, the requirements of the Amsterdam Treaty will make this ecological tax reform more likely and more realistic now that we are embracing the euro."
"We are living in a decisive age when the European Central Bank will surely take a part in economic policy that is just as large as we allow it."
"My group would like to state that it will be terribly important that a counterweight is created through a truly common economic policy, so that the ECB does not ascend to a position that is too dominant."
"Madam President, it is the first time since the decision of 2 May that this Parliament has been asked to give an opinion on the subject of economic policy, in relation not to a decision-making act, but to a recommendation of the Commission to the Member States on their policies."
"We know the extent to which these policies are becoming delicate and difficult to manage, precisely because of the decision to complete the third phase of the Treaty and therefore of economic and monetary union."
"Now, the states only have control over taxation, while control over the budget has been taken away."
"All of this may create problems for the various areas in the individual states of guaranteeing the competitiveness of all areas."
"The French economist and banker, Antoine Michel, said that there have to be three essential conditions for an area to be competitive, since competition will now no longer be between companies but between area-based systems: an area-based system must be able to have efficient administration, fair and if possible light taxation, and infrastructures whose purpose is to be competitive."
"I think that it is the duty of every Member State to ensure that there are no forced transfers of resources from one area to another, because this would constitute waste."
"I am referring in particular to Italy, where there are already large-scale programmes for the transfer of resources from productive areas to areas that are at present assisted."
"This will create serious difficulties; in my opinion this is not a policy of rebalance but a policy of imbalance."
"It would therefore be appropriate if it were in fact the European Parliament which told the Member States that resources should especially remain and be invested where they are produced, since the whole of Europe will grow in accordance with these virtuous policies, whereas there would be serious consequences if this were not to occur."
"Madam President, can I start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, for his report on the broad economic guidelines."
"I, along with the rapporteur, welcome the Commission's emphasis on achieving a high level and rate of growth of employment."
"It is clear from those guidelines that we require a policy mix which is favourable to economic growth."
"However, what is also clear is that with inflation averaging 1.6 % in those countries within the European single currency zone, perhaps a slightly more relaxed monetary policy, combined with an increase in internal demand, will increase much needed employment across the European Union."
"The British presidency has promoted the idea of a flexible labour market and this, along with an increased demand for internal products, services and capital, in addition to growth through exports will be, I believe, the catalyst for those essential jobs that we need here in the European Union."
"Reference has already been made to the birth of the euro and I believe, along with many other people on this side of the House, that the euro will improve the operation of the single market and in the medium to long term increase jobs in general across the single market."
"Many opponents of the euro have claimed in the past that job losses have resulted from Member States meeting the convergence criteria."
"I would suggest that in the longer term job increases will be the order of the day as a result of these developments."
"The future and security of Europe will also depend on the ability to get as many as possible of Europe's twenty million people back to work."
"The depressions in the early part of century and in particular the 1930s led to mass unemployment and two world wars."
"Jobs are being created but not quickly enough because jobs are being lost nearly as quickly."
"The unemployment figures today are nearly as high as they were when the Essen summit took place not long after my election to this Parliament in 1994."
"I believe that the conditions are right for job creation now and, as we say in my country let's make hay while the sun shines."
"With low inflation we can now do that."
"I, therefore, suggest that the Member States of the European Union take that course of action."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the introduction of the single European currency on 1 January 1999 in eleven Member States of the European Union has been agreed."
"From this date onwards, the European Central Bank will be responsible for a single European monetary policy."
"That is why it is becoming ever more important to take further the co-ordination of national economic policies."
"It is necessary on the one hand in order to secure the long term stability of the European currency, and on the other in order to create the appropriate framework conditions for growth and employment."
"Decisions taken by the European Council on economic policy guidelines are a particularly important instrument in this regard."
"The European Parliament collaborates intensively in this matter, according to the provisions of the Treaty."
"In this context, on behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, I should like to congratulate my colleague Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on his excellent report."
"In its recommendation, the Commission gives guidelines which are directly addressed to the individual Member States in order to arrive at healthy state finances."
"I welcome these detailed recommendations which are targeted at the specific situation of the country in question."
"In my view, they are more useful than generally formulated proposals which are directed at all countries without taking account of the circumstances of each case."
"I expect, and this is no more than the application of the Treaty, that the Council will decide on the basis of the Commission's proposals, because in the first place the Commission has made some very sensible proposals here, and in the second the Treaty itself prescribes that this is the procedure to be followed."
"The stability and growth pact is an important and innovative instrument for the greater co-ordination of national budgetary policies which is essential."
"In good times, the objective is to have balanced budgets or surpluses, so that a policy of assisting growth can be pursued in economically difficult phases."
"As a Christian Democrat, I would describe this as an economic policy following the rules of the Bible, which always tells us that in the fat years we should put by stores for the lean years."
"In my view, the importance of the stability policy for growth and employment cannot be underlined often enough."
"Today's historically low long-term interest rates are the result of the consistent stability policy of recent years."
"Low interest rates mean confidence in the stability of economic development."
"This is the way in which stability policy creates the environment in which growth and the resultant employment become possible."
"The first steps towards greater co-ordination can also be discerned in tax policy."
"The code of conduct for corporate taxation recently adopted by the Council points in this direction."
"We are also seeing the first signs of a solution to interest taxation."
"A switch from the principle of country of destination to that of country of origin in the case of value added tax remains on the agenda."
"However, the objective of greater co-ordination of national tax policies is not complete harmonization."
"The internal market lives on competition."
"That also includes competition about which state offers its citizens and businesses the services which are expected from the state on more favourable terms."
"That is why this competition between the systems will also be an essential component of European tax policy in the future."
"There will also be a greater need for co-ordination in relation to the competition policy of the Community and its member countries, the Community's structural policy and the creation of a European infrastructure."
"There is also a need for action in relation to the ecological and social framework conditions of the European market economy, because our objective is to create a European economic policy which is based on the principles of an ecological and social market economy."
"The report from my colleague Mr Gasòliba i Böhm is an important contribution towards this!"
"Madam President, it is now and in the near future that decisions will be made on all of the questions that will determine the course taken by the European Central Bank, which - if I am correctly informed - starts work this coming Monday."
"This is all very well, but where do my country and its government feature in this picture?"
"As a European-minded Swedish liberal who belongs to a party that has clearly declared itself to be in favour of European cooperation, I find it sad - distressing, in fact - that my own countryʼs government has denied itself the opportunity to influence these decisions which are so vital to future employment and prosperity throughout Europe."
"Madam President, on 2 May last I voted in favour of a single currency with cautious enthusiasm."
"I voted for the motion because I believe that the euro is better than a Belgian franc bound indefinitely to the German mark alone and it is better than the mighty American dollar."
"But in this Assembly I have always expressed the opinion that the arrival of the euro will not affect unemployment, which hits more than 20 million Europeans and which is caused partly by relocating companies in countries where manpower is 40 to 50 times cheaper than in Europe and partly, which comes back to the same thing, by the immigration of populations from outside Europe that expands the ranks of job seekers."
"Nor can I believe any longer in the dogma of interest rates which remain constantly low."
"A euro, as strong as it is, will require, whatever anyone says, gradual increases in interest rates."
"I therefore invite the Commission to assume a more realistic, rather than an optimistic approach and to exhibit greater courage in its decisions on the most pressing matters to protect the jobs we still have and finally to inspire those young people who no longer believe that they have a promising future."
"Madam President, the submission of the guidelines of economic policy by the Commission does indeed this time bear the hand-writing which was previously inscribed in the family album of European employment and economic policy by the Amsterdam resolutions and by the Luxembourg employment summit. This gives us hope that at long last an appropriate and properly balanced policy mix is emerging for the economy of the European Union."
"That is why the EU Finance Ministers are called upon to launch Community strategies for investment and employment, and finally to undertake co-ordination of economic policy in such a way that it merits the name, as it is set out in the Maastricht Treaty."
"The European Union must place economic policy in the service of employment."
"Around a third of current mass unemployment is caused by a failure of overall economic co-ordination."
"The Maastricht Treaty must at long last be implemented in economic and employment policy as well."
"In addition, we need growth which is supported by investment and provides employment."
"We need not only an upturn in economic activity which exploits unused capacity, but above all a medium-term process of growth which creates new productive capacity and new jobs."
"A decisive role will be played by an increase in the investment quota which continues to be quite scandalously low!"
"The pre-conditions for this sort of growth process supported by investment are more favourable now than they have ever been, and the Commission rightly draws attention to this."
"Now it is essential to deploy public sector investment as well and to dress the Delors White Paper infrastructure programmes for modernisation and innovation in new clothes."
"A European investment pact must lead to public resources flowing into productive uses, into an investment alliance between states and private business."
"In the process, thought must be given in particular to the stimulus effect for small and medium-sized businesses."
"Entry into the 21st century cannot be achieved solely with monetary union."
"In the interests of our fellow citizens, as I have already said, we need at long last to have a European economic and financial policy and more co-ordination, ."
"The Commission is called upon to see to it that European economic research institutes draw up an annual report on the state of the economy and of employment in the European Union, as a contribution to steering European policy."
"Madam President, it is a rather odd situation that, although I am officially the rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am the last speaker but one; but that is a formality that I need not dwell on."
"The final report by Mr Gasòliba and the Commission proposal, in my honest opinion, represent clear progress compared with the previous reports."
"More balanced attention is devoted throughout to macroeconomic policy, on the one hand, and to structural policy on the other."
"That does not mean that I am completely satisfied."
"Thus, in my opinion, when analysing stability, employment or unemployment is systematically underestimated as a factor in it or as a hindrance to it."
"On the other hand, flexibility, of which the value and necessity are fairly controversial, is systematically overestimated."
"I considered and still consider that the guidelines offer little in the way of a concrete strategy for the stimulation of demand, to which the report itself urges substantial attention to be devoted."
"The only thing about which a lot is in fact said is the control of wage development, and I get the impression that this relates mainly to wages governed by collective agreements."
"When I look at experience in my own country, the Netherlands, the polder model, I can report that there is extensive control of wage development as far as collective agreement wages are concerned, but that there is a scandalous trend in non-agreement wages, where the top incomes in firms in which wage rises were limited to 2.5 % have gone up by over 30 %."
"I would appreciate it if that aspect were also covered in the reports of the Commission, for it is ludicrous to exert constant pressure for low wage rises under collective agreements and to say nothing about the rampant growth in wealth at the top."
"I think it important to ask for a few points of action, and the most important one for me is that an effective form of parallelism should finally be created between the Council and the Commission in preparation and decision-making relating to employment and macroeconomic guidelines."
"There is too much evidence of compartmentalization in which people talk in complete isolation from one another at both staff and Council levels."
"I once proposed that the decision-making should take place in a Finance, Ecofin and Social Affairs Council, and I happily repeat that request, that advice, here."
"Otherwise you will not arrive at a serious, integrated and balanced approach."
"Finally, it surprises me to hear arguments constantly presented for more regional differentiation in the field of wages."
"I favour the argument for wage development which takes account of or is based on productivity, but I am against pressing for regional differentiation throughout Europe based on the pattern in Germany."
"If you think that can run smoothly and without doing damage, I advise you to look at developments which have taken place in the United Kingdom."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the only question weighing on the minds of Europeans today is whether the major economic guidelines submitted by the Commission will tackle the unemployment problem effectively and substantially."
"My reply to this question is clearly that if all the necessary steps are not taken, it does not add up."
"I am pleased to note that the report by Mr Gasòliba and the Commission debates have persuaded our Parliament to insist on the need to revive domestic demand and also to insist on the urgency of revival through investments."
"But I am sorry that the question of reducing working hours has not been properly expressed by the Commission."
"And I can only view as a provocation the Commission text concerning the implementation of a reduction in working hours across the board, which states that the Commission considers that this raises serious problems and would prefer a more diverse, negotiated solution."
"In my view, this is either too much or too little."
"It is too much, because clearly public opinion in France has regarded it as a challenge to the French government."
"And that lies outside the jurisdiction of the Commission."
"It is too little, because if we were to take a tally of all the issues that raise problems today in terms of employment and the economic future of Europe, much is missing."
"I would have liked to see the Commission dispute with equal vehemence, for example, increased flexibility, a drop in wages, the fact that part-time work prevents an increasing number of wage-earners leading a dignified existence, in other words it slows down domestic demand and an upsurge in consumption, which is to say growth."
"Either the Commission draws up a list of all the issues that might threaten growth and the future of Europe, or it should abstain from commenting on national issues; it is also regrettable that the Commission should refer to the texts produced by European employers in this respect."
"At all events, I am pleased that Mr Gasòliba and the Commission have reinstated the proposals in Mr Delors' White Paper, which seem to me to be much more relevant than the existing Commission proposals to solve the unemployment problem."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this preparatory year in which we draw up the major economic policy guidelines is of particular importance."
"Your House has understood this well."
"I would praise the professionalism with which you have contributed to the drafting of those guidelines."
"The quality and consistency of the report delivered by Mr Gasòliba must be stressed, I offer him my compliments."
"I am also pleased, on behalf of the Commission, to note the support which the European Parliament showed for his recommendations concerning the major guidelines for economic policy in 1998."
"This support is important for two reasons."
"Firstly, because it emphasizes the operational nature of these guidelines, the first of their kind following the decision to enter Economic and Monetary Union."
"Secondly, because it confirms the consensus in favour of the contents of the European economic policy."
"The operational nature of the coordination of economic policies depends both on the framework of that cooperative spirit and the manner in which it is deployed."
"With regard to the coordination framework, following implementation of the Economic and Monetary Union, the major guidelines are designed to serve as a genuine programme of European economic policy."
"Hence, the 1998 Broad economic policy guidelines fit in the context of real multilateral controls, whereby the strict coordination of economic policies, which remain subject to national jurisdiction, assumes its true importance."
"This is why the European Councils in Amsterdam in June 1997 and in Luxembourg in December 1997 invited the Commission to formulate recommendations under the terms of Article 103, paragraph 4, in the situation where a Member State might ultimately compromise the successful operation of the Economic and Monetary Union."
"Those very European Councils requested that the Broad economic policy guidelines take account of long-term employment programmes and employment guidelines."
"The Commission will ensure that these duties are performed consistently and it will assume full responsibility in this respect."
"How do we implement this framework; and how do we monitor this coordination?"
"Quite rightly, this year the new major guidelines include specific recommendations for individual countries, with regard both to public finance and structural matters."
"Similarly, the recommendations proposed by the Commission, with regard to the euro area as a whole, coincide with the arrival of the euro and represent quite a novelty."
"These various recommendations, which come in the wake of the resolution of the European Council in Luxembourg are vital."
"Amending them, to arrive at a less precise and therefore more restrictive formulation, would not satisfy requirements concerning the coordination and monitoring of economic policy in Europe."
"But in order to render the Broad economic policy guidelines more operational in terms of monitoring and coordination, we need a more accurate definition of the function of all those participating in economic policy in Europe, including the European Central Bank with regard to monetary policy and its contribution to Community goals, Community institutions in terms of balancing the entire economic policy, national governments in terms of budgetary policy and all social partners in terms of fixing wages."
"In the light of this, Mr van Velzen, I do not think the Dutch example that you mentioned can be instituted across the board in Europe."
"It seems to me more of a local concern."
"As to regional differentiation, everybody generally believes this to be necessary."
"The example of Italy, especially Southern Italy, provides the proof; we must take due account of productivity."
"You are aware of the Commission proposal regarding the broad guidelines."
"This meets the requirements in terms of consistency and comprehensiveness, whilst complying with the principle of subsidiarity associated with the implementation of economic policies in Europe."
"I therefore back the resolutions put forward by a number of you, including Mr von Wogau, Mr Herman, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mrs Randzio-Plath, that the Commission, when striving to adopt the new GOPES, should prevent national feelings prevailing over Community interests, or those of the Economic and Monetary Union."
"In the same vein, I would remind you that the Treaty stipulates that decisions concerning the broad economic policy guidelines must be approved by a qualified majority, these are the terms of Article 103.2 of the Treaty."
"Hence the Commission recommendations may be adopted by the Council by a qualified majority."
"There is no need to seek unanimity at all costs."
"To make sense, coordination of economic policies must be the operational instrument that guarantees genuine multilateral monitoring, organized and administered by the Commission, in close liaison with your House."
"At all events, this is the aim of the Heads of State and Government, as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council in Luxembourg."
"This is the philosophy of the broad guidelines, which is designed to confer on them an operational nature."
"I now come, briefly, to the contents of those broad guidelines, which I have already spoken to you about in detail."
"I will therefore confine myself to the basics, from a macroeconomic and structural aspect."
"I would remind you that from a macroeconomic point of view, the broad guidelines for 1998 set out two aims at high level: employment and the success of Economic and Monetary Union."
"It is for this reason that the Commission is pleased to congratulate your rapporteur unreservedly on the strategies he advocates and I am thinking in particular of item 6 in your draft resolution."
"Similarly, as reflected in its recommendation, the Commission endorses the need expressed to achieve adequate levels of private and public investment, as stated by Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Your House, Mr Hendrick, is also concerned about the subject of domestic demand."
"Well, I can assure you, the Broad economic policy guidelines take this dimension of economic policy into account, although demand must not be stimulated artificially."
"The aim is to ensure that investment and consumption gradually dispense with exports in order to achieve self-maintaining growth in the medium term."
"Incidentally, the latest Commission forecasts confirm that this dynamic is already underway."
"Finally, with regard to structural policies, your rapporteur approves the Commission recommendations, whether they relate to product markets, services, capital or job markets."
"As the European Council recommended in Luxembourg, the Commission recommendation establishes broad guidelines and an effective instrument promoting sustained convergence between Member States."
"Hence the Broad economic policy guidelines are focussed more than in the past on measures designed to enhance the growth potential of Member States in order to boost employment."
"This is why the Commission attaches such importance to putting forward recommendations to improve competitiveness, the effectiveness of job markets, goods and services, education and information and to render tax and welfare protection schemes more favourable to employment."
"With regard to a reduction in working hours, your address, Mrs Lienemann, does not, it seems to me, represent the views of the Commission and I can tell you that the contents of the report and the Commission recommendations reflect not more nor less than the contents of the White Paper of 1993, presented by Jacques Delors."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that these new broad economic policy guidelines define the resources for monitoring and controlling the coordination of economic policies."
"This approach, adopted and supported by your rapporteur and your draft resolution is all-encompassing and consistent."
"The exercise of this coordination function, and I weigh my words carefully, as concluded by the Heads of State and Government must not tomorrow be abused."
"The implementation of the Broad economic policy guidelines, which is vital to the satisfactory operation of Economic and Monetary Union, essential to the deployment of a coordinated strategy to promote employment, will depend on the political will of Community institutions and national governments."
"The Commission, for its part, will remain vigilant in the controls it exercises and will keep you closely informed of these."
"Many thanks, Commissioner de Silguy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m. tomorrow."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.22 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Consultation of the ECB by national authorities"
"The next item is the report (A4-0195/98) by Mr Herman, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the consultation of the European Central Bank by national authorities on draft legislative provisions (COM(97)0725 - C4-0147/98-98/0056(CNS))."
"The rapporteur is not yet here."
"I shall give him the floor when he arrives."
"Mr Giansily, of the Union for Europe Group, is here however, and may have the floor for three minutes."
"Mr President, it is true that it would have been preferable, I feel, to have heard my address after Mr Herman had justified his own position but I will gladly tell you of the matters I wish to raise concerning his report."
"Firstly, Mr President, Article 105, paragraph 4 of the Treaty, reflected in Article 4 of the statutes of the European System of Central Banks, stipulates that the European Central Bank is consulted by national authorities on any draft legislative provision within its field of competence, but within the bounds of, and according to the conditions established by the Council, in line with the procedure set out in Article 106, paragraph 6."
"The purpose of the draft decision before us is to specify the conditions, obligations and limits imposed on those national authorities that intend to adopt regulations that fall within the field of competence of the European Central Bank, bearing in mind the overall objective which is to underwrite practical operation of the ESCB and the European Central Bank."
"Owing to the diversity among Member States in terms of their organization, the draft decision allows them a free hand with regard to those aspects we have just discussed, provided, it goes without saying, that the principle and rules fixed by that decision are observed."
"Let us remember that the European Central Bank is the central body and that all authorities must appeal to that body beforehand whenever they intend to adopt amendments to the prevailing rules in sectors within the field of competence of the ECB."
"We give our consent, Mr President, to this entire development."
"However, we do not share the fears nor do we endorse the requirements put forward by the rapporteur which he has included in the amendments."
"On reading the proposals by Mr Herman, which I commend, it is clear that the impetus behind his proposals is the will to accelerate the process of a federal Europe by providing the Council, especially in respect of Amendment No 4, with retaliatory powers in order to impose on states special standards which the national bank would be reluctant to accept."
"This does not, however, seem to be in keeping with the spirit of the Treaty."
"All the debates in recent months prove that the will of the overwhelming majority of this House is to protect the European Central Bank from political pressure and to guarantee its independence."
"To seek to place it at the heart of a pressure group seems to me to contradict everything that has been said in recent months."
"This is why, in view of the formulation of the excessively restrictive text of the rapporteur, in our opinion, we would prefer the original enacting terms of the text of the Commission, which seems to us most appropriate, more flexible and more open."
"Similarly, we do not think it is necessarily a good thing to start out with an attitude of mistrust with regard to national authorities."
"Thank you very much, Mr Giansily."
"Since the rapporteur is now with us, I invite him to take the floor."
"Mr President, please accept my apologies."
"This building is so huge, especially the furthest extensions, that it took me five minutes simply to get out of the place where I was attending a meeting in order to come here."
"It is an advantage to be able to address you as a rapporteur after the speakers, because this gives me the opportunity to reply to them."
"But first of all, I would like to explain the reason why I proposed these amendments."
"There is absolutely no intention to give the Central Bank supplementary powers."
"There is no desire, as Mr Giansily observed, to enclose the Central Bank in a network of pressure of which it would be the victim, none at all."
"What I wanted to do is this."
"The Commission, and the Council too, I might say, allows itself too frequently to be guided by legal experts."
"Those experts hit upon a formula that was perfectly valid when they sought to settle matters with the European Monetary Institute."
"Why is that so?"
"Because at that time the Monetary Institute was still not the Central Bank."
"Monetary policies and the central banks were to remain active up to 1 January 1999."
"Consequently, if the Member States were to take steps that fell within the direct or indirect jurisdiction of the Central Bank, it was quite normal that they should consult the Central Bank."
"That was the arrangement."
"But since the legal experts and diplomats were not always sufficiently bold or particularly pushy, what did they achieve?"
"Once the text had been agreed, they incorporated it for the next stage."
"They did not revise the text to allow for the fact that there would be a move to a different stage, that the Monetary Institute is not the Central Bank and that the Central Bank, once installed, would apply a single monetary policy."
"From that moment forward, things change."
"Once a single currency has been established, why should states still have the authority to solve, for example, the problem of the legal situation regarding the bill of exchange or the cheque?"
"What sense was there in citizens having a common currency, if they have to be subjected to 15 different legislative procedures when they use a bill of exchange or a cheque?"
"The system proposed by the Commission does not alter these matters."
"One simply consults the bank."
"For my part, I would like to reaffirm the principle that all matters that come within the jurisdiction of the Central Bank should from now on, and this is the text of the Treaty itself, be subject to European legislation."
"But I accept that individual legislations are only remotely linked to currency and that, indirectly, they fall within national jurisdiction."
"And there, of course, the consultation terms proposed by the Commission seem to me to be perfectly acceptable and normal."
"This is why I have drafted amendments that restate this point."
"And I am pleased to note that my convictions were shared unanimously by the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs, including the main Committee itself."
"For this reason, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Giansily's argument does not reflect my intentions nor the spirit of the text, since the text read out by Mr Giansily has twisted the words slightly to make them say what I did not wish to say."
"Mr Herman, I know how punctual you normally are, so when I saw you were not here I knew something important must have happened."
"But I should inform you that at the start of his speech Mr Giansily said he wished he could have heard you first."
"You made a lot of references to Mr Giansily but, according to the Rules of Procedure, he had the right to listen to you first."
"Somebody who has definitely heard you first is Mr Ribeiro, whom I now invite to take the floor for two minutes, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"Mr President, I have once again listened to Mr Herman with great pleasure, in spite of our differing views."
"Now that the euro has been adopted, it is necessary to speed up everything which has already been in the course of preparation for its practical introduction."
"This is what the Commission's proposal does, whether or not it is to the liking of those who have been opposed from the start to this process, which serves a strategic plan."
"It would give expression to Article 105 (4) of the Treaty, which provides that the ECB must be consulted by the national authorities on any bill or draft legislative provision relating to matters within its competence."
"Where the Commission says 'weaken them' , Mr Herman says 'finish them off' ."
"I think the proposal is still too decentralizing, which I admit would have been justified in 1991 to avoid frightening off (effaroucher) some of the Member States involved in the proposal."
"Now that it is no longer necessary to say the opposite of what you mean in order not to frighten anyone off, because public opinion is gradually becoming resigned to the coming of the euro and all it implies - which is also in the explanatory preamble, - and, as I say, it is being subjected to a disinformation campaign - for Mr Herman a step, even an accelerated step, is not enough: his report wants a leap forward."
"And that leap, quite apart from the amendments, adds a clause to the Commission's proposal which will mean we can no longer speak of national authorities."
"There will be little that is national, and nothing authoritative, about those bodies, which will be obliged to consult and comply with the ECB's opinions, even though they are endowed with the democratic legitimacy the ECB patently does not have."
"Mr Herman has exceeded his remit."
"And I doubt whether my fellow Members who are going to vote for this proposed resolution have had sufficient information about what they are voting on, because this report has been adopted with such vertiginous speed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate in progress this evening may seem technical, yet it is important and necessary since it deals with legislation relating to the setting up of the European Central Bank."
"Your House has therefore been consulted on four proposals from the Commission and three from the European Central Bank."
"Naturally, I will only address those concerning the Commission."
"Three of the four proposals do not pose a problem."
"Your rapporteur intends to approve them: this relates to the scale of contributions for a share in the subscribed capital of the Central Bank, matters relating to the taxation of ECB staff, privileges and immunity."
"I can therefore only express my delight in your support."
"The problem relates to the fourth proposal for decision, in other words that relating to European Central Bank consultation by national authorities on the subject of draft legislative provisions; in this respect, your rapporteur proposes four amendments."
"I would, first of all, like to recall the general philosophy underlying this text before setting out the position of the Commission with regard to the four amendments."
"On a philosophical level, if I might call it that, the Commission proposal is inspired by a particular principle and past experience."
"The principle is strict compliance with the Treaty. The experience relates to that we gained, as a whole, in respect of the secondary legislation relating to the European Monetary Institute, an experience which, I believe, brought satisfaction."
"I would also like to state that no-one could claim that a single currency might lead automatically to the genesis of a unique euro financial market."
"Of course, there is a very strong market logic and certain practices will find a certain similitude in a number of market sectors, and here I am thinking in particular of the monetary market."
"Yet, other alignments depend on conditions prevailing outside the market and even on Economic and Monetary Union."
"Hence, the inauguration of a single financial market, totally integrated, is predicated on a certain degree of harmonization."
"Some of these harmonization processes lie within the jurisdiction of the Community, whilst others are a purely national concern."
"With regard to Community jurisdiction, I am thinking in particular of the legislation on savings, the taxation aspect of which was covered by a draft directive which the Commission adopted only recently and which has been issued to you."
"I am also thinking of the directive on the prospectus, or even the possible adaptation and possible harmonization of accounting rules."
"With regard to the jurisdiction of Member States, I am thinking in particular of the schedule for the states' sovereign issues, but at the same time I am thinking of legislative reform with regard to insolvency, bankruptcy or, indeed, the regulation of financial institutions."
"In all of these areas, substantial progress is a prerequisite for the introduction of a fully-integrated euro financial market as, if I understand it correctly, your rapporteur wished to see."
"This is the thinking behind our proposals."
"I will now move on rapidly to a survey of the four amendments."
"Amendments Nos 1 and 2 actually go back to the matter I just raised on the sharing of jurisdiction between the European Central Bank and the Member States with regard to regulation and financial matters."
"As I suggested just now, the introduction of the euro can lead neither to automatic harmonization nor to a transfer of jurisdiction - indeed, Mr Giansily stressed this earlier."
"Incidentally, this transfer of jurisdiction from national level to Community level is not specified in the Treaty."
"Therefore these two amendments extend beyond the scope of Article 105, paragraph 4."
"Yes, Mr Herman, things will change on the 1 January 1999 and I have said this many times in your House."
"But the Treaty will not change, nor will Article 105, paragraph 4."
"This is the reason why the Commission cannot endorse these two amendments."
"I would simply like to reassure you."
"In truth, the main precautions have been taken in this respect."
"Consequently, in the convergence report, first of all, the European Monetary Institute and the Commission have assessed and confirmed legislative compatibility of those Member States joining the euro movement, with respect to their central banks, with the provisions of the Treaty."
"Secondly, should a Member State adopt a legislative text, a law, affecting the jurisdiction of the European Central Bank, recourse to the Court of Justice would obviously be possible."
"Finally this draft decision by the Commission is based on similar provisions, currently applicable to the EMI, within the framework of Economic and Monetary Union."
"These provisions are satisfactory, they are operational and they have proved their effectiveness."
"Moreover, the Commission proposals tabled today have been approved by the European Monetary Institute."
"Furthermore, the Commission is not even able to accept Amendment No 4 which, in practice, would mean that national authorities are obliged to bend to the will of the European Central Bank when it is consulted."
"In fact, Article 105, paragraph 4, simply envisages an obligation to consult the ECB without any binding commitment."
"Here too, however, irrespective of Article 105, paragraph 4, the Commission is obliged to ensure that the Member States comply with the Treaty, especially with regard to the powers and the independence of the European Central Bank."
"I can assure you that it will honour its obligations to the full in this respect."
"Finally, Mr Herman, I can offer you a measure of satisfaction: we can accept Amendment No 3."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank your rapporteur for his analysis, and, personally speaking, I would like to commend him on his endeavours to promote the Community spirit."
"The Commission shares this approach but all the same, as custodian of the treaties, may we inform you that we cannot step outside the provisions of the Treaty and, in particular, the scope of Article 105, paragraph 4."
"Thank you, Mr President, for allowing me the right to reply."
"I wholly agree with the Commissioner's words."
"Unfortunately, the Commissioner interprets the texts in a different way."
"When we speak of matters that fall within the field of competence of the Central Bank, we are no longer talking of matters that lie within national competence."
"And the Commissioner should know that, before the judges in the Court of Justice today, the texts are not interpreted in terms of the intent of their authors or their interpretation, but formally."
"We witnessed this recently and the Commission was its first victim, in the case of external relations problems."
"It was said that anything concerning services is not a matter for the Commission, since services are not dealt with in the Treaty."
"This is a purely formal interpretation."
"So, Commissioner, you should be aware that you have judges who interpret matters formally and when we are speaking of matters that fall within the field of competence of the Central Bank, they are no longer matters that lie within the bounds of national competence."
"So, all of the matters you raised and all the examples you quoted lie within the bounds of national competence."
"I do not intend to prolong the debate because you have a lot of reports to examine and your House has been delayed somewhat."
"I would simply like to remind you that from a banking point of view, but also in a number of other fields, central banks retain responsibilities and powers."
"We cannot extend these powers abruptly without changing the Treaty."
"The Treaty does not allow us to espouse the approach advocated by Mr Herman."
"I regret this personally, but that is what the texts state."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Estimates of the European Parliament and the Ombudsman"
"The next item is the report (A4-0175/98) by Mr Viola, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament and the estimates of revenue and expenditure of the Ombudsman for the financial year 1999."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to stress particularly some common aspects characteristic not only of the Parliament's budget for 1999 but, in many cases, of the budget of the other institutions: the adoption of the euro, computer changes for the year 2000, the forthcoming European elections and the related information policy, the consequences of the Amsterdam Treaty, the full implementation of the building programme exercising the option to purchase the LEO complex and the occupancy of IPE IV and, finally, the new staff management policy."
"A few items constitute the basic choices comprising the 1999 budget: firstly, the rate of increase in heading 5, equal to 4 %, to which the Parliament and the Ombudsman must adhere."
"This increase, I can confirm here today, must not be considered an objective to be reached but rather an unsurpassable ceiling on expenditure, thus sticking to the idea of a rigorous budget comparable, in this respect, to that which the Member States have imposed on themselves."
"Secondly, we must not forget, as regards the allocation of earmarked funds for the Parliament and the Ombudsman, that the initial estimate of these funds is based on the ""zero' -budget option, and new requests are and will still have to be supported by adequate motivations."
"Compliance with these conditions means that the overall amount of the European Parliament budget comes to ECU 916.1 million, with an increase of barely 0.88 per cent compared to 1998 and an operating margin of 28.5 million ECU. In October this will allow us to give a response to some important problems which are still unresolved, such as the annual expenditure and its breakdown between the sums required for the purchase of IPE IV in Strasbourg, the costs connected to the new status of the Members - these proposals will have to be submitted by the working party created for this purpose by the President's Office to the Committee on Budgets by the first reading of the budget itself - the costs related to the choices that will be made regarding the status of assistants and contracting, still in progress, with freelance interpreters."
"Moving on to an analysis of the specific features of 1999, the introduction of the euro and the preparatory work to solve the problems in the computer sector with the year 2000 will be reflected as from the present budget procedure."
"Therefore, and in line with what was highlighted by the European Council in Luxembourg last December, we shall take appropriate measures at the first reading."
"Turning specifically to the Parliament, for which the allocation rate is 19.4 per cent of the volume of resources of category 5, and the particular features of the end of the fourth legislature, I would like to point out that the next elections should include financial costs of about ECU 17 million."
"This assumption is related to the percentage of renewal of the Members of the institution and the accompanying measures to be adopted before the elections, such as information, for example."
"In any case, the European elections will, as in the past, be an opportunity to undertake a number of specific initiatives in the information sector, initiatives to increase voter participation, such as the Use your vote campaign, agreed with the Commission, also in a context of close cooperation with EUROSTAT."
"However, as regards the consequences of the Amsterdam Treaty and the enlargement policy, we have taken into account, within responsibly reduced limits, the Parliament's need for more adequate human resources."
"This need is contained in the proposal to create 10 new temporary posts, linked to the enlargement process, on the basis of the job description which will be presented by the Secretary General to the competent bodies before the first reading of the draft budget."
"On property, we would like to stress that, as from 1999, the related costs should decrease by a further ECU 17 million."
"Within this framework it should be noted that the savings derived from the reimbursement of the investments for buildings D1 and D2 make a margin of ECU 27 million available for the next financial year and that if this continues, this policy will certainly produce a real saving for the Union budget in future years."
"It is within the context of this policy that Mr Tomlinson's amendment falls, an amendment that includes the choices of the President's Office to use the financial resources available for the current fiscal year in order to exercise the option to purchase the buildings on rue Belliard for use by committees, by a letter of amendment to the 1998 budget, and on which, as rapporteur, I express a favourable view."
"However, as regards the Ombudsman, the proposal of three new posts - and not six, as requested - is considered more in line with the budget rigour imposed for all the institutions, including the Ombudsman."
"With this, I do not want to rule out the possibility of further examination, which may lead to appropriate amendments in October, following also the indication of the President of this Parliament, who stated that the Council and Commission consider it the Parliament's job to lay down the general principles to be applied to the staff of the Ombudsman, regarding the number and status of the officers in his service."
"It is in connection with these observations that I invite the Socialist group to withdraw its amendment or reformulate it adequately with an oral amendment, which I am prepared to agree."
"Finally, I would like to emphasize the happy choice adopted in the committee to modify the nomenclature, and the positive outcome given to this choice by the administration of the European Parliament, which ensures that the Parliament's budget which we are now examining includes an attachment which presents the main budget amounts according to the intended use."
"I would also like to underline the harmonious relationship created with the President's Office and particularly in the last phase with the Vice-President entrusted with the dossier , my colleague and dear friend Lucas Pires, which is another small reason why we mourn his tragic and premature death."
"Mr President, it is often said that one of the first signs of madness is to start talking to yourself."
"The attendance at this debate this evening shows how close to the edge some of us are in danger of becoming."
"My feeling is only somewhat lightened by the very warm welcome I give to the Secretary-General who is here at the debate and Commissioner Liikanen."
"I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Viola on an excellent report."
"It is excellent not only because it is good of itself but reflects what over recent years in the Committee on Budgets has become a seamless continuum of budgetary approach to our own Parliament."
"The stringency and the strict adherence to the 20 % ceiling of Category 5 appropriations is something which Mr Viola has welcomed and has enforced very strictly in the resolution he puts to us tonight."
"My group would certainly endorse the three principles which reflect that continuum to which I referred: trying to get our estimates more and more based on the principles of zero-based budgeting, taking strong account when fixing the budget of the implementation of the appropriations that have been placed in previous budgets and an insistence that demands for new appropriations should be backed by appropriate supporting documentation."
"Behind those principles there is also a very clear statement of priorities from Mr Viola."
"One of those priorities is in relation to our property policy in Parliament, Although we have such a thin attendance, we should perhaps note that part of that property policy renders the tense of Mr Viola's priorities in his explanatory memorandum slightly out of date."
"The necessary signatures were undertaken yesterday for us to proceed to the purchase of the Leopold building complex."
"That is extremely important as part of Parliament's approach to property policy."
"We have exercised the purchase option before the date of 31 May and in so doing we have managed to get the beneficial input to Parliament's budget of the BEF 7.25 billion that has been negotiated between Parliament and the Kingdom of Belgium."
"That ECU 180m that the Belgians are giving by way of indemnifying the land and land development costs is a very important part of our building policy."
"But added to Mr Viola's report is Amendment No 2 from the Committee on Budgets, an amendment which I know Mr Viola supports."
"It is an amendment which refers to the supplementary and amending budget No 1 of 1998."
"In that amendment we are seeking a letter of amendment from the Commission to supplementary and amending budget No 1 of 1998 so that we can continue with the policy of property acquisition."
"It is the view of the Bureau and of the Committee on Budgets - and here they are absolutely as one - that in that supplementary and amending budget we should seek to purchase the Belliard I and II buildings so that they can be made available to the Committee of the Regions, to the Economic and Social Committee and to the common structure which, following the Amsterdam Treaty, will be dissolved but which will still have to produce common services to those two committees."
"So, I strongly commend Amendment No 2, which has already been carried by the Committee on Budgets, to the House."
"The priorities are also stated as being the new staff management policy, a policy that the Secretary-General has outlined very clearly both to Parliament and to the staff."
"A third priority which I particularly welcome is that which we attach to the problems related to the introduction of the euro and the impact of the millennium bug."
"I hope we can look to the administration to produce a report to Parliament as to what this priority means in practical terms, not necessarily waiting until next year."
"These are serious problems for an information technology department which is already in many ways over-stretched and are probably two of the most important demands that will made of it."
"Finally, I should like to refer to Amendment No 1 which stands in the name of my group."
"We have tabled this amendment in Mr Wynn's name in order to leave the matter of staffing for the Ombudsman open until the first reading when one will have a clearer view of the overall need concerning staff."
"We have done that, taking into account the views of the Committee on Petitions' rapporteur for the 1999 budget, Barbara Schmidbauer."
"I commend that amendment to the House as well."
"On behalf of the Socialist members of the committee, I should like to say how much we identify with what Mr Viola has said about the sad death of Vice-President Lucas Pires."
"He was proving to be an extremely good interlocutor between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets."
"We will certainly miss him in that role but, above all else, we will miss him as a good parliamentarian."
"Mr President, Mr Tomlinson said we may end up talking to ourselves. That reminds me of being on electoral campaign, preaching the good news, and sometimes being faced with empty halls."
"And of course, conscious of our role as missionaries, we do not give up, but carry on. All we do is say: ""Please could everybody move into the front row' ."
"Well, I think we could at least move into the front row without pushing Mr Liikanen out of his seat, which is rightfully his. That way we would be a bit cosier."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Viola on the budget he is presenting to us."
"It is a difficult budget, and that is the nice thing: to produce a difficult budget."
"In times of plenty, the budget is boring."
"And this is a difficult budget because of the large investments in property, furnishings and office automation equipment."
"But with regard to Mr Viola's report, I would like to focus mainly on the Ombudsman's budget. The Ombudsman is an institution which was born after the era of budgetary plenty."
"Like everybody, it was born with nothing, and therefore without demands. And because there were no demands, it was born with a very highly regulated organization."
"I believe the demands have increased - in fact, we can feel it - so the organization needs to be adjusted to the work rate demanded of it."
"And the work rate being demanded corresponds to the institution the citizens want."
"They want a flexible institution, with a good cost-efficiency ratio."
"So I think the time has also come for us to ask ourselves seriously whether something more really needs to be done with the organization of the Ombudsman."
"Not just to provide the posts which have been requested this time, but really to see if the Ombudsman needs a bigger organization."
"It is true that not all the Member States have reacted in the same way."
"Some countries, such as Finland and Spain, are responding better, while the others are still some way behind."
"But we want an institution which can rise to the occasion, so it also has to be on a par with the other institutions, which means it has to have the necessary staff and means."
"And the staff have to be on fixed contracts, whereas temporary staff have to be for precisely that - for work which is only temporary."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Viola for a balanced and reliable report on the European budget for 1999."
"The total amount for the budget is 916 million euros, which is in accordance with the Bureau's proposal."
"This represents a rise of 5.2 million euros on this year's figure, or 0.6 %."
"This answers the call for austerity that has to be obeyed when expenditure rises, just as the Member States themselves impose the same discipline on themselves."
"The proportion of costs in relation to total EU administrative costs is also below 20 %, which falls in with Parliament's previous level of commitment."
"Balancing the budget is eased by the reduction of fixed costs by 17 million euros, as a conclusion is reached regarding Strasbourg's and Brussels' structural programmes."
"On the other hand, the end of the Parliamentary term and the switch to the euro will cost an extra 16.8 million euros next year."
"That is why the budgetary change, and in particular staffing costs, have demanded much restraint."
"I would especially like to bring up one matter, namely the Ombudsman's budget."
"The institution of the European Ombudsman was established with the Maastricht Treaty, and it began its work in 1995."
"The experience of already two and a half years has shown that it is necessary to have one."
"A clear example of this is the soaring number of complaints that have been lodged, which last year showed an increase of 40 %."
"One of the main duties of the EU and the European Parliament is, I believe, the defence of the weakest."
"As the institution of the Ombudsman has been once and for all established by a unanimous decision by Member States, it should at least be given the modest resources it requires, or else the whole system will turn against its very own aims as matters pile up and decisions take so long to be made."
"The proposal by the Ombudsman for six interim posts is modest when we consider the quality of the work done by the institution and the vast area their work covers, as well as the incredibly short period of time they have had to develop."
"For this reason, I support Mr Wynn at this stage in his Amendment No 1."
"In all other respects I endorse the acceptance of the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find it difficult to talk about the European Parliament's budget today without referring to the striking confirmation in the most recent report from the Court of Auditors on the reimbursements and allowances which we receive as Members of the European Parliament."
"That is why it shows no disrespect towards my colleague, Mr Viola, and his work if I emphasize that my group will support the report and its priorities and naturally the draft amendments as well, particularly as far as the Ombudsman is concerned, and I now devote my speaking time to the special report, especially since the budget of the Parliament will certainly pick up detailed proposals which emerge from the Court of Auditors' report, and Mr Viola will submit appropriate proposals to us, I have no doubt!"
"It is extremely regrettable that the President has rejected convening a conference of Presidents this afternoon and has resorted to formalities."
"If the public rightly gets worked up about the unacceptable arrangements for reimbursement and insinuates that the Parliament has a self-service mentality, the President of this House should not hide behind provisions in the Rules of Procedure."
"The right course of action would have been to go on the offensive, because we did after all request the Court of Auditors' report ourselves and because at bottom we knew of all the procedural gaps which we have now had confirmed."
"Going on the offensive would also have meant in this case reducing the contradictory procedure to the minimum."
"Why not 24 hours, because it could hardly be simpler to give an answer to the observations of the Court of Auditors."
"The answer would be: ""Agreed, that is how things are at present' , and ""Agreed, that is how we want to change things in future' ."
"But can we rely on this President and this Bureau as far as a willingness to change is concerned?"
"I do have my doubts!"
"The working group set up by President Hänsch has come to nothing."
"The investigation into the pension fund system has come to nothing."
"The rationalization of travel costs calculations has more or less, well, actually come to nothing."
"It might perhaps be best to entrust the report to the Committee for Budgetary Control."
"I can assure you that we would work quickly and speedily!"
"Mrs Müller, you have criticized the stance taken by the President of Parliament. He is not here, but I represent him at the moment."
"I must remind you that the President told the House that there is no Court of Auditors' report. There are some provisional opinions, which are known to all of Parliament's political groups because they were sent to the chairman of each and every group."
"Furthermore, a reply to this provisional opinion is being prepared by the Bureau, which is the competent body to do so."
"That is a fairly accurate rendition of the President's words."
"You may have the floor for one minute on a point of order."
"Mr President, my point was not to refute what the President said this morning; my point was that I expected a political reaction."
"That is what I am criticising."
"Of course it is only a provisional report."
"Of course it was distributed to the Chairmen of the groups much too late, and of course as a Member I also received it yesterday evening."
"That's not my point!"
"My point is that I am pressing for a political reaction from our President, given that the press out there which is full of suppositions and insinuations is demanding answers which have to be given by every Member of this House."
"My criticism was a political one, it was not aimed at the formalities and the Rules of Procedure!"
"In that respect, the President is certainly right!"
"Thank you for publicly acknowledging that the President has acted correctly."
"I respect your opinions on the press, but I must inform you that the President is answerable to this House."
"Mr President, greater transparency and clarity in this matter would be a boon for Parliament."
"I remember suggesting a long time ago that all of these matters should be dealt with by a committee."
"I am surprised that yet again a budgetary debate is under way here, in Brussels, in flagrant violation of the Edinburgh compromise, confirmed both by the Court of Justice and the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Dear Mr Tomlinson, there were more of us present during the budgetary guidelines debate which was held this year in Strasbourg."
"That comment aside, I would immediately like to raise again the matter of the chair to invoke the Viola report, which envisages ""the appropriations necessary for a parliamentary calendar comprising 11 ordinary sessions and 6 additional sessions' ."
"Eleven ordinary sessions instead of twelve, we all agree."
"This is an electoral year: we have six additional sessions, why is that so, when the calendar adopted by the Conference of Presidents stipulates only five."
"The second main provision of the report sets aside appropriations to conduct a neutral campaign of institutional information amongst citizens of the Union."
"What is proposed is that we step up the appropriations allocated for information policy; ECU 2 750 000 have already been released for this purpose in the form of a transfer voted on 28 May last, instituting a special ""European elections' action."
"So the European Parliament is preparing to vote on a 1999 budget which will only serve finally to augment its propaganda appropriations."
"Is there a single example, in any democracy, where a special information action on the eve of the elections adds four billion already devoted directly or indirectly to propaganda by the Community budget?"
"But that will not change anything."
"The federalist propaganda will continue relentlessly to seek to change the mind of those who, with full knowledge of the facts, are opposed to the process of European integration."
"Mr President, I find myself totally supportive of the need to exercise very strict restraint over the budget, most importantly over the money we spend on the institutions."
"Therefore Mr Viola will have my full backing just as he will have my backing tomorrow in his very important report on the island regions of Europe."
"I would, however, say as an aside that I regret that in staffing issues we do not make more use of fixed term contracts."
"The businesses and individuals who create the wealth of Europe all have to act with restraint and they do not have jobs for life."
"Having said that, our priority must always be how we can help the people of Europe."
"So I too am going to concentrate on the element of the budget dealing with the Ombudsman."
"The European Ombudsman is a critical role."
"It is important for us that we see that he gets the resources he needs."
"As a member of the Committee on Petitions, like you, Mr President, I have worked very closely with Mr Söderman."
"He is an extremely conscientious officer."
"Nobody could say that he is acting in a flamboyant or extravagant way."
"That is not his Finnish style."
"His office is the smallest ombudsman's office of any in Europe, save Malta."
"So, his initial request for six temporary staff was one that, at the very least, merited full consideration and a meaningful dialogue."
"There are newspapers across Europe that are making a living exposing the errors and flaws of the European administration."
"Sadly, there are too many such errors and flaws."
"In the Ombudsman we have an officer who can act on behalf of the people of Europe but if he is going to do that job properly he needs the proper resources to do it."
"We should make sure he gets those resources."
"If we want to look at where that money can come from, I suggest we do a proper cost-benefit analysis on the Economic and Social Committee."
"Mr President, first I would like to thank the draftsman of the report for some very painstaking work."
"I also wish to draw your attention to the European Ombudsman's budget."
"The opportunity to appeal to an ombudsman is one of the most important rights citizens of the Union have."
"The Ombudsman's task is to handle complaints about errors made by other institutions of the Community."
"The Ombudsman's office has been now running long enough to judge what sorts of staffing levels are necessary for a sufficiently up-to-scratch and speedy service for the citizens of the Union."
"The office of the European Ombudsman has been getting an ever-increasing number of enquiries."
"This shows that our citizens have regarded the work of the Ombudsman as essential in solving the problems that have cropped up in Union administration."
"In his report Mr Viola suggests establishing three new posts to ease the work pressures on the Ombudsman's office."
"The problem, however, is not only the number of new posts, but, more particularly, their professional level."
"The citizens of Europe have a right to expect the European Ombudsman's office handling their complaints to have at their disposal a legal staff that have at least the same level of experience as those in the institutions of the Community which are being looked into."
"Otherwise we create a situation where the European bureaucrats are racing finely-tuned Formula 1 cars against the Ombudsman's Mazda 323 family saloon."
"In my opinion that is not fair for the citizen making the complaint."
"I hope we can yet consider the proposal by the Ombudsman on the number of staff he requires, and especially on their professional level, before we finally approve the 1999 budget in the autumn."
"Mr President, I should also like to congratulate Mr Viola most sincerely on his report and come immediately to budget line 205 concerning the security and surveillance of buildings."
"In this case we have a rate of increase of 67 %, we are spending a total of ECU 17 million on our security, and we know that there is certainly a need to improve security in the building."
"There has been a great deal of theft in the House."
"That is why I launched a campaign on security and fighting crime."
"More than 150 Members have added their signature to this issue, and I believe that it should be a matter of concern to us that, if we are spending so much money on security, there should be some recognisable benefit in this area."
"It was the case that special units were made available to guard the Parliament during the session which the Parliament held in Strasbourg."
"The Parliament is also guarded by the police and by the military, of course, in Brussels."
"I believe that it would be sensible to speed up official discussions in order to guarantee the security of the House and to ensure that costs are incurred in this area in a way which is really efficient."
"I believe that this is a matter of concern to the citizens of Brussels, and it is a matter of concern to all employees in the European Parliament and at the European level."
"I would argue that we should hold discussions in this area."
"The President promised to do so, and I believe that it should be a matter of concern for us all to look after the security of people in Brussels."
"Thank you very much, Mr Rübig."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rübig's was the last speech."
"The Commissioner, Mr Liikanen - whom I welcome - has told me that he does not wish to speak."
"Before closing the debate, I shall give the floor to Mr Viola, as rapporteur. Perhaps he would like to explain to Mr Perry how big the Maltese Ombudsman's office is, because I know that Mr Viola was in Malta before coming here yesterday."
"Mr President, precisely with regard to the Ombudsman, which all the Members have been discussing, there are a few things I would like to say."
"No one denies that the Ombudsman has been more and more active these past few years; his initial requests, however, contain elements which conflict with the regulations on the status of officials and with the rules on the rationalization of administrative expenditure laid down by the three institutions."
"For example, the Ombudsman cannot ask for posts which are not at the initial levels; he cannot request directly posts of high qualifications, or certain revaluations, like a revaluation of an A3 post to A2 after scarcely three years, meaning an official hired from the outside as A3 becomes A2 after three years. To me, frankly, these requests seem somewhat excessive."
"So, if we approach this matter with a sense of balance and moderation, I am prepared to discuss it again, provided that - and I repeat - there is balance, moderation and compliance with the rules."
"Thank you very much, Mr Viola."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Frontier workers"
"The next item is the report (A4-0168/98) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the situation of frontier workers in the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen though few in number, I do not think I am wrong in saying that frontier workers can serve as a barometer for social integration in the European Union."
"Although there are only about 380 000 of them in Europe, they perform such an important signal function that they should be high on every agenda: on that of the Monti Group on tax coordination, in the Commission's Action Plan for the free movement of workers and in the plans for a European labour market."
"We can read from the situation of frontier workers how low the level of integration of the European labour market still is."
"How many obstacles there still are to the free movement of persons, how hard we still need to work in order to align social security systems and taxation arrangements of the Member States more closely with one another."
"Occasionally the barometer gives a real storm reading."
"For example, on 1 January 1994, when a change in the financing of the Dutch national insurance system left 13 000 frontier workers with a loss in pay averaging 3 000 Belgian Francs per month."
"Good enough reason for the Belgian trade unions to sound the alarm and use their right of petition, but this is only the tip of the iceberg."
"Indeed we have learned enough from our inquiries in committee meetings, from scientific studies, from judgments of the European Court of Justice, from the testimony of the EURES consultants, to convince us that every border area has its problems."
"On top of problems regarding the transferability of social security provisions there is the chaos of tax arrangements which are regulated in some 220 different bilateral treaties and, to make matters worse, are not coordinated with the social security rules, so that in one instance it is the country of residence which is applicable and in another the country of employment."
"Because all countries are carrying out reforms of both their social security and their taxation systems, involving modernization, even privatization, the problems will only increase."
"In view of all this, frontier workers are rightly calling for a European policy."
"The demands of the frontier workers are very reasonable."
"We have incorporated a number of them into this report."
"I hope that Parliament will be able to support the report tomorrow."
"Anyway I take this opportunity to extend a warm word of thanks to those colleagues who are here for their very intensive cooperation, and of course to the Commission, who assisted us with information of all kinds."
"First demand: as prevention is better than cure, we ask the Commission to draw up a proposal for a Europe test, by which all new legislation on taxation, social protection and employment matters would be subjected to preliminary and mandatory vetting for its effects on frontier workers."
"According to Parliament's Legal Service, Commissioner, Article 49 of the Treaty offers a sound legal basis for doing that."
"I would therefore very much like to have a concrete reaction from you on this point."
"This report fleshes out the Europe test in more detail."
"A national platform of social partners and experts from the social affairs and tax administrations could carry out the assessment in each Member State."
"At European level, however, we think that the Advisory Committee on Social Security for Migrant Workers and the Advisory Committee on the Free Movement of Workers would be best placed to consider the problem of frontier workers and could propose solutions for the problems which remain despite the Europe test."
"Second proposal: we ask the Member States to set up compensation funds for the income loss suffered by frontier workers as a result of changes in legislation."
"Here I have to say, ladies and gentlemen, there is some misunderstanding about this proposal."
"It is definitely not about the creation of a European Fund."
"The initiative is left entirely to the Member States."
"This is an appeal from Parliament."
"Of course, only in those cases in which a Europe test finds that changes in tax and social legislation do lead to income losses and the Member State in question nevertheless decides to go ahead with the changes, and sometimes Member States have good grounds for so doing, only then would a compensation fund come into operation."
"I therefore hope that colleagues can drop their last remaining objections to this proposal."
"It is also Parliament's intention with this report to achieve a further step towards European coordination in social security and fiscal legislation in the Member States."
"With regard to social security, Commissioner, I will be brief."
"The Commission has already presented a number of proposals."
"We are also pressing for attention to be given to the new supplementary social security systems, which are not yet covered in the Regulation, but the Commission deserves all credit for the initiatives it has already taken, and we only hope that the Council can now finally take a decision."
"In the field of taxation, on the other hand, there is a proliferation of schemes."
"We therefore ask the Commission to screen the bilateral taxation agreements, to work out a European Model Convention to replace the OECD Convention and to prepare a mandatory European directive on non-discrimination against non-residents on the basis of the long-promised Memorandum."
"I hope that the Commissioner can also give his opinion on that, although of course it falls within the remit of his colleague, Mr Monti."
"The lack of coordination between taxation and social security is really the cause of most of the problems."
"Reason enough to plead for a homogeneous application of the country of residence or country of employment principle for both systems."
"I myself felt that the country of employment principle best responded to the existing social security arrangements, on the one hand, and to the general principle of double taxation agreements on the other hand."
"This, combined with systematic application of the non-discrimination principle with regard to tax deduction and a compensation scheme between Member States, could have secured the removal of the last remaining objections."
"Apparently some minds are not ready for that, Commissioner, so we ask the Commission to make a detailed examination of the advantages and disadvantages of the possible choices of country of employment or residence principle and to present a proposal to Parliament on the basis of that."
"Lastly, the report also urges that service and information facilities for frontier workers be strengthened within the context of the EURES networks, but we think also that the national administrations should do much more to honour their responsibilities towards frontier workers."
"The situation in which border areas are literally peripheral regions and frontier workers' problems are marginal problems must not be allowed to continue."
"Finally, we complain so often that Europe is remote from ordinary people."
"Here we have brought a Euro-barometer in from the real world, the world of people who have direct experience of European problems on a daily basis."
"I hope that the Commission will take the problems of these people to heart and can report to us annually on the situation, and I hope that we can keep these problems permanently on our parliamentary agenda."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report on the situation of frontier workers is one of a series of reports which deal with the problems of people who use or want to use one of the most important basic freedoms in the European Union."
"The rapporteur has devoted a good deal of work to drawing up the report in order to demonstrate the diverse problems of workers in frontier regions."
"Although in theory and in practice the internal European frontiers are intended to present no obstacles to the free movement of people, there are plenty of difficulties in terms both of tax law and of social security law, so that clarification is urgently necessary in the interests of the workers."
"The first thing to be done is to arrive at an unambiguous definition of the term frontier worker."
"It is all too often the case that different interpretations are advanced."
"It would be splendid if the Commission could work towards producing some proposals in this area."
"In our group, we have looked at these issues in depth, and we are able to agree with many of the rapporteur's ideas."
"We would like our draft amendments to contribute to ensuring that the report on the problems of frontier workers sticks with this issue, and that it is not muddled up with other sets of problems."
"We shall reject those points dealing with compensation funds."
"In this matter, our view is that no genuine solution can be achieved on the basis of this sort of more or less voluntary individualisation between the Member States."
"On the contrary, it would simply be a postponement which is the last thing the workers concerned want."
"If there were any result, it would involve a lot of agreements between countries which would simply compound the confusion and no country would consider itself obliged to make any effort to work towards a common and fundamental solution of the problem."
"I would like to encourage the Commission to take concrete steps in this regard and to press for the proposals which it has already put forward."
"The Council has put a tight leash on itself by virtue of the unanimity procedure."
"These are brakeblocks which should at long last be abolished now in the interests of the European cause."
"We shall also reject the demand for checks and directions to be introduced into free collective bargaining."
"Free collective bargaining is something that we have always strongly defended."
"Our Amendment No 10, which relates to point 13, was withdrawn by me, because it was drawn up on the basis of an error in translation in the German version."
"That also relates to the term ""Europaprüfung' in the German version, but we have already come to an agreement with the rapporteur about ensuring that care is taken to make the appropriate changes in the different versions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to place this report in a somewhat wider context."
"This afternoon we talked about the broad economic policy guidelines and then we noted, and that was right across the House, that there is still a lack of coordination in the European Union in countless policy sectors which are absolutely vital."
"That is why the Van Lancker report is so urgently needed, because it exposes matters which admittedly affect frontier workers in the first instance, but which also have everything to do with bringing flexibility to the labour market, not only within countries but also in possible employment situations spanning different countries."
"This is a matter that various Commissioners are working on. Mrs Van Lancker has already pointed this out."
"The Monti Group on tax coordination and the Veil Group have done excellent work."
"At the present time we are looking at what can be done in the field of pensions."
"Nevertheless, frontier workers are often in extraordinarily difficult positions and, in taking the initiative to work across the border, lose quite fundamental rights, including basic entitlements such as the right to a pension."
"I have tabled an amendment following on from the Decker v. Kohl cases, and I hope that the rapporteur will include this amendment in the considerations, because here too a quite fundamental matter is at issue, namely the right to medical care even after the employment relationship ends."
"In short, I am very happy indeed with Mrs Van Lancker's report."
"She has done an excellent job and I hope that this report will be a basis for resolving a number of anomalies that still exist."
"Mr President, I believe that Mrs van Lancker has not only worked hard but also well, which is most important."
"I would like to refer again to her thesis of the signal function."
"I believe that frontier workers are in some ways like bio- indicators which record the level of free movement and equal rights in this Union."
"It has to be said that this level seems to be under a high degree of pressure."
"If we take that as our measure, then there is an urgent need for action."
"This is not the first time that we have agreed on this matter; we withdrew the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for example, until we could reach a more positive understanding with the Commission."
"In this case, it is mainly a matter of social security and taxation, and their interaction."
"These are not matters for local authority politics."
"We cannot place these questions on the shoulders of frontier local authorities; the Member States have to face up to their responsibilities at long last!"
"Moreover, in everyday life it is also a matter of access to healthcare, security for family members, early retirement, supplementary pension systems, access to unemployment insurance and taxation."
"All of that is caught up with the problem of unanimity in the Council of Ministers, even though in other areas everything that is needed to implement the internal market is not subject to unanimity but can be decided by majority vote."
"It seems to me that there is a systematic problem here."
"I think that the proposal of a compensation fund for disadvantages suffered or for an early warning system through the consultation procedure in advance of relevant legislation is a good proposal."
"I am not convinced by the tendency of the European People's Party Group to delete essential elements by means of draft amendments, on the pretext that a global solution which might some day be achieved will be prevented by adopting interim solutions."
"We should support the proposal as it is."
"I think that Mrs van Lancker has elaborated the essential points."
"If we adopt it as it is, we shall be taking a step forward."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the matter raised in Mrs Van Lancker's report merits our full attention."
"When, in this very House, we debate problems that focus on the lack of harmonization, for example, in the sizing of processed peas, the capacity of moped engines or the speed of forestry tractors, we tend to overlook those citizens who, whether nationals or frontier residents in a Member State, are unable to work in the adjoining Member State without coming up against insurmountable administrative, social or tax problems."
"What are we to think in an age when trade, electronic interaction, professional and geographical mobility on a world scale are becoming commonplace, how do we view a European Union that professes lofty principles, in this case the abolition of all domestic borders, yet fails to broach problems of stewardship."
"It is a sensitive problem and even the euro, the alleged panacea for all our problems, offers no relief."
"Different and frequently complex social regimes exist within our individual Member States."
"We therefore need a strong political will and a genuine desire to promote the common good in order to confront the problems posed in this area."
"In the preambles to her report, Mrs Van Lancker quite rightly referred to the many petitions that our committee responsible handles in this respect."
"Thus, for instance, the many cases of dual taxation in the state of residence and in the state of employment, or non-payment of various allowances because the citizens reside in another Member State."
"It is indecent to appeal throughout the report for more resources to assist the mobility of citizens of the Member States or to claim the creation of a citizens' Europe when those very citizens, on a daily or weekly basis, cross domestic borders and face staggering problems."
"We might add to this those situations where Community nationals face difficulties due to the lack of coordination on the position of Member States in their bilateral agreements with other states."
"Once again, there is no shortage of examples, especially in Switzerland."
"In France, for example, the committee for the defence of frontier workers in the Upper Rhine throws up many examples, such as that of the Italian national who worked and paid his dues for 25 years in France, followed by two years in Switzerland and who, falling victim to a disability, lost his claim for compensation because of the last two years since he is Italian and therefore not covered by the Franco-Swiss bilateral agreement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that in the first instance, we are the elected members responsible for promoting the common good."
"Europe will not be built on large coalitions, declarations of intent and self-congratulation, but by the day-to-day approval of its members, I mean individuals and whole peoples."
"This is because we will know, when we acquire the legal and technical jurisdiction, how to listen to them and solve their problems and they, in turn, will be able to listen to us and understand."
"Mr President, I want to say a sincere thank you to the rapporteur for a good report."
"The report has its origin in the problems of Belgian frontier workers who, through the fiscal treatment of social security in the Netherlands, suffered a loss of purchasing power amounting to a few hundred guilders a month."
"The rapporteur has made use of that and has referred to numerous petitions submitted to the Committee on Petitions."
"The Committee on Petitions is in fact the last resort for tens of thousands of people who constantly face border problems."
"There are in Europe a good six hundred thousand workers who commute across frontiers and, if we add the number of people who receive benefits from past employment in another Member State, we have a substantial group of people who desire more European coordination in the field of social security, taxation and benefits or allowances for sickness."
"Compared with employees or benefit recipients who live and work in the same Member State, they often have an inferior status."
"Europe is trying to coordinate."
"However, only social security falls within the Regulation, which moreover shows many other gaps."
"A major problem results from taxation not being in step with social security or sickness allowances."
"Now that social legislation is being constantly amended in the Member States and more and more tax-related elements are being introduced, it is high time for fiscal coordination to be tackled at European level."
"A study of the University of Limburg, carried out in response to the Belgian problem, indicates that it would be possible to put an end to the many instances of unfairness by allowing people to opt for both their social security contribution and their tax assessment to be located in their country of residence or, if they prefer, in their country of employment."
"The clear choice that the rapporteur had for that concurrence in the first instance has been invalidated by her subsequent amendment of the original quite categorical formulation."
"I think that is a pity."
"Now the Commission is being given the task of working something out in the field of taxation too."
"I would have preferred to see it formulated in much sharper terms; I support a rapid and constant endeavour on the part of the Commission to reach a solution."
"If the Commissioner can now tell us what he intends to do, I shall at least be able to give a little hope to my commuting constituency to whom, if I may say so, the European ideal is of such vital significance."
"Of particular importance, and I hope to get a positive answer on that point too, is an element in this report which I already introduced here about six years ago, but then as ""the commuting effect test' , but what's in a name?"
"The aim of what is referred to in this report as the Europe test is to introduce an obligation to chart the effects of every amendment of social or fiscal legislation at Member State level on commuters and ex-commuters."
"The availability of information on the problems will also prompt national parliamentarians to turn their attention to seeking solutions."
"What makes less sense to me is to have a compensation fund by which disadvantages to cross-frontier commuters would be mitigated at Member State level."
"It was particularly gratifying to me - and I say that to my colleague, Mr Chanterie, as well - to learn that the Belgian government set up an arrangement for Belgian frontier workers when my country, the Netherlands, proved unprepared to agree something on a bilateral basis."
"However, I think it would be a tedious business to make provision for such stopgap remedies at European level."
"Thanks to the rapporteur for taking up the idea of setting up an experiment - you might remember the Maas/Rhine EuroRegion, where it makes no difference as regards sickness allowances, at least for cross-frontier commuters and their families and/or ex-commuters, where the entitlements are purchased."
"I remember asking for Limburg to be included, but without anything coming of it."
"I wonder whether the Commission is prepared to support a new initiative on these lines or to develop it from scratch, since cases of this kind are now making much more headway through the Court of Justice."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"I must say, the clock was on your side because it only started counting some way into your speech."
"Mr Chanterie now has the floor for three minutes. Let us hope the clock is working properly now."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we all agree that we have talked about the advantages of the internal market in a great many places over the years."
"But those citizens who have most experience of the disadvantages of the existence and working of the internal market are the frontier workers."
"They live in one country and work in another, a neighbouring country."
"They pay taxes in one country and social security contributions in the other."
"The tax and social security rules of the countries concerned may well be in conformity with the letter and spirit of Community law, but in the way they interact they cause substantial loss of income to frontier workers."
"And that is the situation."
"That is the situation of many frontier workers in my country who go to work in the Netherlands, or in France, or in Germany."
"These frontier workers are victimized by that situation, for various Member States, primarily the Netherlands - and we have to put the Netherlands in the dock over this - but various Member States have developed the habit of penalizing socially people from across the border who come to work in their countries."
"It is a familiar pattern."
"It concerns matters that are regulated by bilateral agreements."
"Agreements between Member States in which the European Union as such cannot easily intervene."
"That is precisely the problem with which our population is confronted. They expect the European Union to act; on the other hand, the Union has up to now had few instruments which would enable it to intervene."
"Hence this initiative report, Commissioner; I congratulate the rapporteur on her work and am pleased that she adopted many of my amendments in committee, so in view of that I will certainly support the report."
"Let me dwell for a moment on the aspect of a test and the aspect of compensation."
"Commissioner, I think that a very important element in this report is the Europe test, or a vetting process to determine what disadvantages frontier workers might experience as a result of new legislation passed or new decisions taken in Member States."
"We have been arguing about a legal basis, but I think there is a satisfactory solution for that."
"Secondly, the compensation fund."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we cannot just sit back and wait until a solution pops up out of the air, while people are suffering substantial income loss through measures of this kind."
"Thus I strongly support the demand for a compensation fund and a compensation scheme in order to offer some measure of restitution to these people who are adversely affected."
"Mr President, the rapporteur is right to state that the 380, 000 commuters across frontiers make up a minority by comparison with an estimated 150 million workers in the European labour market."
"At the same time, it goes without saying that the free movement of workers is an important right of the internal market."
"I am very happy to concede the signal function in relation to the EU's objectives."
"That is why I fully support giving equal rights to frontier commuters and mobile workers in terms of the European Commission's action plan which contains five main emphases, namely improving or adjusting the most important legal documents on the free movement of workers, increasing the transparency of the labour market, taking-on of responsibility by the Member States and developing co-operation, better information about the right of free movement and strengthening the external effect as well as assisting innovative projects in the framework of the European Social Fund."
"Under no circumstances can there be any tampering with free collective bargaining - a great good - as is demanded at point 7 by my colleague Mrs van Lancker."
"The principle of subsidiarity must also be respected."
"Preference should definitely be given to bilateral solutions."
"Under no circumstances can I agree to a central compensation fund at an EU level."
"And I continue to reject any extension of reuniting families, or any expansion of the export of support for the unemployed and for families and payments of money or of the right of residence for family members from third countries until it is has been established who are members of the close family circle."
"Under no circumstances can these include children over 21 who are not entitled to maintenance, or relatives in an ascending line who are not entitled to maintenance."
"In conclusion, I say to my colleague Chanterie that I would stress one point: the frontier workers do this on an entirely voluntary basis."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to thank Mrs Van Lancker for her excellent report on the situation of frontier workers and, in particular, the social and fiscal problems that these workers face."
"The Commission fully supports her concerns."
"Indeed, the Commission's action plan for free movement of workers adopted on 12 November 1997 highlighted the important role of cross-border mobility in the Union."
"In particular, it underlined the need for specific clear provisions to overcome the problems caused for frontier workers by disparities between national, legal systems in fields such as social security, taxation, health care and social advantages."
"Besides this statutory action, cross-border cooperation needs to be fostered in order to cover specific issues of interest to frontier workers such as social security and taxation."
"Your draft resolution calls for a range of actions from the different partners involved."
"I welcome your proposal to put forward the resolution to the Council, the European social partners, the governments and the parliaments of the Member States, as well as to the Commission."
"I fully agree that only a combined action at each of these levels will bring about meaningful resolution of the problems analysed in the explanatory statement."
"Allow me now to set out briefly the Commission's approach to the points raised in the resolution."
"With regard to fiscal matters, the Commission has long been aware of the specific tax problems of frontier workers and has sought to contribute to their solution by way of legislative proposals and other initiatives."
"As early as 1979 the Commission presented a draft directive to harmonize certain aspects of a tax treatment on non-residents."
"Unfortunately the proposal was not adopted since the required unanimity in the Council could not be reached."
"Therefore, in 1993 the Commission adopted a recommendation on the tax treatment of residents' income."
"The recommendation and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice following the approach of the recommendation, in particular the Schumacher judgment, significantly benefited the situation of non-resident workers."
"Most Member States concerned have now, more or less, adapted their legislation on the taxation of non-residents who earned their main income in a Member State other than that of their residence, in line with the recommendation."
"The Commission has also kept under review the legislation in Member States and initiated infringement proceedings against several Member States for failure to respect the non-discrimination rule."
"This report underlines the need for a Community approach to the problem of rules for tax jurisdiction in parallel to that existing in the field of social security."
"The Commission can in principle agree with the need for Community action."
"It has to take into account the need for unanimity for any adoption of binding Community legislation in the tax field."
"In the absence of harmonization of income taxes, the attribution of taxing rights among two Member States is so far governed by their bilateral tax conventions."
"Recently the Court ruled that under the existing provisions of Community law Member States are free to arrange bilaterally the tax jurisdiction for income tax of frontier workers."
"Any multilateral approach in the form of a European convention on the avoidance of double taxation of income and capital would also require unanimity."
"However, the Commission will pay particular attention to the need for a coherent solution of the tax and social security problems faced by the frontier workers."
"Concerning social policy, I welcome Parliament's support for the Commission's different proposals to amend Regulation 1408/71 on social security for migrant workers."
"In this respect, you are probably aware that the Court of Justice has recently made two important judgments."
"These judgments means that a person who was insured for medical care in a Member State is entitled to be reimbursed by that state for all medical care he or she receives in another Member State in accordance with the tariffs of the state of insurance."
"Since these judgments are directly applicable, the experiments that Mrs Van Lancker suggests in her resolution do not now seem to be necessary."
"I would like to thank Mrs Van Lancker and her colleagues for the encouraging support given to the EURES network."
"The EURES cross-border partnerships have been supported by the European Parliament from the very start and we welcome the proposal that EURES and its cross-border partnerships should be stepped up."
"However, I should underline that while the number of cross-border partnerships has increased from 11 to 18 over the past two years, our budget has not increased."
"In fact, it has slightly decreased over the same period."
"These cross-border partnerships provide services to frontier workers such as relevant information about their rights and obligations."
"In that sense they support certain requests of this resolution."
"The EURES adviser can help national and European institutions to be informed as quickly as possible about obstacles to mobility."
"In the future we intend to gather such information in a more structured manner."
"The EURES partners and their advisers will thus be able to contribute to the setting up of an early warning system."
"However, it should be made clear that they will not be able to provide a complete coverage in all border areas of the Union or in all aspects mentioned in the resolution."
"However, the Commission will shortly present a comprehensive report on the work of the EURES network for the years 1996 and 1997 to Parliament."
"This could be a good opportunity to carry out an in-depth dialogue over the future developments of the EURES network."
"As regards the proposal to establish call centres for migrant and frontier workers, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the Commission's intention to launch a permanent dialogue with citizens."
"This will be officially announced at the European Summit in Cardiff."
"Call centres will be established in all the Member States on the model of the Citizens First initiative, to advise citizens on their rights as well as on any community-related problems."
"Finally, I would like to comment on the idea of the proposal for a directive on the introduction of a European test, whereby Member States would be required to test their legislation on the effects they have on frontier workers."
"I would like to make it clear that it is already the Commission's task to ensure that all provisions of national legislation are compatible with the Treaty and the secondary legislation so far as Community law is concerned."
"The Commission will certainly continue to use the powers laid down in Article 169 of the Treaty and to launch infringement proceedings against Member States when they violate EC law."
"However, I understand that the suggested proposal for a directive aims to provide for a more general socio-economic impact assessment of the consequences of national legislation which is in itself compatible with EC law but which might cause detrimental effects to frontier workers."
"While I am not sure that it would be appropriate to propose a directive in these circumstances, it seems to me appropriate to stimulate, as it is suggested in the report, cross-border concertation of the partners involved in the different regions and at Community level."
"So I can confirm that it is the Commission's intention to stimulate this concertation in order to be able to identify infringements of EC law and the socio-economic consequences of national legislation on frontier workers."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her stimulating report and to stress the Commission's determination to maintain its efforts to overcome the problems faced by frontier workers."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his extensive answer, which I find to be largely satisfactory. But one question regarding the Europe test."
"I know that he was not so favourable to the idea of a Europe test before, but I also know that the Commission's Legal Service has been investigating the question of the legal basis in the Treaty."
"Can the Commissioner confirm or deny that there is a legal basis for such a test, by which it would be possible to vet the social legislation of Member States not only for its conformity with European law but also for its effects on frontier workers, which is another kind of test?"
"Our Legal Service had indicated Article 49 as a suitable legal basis."
"I would appreciate it if the Commissioner could comment on the findings of the Commission's Legal Service."
"Mr President, I should like to say to Mrs Van Lancker that it is my opinion that there is a legal base."
"The question is of some political choices to be made here and before any of these matters concerning that and other matters concerning taxation are pursued, the taxation policy group should have a look at these matters first."
"The only difficulty is that it seems to be overloaded with matters to be dealt with this year."
"I know they are obliged to deal with an investigation on pensions and on energy taxation and on electronic commerce."
"That is a pretty over-loaded agenda at the moment."
"But the answer in short is Yes, it can be established that there is a legal base where this could be undertaken."
"Thank you for your speech, Mr Flynn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Registration documents for motor vehicles"
"The next item is the report (A4-0190/98) by Mr Bazin, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive on registration documents for motor vehicles and their trailers (COM(97)0248 - C4-0423/97-97/0150(SYN))."
"Mr President, I consider that the regulation proposed by the European Commission is most fortuitous for two reasons:"
"First, because road cabotage has been deregulated."
"This means that we need an efficient system for monitoring and controlling freight vehicles moving within the internal market."
"Secondly because, as the committee of inquiry into fraud and smuggling of goods in transit found, most goods, especially cigarettes and alcohol, are smuggled by road."
"There are, at a guess, hundreds of instances in which lorries have disappeared together with their freight by changing their number plates and respraying and many of these have been documented in the Commission report in the committee of inquiry into fraud and smuggling of goods in transit."
"The proposal itself, and I would like to congratulate the Commission and its rapporteur, Mr Bazin, on their proposal, is based on two premises:"
"First, if a lorry or bus is to be registered in a Member State, the old registration documents must be submitted to the new state in which they are to be registered."
"That is fundamental."
"Secondly, the state which registers the vehicle must send the old registration documents to the state which issued them, in order to inform them that the registration number of the vehicle has changed."
"Another extremely important point is that provision has now been made for vehicle checks on all main roads within the European Union."
"In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, where freight vehicles do not need to carry their registration documents while travelling within the country, they are now required to do so when travelling outside the United Kingdom, Sweden or Denmark."
"May I also say that the Group of the European People's Party endorses the report and will endorse the rapporteur's amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is really a debate among transport policy conspirators."
"This is a report which is slightly technical but not really as technical as all that."
"Allow me to begin by offering sincere thanks to the Chairman of the Committee for Transport and Tourism."
"It is sometimes his duty, which he takes seriously, to assume the role of rapporteur and to push the matter forward, if no group wants to take on a report because of the subject, and I am particularly grateful to him for handling transport policy in our Committee with such commitment."
"As to the matter itself: we support the draft directive from the Commission on the harmonization of the registration documentation for motor vehicles and trailers."
"I believe that aligning registration documents will facilitate transport checks in the Union, because in future and irrespective of the issuing country the documents will in each case contain a series of clear and uniform statements; for example, inter alia they will indicate in which Member State the vehicle is registered and which person is the authorised owner of the registration documents."
"That will unfortunately still not tell you who is the owner of the vehicle, but we shall at least know who is the authorised owner of the registration documents."
"By this means, the draft directive will at the same time assist the fight against car crime."
"Moreover, the alignment of registration documents will facilitate reregistration of a motor vehicle from one member country to another."
"However, Commissioner, my group believes that this can be only the first step towards harmonization, because it makes no sense within the European Community for some states to have one-piece registration documents and others two-piece documents, with differing legal consequences in the Member States concerned."
"That really makes no sense at all in an internal market."
"I think that we need a certain degree of harmonization in an internal market."
"It does not have to be taken to the final degree, but there has to be a sensible harmonization of basic data."
"That is why I would be happy if you would acknowledge that harmonization will have to go beyond this first step, especially since I believe that the theft and smuggling of vehicles within the Community and also from the Community into adjacent third countries must be more effectively prevented, and it would be helpful in this respect to have sensible registration documents."
"That is why, Commissioner, we support your proposal."
"We hope that you will support the draft amendments from the Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism - apart from the draft amendment from the Greens, of course, we do not support that one either - and we also hope that it is the first step on the road to a careful but objectively justified harmonization."
"Mr President, can I begin by thanking Mr Bazin on his excellent and concise report discharged as a duty but also with some enthusiasm."
"As this report notes, and as we have just heard from Mr Bazin, there are considerable differences between procedure and purpose relating to the registration of motor vehicles in the Member States."
"There are also varying degrees of endorsement of the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, so increasing mobility in the Community and in the single market now makes the harmonization of rules on information contained in registration certificates sensible as Mr Sarlis pointed out."
"I am naturally pleased to note that Mr Bazin and his colleagues support the objectives of the proposal."
"I have, of course, considered the various amendments carefully and whilst they have my broad sympathy, some purely practical considerations mean that I sadly cannot accept all of them."
"Amendment No 1 calls for an additional statement in the preamble to the effect that this proposal constitutes a first step towards more complete harmonization."
"While I agree with the sentiment of the amendment, for the reasons set out very recently by Mr Jarzembowski and whilst I also believe that there will be moves towards greater uniformity in the future, the addition of such a new preamble would serve no strict legislative function and consequently the Commission cannot accept it."
"Amendment No 3 seeks to change the dates of implementation to take into account the actual time frame of the proposal."
"While the purpose of the amendment is certainly sensible, the need for a modified proposal and the need also for a second reading, mean that even the new dates suggested are unlikely to be achieved."
"I believe it best, therefore, to leave this detail until the actual adoption of the common position and to set appropriate dates at that point."
"I hope, therefore, that this amendment can be withdrawn."
"Amendment No 4 calls on the Commission to circulate all copies of all registration documents to all Member States and I can certainly support that amendment as a useful means of spreading relevant information."
"Amendment Nos 2, 5 and 6 relate to anti-fraud measures."
"I can accept both the principle and specifically Amendment No 5 which requires the inclusion of the engine identification number on the registration document."
"However, the effect of the other two amendments would be to require replacement registration documents when certain new spare parts were installed in the vehicle, including for example a replacement window."
"I am sure that this could not have been the intention of those who drafted the amendment, since the results would obviously be extremely bureaucratic."
"I hope that on reflection honourable Members will not pursue these amendments."
"Amendment No 7 were to have the effect of making inclusion of a vehicle's environmental characteristics in the registration documents compulsory rather than optional."
"Since such details could play a role in taxation regimes at some time in the future and since such features could also be subject to roadside checks, the Commission acknowledges the sense of making such information mandatory and we can therefore support this amendment."
"I am very grateful to Mr Bazin and to his committee for the constructive attitude that they are taking to a proposal which will I am sure prove its worth to vehicle owners and to transport authorities and also be a useful addition to the efforts to combat theft and fraud."
"So I, together with Members of this honourable House, look forward to its progress into law."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Potato starch"
"The next item is the report (A4-0163/98) by Mrs Redondo Jiménez, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch (COM(97)0576 - C4-0045/98-97/0300(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are considering the reform of Council Regulation No 1868/94. Articles 1 and 2 of that regulation say that the Commission is obliged to present a report on the performance of the regulation, as well as proposals to extend the time limit, or change the regulation or the allocation of starch quotas in any way."
"The countries affected were Denmark, Germany, France, Holland and Spain."
"In January 1995 three more countries joined - Austria, Sweden and Finland. Therefore, a modification was made at that time, with the overall quota being adjusted to 1 869 000 tonnes."
"The present proposal also lists the operational instruments upon which it is based, such as the minimum price of potatoes, the compensation payments to farmers, and the special premiums to industry. There are three reasons for paying industry: because of the structural disadvantages associated with starch manufacture; because of the limited value of by-products; and because of the seasonal nature of production."
"I should like to describe to the House the contradictions I have found in the Commission's proposal."
"I think the criteria used in the proposal need to be examined here, by all of us."
"Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to be sure whether we are talking about starch or about potatoes."
"If we are talking about starch, the price of starch should be the same whether it comes from potatoes or from cereals."
"In this case, there is discrimination in favour of potato starch, with an overvaluation of approximately 35 %, which needs to be looked at."
"If it is a question of potatoes, then I hope the honourable Members will allow me to say this: we are going to study this matter in depth and we are going to move towards a set of rules to cover the potato, not just for starch use, but for all uses, both for industry and for food."
"And here I would make a claim on behalf of many EU Member States: we propose a common organization of the market in potatoes."
"As for assistance to the starch industry, it is paid because of seasonal variations, for not using by-products, and for agrienvironmental measures."
"I should like the Commission to bear in mind that if it is a question of seasonal variation then the whole of the agri foodstuffs industry should be paid."
"Is the Commission prepared to pay the whole of that industry for products which experience problems because of their seasonal nature?"
"I think that would be a serious mistake."
"As for not using the byproducts, the same thing applies. How many industries are there which not only have no useful by-products, but also have to pay to get rid of them?"
"So we are paying for something which others have to pay for themselves."
"As for environmental measures, we have been paying the starch industry to take such measures for 20 years."
"I think they should have been taken by now."
"What am I trying to say, ladies and gentlemen?"
"Should we get rid of these subsidies?"
"No: I think we policy-makers and the Commission should be flexible and remember the social, regional and environmental problems we are faced with."
"So in this case, I propose a careful study of how to implement a new COM in potatoes."
"In the case of potato starch, however, the status quo should be maintained for three years."
"When it comes to studying the new COMs, as we shall have to do, I hope the same arguments, which I have stated here as contradictions, will be taken into consideration. We are always being told there are financial problems, so we cannot increase our budgets."
"Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal involves a budgetary increase of 26 %, which I think is highly significant."
"We are told that by cancelling things we could save ECU 150 million."
"With the oil question, we are talking about figures in the region of ECU 200 million, which is causing a big fuss throughout the European Union."
"So we are going to be consistent and apply the same criteria to all COMs."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez for her report and I have noted with some interest that she has pointed out some of the facts that I pointed to three years ago when I was asked to write a report on potato starch quotas."
"Just to go back for a moment, the quotas were introduced because there had been a huge increase in the production of potatoes for starch when starch from potatoes started to be treated, as far as subsidies were concerned, in the same way as cereals."
"Potatoes, grown for potatoes, to eat as chips or potatoes do not get a subsidy and it was because of a huge increase in production that these quotas became necessary."
"I repeat again, as I said at that time, that it is a very questionable use of public funds to support people to grow potatoes for starch when there are other sources of starch."
"There has been a huge growth in the amount of money being used to support this production."
"Potato starch consisted of 48 % of the total starch exports in 1996-1997."
"No fewer than 385, 000 tonnes of the stuff!"
"Why are we using public money to support people to grow potatoes to make into starch that we cannot use in the EU?"
"We pay the producers to make the starch and then we pay them to export it because nobody wants it."
"This is an absolute nonsense and we should not be looking to extend these subsidies, we should be looking to reduce the quotas so that we are at the very least cutting out the export subsidy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my very sincere thanks to Mrs Redondo for her report, and in this case I should like to contradict Mrs Hardstaff quite frankly when she asks: why do not we take maize or corn instead of potatoes?"
"Neither wheat nor maize can thrive where potatoes thrive, and that is why it is in particular the production of potato starch that is indispensable and an essential factor for certain disadvantaged regions of Europe."
"That is why it is also necessary for the future of the starch industry - because it, too, secures jobs - that the producer premium for potato starch is given to farmers."
"There is one other point which I want to mention: it is clear to all of us that high technology in starch production is essential for the firms or for the potato starch producers as well, and these processing plants also need reliable partners among the farmers."
"But the farmers can only produce the potatoes if these compensatory payments for the starch potatoes continue."
"I think that we should support the Commission's proposal in its present form, and also the proposal that the quotas for the next three years should be maintained."
"Mr President, it is not always the case, but this time my group can fully support the Commission's proposals in broad outline."
"We think that payments for starch from whatever source, including potato starch, should be made on equal terms."
"Why do we think that?"
"Firstly, the regions of Europe where potatoes for starch production are grown generally have soil that is not very fertile."
"Few alternatives are available."
"If we did not do this, large areas of Europe would be facing disaster."
"I therefore entirely disagree with the spokeswoman from the Socialist group."
"I would also have expected arguments of this kind to appeal to her, bearing in mind what it would all cost: at present I think we pay about ECU 200 million for this policy."
"Considering regional development in Europe as a whole, that is an extremely small amount."
"We get definite value for our money."
"What else is attractive about this industry?"
"It has proved over the years that it can operate in a very environmentally friendly manner - no more environmental pollution."
"A further attractive feature of agricultural production for non-food purposes."
"These are very important developments."
"Recently there was a report in the Dutch newspapers that one of the factories had developed a product which could replace gelatine."
"Given the BSE problem, that is very attractive indeed."
"Factors of this kind must be encouraging."
"In the long run they are probably the salvation of industries like this one."
"For these reasons the subsidy we give is very worth while."
"Thank you very much, Mr Mulder."
"But you were the one who allowed yourself to overrun by five seconds. I never cut anybody off."
"All I do is tell people, fairly forcefully, when their time is up. The responsibility for keeping to time or otherwise lies with each and every Member of this House."
"He has a minute and a half. We shall see if he allows himself longer than that, in which case I shall forcefully remind him that his time is up."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal to extend the quota system for potato starch by three years merits full support."
"The arrangement has contributed to a stable development of the market."
"The costs of the market organization for potato starch are being kept under control."
"In the interests of production planning for the next few years, it is important that the decision-making on the extension of quotas be completed as quickly as possible."
"The rapporteur's amendments aimed at reducing support for potato starch production were rightly rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"A one-sided reduction in support for potato starch would seriously disturb the balance on the market between cereal-based starch on the one hand and starch from potatoes on the other."
"Hence any reform of the market organization for potato starch must be coordinated with reforms in the cereal sector."
"But I do not think that Agenda 2000 proposals for potato starch, in which compensation for a drop in price is only 44 %, are acceptable."
"Finally, I would point out that starch potatoes cannot be compared with table potatoes."
"We are talking about completely different products and markets."
"A market organization for starch potatoes is necessary because these producers have to compete with cereal-based starch producers, who are generously supported through the MacSharry premiums, but there is absolutely no need for the market organization for table potatoes called for in Amendment No 3."
"The free market in this product works satisfactorily."
"Mr President, I first wanted to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez for her report on the quota system for potato starch."
"Also, an amendment has been added - Amendment No 3 - which calls for the potato problem to be analysed as a whole, including potatoes for consumption, because we need a COM to regulate the European potato market, in order to protect farmers from the price drops which regularly affect this product."
"The potato market suffers cyclical ups and downs, leading to periodic price drops which seriously affect the production sector. So Europe needs to intervene to regulate this market."
"Let us not forget that the potato is the tenth largest agricultural product in Europe in terms of its volume of production. Furthermore, it is the only one of the 25 most important EU agricultural products not to be regulated by the Union itself."
"Other products each cost the Community coffers ECU 2000 million, or ECU 1500 million in some cases. Nevertheless, there is no room for any sort of regulation of the potato, which is the tenth most important agricultural product in Europe."
"It is an inflexible market, in which an increase in production and the resulting price drop do not lead to greater consumption."
"There are studies which say this market can be regulated by establishing a system of quotas and areas, since it has been demonstrated that there is a correlation between the area under cultivation, the prices and the product."
"As well as protecting the product, the potato, from its ups and downs, a regulatory system of this nature would not be administratively complex, and the budgetary cost to the Community taxpayer would be minimal."
"So I am in favour of this report being approved."
"But we should also call upon the Council, through Amendment No 3, to have the courage once and for all to find a system to regulate the problem of food potatoes throughout the EU, by means of a COM, now that they have had proposals on the table for 5 or 6 years."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Redondo on her report on potato starch production."
"It is to her credit that the rapporteur was prepared in the committee reading to accept proposals of compromise which give the report a much more balanced feel, and pay greater attention to the special circumstances pertaining to starch production in different countries."
"The Commission is proposing to keep the quota system as it stands, in order to make the Community's starch markets more viable."
"In Finland domestic potato starch production is enough to meet only half the demand of the country's paper industry, and so Finland has recommended increasing its quota to 70 000 tonnes. That would satisfy existing production capacity more fully."
"Because of its cold climate, crop rotation in Finland is in much greater evidence than it is in Central Europe."
"Because of that, it is difficult to apply the conditions of production to the quota's 5 % flexibility limit."
"With reference to the large-scale crop rotation that goes with potatoes, a transfer facility of 10 % from one year to the next seems quite justifiable, and thus I consider Amendment No 6 six to be very welcome."
"This is the proposal to be able to deviate from the quota by 10 %."
") Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which drafted the report on the proposed adaptation of the quota restriction scheme for potato starch."
"The proposal seeks to renew the existing scheme for a further period of three years."
"The Committee willingly accepts Amendment No 1 which underlines the socio-economic importance of potato starch producers and justifies the steps taken in this sector."
"Similarly, the Committee accepts Amendment No 2 which lends support to the aim of maintaining a balance between the root vegetable starch and cereal starch sectors."
"With regard to Amendment No 3, relating to potatoes grown for food, the Committee is aware of the need to deploy a common market organization in the potato sector."
"This is why it submitted a proposal along these lines to the Parliament and Council in 1992."
"With regard to Amendment No 4, which seeks to impose a limit on the premium paid to starch manufacturers during the 1998-1999 campaign, the Committee regrets that it cannot accept this amendment which would be contrary to the interests of this sector due to structural constraints in terms of production."
"Similarly, with regard to Amendment No 5, the Committee does not see the need to specify a period of three years, as indicated in Article 1 of the proposal, or the reason why the amount of the premium set in the rules should be changed."
"Consequently, the committee is unable to accept this amendment."
"With regard to Amendment No 6, which seeks to increase the flexibility of the scheme, the Committee regrets that it cannot accept this amendment either, since it might boost production in a market that is already relatively saturated."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Cresson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Higher education"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0191/98), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a Council Recommendation on European cooperation in quality assurance in higher education (C4-0191/98-97/0121(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Heinisch)."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European co-operation to ensure the quality of higher education. At first glance you might think that we were dealing in this case with a hopeless undertaking."
"On the one hand we have the cultural autonomy of the Member States, the variety of educational systems, the independence and individuality of colleges and universities, and these embodiments of the principle of subsidiarity are now at odds with the need to establish European quality standards in higher education, because in the Community there is undoubtedly a consensus view that comparability among European higher education institutions is an indispensable precondition for the promotion of student mobility in the European Union, which is the express wish of us all because we hope that it will lead to the European Union growing together."
"But the comparability among higher education systems which is necessary to this end will be possible only if we succeed in reaching agreement on how to define and ultimately how to measure quality."
"Beyond that the question arises of who should appropriately hold responsibility for quality assurance measures."
"The positions which have been taken up by the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament in the course of the work on the recommendation with which we are now concerned offer a striking reflection of the difficulties that we come up against so often in the sphere of European educational policy, when it is a matter of achieving objectives which are desirable for the Community while strictly respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"In its original proposal, the Commission envisaged that it would be solely responsible for the creation of a European network which would take forward quality assurance and evaluation."
"Understandably, this was not acceptable to the Member States, and that is why at first reading the Parliament followed my proposal under which the Member States were to play an essential contributory role in the establishment of the networks."
"The underlying thought was that the establishment of a network could be successful only on the basis of mutual trust and co-operation, and it would have been very difficult to conceive of a European network without the corresponding national framework conditions."
"The common opinion has picked up Parliament's idea on this decisive point."
"Its approach is to recommend the establishment of a network to the Member States, whilst the Commission is to be given the task of supporting co-operation between the competent authorities for quality evaluation and assurance in higher education."
"Alongside this essential point, the Council has accepted 13 further amendments from the Parliament either verbatim or in spirit."
"What is important to me is that two fundamental considerations on which I constructed my report are now established in the Council's opinion."
"Success has thus been achieved in giving clearer emphasis to the principle of the autonomy of colleges and universities and the preservation of their own understanding of their educational purpose."
"Equally, the very obligatory tone in which the Member States were called upon to take certain measures has been diluted by comparison with the original Commission proposal."
"However, some of the amendments which the Parliament supported following my report have not been accepted."
"The Council has, for example, rejected involving the CEEC states in the quality assurance measures."
"Even if a recommendation to these states may at present fail because for legal reasons it cannot be directed at non-Member States, I nonetheless consider it important that we should not lose sight of the importance of their being involved, because it goes without saying that all the quality assurance objectives which we are pursuing apply as well to the states with which we shall be enlarging our Community in the near future."
"They, too, should share in the integrating effect at which our measures are targeted, and it will be important for them in particular to profit from Europe's capacity for innovation and to contribute to it."
"A further amendment has not been accepted by the Council."
"I had supported the creation of evaluation systems for the research sphere as well in this amendment."
"In Germany where teaching and research form a single entity, it seemed to me a very obvious thought that the quality of a college or university can be judged only if its research achievements are evaluated at the same time."
"However, Article 126 of the Maastricht Treaty, on which our recommendation is based, does not allow any statement in relation to the research sphere."
"It is the legal base only for questions of education."
"I attempted a compromise with the draft amendment which I have again introduced at second reading."
"This draft amendment also includes the sphere of training for research in the quality evaluation measures."
"In so doing, it falls within the legal base of Article 126 and can thereby include research evaluation in training."
"I think that this will be of help as regards the dichotomy between the subsidiarity principle and the pursuit of education policy objectives."
"We are well aware that there are still some obstacles to overcome before this compromise can be realized, but the compromise should point the way for university education at the start of the 21st century."
"As we develop towards globalization, we in the European Union have to face up to international criteria and follow new paths in higher education policy."
"These will include inter-disciplinary and European courses of study."
"We need to recognise how important it is to base all our educational measures on a holistic concept of education."
"Finally we must all endeavour to develop partnerships and establish these in the place of fear of loss of responsibility."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we support the common position and consider that it has taken account of our draft amendments."
"The guarantee of and progress in the quality of training and its constant critical review by colleges and universities and all of their members ought really to be much more a matter of course, in the interest of the best possible life and career opportunities for young graduates."
"Sadly this is not the case, to a greater extent in some of the countries of Europe, to a lesser in others."
"It undoubtedly comes as a bitter realization to students when they get to hear, often by way of dubious ranking procedures, that their university is poorly classified in public esteem because it perhaps missed the opportunity to make changes."
"It should at long last be common practice that every college undergoes an evaluation of its research and teaching and that international external experts should also take part in the evaluation groups."
"For example, universities should ensure that they face critical questioning about how good and forward-looking the education they are offering is, whether they consciously give a European orientation to their courses of studies in the spirit of ERASMUS, and offer lectures and seminars in other languages, for example, whether they have reached agreements with colleges or sectors of industry in other countries in order to offer students practical experience abroad, or whether the college puts itself forward as a regional training centre for those in work or whether one subject area takes part in distance-learning."
"There will be some in research and teaching who will find it hard to re-think along these lines."
"That's the only way to overcome ossification."
"It is certainly important to ensure that training is assured on the basis of criteria that are as far as possible the same, but it seems to me questionable that new bodies should be set up for this purpose, such as a ""network' institution on a European basis, especially since in legal terms it is on thin ice, and this should be rejected."
"It will not lead to any progress."
"What are important are permanent exchanges of experience about evaluation procedures between colleges and universities themselves."
"Individual projects can sensibly be supported by the EU."
"In conclusion: what is wrong with the varied profiles of European colleges and universities?"
"They are sources of innovation potential."
"Why should not architectural studies in Milan, for example, be offered with rather different emphases than in Aachen, for example, if the quality standards are good in both cases?"
"Mr President, many thanks for listening to my important remarks so late in the day."
"Guarantees of quality should certainly be welcomed."
"We should also welcome efforts to align quality in Europe."
"However, what has not been taken into account is the free access that we are addressing."
"Free access for students to all of Europe's colleges and universities will result in a hierarchy of higher education institutions, and will generate a competition which leads to efforts being made by all colleges and universities to attract students."
"That will be far more important than provisions aimed at aligning them with each other."
"However, the concept that has been mentioned of research training is somewhat questionable because research training would mean that special syllabuses would have to be developed for research."
"Secondly, what is missing here is the propagation of co-operation between research and industry, because we know from experience that research only works properly where it is jointly organized with industry."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Parliament and especially the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media and its rapporteur Mrs Heinisch, for having examined the common position of the Council in such a short space of time."
"In its broad outlines, it was in line with the spirit of the Committee's proposal."
"It also accepted a large number of the amendments proposed by Parliament on the first reading."
"In fact, the Council text contains all your major amendments such as those concerning the definition of an establishment of higher education, the diversity of national education and assessment systems, as well as the independence and individual character of establishments of higher education."
"If we seek to promote an educational and vocational training system that matches up to the challenges before us, as expressed in the Treaty, quality assessment systems are essential tools, they make a positive contribution to policies favouring employment, growth and competitiveness."
"As you have seen, the principles on which the evaluation systems are based are clearly highlighted in the recommendations."
"Your contributions have added greatly to their further development."
"I remember that they are derived from experience in the field, in which many teaching establishments participated and it is on the basis of this experience that we have been able to single out the common features of teaching quality assessment systems across the various countries of the Union."
"I would also like to mention the importance of this cooperative spirit if we wish to achieve a genuine transparency in teaching systems and to foster the exchange of mutual information between educational establishments on the content and quality of their teaching."
"This should further the cross-national mobility of students, the recognition of diplomas and qualifications and the free movement of qualified students in Europe."
"With regard to the amendment proposed by the rapporteur, I concur wholeheartedly with the desire to show that higher educational establishments must improve not only the quality of teaching and learning, but also that of training for research."
"You will recall that the Commission was unable to accept at the first reading an amendment that referred to research in general, since this does not come within the legal premise underlying the recommendation."
"However, the scope of the amendment proposed today is clearly defined and restricted to training in research."
"I think we should introduce this amendment to the extent that in the teaching provided by higher educational establishments, training for research is often intimately tied to general education."
"I have frequently stressed the importance of this recommendation towards promoting quality education in Europe."
"I can therefore only rejoice at the fact that the inter-institutional decision-making process has reached a very positive agreement."
"As soon as the Council has finally adopted the recommendation, the Commission will proceed as soon as possible to set up the network for quality assessment, whose work will be decisive towards creating the European educational space we all desire so earnestly."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Cresson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Fifth Framework Programme"
"The next item is the report (A4-0188/98) by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the proposals for Council Decisions concerning:"
"I.the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities and for the dissemination of research results for the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme of the European Community (1998-2002) (COM(97)0587/2 - C4-0015/98-97/0309 (SYN));"
"II.the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities for the Treaty establishing the Fifth Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) (1998-2002) (COM(97)0587/2 - C4-0016/98-97/0310 (CNS))."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal being presented on the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities and for the dissemination of research results for the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme of the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community performs the essential task of making it possible to implement the objectives and actions stipulated in that framework programme."
"Our committee's overall opinion was favourable, and we like the set of measures intended to provide the people concerned with access to Community research."
"Our committee has focused on one or two aspects designed to solve the few remaining problems detected during past experience and previous calls for proposals. These need to be dealt with because the improvements introduced by the current proposal do not go far enough."
"Thus we express our concern about the effects of rapid technological innovation on some areas of research - especially in relation to the information society - as regards the composition of the applicant groups, as well as their launch and budgetary obligations."
"Another of the improvements introduced refers to the need to guarantee that information about calls for proposals is accessible through other electronic media, besides the Official Journal, and in all languages."
"We have also received many suggestions aimed at helping the applicants by speeding up the decision-making process, so that it takes no longer than four months to reach a decision."
"We also thought it would be a good thing, when it comes to implementing the grants financially, to take account of the various aspects and different characteristics which come into play in each of the countries where the research groups are based, and to treat them all in the same way for that purpose, so as not to cause resentment."
"One aspect the committee found particularly relevant is the reference to the property rights to knowledge resulting from work carried out under indirect actions, when the Community's contribution is 50 % or more."
"We did not think it right or adequate only to stipulate that right to shared property rights when Community funding was 100 %."
"Something of particular interest throughout the Union is the fight against fraud."
"Although it seems incredible, we have also received warnings about this disgraceful practice, in some cases."
"For that reason, and taking as a legal basis the precedent provided by the judgements of the European Court of Justice, we have introduced specific corrective and preventative mechanisms, which also allow penalties to be imposed, if necessary, on groups which present anomalies or serious irregularities, or fail to fulfil their obligations in this respect."
"All of this arises from our concern to protect the financial interests of the European Community, as provided for by Regulation No 2988/95."
"Passing on to other matters, we think it is right to use all the languages in order to provide contractors with the necessary information. Similarly, we think all the current resources of the information society should be used, especially for SMEs, universities and research centres."
"Finally, we think it is quite right that substantive, detailed reasons should always be given, both for acceptance and rejection."
"I should point out that our discussions in committee were very full and covered other aspects, such as our concern to involve as many of the smaller SMEs as possible, or how to set priorities. We discussed the relative importance of the competitiveness of associated technological innovation and the satisfaction of the social needs of Europeans."
"In short, by making this contribution, the European Parliament is fulfilling its function of directly representing the concerns and wishes entrusted to it, and is trying to perfect this proposal, which was already good, on this crucial subject."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, the publication and evaluation of results are essential aspects of scientific research policy for countries with under-developed industries."
"Although their importance is enshrined in the Commission's text, I have reason to fear that in practice they are still not being dealt with satisfactorily."
"So far as publication is concerned, electronic media are an excellent resource for those who know what they are looking for."
"But they are not reaching everybody."
"We have to find others for those who have yet to discover the potential that lies in exchanges of information and co-operation in the field of research and technology."
"These can be research centres such as universities, or equally they can be small and medium-sized businesses."
"I would like to say that it is important to keep the definition of SMBs at the present maximum of five hundred workers and not to reduce it to two hundred and fifty, as proposed in Amendment No 1."
"If that is done, a country like Portugal will be prevented from taking part in SMB support schemes, which is undoubtedly the opposite of what Mr Marset Campos intends to achieve by proposing this amendment."
"But the fact is that in Portugal only companies of a certain size can conduct research."
"With regard to evaluation, which means the ability to convert research into production, one good way would be to promote liaison with the EUREKA programme."
"So I appeal to the conference which will conclude the Portuguese presidency of EUREKA in June to create conditions in which there can be interaction between the Fifth Framework Programme and EUREKA."
"And, since I have mentioned the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme, may I enter a final plea that we do not make the mistake of reducing the marine science and technology budget, especially in this Year of the Oceans."
"They are the flagship of Europe."
"The world would not understand such a lack of vision and the future would not forgive us for it."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Vaz da Silva."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Vaz da Silva's speech brings us to the end of the contributions from Members of this House."
"So I now invite Commissioner Cresson to take the floor."
"Mr President, before all else I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, especially the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, for the work accomplished."
"I entirely share the sentiment of Mr Marset Campos: our rules of participation and dissemination must be comprehensible to all those engaged in research."
"They must be deployed with the highest degree of transparency."
"Our proposals on this matter come within the much wider context of the efforts by the Commission to guarantee optimum management of Community research programmes."
"In particular, efforts will be made to simplify the procedures as much as possible and reduce delays as soon as possible."
"The proposal under discussion was prepared on the basis of experience gained with the existing rules."
"These worked satisfactorily overall."
"Whilst being most important for the participants, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, they are still quite technical."
"I will summarize the position of the Commission with regard to the two draft recommendations of the Parliament as follows."
"The Commission in the main endorses the objectives of Amendments Nos 4 and 8 (EC, Euratom)."
"The first states that requests for proposals should be made public, rather than simply published in the Official Journal."
"The second expands upon the financial contribution methods of the Community."
"Pending reformulation, the Commission can partially adopt these amendments."
"It cannot do the same for the other amendments."
"Although sharing their underlying concerns, the Commission is actually of the opinion that these amendments are already covered by the measures proposed, for example Amendments Nos 1 (ECEuratom), 5, 11 and 16 (EC), or they are likely to introduce daily management provisions in the theoretical texts invoked to govern research policy in its entirety, for example Amendments Nos 2 and 7 (EC, Euratom) and 14 (EC)."
"Some are likely to raise problems of a legal nature, for example Amendments Nos 12 and 13 (EC)."
"Others are to be considered within the context of the implementation measures, for example Amendments Nos 3 and 6 (EC, Euratom), and 9 and 15 (EC)."
"I am very grateful to the European Parliament for having grasped the urgency of this paper."
"The adoption of this recommendation at the first reading should enable the ""research' Council of the 22 June to adopt a common position on the proposal."
"We are all aware that the existing framework programme, its special programmes and the existing contribution and dissemination rules expire at the end of the year."
"So we are engaged in a genuine race against time."
"If we wish to avoid disrupting the European research effort, the Fifth Framework Programme, its special programmes and the new contribution and dissemination rules should be ready in good time to enable us to proceed from the 1 January 1999."
"We are on the right track."
"However, I do not underestimate the difficulties awaiting us with regard to the adoption of the fifth framework programme under satisfactory conditions."
"I am sure that I can count on and continue to enjoy your support in achieving this goal."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Cresson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"I wish you a good night's sleep, which I know is well-deserved. May I remind you that our next sitting begins at 9.00 a.m. tomorrow, Thursday 28 May 1998, and is planned to finish at 1.00 p.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, on page 6 of yesterday's Minutes it says that I asked to make a personal statement."
"What I said then, Madam President, was proven again by something that happened yesterday."
"On Dutch television, in the programme Nova , Mrs Van Dijk again did precisely what I reproached the Greens for yesterday, in other words, she misrepresented the situation for electoral purposes."
"She maintained on television that I am against any change in the current statutory arrangements for Members."
"Everyone in this House knows that I have said very clearly time after time, orally and in writing, and in reports by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, that I am of the opinion that the same statute must apply to all Members and that there must be no discrimination on grounds of nationality because that is against Article 6 of the Treaty."
"At the present time, Madam President, Italians in this House earn five times more than Spaniards."
"That is a disgrace!"
"That is discrimination on grounds of nationality."
"We are deemed to perform the same work and should therefore receive the same emoluments."
"Once there is a statute based on equality, Madam President, the rules for travel and subsistence expenses can also be changed."
"I demand that the Greens withdraw their accusation that I am against change."
"I am in favour of it."
"Madam President, we expect proposals from the Bureau as soon as possible on a single statute."
"I have one final remark, Madam President."
"Why is there not a service in Brussels which can make reports of sittings available the next day, as in Strasbourg?"
"It is an odd situation."
"No, those are the Minutes, Mr Martens."
"I am talking about the Verbatim Report, the so-called ""Rainbow' , in all the various languages."
"But Mr Martens, he is hardly here, he does not know all about it yet."
"Madam President, I hope that Brussels will be treated in the same way as Strasbourg and that there will also be a service here that can handle the Verbatim Report of Proceedings."
"Thank you, Mr Wijsenbeek."
"We shall take note of that."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Cohesion Fund - Structural Funds - Island regions"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0159/98 by Mr Arias Cañete, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the Commission's Annual Report on the Cohesion Fund for 1996 (COM(97)0302 - C4-0482/97); -A4-0160/98 by Mrs Klaß, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the Eighth Annual Report on the Structural Funds for 1996 (COM(97)0526 - C4-0582/97); -A4-0118/98 by Mr Viola, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the problems of island regions in the European Union."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Article 130a of the Treaty contains a fundamental provision of Community law."
"It establishes that the Community shall develop and pursue actions to strengthen economic and social cohesion, in order to promote its own harmonious development. The article adds that the Community shall aim in particular to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions, and help the least favoured regions, including rural areas, to catch up."
"Of all Community regional development policies, the Cohesion Fund is one of the main instruments of that policy, since its essential aim is to help combat the current disparities within the European Union."
"The four countries which receive aid from this Fund are still the most affected by such disparities, as was clearly shown in the Commission's first three-yearly report on cohesion."
"The report before us at the moment reflects the fact that although a lot of progress has been made in the Cohesion Fund's two sectors of activity - transport and environment - the disparities we are talking about are a long way from being resolved. So it is vitally important for the Fund to continue to function within the four beneficiary countries."
"However, it must be stressed that these countries have obligations, not just to make a real effort to ensure that actions implemented at the expense of the Cohesion Fund are really effective, but also to make sure there is a proper balance between actions in the two sectors of the Fund. As the report says, there are imbalances in some of these Member States as regards the funding of projects in certain fields."
"Specifically, in the transport sector, we must underline our concern at the fact that road projects are still being given priority, when curiously enough these are the least environmentally friendly compared with other means of transport, such as railways."
"This can end up being somewhat contradictory, when we remember that the environment is the other sector which receives aid from the Cohesion Fund, and the most environmentally friendly projects should therefore be given priority."
"From a strictly financial point of view, the 1996 results are highly satisfactory because the budgetary implementation reached 100 % of commitment appropriations and 97.5 % of payment appropriations. Also, progress is being made towards achieving a balance between the intervention sectors."
"The special attention being paid to the ultra-peripheral regions is very positive, Madam Commissioner, because as we know, those are the regions which tend to have the biggest problems, especially where communications are concerned."
"In analysing the importance of the Cohesion Fund as a financial instrument designed to achieve economic and social cohesion, we should once more underline the difference between nominal convergence, which some of the Member States benefiting from this Fund have managed to attain, and real convergence, which is still a long way from being achieved in those countries. It is that real convergence which is the main objective of the Cohesion Fund."
"Some amendments to the report confuse real convergence and nominal convergence. As I see it, to say that those Member States which have reached the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union should be excluded from the Cohesion Fund, despite fulfilling the requirement of having a GNP less than 90 % of the Community average, would be to reward those which failed in their obligations and to punish those which, despite being disadvantaged in relation to Community GNP, have made real efforts to reduce disparities and comply with the established criteria - and to continue to do so - not just in the convergence plans but also in the stability plans."
"Without compromising that view, I shall present the House with an oral amendment to paragraph 14 of my report, designed to ensure that it is fully consistent with the approach taken in Mr Izquierdo Collado's report, in view of the compromise amendments established by Mr Berend, so that we can preserve the consensus achieved in the Izquierdo Collado report."
"We should also welcome the jobs this Fund creates, directly or indirectly, in the beneficiary Member States."
"That is an aspect which should be encouraged, because although job creation is not the main objective of the Cohesion Fund, it needs to be taken into account, and priority should be given to measures which can create lasting jobs."
"That is all the more true at a time when the European Union has to strengthen this policy, in the context of the Treaty of Amsterdam which is waiting in the wings."
"To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out that the Cohesion Fund has shown itself to be an essential instrument for achieving a large, balanced European Union without disparities."
"So it is a valid model to inspire the future instrument of pre-accession, which can model itself on this Fund and help to ensure that enlargement is a complete success."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's report on the Structural Funds for 1996, as forwarded to Parliament, is a very comprehensive and yet a very topical document, and for that we wish to express our thanks to the Commission."
"We are adopting a position on this report today because we want the experiences of 1996 to be a lesson for the years to come."
"Our gaze is already focusing on the challenges which lie ahead, on the reform of the Structural Funds and on the enlargement of the Union."
"A number of problems from previous years still beset us and these have already been discussed in previous years by Parliament's rapporteurs."
"Nevertheless, I have decided to include these points again in my report, for as the saying goes, ""constant dropping wears the stone' ."
"I hope the Commission may forgive me, but I hope that by adopting such an approach these problems might be overcome."
"With the conclusion of 1996 we reached the midway point in the current programming period."
"The two preceding years recorded less than satisfactory results in respect of the take-up of funds."
"However, 1996 shows that the backlog in programme planning now seems to have been overcome."
"This means that 1996 was really the first effective year of implementation."
"We note with satisfaction that the take-up of appropriations from the Structural Funds for 1996 amounts to 98 % of available commitments and 95 % of available payments."
"This constitutes a considerable improvement."
"It has to be admitted, however, that these payments only give a limited picture of actual implementation in the field."
"We therefore call on the Member States to respect the three-month deadline for transferring funds to final beneficiaries."
"We ask the Commission to provide data on the transmission of funds to beneficiaries in its next annual report."
"Only in this way can we monitor the flow of funds from the Commission to final beneficiaries."
"The rate of take-up for Community initiatives and transitional and innovative measures still gives cause for concern, however."
"This category accounts for 70 % of the total funding not taken up."
"According to provisional figures, implementation of Community initiatives in 1997 also failed to register the hoped-for improvement."
"Reprogramming and transfers of appropriations have therefore become necessary and I would request that Parliament be informed of these developments as early and as fully as possible and that our opinion be duly taken into account."
"This applies particularly in the event of problems arising from the exhaustion of funds at the end of the programme planning period."
"The activities of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund will considerably strengthen the impact of the Structural Funds."
"Greater use should be made of these facilities in future years."
"But we also need to have verification of the European Investment Fund by the Court of Auditors."
"We must continue to underline the importance of having a structural policy which is compatible with other Community policies."
"While the implementation of the partnership principle has improved over the years, this continues to be episodic and sporadic, particularly with regard to the involvement of economic and social partners at regional and local level."
"The Commission's thoughts on new forms of partnership and strengthening of the principle and anchoring it more effectively are of significance in that the imminent Structural Fund reform will in all likelihood make partnership an important issue."
"Anchoring partnership more powerfully in the new regulations should mean defining realistically and accurately the scope, allocation of roles and function of partnership."
"Monitoring, evaluation and checks are of fundamental importance for the successful achievement of these aims."
"However, this sector has now assumed enormous complexity in its criteria and procedures."
"The forthcoming reform of the Structural Funds must include an appropriate simplification of the evaluation system."
"There has been an increase in the number of financial irregularities."
"More effective controls and closer cooperation between the Commission and the Member States are certainly exposing more cases of this kind."
"However, I believe that an increase in fraudulent activity has also played its part in the rise in recorded cases."
"The additionality of resources should continue to enjoy priority."
"Nonetheless, verification of the observance of this principle is not being carried out satisfactorily."
"The Commission has proposed additionality as one of the criteria for a 10 % reserve."
"Yet the difficulties with verification, which are still being encountered, are anything but encouraging."
"In this respect I ask myself how a criterion which has been verified as inadequate can be considered as an additional key for apportionment."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to think again about this project."
"In conclusion I would like to express my thanks to all those who have provided help and support in the drafting of this report."
"I hope that it will play a part in our continuing efforts to promote an ever closer European Union through the Structural Funds."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, a year ago the Council decided to modify the Treaty on European Union inserting an important clarification into Article 130a, at the heart of the cohesion policy."
"The island regions, which are for obvious geographical reasons far from continental Europe and its internal market, were added to the list of the European Union's least favoured regions - regions therefore in need of special, focused help - because of a series of extra costs which nature imposes upon them."
"Finally the European Union acknowledged, on that happy occasion, what it had already acknowledged for other regions, such as the ultra-peripheral regions or the regions of the far north: the right to be treated and considered differently, an exception to the principle of uniformity of which it is often a victim."
"It acknowledged something that even the Court of Justice had ruled some time ago, that discrimination consists in treating different situations in an identical way."
"A year ago, the Council gave us a huge container to fill with ideas and constructive proposals, a container whose legal basis is the new text of Article 158 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and Declaration No 30 which is attached."
"The sides of this container are the common policies: agriculture, cohesion, fishing, energy and so on, but unfortunately it has a rather heavy lid which is delaying the implementation of the Treaty's provisions."
"This lid is represented by the Commission, which up to now has closed the door on the ideas of Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy."
"I hope that as from today it changes course."
"I do not want this House to open the controversy on the linguistic translation of Article 158 - the Committee on Regional Policy did not concern itself with this problem - and I leave that task to whoever is competent in this Parliament and possibly the Court of Justice."
"I would rather discuss giving concrete expression to Article 158."
"In fact, I am fully convinced of the correctness of the Italian translation, but I am not so convinced of the Commission's will to carry it through."
"If it is true, as it is true, for example, that Community regulations must comply with their primary legal source - that is, the Treaty -, I do not understand why the proposals for regulations on the reform of the Structural Funds, presented by the Commission on 18 March, do not refer to any insertion of that aspect of insularity which concerns 14 million European citizens."
"In fact, what is required is to apply the principle of equal opportunities to the island regions, through measures of positive discrimination which, in the last analysis, can compensate for the clear disparities in starting points, in agreement with the principle of economic and social cohesion which is at the basis of the construction of Europe."
"In my report I describe an integrated policy for the island regions, coordination managed by an 'Interservice Group' within the General Secretariat, inclusion in the new Interreg of a specific chapter for inter-island cooperation, a criterion for eligibility for the Structural Funds concerning the insular geo-economic factor, and an intermediate island tax zone between the continental and ultra-peripheral zones which already exist, allowing the island regions to compete on equal terms with all the other continental regions, if accompanied by valid financial incentive measures."
"In today's vote Parliament wishes to express its own conviction that the Union must make important and innovative decisions."
"These decisions will only be the product of Amsterdam if they go in the direction stated in the declaration attached to the Treaty, which recognizes the need for Community legislation to take into account the disadvantages imposed by the island handicap , with a view to adopting specific measures - if justified - in favour of these regions with the ultimate aim of integrating them more in the common market on equal terms."
"There are three key expressions."
"Firstly ""justified measures' could dismiss the doubts of those who fear a blind horizontal policy, indifferent to the diversities which exist between one island region and another and therefore for some are unjustified."
"Secondly, as regards ""equal terms' , if consequential logic exists, this leads to the admission of the existence of the basic unequal conditions which the island regions are subject to."
"Finally, the third concerns ""integration and the internal market' , a market which the island regions cannot yet fully exploit and from which at times they only suffer losses, caused by the unfair competition which nature imposes upon them."
"It is the Amsterdam Treaty which uses these expressions, not an islander like the rapporteur, who nonetheless obviously fully recognizes himself in this Treaty."
"Therefore, I ask for a correct ratification by the national governments, acceptance by the European Commission and speedy implementation, starting with the reform of the Structural Funds, competition policy and the common agricultural policy."
"The call from this House is not to isolate the islands, not to create a vacuum around lands which are the historical memory of our continent, but to enforce, in the final instance, the rights that the Treaty recognizes are ours."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection had no hesitation in presenting its opinion on such an important question as the social unfairness and lack of ecological sustainability suffered by the islands of the European Union."
"Islands - basically those with a population of 100 000 or less - suffer reduced competitiveness and offer fewer opportunities to their people and their industries. They end up being dependent on the dangerous monoculture of tourism."
"The small islands of an archipelago lack infrastructure and depend on imports for basic resources, energy, water, waste management and so on. In the summer, when their population increases three- or five-fold because of tourism, the scarce natural resources run out."
"The resulting ecological problems are sometimes beyond repair, as with waste for example. This means that sustainable development, one of the Union's main priorities, becomes mere fiction."
"Another serious inequality suffered by the small islands of an archipelago, such as Minorca, Ibiza or Formentera, is that they lack specialist medical facilities, to provide radiotherapy or adequate treatment for heart conditions and rheumatism, for example."
"So their inhabitants suffer a dual insularity, a double discrimination, since these conditions can only be treated on the larger islands. That means they have to travel, which adds even more suffering."
"Could anything be more unfair than that, Madam President?"
"I conclude, Madam President, with a request on behalf of my committee that small islands, where health and education suffer particularly, should be granted compensatory legal measures such as the provision of financial instruments, the application of incentives and fiscal exemptions and the inclusion of small island regions in Objective 1 until a specific programme can be prepared for them."
"In any case, small islands with a population of less than 100 000 should be treated as ultra-peripheral regions."
"That, Madam President, is something the Commission and the Council should think about."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Klaß for her excellent report and to say that the financial instrument for fisheries guidance, the FIFG, only represents about 1.5 to 2 % of the Structural Funds."
"Considering the importance of the fishing industry to the poorest and most peripheral regions of the Union, that is a lot less than adequate to meet its task."
"70 % of this money goes to Priority 1 regions which means that the remainder, going to Objective 5a and Objective 6, is a relatively small amount of money."
"In 1995 the position of this instrument was in marked contrast to the rest of the Structural Funds in that commitments reached 100 % but in 1996 the position was reversed with only 75 % of commitments, giving it at face value a much worse performance than the regional, social and agricultural structural fund."
"We do not have a clear explanation by the Commission of the position in the various regions but the Court of Auditors' report draws attention to the situation in greater detail."
"It seems that some Member States just do not take the fund seriously and I suspect it is because it is too small to meet any serious purpose."
"PESCA is a Community initiative designed to reduce the negative impact of restructuring the industry."
"The amount of money is about ECU 40m per year."
"The Commission report does not make clear the exact position in 1996."
"For the total programme up to 1996, 71 % had been committed and 14 % payments made."
"The Court of Auditors tells us that in 1996 91 % of the PESCA Fund had been committed and 43 % in payments."
"In relation to the PESCA Fund, I should just like to say that its purpose could be met more adequately in the general provisions of regional policy."
"It is too small, the general public is confused about its purpose and this makes it more difficult to administer."
"I do not agree with so much emphasis on the idea of additionality."
"Surely, within the framework of EMU, we should have a more balanced public spending programme in each Member State."
"The question of additionality in some cases could put pressure on Member States to overspend."
"Madam President, first of all I have a few comments regarding the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"To begin with, 1996 marks a turning point in the use of Structural Fund appropriations since, for the first time, we have recorded a very active year and this reveals a distinct improvement in the use of appropriations for commitments and payments, as compared with the last two years."
"This, then, is a good year in which to prepare for the reform of the Structural Funds in the framework of Agenda 2000."
"As draftsman, I would like to make a few remarks concerning the European Social Fund that are wholly encouraging and I would like to say that, with respect to both commitments and payments, we have been able to use up all the appropriations detailed in the budget for the first time."
"Nevertheless, in spite of everything, we need to qualify this asset, due to the fact that Objective 4 has proved difficult to apply on the ground and that take-up rates for Community initiatives remain inadequate."
"By way of example, we may cite the case of the ADAPT initiative, which does not square up fully with the expectations mentioned above, especially with regard to the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Now we know that there are those in Europe who are, first and foremost, job creators; but, nowadays, we must take account of the competition we face from the United States and we must therefore devote particular attention to such participation."
"These few comments echo the initial proposals for reforming the ESF, whereby future interventions would be combined under a single objective, designed to specifically support the European jobs strategy."
"Finally, I would like to note that the matter of partnership and its operation in practice is openly raised in this eighth report and it forces us to rethink the question of the composition and role of the monitoring committees by linking the place of social partners in a different way, especially bodies that work in the social field, in order to enhance their participation when this forthcoming reform is introduced."
"Madam President, these are the views of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, we in the Committee on the Environment consider that many of the Commission's commitment appropriations have been honoured, that payment appropriations have been advanced almost in full and that the balance between assistance for transport and for the environment has been maintained."
"However, we have a number of comments and one question which we would like to put to the Commissioner."
"First, as regards the payment appropriations for transport, clearly, all environmentally friendly modes of transport - railways, ports etcetera - have, shall we say, suffered an injustice in all the Member States, while tremendous importance has been attached to motorways, and we cannot agree with this."
"Secondly, we note that in terms of payment appropriations for the environment, tremendous importance has been attached to water supply and sewage systems, which is not of course a bad thing per se."
"However, we remain somewhat dissatisfied as regards the protection of nature and requirements under programmes such as NATURA 2000."
"Thirdly, the evaluation of work under Directive 85/337 and work of a more general nature is unsatisfactory."
"Environmental impact studies are carried out merely as a formality and the Commission fails, I think, to get to the heart of the matter."
"What do these studies say?"
"Have these studies been adhered to? And so on."
"Fourthly, we still attach great importance, Madam Commissioner, to the involvement of local authorities and non-governmental organizations in the drafting of studies and in the implementation of work."
"No progress has been made on this point and I think that progress here is needed."
"I would like to finish by putting a question to the Commissioner: we would like you to tell us, Madam Commissioner, if the Commission has carried out or is able to carry out a more general overall evaluation of investments and assistance through the Cohesion Fund, if the objectives of cohesion have been achieved, if environmental protection has improved etcetera, if possible, for each country."
"That would enable us to make a more general appraisal."
"Madam President, we have two very important reports before us today."
"The first, the report by Mrs Klaß, reviews the implementation of the Structural Funds in 1996."
"The second, by Mr Arias Cañete, reviews the Cohesion Fund in 1996."
"It is important that this Parliament takes its scrutiny and monitoring roles seriously as regard structural fund applications."
"It is only by looking backwards and correcting the mistakes of the past, that we can plan for the future, for more effective and targeted use of the EU structural fund resources."
"Today's debate is particularly relevant following on from yesterday's presentation by the British presidency of the forthcoming agenda items on the Cardiff summit where Member States will be asked to bring forward their employment action plans."
"They will be asked to address themselves to creating an effective and competitive EU economy where SMEs flourish and there is no place for red tape."
"It is precisely at this point that we should emphasize the role which the European Parliament and the structural and cohesion policies play in combating unemployment, protecting the environment, advancing equal opportunities and building a People's Europe while closing the gap between poorer and wealthier regions."
"Therefore, we say to the ministers in Cardiff, these are the objectives which should be at the heart of the reform process."
"We have vital tools in structural and cohesion policies."
"I would like to endorse Mrs Klaß' recommendations, in particular her call for enhanced monitoring and evaluation, improvement in financial management and the need for a more rapid transfer of funds to financial beneficiaries."
"It is simply not credible for EU funds to be paid out in some cases a year after projects have commenced."
"Late approvals and blockages in the flow of cash to projects threatens their very viability, creates uncertainty for those implementing projects and does not help the credibility of the European Union."
"Today I have a letter from my own county council in Derbyshire awaiting changes to be made by the Commission to financial tables before they can send out letters for approval for 98 projects on ESF."
"I know this is not specifically your area, Madam President, but it is about RECHAR, European Social Fund projects."
"It is no good sending out letters to start projects half way through the year and then expect that we can deliver those on time."
"We can do better on funds."
"We need in future to look at all the options of global grants, intermediary funding bodies, to speed up approvals to spend."
"We need to learn the lessons for the 2000-2006 programming period with better forward planning in all our programme areas."
"We need a strengthened and solid partnership with strong involvement of local partners which can help in delivery."
"Finally, I agree with the paragraph in Mrs Klaß' report on the Community initiative that Parliament indicated to the Commission its guidelines on the financial envelope of the initiatives and the allocation of the reserve in March 1996, in particular in respect to the RECHAR, RETEX, KONVER and peace initiatives."
"It is important that the Commission acknowledges these guidelines in reports."
"Otherwise, we will think that the Commission does not intend to apply them."
"To Mr Viola, I would say that the we in the Socialist Group take seriously the challenges of the island regions but we simply cannot accept 25 new amendments without prior discussion in committee."
"That is an abuse of the committee system."
"Madam President, there is a lot of money at stake in the reports presented by Mr Arias Cañete, Mrs Klaß and Mr Viola, and indeed in the countless other reports which we have been working on for months in the Committee on Regional Policy. This money is being redistributed from the pockets of citizens who live in the better-off countries - and I am deliberately not referring to the net contributors - to fund projects in the less wealthy and structurally underdeveloped Member States."
"When organizing this redistribution we need to observe a few basic principles, which being few are all the more important for it."
"The first is that the purpose of European cohesion, namely the support of the weaker, must be beyond dispute."
"This means genuine solidarity, which is one of the fundamental principles of our Community."
"The second is that we must be very careful about how we handle money from the Cohesion Fund."
"Parliament takes its role as a monitor here very seriously indeed and calls on the Member States to do likewise."
"The third is that European solidarity is indivisible."
"This means that it is not something to be called upon just by a few, or even monopolized."
"We have to retain our solidarity with the southern European nations, while the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe also need our solid support, for this is in all our interests."
"Fourthly, we should not demand too much of the contributors."
"At a time when unemployment figures are high, even in the wealthier Member States, and budget funds low, these arrangements have to be handled very carefully."
"In this connection I would particularly warn against excessive demands, for these will inevitably produce a backlash."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, the subjects of our debate are important for regional policy: Mrs Klaß' report on the Structural Funds and Mr Arias Cañete's report on the Cohesion Fund, both for 1996."
"I should like to repeat that when we talk about these aspects of regional policy and cohesion funds, we are talking about 34 % of the EU's budget."
"I shall limit myself to saying that I think the Arias Cañete report is positive, as regards its subject, that is, the funds for 1996."
"I shall not consider the future of the Structural Funds, which we shall be talking about in future part-sessions of this Parliament."
"As regards Mr Viola's report, I would like to say that I think it is very important to pay attention to the problems experienced by islands."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam now mentions the structural disadvantages of islands, especially with respect to water supplies, energy, education, health and transport."
"Regional policy should take islands' problems into consideration."
"In that sense, the Commission should allow special transport aid to make up for the disadvantages suffered by people who live on islands, especially the smaller islands."
"The Member States should also take the principle of insularity into account in their fiscal measures. Otherwise, if people living on islands continue to suffer these disadvantages because of their special situation it will be impossible to have a Europe which is the same for all its citizens."
"As Mr Viola said, I think this report is about implementing the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam in relation to island status."
"To bring Europe closer to island-dwelling citizens will mean bringing Europe closer to all the citizens of the Union too."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of our debate might be viewed as insular, it is certainly one that stands on its own."
"I am personally aware of the expressions of interest that the various political groups in our House have shown in the report by our colleague Mr Viola, to whom I extend my warm and sincere congratulations, not only for the excellent work he has done but also for the spirit of unity he has imbued, in close cooperation, amongst all European partners of island origin."
"The report submitted to you seeks to show that we must not allow the Union to disintegrate at the periphery."
"Yet this is the risk run by island regions, given the socio-economic factors that define those areas."
"Up until now, only island regions on the outer periphery have elicited a general and natural concern on the part of the European Union with regard to their problems, in recognition of the handicap they face due to their remoteness."
"Other regions have benefited from Community interventions when delays in development so obviously justified the allocation of major Structural Funds."
"In fact, and this is the main point of our debate, these regions have never been perceived strictly and specifically in terms of their insularity."
"A changes in the Community approach to the problems in those regions has been slow."
"I should remind you that by virtue of the concentration principle and in applying rigid, technical guidelines, the Commission plans to exclude islands such as Sardinia and Corsica from the new Objective 1."
"We must note how few island regions in Europe will be regarded from 1999 as regions in which development is slow and which therefore require special structural aid."
"There is obviously a paradox between the political will of the European Union, reflected in an amendment to the Maastricht Treaty, leading to a genuine institutional recognition of island regions in the new Amsterdam Treaty and an approach which consists in depriving those regions of the resources they require for development at the earliest opportunity and incorporating them in a European area earmarked for expansion."
"How are we to conceive of Community regional planning from an exclusively continental standpoint?"
"Island regions, which suffer from a variety of handicaps on the economic, social and human fronts, due to trading difficulties, need us to examine different approaches of a suitable nature within the context of a genuine integrated policy."
"Their future depends on it, as does economic and social cohesion, which is a highly cherished principle in the European Union."
"I would like to stress, on this occasion, the fundamental importance, in my view, of multilateral cooperation between island regions."
"In conclusion, I believe that island regions clearly illustrate the challenge posed for Europe as a whole, which is to move towards a stronger Community, which is developed more harmoniously and which has greater solidarity."
"Over and above the legal and economic aspects, this is a political imperative which I invite you to share and support."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this joint debate I should like to emphasize further - as the Viola report does - the need to take the problems of the island regions into account and to adapt Community policies to their particular characteristics with more flexibility."
"However, we must be careful to distinguish island regions from ultra-peripheral islands and regions, as indeed the Treaty revised in Amsterdam very properly does."
"I should also like to associate myself more closely with the conclusions of the Klaß report on Structural Funds in 1996, which makes it clear that the budget has been better implemented generally, achieving around 98 % of its commitments, but which also calls for more and better information on the proper application of the principle of additionality by some Member States."
"For that reason I am obliged to concentrate the House's attention on the Arias Cañete report on the Cohesion Fund for 1996."
"I do not so much to the rapporteur's proposals, which I think deserve universal acceptance, although I do not agree with the way in which the question of conditionality is approached at times here, but more especially because of the present political importance of four of the amendments proposed by our German colleague in the PPE."
"To propose, as the Member does, that the European Parliament should consider limiting the benefits of the future Cohesion Fund to those Member States which at present are parties to the cohesion agreement but have not joined the euro, that is to say to try to exclude Spain, Ireland and Portugal from the Cohesion Fund in future, is not only an attempt to subvert the legal basis of the Treaty itself, but confirms that in this House there are Members for whom economic and social cohesion are mere figures of rhetoric which must bow to the reigning financial and monetarist interests."
"I sincerely hope this House will reject any such amendments clearly and by a large majority."
"The very fact that they have been proposed, however, is a politically unacceptable act which goes against the purposes of solidarity and should therefore be roundly condemned."
"If by chance the amendments were to be approved, which of course I do not believe they will, we should have reason to wonder where this European Union of ours is going and what has become of the concepts of cohesion and solidarity between its peoples and its Member States."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, equal living standards for all will not just be achieved by reducing everything to the same level."
"We have learned from the reports on both the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds that while a great deal of money has been paid out, we are still failing to promote sustainable development in the regions in spite of the level of aid being applied; in fact, quite the reverse, for the balance is showing a deficit."
"We now have rising unemployment, the destruction of ecosystems - which for centuries have sustained all our economic activity - and the centralization of market systems which are destroying economic relations at regional level."
"It is a matter of great urgency that both the Commission and the Member States should now effectively comply with the requirement contained in the Structural Fund regulation for the sustainable development of the regions."
"We need to remedy this situation now and not wait until the year 2000."
"This means that the Commission should not just be filling up its filing cabinets with its latest proposals on job creation, the environment and local employment initiatives, but should be calling for the effective implementation of these measures for the efficient use of European funds in the Member States."
"The call for the continuance of the Cohesion Fund cannot be met unless there is a radical change in the way the Fund is managed. We need support for local development structures, the participation of local people, communities and initiatives, the promotion of biodiversity and the protection of the green network Natura 2000."
"Every day we read that EU funding is helping to destroy the unique treasures of Europe's natural and cultural landscape; this is not only a disgrace, it is a scandal, particularly as it is taking place under the nose of the Commission which, in spite of everything, is doing nothing about it."
"This money must be immediately reclaimed by the Commission."
"It is now time to stop turning a blind eye to what is going on."
"Sustainable development should mean preserving local potential, not participating in its permanent destruction."
"Madam President, I would like to make one or two points about islands in particular and also about the significance of the debates we are having on Mr Viola's excellent report for Agenda 2000."
"This is the background to the discussion."
"As we move towards the end of this year and into next year we will have some very important decisions to take."
"They are all about making Europe more acceptable to the citizens, whether they live in the remote islands or the larger islands and whatever their location."
"If you look round Europe you can see Scotland with its hundred islands, you can go through the Åland Archipelago between Finland and Sweden and you will see one island after another."
"You can go to the larger islands such as Sardinia."
"Each has its own different problems: each is particular."
"The map of each island is engraved in the minds of those who live on that particular island."
"It would be tempting to say that they do not have common problems but I believe they do."
"The common problems are those of remoteness and transport disadvantage."
"In many cases this is compounded by smallness of size."
"A small island cannot achieve the economies of scale which would allow the prosperity which Europe hopes will spread right across the territory."
"So a special compensation has to be built in for island living, for the extra costs of administration, health care and so on. These are important items to build into our Agenda 2000 discussions."
"I would argue that it is important, if we accept that there are particular problems for islands, that these should not necessarily be measured by vast areas crudely lumped together and measured for unemployment or percentages of GDP."
"If we could be a bit more sophisticated I believe we have a chance of making a success of the imminent discussions."
"To sum up, I believe that the euro project is going to provide the integration for Europe."
"We now need to provide the compensation for the disadvantaged regions."
"Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteurs on their reports."
"I am extremely pleased that in the area of cohesion funding, in particular structural funding, there has been an improvement in the take-up of funds."
"To most people a shortfall in take-up represents problems with bureaucracy in their area, rather than a lack of applications for funding."
"It is therefore pleasing that this old problem seems to be in the process of being resolved."
"I fully support Mrs Klaß in her view that the annual report should include information on the transmission of funds to final beneficiaries."
"When so much of European Union funds are involved, it is important that we see where it goes and how it is spent."
"As a member of Parliament's Regional Affairs Committee, I am always encouraged by the emphasis which the committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Cañete, places on the partnership principle."
"This is generally accepted as the way forward for the distribution of European Union funding for its programmes."
"It is therefore essential that it is properly implemented in all Member States."
"Failure to develop it fully will amount to a failure in the way in which we spend money on the ground."
"I want to see the fullest possible involvement of local economic and social partners, including locally elected political representatives."
"It is by this means that the general public will be able to identify with the European Union and the work in their constituencies."
"Although the Eighth Annual Report specifically deals with 1996 and the current programming period, it is inevitable that we look at it in the context of the future for structural funding in general."
"It would also be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to say to the Commission that, as we move towards the reform and Agenda 2000 in 1999, the rigid criterion of 75 % of GDP is not only unreasonable, it will be difficult for many regions to accept."
"Substantial amounts of funding have been going to many areas."
"The cohesion funding has given certain areas a particular advantage."
"But it has worked to the disadvantage of those areas that are in close proximity to cohesion areas."
"They have not had that access or opportunity."
"Areas such as my own were dependent to a large extent on European Union funding to stand still, never mind move forward."
"I have to say to the Commission that it must revisit my area and look at it again."
"It must take up the challenge presented by those areas which have not been able to develop, such as my own, because of circumstances."
"Especially after what happened last week, namely the very strong referendum vote by the people in my area to move to a new position, to look for new opportunities, I appeal to the Commission at this time to support us in that area."
"Madam President, the National Alliance and I in particular are aware of the disadvantages of the island regions, and in accordance with our position in matters of economic and social cohesion, we are very concerned for the future of the islands, if the reform of the Structural Funds is approved without substantial changes."
"The islands suffer from structural disadvantages which in the long term end up having a negative effect on their economic and social development."
"With the reform of the Structural Funds, whose main points are set out in Agenda 2000, particular importance has been given to the principle of concentration and, please note, among the various territories which will be disqualified from the Objective 1 programme are many islands."
"It emerges from this that if the reform is adopted as shown in the Commission's communication, only a few islands will from part of Objective 1: this means that the island territories will be considered to be regions which do not require particular structural assistance."
"This is nonsense and it also appears that the experts in the European Commission who have worked on the reform of the Structural Funds have not read the new Amsterdam Treaty, which provides for the specific nature of island regions either through a rewriting of Article 130a or through the attached declaration."
"The Commission is therefore asked to review its position on this point, and provide room for the island regions within Objective 1, apart from their GDP, because a close and conscientious examination of the situation should show that there are not only macroeconomic reasons but above all different reasons which are of a geo-economic nature."
"In addition, the Commission should review, for this specific case, its policy for state aid, taking into account for island regions their fragility and their particular geo-strategic importance because they are on the periphery."
"In addition to that, a series of fiscal and financial incentives should be introduced to benefit the island regions. Finally, particular importance should be given to preventing damage to and safeguarding the environment, with appropriate measures to exploit the enormous potential of the regions in question."
"Mr President, we have before us three important and good reports."
"As regards Mrs Klaß' report on the Structural Funds, I would just like to say that all the measures aimed at transparency and control in the application of the Funds can count on our full support."
"As regards Mr Viola's report on islands, allow me to pay tribute to that report by associating myself, word for word, with my colleague Carmen Díez de Rivera Icaza's excellent speech."
"I do not think I could add any more skilled or positive comments, and that makes me feel very proud."
"As for Mr Arias Cañete's report, I must say I think it is balanced, positive and very good. However, it is accompanied by several amendments which I think make up the political substance we have to clarify in this debate."
"I am not going to waste time - which I do not have anyway - by saying how good the Cohesion Fund is, and what important effects it has had. I just want to say that we are going to support Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 by Mr Berend, who is unfortunately not listening to me although he is here."
"However, we would ask him to withdraw Amendment No 4 because we are talking about the Cohesion Fund for this period. So we are going to support Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 which state that we are talking about the period up to 1999."
"But I would earnestly call on him to withdraw his Amendment No 4, since we are not making a decision on a future debate."
"Agenda 2000 lies ahead of us, and the relevant decision can be made in a peaceful and proper manner. If we manage to get that amendment withdrawn, I think this report will have all the qualitative and positive ingredients it needs."
"Mr President, in his report Mr Cañete has very carefully evaluated how the Cohesion Fund was implemented for the 1996 financial year."
"There is no denying the success of the Cohesion Fund."
"Infrastructure has been decisively improved."
"As far as the environment is concerned, financing has continued to concentrate on water supply and treatment projects and, to a lesser extent, on waste treatment."
"The essential purpose of the Cohesion Fund, namely to promote economic and social cohesion, has so far been achieved, as witnessed by the increase in per capita income over the last ten years."
"This is borne out by the fact that Ireland, Portugal and Spain are to join monetary union in the first wave, while Greece is also well on its way to joining."
"That is all I have to say regarding the annual report for 1996 and its evaluation."
"In some aspects of the resolution the rapporteur has tried - although in my opinion this was not part of his remit - to keep all four current beneficiary Member States in the Cohesion Fund beyond the year 1999."
"Regrettably, I cannot agree to this."
"Solidarity also means not demanding or approving any more aid than is absolutely necessary."
"Madam President, I congratulate Mr Viola on his report."
"I am particularly pleased that my group, the Union for Europe Group, played an important part in ensuring that this vitally important matter is the subject of a report from the Regional Affairs Committee."
"For that I thank my friend and colleague Mr Baggioni."
"The fact that the island regions are at last specifically mentioned in the Amsterdam Treaty is a major victory for all those concerned and the Commission must now come up with substantial proposals for these island regions and the current reform of the Structural Funds."
"The Commission can be assured that my group and the Regional Affairs Committee and others will be most supportive of the proposals when they come on stream."
"While I recognize that the problems of Corsica, Sardinia and some of the Greek islands are very specific, I would also like the Commission to recognize that there are small islands in my own country that could and should be considered for specific Community action."
"The problems encountered on these islands, notably off the south-west and west coast of Ireland are not acceptable by any Community standard."
"They too deserve serious consideration in the ongoing reforms."
"On the Cañete report, there is cause for satisfaction."
"The budget for 1996 was fully implemented and no case of fraud was reported."
"I am extremely pleased that no initiatives were taken on the environment sector and the reference period projects relating to coastal erosion are notable, something I have been advocating for a long time."
"In this context, I pay tribute to the Irish Government for a whole series of actions it has taken in this sector."
"This has to be a good omen for the future of the Cohesion Fund which has played and will continue to play a vitally important role for the participating countries."
"Finally, I attach the utmost importance to the contribution of the European Parliament to the reform of the Cohesion Fund in the coming months."
"At this stage in the procedure it will be up to us, the Members, to ensure that the participating nations get the best possible deal to ensure that they can continue and, in some cases complete, the ongoing good work in the environment and transport infrastructure."
"I thank the Commissioner for her work in this area."
"Madam President, Mrs Klaß has produced an excellent and thorough report on the Commission's annual report on Structural Funds, for which I thank her wholeheartedly."
"It is clearly evident from both the Commission's report and Mrs Klaß' report that there are problems in how to use Structural Fund resources to best effect."
"According to the Commission's preliminary budget for 1999, spending commitments are set to increase by a massive 17.8 %, which bears no relation to the budget's growth in general, a commitment of 6.5 %."
"At the same time the difference between committed spending and actual spending has grown to 7.8 billion euros, that is to say, actual spending is more than 20 % below the figure for commitments."
"This means that considerable appropriations have to be used the following year for spending commitments from the planning stage."
"Mrs Klaß and the Committee on Regional Policy kindly included in their report points raised by the Committee on Budgets, which stressed - in points 4 and 5 of the report - the need for simplicity in administering Structural Funds, a clarification of the sharing of responsibility, and an appraisal of whether there is a reasonable link between the costs of administering Structural Funds and the money to be spent."
"The hallmark of Structural Fund administration is sluggishness and bureaucracy."
"In addition, the size of the administrative machine does not always accord with the sum of money to be spent."
"Furthermore, comments on the vagueness surrounding the use of Structural Funds testify not only to the complicated nature of the administrative process but to a lack of clarity in the area of who is responsible for what."
"Rationalization of the administrative process and clarification on the sharing of responsibility are the most important issues to address as we pass into the new planning stage, and this is one of the greatest changes facing my worthy colleague, Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"The accumulation of funds in recent years, the so-called snowball effect, has been a continual source of worry for the Committee on Budgets."
"There have been serious difficulties in drafting the budget, where one main area grows threefold while other areas suffer."
"That was the case, for example, last Autumn, when 550 million euros had to be cut from other areas."
"It was this snowball effect that the Committee on Budgets wished to bring to everyone's attention in its report, and it thus proposed Amendments Nos 2 and 3."
"I would hope that Parliament will approve them, as it did Amendments Nos 3 and 4."
"Mr President, the reports being debated this morning are all very important, and to my mind the Viola report on the problems of island regions is especially important."
"When talking about these regions, reference is often made to the need to adopt specific measures to compensate for the disadvantages they suffer compared with mainland regions."
"Nevertheless, although recognized as necessary, such measures are far from substantive, except for those agreed for the ultra-peripheral island regions."
"There will have to be a change of attitude when the Funds are reformed."
"Fourteen million EU citizens live on islands and suffer the constant effects of these disadvantages on their daily lives, in matters of employment, education, health and quality of life."
"The seriousness of these problems demands that geographical and economic factors, such as a region's remote position or island status, be taken into account during the forthcoming reform of the Structural Funds, if we want to see an end to inequality between central and peripheral regions."
"If that inequality continues, it will confirm the division between first and second class European citizens."
"If the reform of the Funds is implemented as it is, that division will be ensured."
"The Viola report is an attempt to avoid that."
"My group supports all the report's proposals for improving the situation in island regions."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Viola on his fine report."
"It is important that we should both pay attention to the EUʼs islands and archipelagos and their special problems, and that we should realize that the problems are considerable, but extremely diverse."
"The problems experienced in the Greek archipelago are markedly different from those facing the islands off Scotland or in the Baltic Sea."
"This applies especially to the landscape and climate."
"I myself come from Sweden, the country with the largest number of islands in the EU."
"For decades we have been struggling to keep the archipelagos alive and to make it possible both to live and earn a living there."
"Major problems for us are depopulation and the absence of sustainable, long-term development."
"We want to see more development programmes and more interregional cooperation aimed at easing the situation of the islands."
"However, we do not believe that the islands should receive special treatment within the framework of future policy on the Structural Funds."
"That would simply lead to a flood of demands from different sectional interests and areas."
"We therefore believe that the 75 % threshold should be retained."
"The situation of the islands is, in fact, a prime example of the need for the EUʼs Structural Fund policy to be supplemented with regional support at national level for those areas not covered by EU subsidies."
"Otherwise, certain areas will be totally neglected, while others receive aid from both the EU and national governments."
"We also believe that in Agenda 2000 the Commission must allow the Member States to authorize national, regional aid to those areas - such as the islands - that are not covered by aid under the EUʼs Structural Funds."
"Anything else would be unacceptable."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, it was recognized at the Amsterdam Summit that the development of the island regions of Europe is affected by differences and problems which they have in common."
"Today, Mr Viola is presenting us with a proposal for an integrated policy for the island regions. I congratulate him and thank him for his work."
"His proposal incorporates and develops the concept of regaining a balance between regions, and calls on the Commission to include in Agenda 2000 macroeconomic factors and geographical and economic criteria such as a region's remote position or island status."
"The island regions of Europe are different but have problems in common, particularly with regard to the transport of people and goods."
"Businesses located on islands, most of them SMEs, have difficulty competing in the single market on equal terms, since ports and airports are their only link to the mainland and other islands."
"We islanders need our regions to grow in qualitative terms and we need to create jobs. So we are asking for support for the development of new technologies and communications."
"Tourism is a good source of income for many island regions. However, we islanders do not live in the hotels, but work in them."
"The service sector needs to become less dependent on the seasons. We need to develop alternative forms of tourism, and there must be plenty of training to allow us to be competitive."
"I know the Commissioner will remind me that the Balearic Islands, which I represent in this Parliament, have been developed for tourism."
"But, Madam Commissioner, our island regions are fragile in terms of sustainable development, the environment and waste treatment."
"We have problems with water, and are highly dependent on others for energy."
"Archipelagos also have small islands which are particularly disadvantaged with respect to education and health."
"Does the Commission realize how difficult it is and how much the regional administrations have to pay in island regions to give their citizens the same quality of services as people enjoy on the mainland?"
"Our problems can be solved if the Commission, with the support of our national governments, implements a plan of action, within the framework of Agenda 2000, to apply Community legislation based on the principle of equal opportunities."
"Madam President, Ireland is a good example of the effective use of Structural Funds."
"In the present programme Ireland is assessed as a single unit for funding."
"There is now, however, a very strong case for regionalization in Ireland for the next round of Structural Fund monies."
"Some regions in Ireland are clearly out-performing other regions in terms of economic performance and therefore all regions cannot and must not be put into the same bracket for the next tranche of structural fund money."
"Figures recently produced from the Central Statistics Office clearly show that the midland region was below 75 % of the average EU standard of living."
"Therefore, the case for granting Objective 1 status to the midland region for the period 2000 to 2006 is both real and compelling and beyond reproach."
"If Objective 1 status was accorded to the midland region, it would develop as a region on the back of the infrastructural improvements such as the Portlaoise bypass, so as to attract more investment and create more jobs."
"Mr President, I would like to say how pleased I am that this report, probably for the first time in the history of the European Parliament, takes special account of our northern Member Statesʼ archipelagos, that is to say the archipelagos of south-western Finland, Åland and Sweden."
"In particular, I would like to mention recital E in the resolution, in which divided archipelagos and ice conditions are mentioned."
"I would like to extend heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur for the understanding that he shows with regard to this archipelago, a region that belongs to our unique heritage, which we have a collective duty to protect, and which can only preserve its character if people are able to work and live there."
"In Finland we have for decades endeavoured to pursue an active policy with regard to the archipelago by allocating responsibilities to special bodies."
"Point 7 relating to the ""Interservice Group' is therefore important."
"It is also important that the Commission should rapidly take steps to guarantee that states are able to extend enterprise and transport aid to the island regions."
"Delays, Madam Commissioner, could prove fatal to a living archipelago."
"Moreover, I hope that the special attention which the report pays to small-scale farming activities on the islands, which cannot be expanded, will also be taken into consideration."
"Mr President, I want to draw people's attention to something happening here today which they might find surprising."
"Almost all the speakers are talking about the Viola report which, objectively speaking, is much less important than the Arias Cañete report on the Cohesion Fund or the Klaß report on the Structural Funds."
"That shows just how important the islands are, and I think Mrs Wulf-Mathies will be taking note."
"The Viola report is an excellent report, as has already been said."
"It describes the reality of island life very well, and proposes constructive solutions which I hope the Commission will take into consideration."
"I particularly want to draw attention to recital E, which contains an almost exhaustive description of the realities of island life. I do not think it would be possible to come up with a better description."
"I want to point out that some of the European Union's most important achievements hardly operate or do not operate in the islands. I am thinking of the achievements relating to the single market or the free movement of persons, as well as some of the most attractive projects, such as the trans-European networks."
"Mrs Wulf-Mathies, the only serious objection we have come up with during recent debates on an integral and specific policy for the islands is based on budgetary considerations. Undoubtedly, that is a very important objection, but many of the measures being demanded involve no cost to the EU budget, for example state aid, such as specific fiscal and economic policies."
"Madam Commissioner, I am sure you are sensitive to these issues and that you will be able to convince your less sensitive Commission colleagues, such as Mr Monti or Mr Van Miert, about these specific measures which the islands demand."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs, Mr Klaß, Mr Arias Cañete and Mr Viola on their reports."
"I would like to comment, as an islander, on Mr Viola's report, which is excellent and should be used as a basis for further action."
"Thanks to the question and vote passed by the European Parliament last May and coordinated efforts by Member States and island agencies, we succeeded in including special provision for the specific problems faced by islands in article 130a of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"In addition, a protocol was attached to the Treaty."
"These provisions could form the basis for the application of an integrated policy for the islands."
"However, the Commission seems unwilling to translate this potential into specific measures and policies."
"That is why we, as the European Parliament, must use our position and status to do whatever we can to overcome these obstacles."
"I think we can do so by highlighting the following points."
"Firstly, we need to include a new sub-programme in the Interreg Community initiative devoted entirely to island regions and to further promote trans-island cooperation."
"Secondly, we must introduce compensatory measures to offset the additional cost of transporting passengers, freight and energy to and from the islands."
"Thirdly, we should introduce alternative fiscal measures which take account of the special nature of the islands in these regions and encourage local economies by introducing tax incentives."
"Fourthly, we need to support Community action and programmes to develop renewable sources of energy."
"And finally, we need priority cofinancing from the Commission to buy emergency means of transport to provide fast links between islands and other islands or mainland areas in the event of an emergency."
"Mr President, in welcoming Mrs Klaß' report, I endorse both the Commission's view that 1996 was the first year in which the current structural fund programme was fully operational and the rapporteur's view that provisional good marks can be awarded for the first time since 1994."
"However, in a debate being held in May 1998, surely the benefit of time can allow us to draw a wider conclusion about what happens when the programme in effect starts three years late."
"We have long lead times for planning and negotiation followed by rushed decisions concerning spending and implementation, consistently late payments both to Member States, regions and individual projects."
"In Brussels underspends are seen as a lack of need rather than a lack of efficient administration."
"Altogether there is a corrosive effect on expectations, breeding cynicism rather than public support for some of Europe's most important work."
"Therefore, I hope that this morning we will recommit ourselves to both ensuring that the budget for the current structural fund programme is fully committed in the 1999 budget, fully honouring the Edinburgh Agreement, and that everything possible is done to ensure that the new programming period from 2000 onwards starts on time."
"The alternative will be a domino effect in which all the problems of delay continue for seven more years, blighting the achievements of programmes of which we should be justifiably proud."
"I hope we will get a clear commitment from the Commissioner this morning in this respect."
"I hope too that she will offer support for the Community initiatives and the innovative projects which, as the report points out, represent 70 % of the total underspends."
"We are all aware of her desire to streamline these expenditures but it is right to point out once again that these are some of the most effective, most visible and most direct forms of European aid to our regions and localities."
"It is the difficulties of administration in Brussels rather than the lack of effect on the ground which is besetting their progress."
"Mr President, as Mr Fernández Martín said earlier, most of the speeches this morning have addressed the Viola report, which shows this Parliament's sensitivity to the island regions."
"I should like to point out that certain island regions already have a distinct, special treatment. These are the ultra-peripheral regions, which are already recognized, even in the new text of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in Article 299(2) of the modified text."
"Apart from these ultra-peripheral regions, the island regions are areas within the European Union which are differentiated and experience certain difficulties."
"The new Article 130a of the Treaty of Amsterdam already introduces a legislative point, and a declaration made at the Amsterdam Conference also goes in the same direction."
"But I think it is right to have that differentiated treatment."
"Such treatment has to compensate these regions for their island situation."
"It is a treatment which assumes that these island regions experience difficulties as a result of the lack of a land bridge."
"In other words, the image we have of the European Union is of a continent, but that ignores the fact that there is a whole series of island regions which experience difficulties."
"I think Mr Viola's proposals are fairly positive in general. I would like to draw attention to the proposals aimed at promoting communications and transport, and especially the application of all the new communications network technologies which offer a solution to certain problems."
"So I want to congratulate Mr Viola, as well as Mrs Díez de Rivera Icaza and Mr Gallagher for the contributions from their respective committees. I hope the Commission will take these initiatives into account in order to prepare concrete programmes to compensate the island regions for these disadvantages."
"Mr President, Mr Viola's own-initiative report seeks to underline the particularly sensitive situation the island regions find themselves in."
"One outcome of the Amsterdam Summit was the addition to the Treaty of a declaration on the economic and social development of islands, which are in, what is in many ways, an unfavourable position."
"The island regions are ecologically sensitive areas."
"They are subject to all kinds of pressures. A balance has to be struck between the living conditions of their permanent populations and increasing tourism."
"Owing to rapidly ageing populations, the traditional island occupations of fishing and farming have declined."
"If island youth is not tempted to stay at home, not only will unique island cultures disappear but valuable cultural heritages will be lost."
"As the report states, a stimulus to development founded on the unique identity of the island regions themselves is the only way to check the exodus among young people."
"It is unfortunate, however, that Mr Viola's report did not cover all the island regions in need of assistance."
"Examples include the vast inhabited archipelago between Finland and Sweden, and the islands in the lake districts of eastern and central Finland."
"The island regions are very sparsely populated in cold climates, and in winter they are cut off due to frozen waters."
"These regions should definitely be included along with the Union's Structural Fund reforms in the creation of a new objective programme, one in which the island regions would figure in the highest aid bracket, that is, 75 % of the total cost of a project."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that if this morning we review the history of these reports, we should again come back to the question of why we have a structural policy in the first place."
"Can we say that the gap between rich and poor, which is probably one of the reasons why we have a structural and regional policy, really closed during the course of 1996?"
"What about the 18 million unemployed?"
"What about the dozens of millions of people who are living below the poverty line in this rich continent of Europe?"
"This is something which we pay too little attention to in our structural and regional policies, and the Commission is one of the main culprits here."
"Secondly, Mrs Klaß established in her report that there has been a considerable increase in fraud in the area of structural funding, a fourfold rise, to be exact."
"In the relevant report on fraud prevention for 1996, the Commission stated that 50 % of the irregularities were caused by the failure to submit proper documents and proof of expenditure."
"But I have to do that every time I go on a business trip!"
"We are even being criticized for this at the moment."
"It works for us."
"And then what about the recovery process?"
"It is interesting to note that those countries which are complaining loudest at the moment about how their net balance will look in the new Agenda 2000 - in other words, well into the red - are the very ones which do not look too clever when it comes to recovery and to this type of fraud prevention."
"Here I am referring in particular to Germany, which has only actually collected ECU 900 000 of the ECU 14m due for recovery."
"I would just advise the Finance Ministers of the countries concerned to focus their concerns not just on the size of these contributions but also on how they are being used."
"Then we would be getting somewhere."
"Madam Commissioner, I hope that we can include these areas not just by saying that we need a little more control, but by making our structural policies a little more watertight in the coming years as far as fraud is concerned."
"These reports, for which I heartily congratulate the rapporteurs, would then take us a step further down the road of European policy-making."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, we ought not to forget that the purpose of the Cohesion Fund is to contribute to the fight against social and territorial disparities. It was created out of the need to support the efforts of its beneficiary states to meet the convergence criteria defined as conditions for joining the single currency."
"Nor have those social and territorial disparities been eliminated - despite the progress that has been made - nor will the budgetary restrictions we have agreed disappear with the single currency, which is why we must keep the Cohesion Fund after 1999."
"In the context of the present Cohesion Fund, however, it is important to prevent adverse effects, particularly those of over-concentration in the most highly-developed regions of the beneficiary Member States."
"If we are to overcome territorial disparities, we must fight those which actually exist within each state."
"So it is encouraging that the Cohesion Fund has at last reached the ultra-peripheral regions, for example, as a result of this House's repeated efforts to call attention to their needs."
"It has reached some of them, but not all of them."
"It has not reached the Azores, in spite of the enormous sums that region needs to invest in the environment and transport, jointly with the Cohesion Fund."
"This fact is all the more relevant inasmuch as in Portugal 55 % of the finance from the Fund has up to now been concentrated in its most highly-developed region."
"We have got to change this situation."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Arias Cañete on the excellent report he has produced on this subject."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, we have before us three interesting reports which give us a very illuminating insight into the islands and the position regarding Structural Funds."
"However, one comment needs to be made."
"In 1996 the rate of application of Structural Funds increased, but in future it will be necessary to speed up and simplify their allocation and make them easier to use."
"Another point is that my own country, Portugal, has the highest rate of absorption and use of Structural Funds."
"Thanks to aid from the Structural Funds, the Portuguese economy has grown by 4 % in the last year, and will grow by around 5 % this year."
"But the territory of Portugal as a whole is below the 75 % level."
"For that reason, the proposals contained in Agenda 2000 must not penalize Portugal and take away a slice of the funds it now receives, because that would be unfair and morally wrong."
"Virtue should be rewarded, and therefore Portugal should go on receiving Structural Funds at their present level in the next Community aid programme."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate is not a fundamental discussion on whether or not to retain the Cohesion Fund beyond 1999."
"Mr Cañete's report, which in itself was a very good piece of work, is the 1996 annual review of the Commission's report for this period."
"This means that it should be, and indeed is, an analysis and critical assessment of the latter, combined with relevant conclusions on the efficient use of funds in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Let us then not anticipate the revision of the Structural Funds and the review of the Cohesion Funds, which will surely go hand in hand with it."
"This 1996 report is not the appropriate place for such deliberations. The amendment which we have proposed, and which was tabled on behalf of my group, can really only be understood from this perspective."
"I therefore also reject the comment which Mr Novo made some while ago as completely unjustified."
"What now appears in these clauses goes well beyond the limits of a 1996 report and should be presented at some later date, not as part of this report."
"I am of the opinion, however, that with the rapporteur we have found acceptable solutions to this problem."
"Mr President, I will confine myself to just one island - the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England - the favourite holiday island of Queen Victoria."
"It is still a beautiful holiday destination and you are all welcome to visit it."
"My constituency of half a million people is approximately three-quarters from the mainland of Hampshire and one-quarter from the Isle of Wight."
"Hampshire is prosperous."
"GDP is over 100 % of the European average."
"Unemployment is 2 %."
"It is a great county with great people."
"The Isle of Wight similarly has great people but GDP is just 67 % of the European average."
"Unemployment is 20 %."
"It is the poorest district in England but has no European Objective 1 funding because, statistically, it is measured with Hampshire."
"Why is it so poor?"
"It is an island separated from the mainland by just five kilometres of water."
"We are not ultra-peripheral but being an island makes all the difference."
"I welcome the reference to islands in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I thank Mr Viola for his report."
"The British government, the Council of Ministers and the Commission do not want to take any action on Clause 158 of the Treaty."
"It is up to Parliament in this report to push for the Treaty to be honoured and for the islands to be helped."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, very briefly, in the minute I have available, I first want to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Arias Cañete, Mr Viola and Mrs Klaß, on their magnificent reports, and reiterate once again that the Cohesion Fund was created to achieve not monetary union, but economic and social cohesion. So until that has been achieved, the Cohesion Fund will still be needed."
"In other words, we need to achieve so-called true or real convergence. In the words of the Treaty, while Member States have a per capita GNP which is lower than 90 % of the Community average, we will need that Fund."
"Unfortunately, the fact that we have achieved monetary union does not mean that regional and social disparities no longer exist in the European Union."
"No doubt, as the Arias Cañete report recognizes, the Cohesion Fund has done a lot. It was well implemented during 1996, as the report also says."
"But there is still a lot left to do, as the Commission itself admitted in its threeyearly report on cohesion, and in its proposal for Agenda 2000, maintaining the Cohesion Fund after 1999, even within monetary union."
"But as has also been said here, we shall have the opportunity to talk about the future in forthcoming debates within the Committee on Regional Policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first let me express my sincerest thanks to the three rapporteurs, Mrs Klaß, Mr Arias Cañete and Mr Viola, for their outstanding reports and for the constructive manner in which they have worked together with the Members of the Committee on Regional Policy."
"As has been emphasized several times during the debate, 1996 was also a successful year for the Cohesion Fund and this applies not only to take-up rates but also to the reduction of disparities in development."
"Even the relationship between transport and the environment has come closer to the desired balance and you will see in the annual report for 1997 that deficits in the individual Member States have also been progressively reduced, with the result that the Commission expects the target balance to be achieved in all four beneficiary countries by the end of 1999."
"I agree with your criticism of the imbalance between road transport infrastructure and more environmentally friendly forms of transport."
"The Commission is involved in intensive discussions with the cohesion countries about the need for progress to be made in the rail sector and in other environmentally friendly areas of transport."
"We share your view that greater attention needs to be directed particularly towards rail projects."
"I agree with all those who have said that we need better environmental indicators so that we can more effectively assess the sustainability of those projects being funded."
"To this effect, Eurostat is carrying out an ambitious programme which one hopes will furnish the Commission with the machinery for assessing environmental improvements and for undertaking comparative studies more effectively in this area."
"I refute the unqualified criticism that the Cohesion Fund has tended to destroy the natural environment and that the Commission has not acted against breaches of EU environmental legislation."
"I believe we can easily demonstrate to you that, in fact, the very opposite is true."
"Your proposal to create local and regional structures within the context of Cohesion Fund projects does not, unfortunately, comply with the Cohesion Fund regulation."
"The Cohesion Fund is not a regional fund and its functions must therefore be assessed in terms of the Cohesion Fund regulation."
"Mrs Klaß, I too am pleased to see that the take-up of appropriations from the Structural Funds in 1996 was a clear improvement on previous years."
"This positive development has continued in 1997 with payments at a rate of utilization of 99.2 %."
"After the delays of the first two years the situation has therefore now stabilized and improved."
"I share your concerns in the area of Community initiatives and you will know that I have repeatedly pointed out to the Member States that we need a greater input from them in this area in order to speed up developments."
"A certain improvement was visible in 1997, but the general situation is anything but satisfactory."
"For this reason public sector talks are currently under way with the Member States on the subject of reprogramming, and after the summer recess the Commission will be submitting to the European Parliament a report on the implementation of Community initiatives, which will of course also take account of Parliament's position in this respect."
"Let me just add as an aside that even the Community initiatives which you have proposed for strengthening the cohesion programme leave a great deal to be desired in terms of their take-up rate."
"It is therefore well worth discussing together what steps we need to take next."
"The financial plan which was agreed in Edinburgh earmarked 39 % of commitments for the final two years of the programme planning period."
"At the time of its implementation on 31 December 1997 this percentage figure had in fact increased to 41 %, that is to say 2 % more than was planned."
"In spite of everything, I consider this to be relatively satisfactory."
"Between 1996 and the present, Madam rapporteur, we have made considerable progress in monitoring and evaluating Structural Fund actions."
"But as you know, we are aspiring to a more effective system of monitoring, evaluation and checks by way of the new Structural Fund regulation."
"In this respect, we are building on the experience gained from SEM 2000."
"Let me just correct something which has been said."
"There is no evidence that fraud is on the increase, but regrettably there is a continuing problem with formal errors and irregularities, for example regarding funding qualifications and the submission of receipts."
"I therefore consider it to be extremely important that the Commission should in future be in possession of instruments for applying sanctions and financial adjustments when it uncovers incidents of this kind."
"But I would not be betraying a secret when I tell you that an intensive debate is currently under way as to the best way of simplifying these procedures and that most of the Member States now see the situation quite differently."
"Unfortunately, Mrs Klaß, we will not be able to give you a report on the transmission of funds to final beneficiaries, since this information is only available to the Member States at national level, and in some cases only at regional level."
"I also believe that it is not our job to do the Member States' homework, but rather we should demand for one thing that the Member States comply with the regulations and for another that they do their work properly."
"This is why we need instruments for applying financial sanctions and adjustments."
"As you know, there have in the past been problems with the partnership principle."
"We are taking great pains to ensure that this principle is more correctly defined in the new Structural Fund regulation, together with a clearer allocation of responsibilities."
"Here too there is certainly greater agreement between the Commission and Parliament than between the Commission and the Member States."
"In this respect we shall continue to be very much dependent on your support."
"Mr Viola, I very much appreciate your commitment to the island regions."
"It is the view of the Commission, however, that the geographical criterion ""island region' is of itself not appropriate for the general application of exceptional provisions, whether this is done within the scope of the Structural Funds or any other Community policy."
"This situation is quite different when it comes to the most remote island regions, whose structural handicaps are assessed as being ""quite special' in Article 299 of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is intensively engaged, within the structural programme, in examining the different problems and specific disadvantages which affect the island regions."
"However, if we wish to declare war on these special problems, then we have to make distinctions and cannot treat all islands alike."
"An important indicator of the economic structural problems affecting our island regions is GDP."
"For reasons you have frequently stated, we have now introduced, for example, higher co-funding rates for the outermost Greek islands."
"But we cannot measure everyone by the same standards."
"I could well imagine the Interreg scheme being used at some time in the future for promoting transboundary cooperation between the islands, provided that appropriate proposals are made to this effect."
"This is something which we could have done in the past had we received a similar quantity of concrete proposals from the Member States, and from the island regions themselves, for such projects."
"But sometimes there is even a shortage of these!"
"I think that we should establish more coherence here too."
"In spite of the general ban on operational assistance, the Commission - as you know - does, under certain conditions, allow operational assistance to be granted on a degressive basis, and for a limited period of time, to the most disadvantaged regions."
"However, here too the level of aid approved is quite rightly determined by the degree of handicap."
"I share the rapporteur's view that we need to promote endogenous, environmentally-compatible development in our island regions, to support new forms of tourism which focus more on the natural, cultural and historic heritage of the islands and to encourage the use of alternative energy resources in these regions."
"I want to tell you, however, that we are already doing this, for instance through the JOULE Programme, which alone is promoting 26 projects for renewable energies in the island regions."
"The Commission is also in agreement with the rapporteur that the new communications technologies can offer the island regions a wonderful opportunity for their development and for reducing the problems associated with their temporal and geographical remoteness. We have therefore called upon the Member States to make the use of information and communications technologies an integral part of their regional funding policy."
"Let me just make one final comment. As far as I am aware, an astonishingly high number of Members of the European Parliament are themselves island residents."
"Their contributions to the debate have shown that those who live in the island regions are very skilful at safeguarding their own interests, not just in the European Parliament but there in particular."
"The Commission is prepared to work with you in drawing up a detailed policy."
"However, I would re-emphasize that this really has to be thought through in detail, for only then will we be able to help those who are at the greatest disadvantage and to promote the economic and social cohesion of the Union as a whole."
"I thank the Commissioner for her speech."
"Mr President, the Commissioner employed exclusively geographical criteria in her comments on islands. We have also been talking about the number of inhabitants as a criterion, Madam Commissioner."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.55 a.m. while awaiting the votes and resumed at 11.00 a.m.)"
"Mr President, I would draw your attention and through you the attention of the President and the Bureau to remarks in the Belgian press attributed to one of our Members, Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre."
"These remarks are a re-hash of allegations that he has previously made of irregularity and worse."
"These are allegations for which he has never produced a shred of evidence, despite being requested to do so."
"He has never produced evidence to the press, to the Committee on Budgetary Control, to the Bureau of Parliament or to our President."
"He appears to allege parliamentary obstruction to requests for waiver of immunity where no such requests have been made to Parliament."
"Will you therefore ask the President of Parliament to further consider these allegations by Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre and ask that Member either to produce evidence, should any exist, or, if not, to conduct himself in a manner more appropriate to a politician with pretensions to legal objectivity."
"Thank you, Mr Tomlinson."
"The matter was raised with the Bureau this morning and the President will take note of your comment."
"Votes"
"If I have understood correctly, Mrs André-Léonard wishes to table an oral amendment."
"Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, believed it would be useful to add a paragraph."
"Unfortunately, we missed the deadline for tabling normal amendments."
"We must therefore table an oral amendment, following the nuclear tests carried out by India on 11 and 13 May and the risks which are still very evident in the region."
"I would thus like to present you with this oral amendment: ""views as most serious the continued presence of nuclear weapons in the Indian subcontinent which poses a threat to international stability, and regrets that the lack of a genuine common EU policy on security prevents the Union from playing a political role in the establishment of a dialogue on the strategic balance between the countries in the region' ."
"If you are in agreement, and if the House is in agreement, I would like this oral amendment to be put to the vote."
"(The House approved the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, as agreed with the coordinator of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, its chairman and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs, the text of the oral amendment is the following:"
"""Demands that the Ecofin Council should accept the recommendation of the European Commission for the broad economic guidelines as supported by the present resolution of the European Parliament.'"
"(The House approved the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I repeat my invitation to my colleague, Mr Wynn, to withdraw this amendment, as I shall go into more detail before the first reading."
"If he should insist on the amendment, I would ask to table my own additional oral amendment to his amendment."
"Mr President, it would seem logical just to vote on this amendment."
"If it is lost then the rapporteur can do what he wishes after that."
"You are therefore refusing to withdraw the amendment and modify it."
"That is a double refusal."
"I will put Amendment No 1 from the Socialist group to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment to the original text of paragraph 14, to replace the words ""...of the Cohesion Fund' with the words ""...of a cohesion fund' , and I would request Mr Berend to withdraw his Amendment No 4."
"Mr President, if that is the case, then we accept this oral amendment and on behalf of my group I withdraw Amendment No 4."
"Mr President, the oral amendment can only be accepted if there are no objections."
"I have objections."
"I do not accept the oral amendment."
"(More than 12 Members stood up)"
"Mr President, I would just like to say to the Members who have stood up that if they do not accept the oral amendment, the Socialist Group will not be voting for this report."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I want to point out that there should be a correction to Amendment No 20, at least in the Swedish version."
"It talks about a programme for coastal connections, not ferry services, as it should be."
"On Amendments Nos 21 and 22"
"Mr President, I wish to speak before the final vote and explain my point, because I like to know exactly what I am voting for."
"When you moved to vote on the recitals, you combined recitals J and paragraph 1 under the same vote."
"But recital J was what we were presented with as a corrigendum, stating the following: ""whereas it is necessary to integrate the island regions into the internal market on equal terms' ."
"We were also told that the existing recital J had become recital K. I have the impression that this corrigendum is more an amendment than a corrigendum."
"Clearly, it does not relate to all the language versions, but it does add to the text and you did not put it to the vote."
"You put recital J to the vote which was the former recital J, rather than recital K which it became after this corrigendum."
"I would be glad if you could clarify this matter for me and proceed to the vote we need to take and the modifications we need to make with regard to the layout of the texts."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, indeed the niceties of the text have not escaped your keen eye."
"There was a mistake in the layout of the text as adopted by the Commission."
"This is a purely technical rectification that has no effect on the content which the corrigendum affects and it does not need to be put to the vote."
"I will now put the entire motion for a resolution, as amended, to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"To say that quality education and training lie at the heart of the struggle for development is indeed a truism."
"Each Member State must draw its own consequences and adapt its educational system with a constant view to improving its quality."
"And this means not only that higher education establishments should meet the educational and vocational requirements imposed by the global ""society of knowledge' , they should also offer a response to social problems and provide standards of education and training that constitute genuine vectors of individual identity, group membership, social advancement and personal development."
"We may rejoice in the fact that in this fundamental matter with regard to the future of our children and our societies, Community programmes, such as Socrates, have contributed to the growing awareness in each Member State that improvements are possible in higher education establishments, as compared with the situation in other Member States."
"In the unified Europe we are building, we must deploy every resource towards achieving a harmonization in terms of an increase in the grades achieved by qualified students graduating from the higher education establishments of different Member States."
"For all these reasons - even if we might actually regret, along with the rapporteur, that the Council did not consider it advisable to assign the Commission the responsibility for getting it off the ground - I am pleased today to see a long process that began in 1991 finally come to fruition."
"After years of waiting, this result will allow us to create and implement the ""European Quality Assurance Network' in the higher education of Member States of the Union."
"Bazin report (A4-0190/98)"
"Car thefts throughout the EU are a serious problem."
"The highly organized criminal gangs who specialize in this trade have been helped by the abolition of border controls."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission has taken an initiative to tackle this problem."
"I also appreciate the difficulty of trying to create a universal system affecting fifteen different countries with fifteen different practices."
"However, try we must and if it does not work then we can go back to the drawing board."
"The Commission proposal for production of two registration documents, if implemented, would be the first positive step in the right direction."
"The Schengen Agreement sought to dispense with internal frontiers in the European Union."
"The result was predictable: since then international crime has continued relentlessly to develop and diversify."
"The traffic of vehicles between all the Member States is merely a by-product of the wishes of the Brussels Eurocrats."
"Customs and police checks are, in principle, carried out at frontiers outside the Union, according to Schengen."
"It is nothing of the kind and the growth of the Mafia and terrorism in all Member States is all the proof we need."
"The National Front, for its part, has continually denounced these agreements and warned us of the dramatic consequences of this European sieve culture, in terms of the development of international crime and money laundering, delinquency, drug trafficking and, indeed, the inability to monitor the migratory flow."
"With this report, Europe is yet again trying to treat the symptoms of the malady rather than its causes."
"Certainly, it is important that we should be able to combat this international crimewave that continues to grow dangerously and the report by my colleague, Mr Bazin, makes a very favourable contribution to that cause."
"However, the time required to take steps to standardize registration certificates, the techniques associated with the theft and smuggling of vehicles, which are like a virus, will have moved on and will have adapted to the already obsolete methods employed to combat them."
"It is therefore high time we responded and attacked the primary causes of this entire breakdown: the Europe of Maastricht, the Europe of Schengen and now the Europe of Amsterdam."
"Herman report (A4-0195/98)"
"Mr President, the Council has just presented us with a proposal for a decision defining the application procedures for Article 105(4) of the Treaty which stipulates that from 1 January 1999, the European Central Bank should be consulted by the authorities in each state regarding any proposals for regulations in areas within its jurisdiction."
"This provision, which is apparently a secondary one, has clearly annoyed the European Parliament rapporteur, Mr Fernand Herman, who has told us that it is incomprehensible since, in a unified monetary area, national authorities would no longer have any independent regulatory powers in fields that might affect common monetary policy."
"Even worse, he has expressed indignation that Article 105(4) merely allows for simple consultation of the ECB without allowing the minimum right of veto."
"The rapporteur sees in this the signs of total inconsistency."
"How has this inconsistency allowed itself to infiltrate the Treaty?"
"Allow me to quote in full the explanation of Fernand Herman, because it should not be forgotten by those who follow in our wake."
"According to the rapporteur, and I quote: ""...the proposal submitted to us bears witness to an excessively decentralized conception of Economic and Monetary Union."
"Such a conception must still have been prevalent in 1991, at a time when this ambitious project seemed unlikely to appeal to certain Member States."
"In order not to antagonize them, they were given to understand that they would retain a maximum of autonomy even in matters where the substance of their sovereignty was being transferred to European level' ."
"Thus we are quietly informed that certain provisions were introduced into the instrument for monetary union simply to give an appealing impression at the time of the Maastricht ratification, but that now we must dispense with them to give the system its true meaning."
"And it is to this ploy that the European Parliament has just lent itself, by voting in favour of the Herman report. How do we view such goings-on, other than as manipulation of the rights of universal suffrage?"
"Those in France who demand a referendum on the single currency should find here new arguments in support of their campaign."
"Since we do not subscribe to the idea of a common currency for the EU Member States, we have chosen to abstain from the vote on this report."
"We emphatically disassociate ourselves from the creation of a European Central Bank that is supposed to control monetary and currency policy in an ""expert' fashion, beyond the reach of democratic influence."
"The report proposed by our colleague, Mr Herman, addresses the issue of setting up the euro and its ""secular' arm, the European Central Bank, a sturdy supporter of this particular currency; I therefore accept the guidelines presented to us today."
"In effect, although we have entered the third phase of economic union, it would be, at the very least, something of a paradox if the Member States were still allowed to legislate freely on monetary matters without regard for the new spheres of jurisdiction conferred upon the European Central Bank."
"Above and beyond the technical aspect of the report, we feel bidden to give our opinion on the federal nature of this monetary ""tool' ."
"And I would say that of those who are most horrified by the notion that the European Union might have a major political role, many would vote for this text, not through a European persuasion, but simply because they subscribe to liberal, monetarist dogma."
"That is not my position at all."
"As far as I am concerned, I will vote for this text, not through ideology but through a genuine European commitment."
"I would hope too, that many of us realize that the construction of European does not come to an abrupt halt on 1 January 1999 but that, on the contrary, it must be stepped up from 2 May 1998."
"I hope, one year away from a major political deadline, that a genuine debate will be opened up concerning the Europe we seek to offer its citizens, as regards the constitution, the political Europe and the social Europe."
"Already, the face and framework of the economic Europe is changing."
"We might gain some satisfaction from this."
"But we should now seek to expand upon the grand design of the major precursors of the European concept."
"We must, without further delay, assist the progress of the political Europe to guarantee a genuine democracy for what will be, tomorrow, one of the leading economic, financial and monetary powers, if not the ultimate leader."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the Herman Report."
"In our opinion, the original Commission proposal was far superior to the Herman report, in light of the Danish derogation with regard to the third stage of EMU."
"We do not support Amendments Nos 1, 2 or 4 in the report."
"The amendments imply:"
"firstly, that the authorities of the Member States should as a general rule refrain from drawing up new rules or regulations; -secondly, that existing regulations in all Member States concerning the ECB's fields of competence should be subject to progressive harmonization; -finally, that a Member State should suspend the implementation of national rules or regulations in the event of a dispute with the ECB until such times as the question is decided by the Council.The wording of the amendments does not take into consideration whether a Member State may have a derogation with regard to the third stage of EMU."
"The amendments imply that Articles 2 and 4 of the proposal for a Council decision would go far beyond the provisions of the Treaty as set out in Article 105(4) of the Treaty, where it merely states that the ECB should be consulted in connection with any national draft legislative provision."
"Thus, the amendments undermine the derogation provisions of Article 109K of the Treaty and, hence, the derogations that some countries have pursuant to the third stage of EMU."
"In our opinion, three of the four amendments to the report contravene the provisions of the Treaty and violate rights laid down in the Treaty with regard to the Danish derogation pursuant to the third stage of EMU."
"The EU decides."
"That is what the Herman report is all about."
"The Commissionʼs proposal for a Council Decision on the consultation of the European Central Bank by national authorities on draft legislative provisions in the monetary sphere is rejected in the Herman report as ""an excessively decentralized conception of Economic and Monetary Union' ."
"This may possibly have been the case in 1991, when the Maastricht Treaty was presented."
"In order not to alarm the Member States, the committeeʼs explanatory statement intimated that they would be permitted to retain the maximum possible autonomy."
"According to the committee, the Member States should, as of 1999, refrain from legislating or regulating on ""all matters falling within ECB fields of competence' ."
"In the light of such dictates, Swedenʼs decision to remain outside EMU seems increasingly wise."
"The debate and the vote on the Herman report contain important considerations for the legal harmonization of monetary policy matters, but, more significantly, they also prepare the way for the establishment of a workable European Central Bank which will be the basis for a successful common currency."
"It is absolutely vital for all preparatory procedures to be brought to an early close, so that the ECB trial run for a successful start-up of EMU on 1 January 1999 can commence at the earliest possible date."
"To this effect the Commission has presented the European Parliament with a proposal for a Council Decision on the ""statistical data to be used for the determination of the key for subscription of the capital of the European Central Bank' , which we can approve unreservedly."
"The statistical data must be provided by the Commission, or by Eurostat, so that the capital shares held by the Member States in the ECB - respectively 50 % of each Member State's proportion of the total population and GDP of the EU - can be determined."
"The capital shares will be revised every five years on the basis of this information."
"Such a weighting system ensures that the costs and benefits of the common monetary policy are allocated in a practical and equitable way."
"This also applies - regardless of the many debates going on in the Member States - to the distribution of the profits of the ECB, which in principle is to be carried out on the basis of capital shares."
"In order to smooth out short-term inconsistencies, there will however be a transitional regulation designed to balance out the different profit levels of the various central banks, which result from the fact that circulation of bank notes is varied in the EU Member States."
"Viewed as a whole, this process, which incorporates both the GDP shares and the population-based shares, constitutes a practical and equitable way of allocating the shares."
"The incorporation of both these parameters could quite possibly become a model for other projects and institutions in the European Union."
"The second aspect of the Herman report concerns the regulations for the ""consultation of the European Central Bank by national authorities on draft legislative provisions' ."
"The rapporteur intends, through his amendments to the Commission's proposal, to achieve a more complete harmonization of the legislation pertaining to monetary policy."
"The Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy support this intention."
"How strong the forces of national inertia continue to be vis-à-vis European integration can be seen right here, where we have managed for the first time effectively to ""Europeanize' a political area, as has been achieved with the adoption of a monetary policy for the single European currency."
"Those who want to see a common currency must also be prepared to take this into account in their national legislation."
"In view of the fact that there is insufficient clarification in the treaties of the relationship between the ECB, the ESCB and the national central banks in respect of their functions outside of monetary policy proper - functions which may be relevant for the development of money supply, for example - we need a pragmatic regulation which will apply in the interim."
"This means that the Commission, and not the ECB, can act as guardian of the treaties - and in case of dispute the Council of Ministers can ultimately deliver the necessary political decisions."
"Mr Herman's proposals, which we can agree to in this respect, are based on these principles."
"It has to be said that, when in doubt, we would advocate diversity and would only plead for harmonization to the point where this can be proved necessary, whereas Mr Herman, under such circumstances, would presumably advocate harmonization."
"But that point is not being voted on at this juncture."
"Redondo Jiménez report (A4-0163/98)"
"We have abstained from the vote on this report because we believe that the common agricultural policy is in need of fundamental reform."
"We wish to see a proper reform of agriculture policy in 1999."
"The current report is, to a certain extent, heading in the right direction, since it proposes a reduction of the compensation payments."
"However, we still cannot vote for an extension of the quota system for potato starch."
"Too much is being spent on this system - ECU 205.4 million plus additional expenditure on production and export refunds - and we question whether this is money well spent."
"During our work in the Committee on Agriculture, our rapporteur attempted to sow some confusion with regard to the production of potato starch and the setting up of a potato CMO."
"As I stressed in my statements in committee, the potato for human consumption has absolutely nothing to do with the potato used in the production of starch."
"I know that for some time the Spanish government has put pressure on the Commission to set up a potato CMO."
"During the vote in the Committee on Agriculture, all amendments which sought to merge these two types of production were rejected."
"We must, therefore, be pleased with the result of the vote in committee since it reflects the reality of starch production."
"Historically, aid for starch potato production was established in order to maintain this special sector which is in direct competition with the production of cereal-based starch."
"But I do recall three reasons given in favour of the preservation of this special production."
"Firstly, starch potatoes are subject to the imposition of starch production quota restrictions."
"Consequently, a drop in prices will not lead to an increase in market share through higher productivity in terms of cost price."
"Secondly, starch potato cultivation requires substantial special investments."
"The cost price is set at ECU 2 400 per hectare at least, in other words ECU 60 per tonne based on a yield of 40 tonnes/ha."
"Thirdly, starch potato producers have had to put up with the various changes to the CAP, since this production is linked - in the context of starch products - to the official price of cereals, especially maize."
"Consequently, the income of farmers has fallen regularly."
"Given these three reasons, we should therefore maintain the existing situation and continue to aid this type of production within the framework of the Santer package."
"In fact, the quota, the competitive balance with cereal prices for starch manufacture and the net operating margin which is higher than that for cereals, justify the legitimate stance in favour of pegging the minimum price of starch potato at 20 % above the basic intervention price for maize, in terms of both the minimum price and for compensatory payment, all within the framework of the Santer package."
"Finally, we must introduce a measure of flexibility in this quota-setting system to take account of climatic fluctuations which affect the volume of production."
"This is why our group has tabled a further amendment to enable a starch manufacturer, during a marketing year, to use - either above or below that year - not more than 10 % of his valid quota for the next or the last campaign, as applicable."
"This 10 % flexibility with respect to an average campaign allows quotas to be adapted to meet variations in production."
"Starch potato production requires expensive special investments, resulting in high cost prices of around FF 15 600/ha."
"Therefore, within the framework of the Santer package, we will need to adapt the European regulations to maintain this production which has the advantage of being environmentally friendly and an excellent ""crop rotation leader' ."
"The starch potato's competitor is maize and not, as the committee rapporteur stressed, the potato for human consumption."
"In fact, the finished ""starch' product is virtually identical, wherever it came from, be it maize or starch potato."
"I would like to remind you that the European Union has a shortage of maize; therefore, we need to maintain our special potato starch production."
"If we were forced to abolish it, maize imports would increase and we will have penalized European agriculture yet again."
"Finally, I am glad that the vote in committee prevented our rapporteur from introducing a measure of confusion between starch potato production and the production of potatoes for human consumption."
"At present, there is no potato CMO."
"Some organizations, especially the Spanish ones, would dearly like to set one up before the accession of Poland."
"May I remind you that Poland produces on its own as many potatoes as the fifteen Member States of the European Union."
"The problem is not whether we set up a potato CMO, but quite simply we must not ""corrupt' the debate concerning the very special starch potato production sector."
"Cardiff European Council"
"The Cardiff Summit will consider a number of issues."
"I would like to refer to two possible areas of policy discussion."
"Firstly, I am concerned about the current proposals for CAP reform."
"I understand that the Agriculture Council has produced a text on the matter which has been forwarded to the General Affairs Council for discussion at Cardiff."
"If the current proposals were to be adopted they would be disastrous for Irish agriculture."
"The proposed price cuts of 30 % in beef, 20 in cereals and 15 % in dairy prices without full compensation would be devastating for Irish farmers."
"The Irish beef sector has already suffered a severe crisis."
"The current proposals would fix prices below the cost of production."
"The cuts in the dairy sector would be the equivalent of a 16.5 pence drop in the price of a gallon of milk."
"Our dependence on these sectors must be recognized and full compensation should form the cornerstone of CAP Reform II."
"Given the grass-based nature of our agriculture, the cuts in cereal prices would also affect our competitivity."
"The second issue I would like to comment on is the problem of debt in developing countries."
"Mr Blair tried valiantly to persuade his colleagues at the G8 Summit to take the necessary steps to alleviate the problems of highly indebted countries."
"Their discussions did not go far enough and I would hope that in the final days of his presidency Mr Blair will ensure that the European Union steps into the breach."
"Spencer report (A4-0169/98)"
"Mr Spencer's report is a useful contribution to the debate on the European Union's common foreign and security policy."
"I support his conclusions which highlight the deficiencies and shortcomings in the present operation of this policy."
"He is also correct to underline the importance of monitoring the situation in the Middle East, the Balkans and the observation of human rights in China."
"Hopefully, when the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified, many of the concerns highlighted by Mr Spencer will have been allayed."
"The establishment of a 'policy and planning unit' coupled with the appointment of a High Representative will provide a badly needed coherence to the CFSP."
"However, it should also be stressed that it is vitally important that Parliament should be fully involved and informed about developments in the CFSP."
"During the cold war, things were simple: there was an adversary against which those from the West, North America and Europe fought together subordinating their entire foreign and defence policy to that cause."
"The end of the East-West confrontation has rendered the emergence of a genuine common foreign and security policy for the European Union even more necessary, since it has reduced the need for such integrated alliances in an increasingly multipolar world."
"Like the rapporteur, I am pleased to highlight the progress made, albeit limited, by the CFSP during the past year, but I also temper this with the dilatory approach and the difficulties surrounding each step forward, as well as the distance we still have to travel before the European Union has a genuine common foreign and security policy."
"But time is moving on."
"The challenges are accumulating and we cannot rely on the good will of the United States for ever."
"In addition, I would stress the democratic need to see Parliament hitch its wagon to the major policy guidelines of the common foreign and security policy."
"From this standpoint, it is high time that an interinstitutional agreement defined Parliament's right to information and consultation."
"Until then, it is highly desirable that the Council and the Commission totally fulfil the obligations which are now theirs with regard to providing Parliament with information on foreign policy."
"An ambitious and determined application of the potentialities contained in the Amsterdam Treaty would certainly help us make significant steps forward in the area of the CFSP, but I would conclude by saying, in total agreement with the rapporteur, that we will achieve nothing without a profound change of outlook."
"That is probably where the problem lies: how do we make the political decision-makers of our fifteen Member States understand that they would better defend the aspirations and interests of their countries if they expressed them with a single European voice?"
"We are unable to support the report, even though it contains certain positive features as regards the need for the EU to seek, through its action, to support the struggle for human rights."
"However, the report aims for the most part to create a common, uniform, supranational foreign and security policy with an increasing military element, which we simply cannot support."
"Instead, we believe that the EU should abandon the superpower ambitions and concentrate its foreign policy-related intergovernmental cooperation on promoting disarmament and peaceful cooperation."
"It is good that the report offers proposals on initiatives to avoid conflicts, securing democracy, strengthening respect for human rights, working for increased legal security, introducing social clauses on democracy and human rights into trade agreements and increasing the utilization of recommendations and public hearings, etcetera."
"I also agree with the importance of the lack of a political strategy in matters relating to poverty and the environment."
"However, the report concentrates excessively on the realization of the EUʼs own foreign and security policy by means of coordinated policies on defence and weapons and by incorporating the WEU into the EU."
"There is no intrinsic value in this."
"The report emphasizes the new opportunities that the Amsterdam Treaty offers for the gradual establishment of a common defence policy."
"Mention is made here of peacekeeping and peacemaking tasks."
"Majority voting is introduced in several areas and a post of ""EU Minister for Foreign Affairs' is created."
"This enables the EU to intervene in a conflict by force of arms with the aim of making peace."
"This is contrary to Swedenʼs policy of non-alignment and is not acceptable."
"The right of veto is retained, but is diluted via a system of so-called constructive abstention from voting."
"The EU is here undertaking tasks which are enshrined in the statutes of the UN, and which, of course, also belong in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)."
"The committee's report is an excellent, thorough treatment of the role of the Union on the world scene."
"The committee's concerns regarding persistent popular scepticism towards European foreign policy are perfectly understandable."
"Citizens expect the Union to be able to take much more effective action in the search for solutions to crises relating to foreign policy."
"I am convinced that Parliament can use this thorough report and its recommendations to help advance our foreign and security policies."
"Because I believe that the European Union must be a cooperation between sovereign states, I cannot vote for the Spencer report."
"This report goes in an entirely different direction by proposing, among other things, that it should be possible for some foreign-policy decisions to be taken by means of a majority vote."
"Viola report (A4-0175/98)"

"An inventory of crimes committed against property must be available for inspection. (Benchmark)3."
"Potential cost-saving measures must be examined.- Gasòliba i Böhm report (A4-0193/98)"
"We consider the wording used in point 35 of the report to be excessive, particularly as far as tax reductions are concerned."
"If tax on labour is to be reduced, then tax on capital and environmental impacts must be increased."
"Furthermore, we believe that the Member States themselves should decide which taxes and tax reductions they wish to implement."
"The Commission's recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines has one merit: it is consistent with the principles of a single currency and pushes the consequences of monetary unification to their logical end, the harmonization of national policies and the introduction of flexibility in economic structures."
"This text gives us to believe that the necessary harmonization must extend much further than some believe: for EMU to achieve its full potential, we cannot simply introduce the single currency, it is essential that all the public and private partners subsequently coordinate their actions in the direction indicated by the Commission."
"The Commission affirms this in careful terms. It states that the overall policy mix will promote growth and employment if all the participants and groups comply with the guidelines it has summarized (p."
"4). The countries of the European Union will soon resemble an army on manoeuvres."
"All macroeconomic, fiscal and structural policies will be examined minutely."
"Even the wages policy, which we would have thought the most decentralized, will not escape."
"In effect, the Commission tells us coldly that, in the future euro area, nominal wage increases must be compatible with price stability, which is the underlying objective of the European Central Bank."
"How do we reconcile the centralized nature of this objective and the decentralization of wage negotiations?"
"According to the Commission, it is essential that governments apply themselves more to promoting a better understanding of the major economic policy guidelines, which were decided in Brussels."
"In conjunction with the centralization of objectives and the harmonization of rules, the flexibility of economic structures should increase."
"The text of the Commission is quite clear: it states that if the economies of Member States do not make the stipulated progress in terms of flexibility, the consequences will be serious."
"They will be very serious even, since they might lead to the explosion of the euro."
"In particular, we are told bluntly that in EMU, salary adjustment must play a more important role in the process of adapting to new economic circumstances, especially when snags specific to certain countries arise."
"In effect, as we have said all along, this is the logical counterpart of the abolition of internal currency markets in the euro area."
"Finally, we will not be surprised to note yet again that the Commission concludes by expressing the need to invent a new form of multilateral supervision."
"In the wake of the Stability Pact, following the definitions of the common economic policy guidelines and the employment policy monitoring procedures, we are presented with the notion of coordination at Community level of regulatory reforms and close monitoring within the context of regular multilateral supervision, which relies on the establishment of a single currency instrument panel."
"So there you have an instrument that was still missing from the spectrum of Commission policing!"
"Let us not deceive ourselves: by denouncing this ""confinement to barracks' of member countries, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations does not intend to defend indirectly the rigidity and ponderousness with which a significant number of our economies are afflicted, especially the French economy."
"We too deplore these serious shortcomings and we consider that the solution should obviously be sought in terms of greater flexibility and a reduction of mandatory levies."
"But how do we move towards this objective?"
"Of course, we recognize the responsibility of our successive national governments with regard to their negligence and slackness in facing up to the problems."
"But do we still have to give up the very idea of national sovereignty in order to accept on the one hand the infantile disciplines imposed by Brussels and, on the other hand, the merciless law of unrestrained globalization which, incidentally, do not offset each other but actually merge, as the Commission document clearly indicates?"
"No!"
"My group considers that we are in the process of inventing a cure that is worse than the illness itself."
"Flexible coordination and the exchange of experiences are undeniably valuable at European level, but the subjugation of peoples and the systematic demolition of their political and social frameworks will yield nothing of value."
"That is why we have voted against the Commission recommendations."
"The resolution on the broad economic policy guidelines has my vote."
"But my feelings are not unreservedly positive."
"In the first place, the rhetoric commending the objectives of greater employment, EMU success, sustainable economic growth and expansion of investment is not to my liking. Paragraph 31 has the most bombastic formulation in this respect."
"The rhetoric in the resolution detracts from a serious approach to price stability and a well-defined assessment of the scope of monetary policy."
"I think it is of the utmost importance for the credibility of Economic and Monetary Union to guard against the danger of inflation that looms from the overheating of some national economies."
"What I am equally disappointed about is that the predicted effects of a steeply ageing population are not considered."
"Under pressure from the Socialist group this reality was deleted from paragraph 12 of the motion for a resolution."
"This is all the more surprising as a start still has to be made on a real rationalization of public finances in the major EMU Member States, as can be seen from the introductory sentence of paragraph 14."
"Finally, I think that the objective of investment-led economic growth may do excessive damage to the environment."
"Although the environment is mentioned in paragraph 3, it comes off very badly."
"There is a Treaty obligation to gear policy to sustainable development, so that the burden of our prosperity is not passed on to subsequent generations."
"I hope that the Council, when it receives this report, will be able to distinguish the good from the bad."
"The report by our colleague Gasòliba i Böhm emphasizes, as it should, the significant progress that all the Member States of the European Union have made in order to qualify for the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union."
"Inflation rates are historically low, as are interest rates."
"But this report is not an invitation to relax and look back with admiration at the path we have followed."
"We still have a great deal to do and it is precisely this that the rapporteur seeks to highlight."
"The structure is fragile."
"The success of the undertaking will depend on the commitment of Member States in the euro area to implement coordinated budgetary policies that meet the pricing stability objective pursued by the ECB."
"Similarly, it is important that those countries that are not yet members of the euro area regard their exchange policy as a matter of common interest."
"Nor should the efforts to stabilize public finance be relaxed."
"We must pursue, or initiate in the case of those countries who have not yet understood it - such as France -, a reduction in public expenditure and prevent tax rises or, even better, reduce taxes."
"We must cut deficits to achieve a balance, or even a budget surplus."
"This is an important condition for countering the possible shocks of ill-balanced book-keeping with which our economies might be confronted."
"We are left with two overriding concerns. The first relates to the low private investment rate in most countries of the Union, despite the presence of sound economic fundamentals."
"It is in our interest to reverse this trend."
"An increase in private investment is necessary for growth and employment."
"The second concern relates to the high average European unemployment rate, rising above the 10 % mark of the active population."
"Hence, as I have said before in our assembly, Europe will only bring us, say, a quarter of the solutions, whilst the remaining three-quarters will have to be provided through national efforts."
"And this will be achieved by implementing profound structural reforms, as our rapporteur clearly indicates."
"First of all, we must ensure that wages progress at a moderate rate and we must reduce the overheads that weigh so heavily on labour in order to eliminate the ""tax wedges' and lower labour costs."
"Next, it would be most useful to promote active policies in the labour market to eliminate as far as possible the factors that discourage people from working."
"Since the report by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm stresses the vast amount of work we have yet to do before EMU can reach total fruition, I shall vote in favour."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the report by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm."
"We support the following positions expressed in the report."
"Firstly, a high level of employment is part and parcel of a successful EMU, and strong emphasis needs to be placed on employment pursuant to the Amsterdam Treaty.-Secondly, the low level of employment in the EU is a source of extensive social, economic and budgetary costs.-Thirdly, we need Investment in training, research and development.-Fourthly, measures to promote investment and stimulate internal demand within the EU are needed.-Fifthly, establishing and maintaining a strong social dialogue is essential.However, the report's appeal for increased approximation of budgetary and fiscal policy at Community level reflects a lack of understanding that some Member States are not participating in the third stage of EMU, not because they fail to meet the criteria of convergence, but because they do not wish to participate in the closer coordination of financial and monetary policy, not to mention comprehensive coordination of monetary policy."
"We could not endorse the points in the report referring to the harmonization of macroeconomic policies - point 8 -, including budgetary policy - point 7 - and fiscal policy - point 25."
"Denmark is choosing to maintain a fixed exchange rate with the euro after 1 January 1999."
"Denmark has made its choice to remain outside the third stage of EMU; Danish currency policy with regard to the euro - point 9 - is and remains a matter for Denmark to determine."
"Many of the general guidelines from the Commission on the economic policy are good, such as the proposal for reducing unemployment and increasing employment."
"It also goes without saying that countries outside EMU are seeking low inflation and stable currencies."
"This is also the case in Sweden."
"However, the committeeʼs proposal regarding the coordination of the Member Statesʼ budgetary policy goes too far."
"And the budgetary policy also has a major bearing on the matter of taxes, economic policy and thus the scope and approach of the public sector, and these are national questions."
"This report is a contribution to an exercise, in which there is no shortage of other contributors, demonstrating an attempt to harmonize two things that are incompatible in real life, inasmuch as social observation proves that in practice they are mutually exclusive."
"These are the introduction of an EMU to serve a strategy based on price stability and single convergent financial instruments and mechanisms, and the alleged priority being given to high levels and rates of employment."
"We are actually doing one thing and saying we are giving priority to the other."
"How long will this go on?"
"Will it go on until society cannot put up with it any longer?"
"Because while wealth is being concentrated, inequalities are being aggravated, extremely high levels of unemployment are being institutionalized, poverty and exclusion are spreading, and disproportion is on the increase."
"And we are by no means being prophets of doom about this."
"It cannot be said that this situation, and these trends, are not reflected anywhere in Mr Gasòliba i Böhm's report."
"They peep through, albeit timorously, when a 2 % limit is suggested to prevent the reduction of inflation from turning into deflation, when he has the necessary ounce of courage(!) to mention the subject of democratic legitimacy and the principle of subsidiarity where the question of taxes is concerned."
"But the report stops there, through timidity and lack of courage, which come to the same thing."
"This is not the way to rectify things that urgently need putting right, even from a point of view we do not share."
"Still less is it so when it ""urges also - in order to avoid market misperceptions - that all official statements should reiterate the views of the Commission, the EMI, and the European Parliament on the economic strength of the 11 Member Euro ""."
"That obviously includes the Gasòliba i Böhm report."
"We must not cause a disturbance in the holy market..."
"We, for our part, would rather have real convergence, which can only come from debate, honesty and the search for truth."
"The need for a tight economic policy is the crux of the Stability Pact intended to ensure that EMU will have a successful, strong currency."
"Thus, is it equally crucial for the Commission to prepare a thorough annual analysis of the economic policies not only of Member States, but also of the EU, and to put forward clear recommendations pursuant to this."
"I strongly agree with the committee's assessment of the Commission's recommendation; in other words, I fully endorse the view that countries that are not participating in EMU from the outset should consider their currency policy as a matter of joint interest."
"This is the only way to ensure rapid assimilation of such countries into the Third Stage of EMU, should they so desire."
"We accept the report for two quite different reasons:"
"1) It takes a number of important steps in the right direction, particularly in highlighting the macroeconomic role of investments and the need not to set as absolute the objective of inflation control."
"Even though in some important respects we hold quite different, and in some ways more practical, views on the necessary transition to a new ecological and social development model, we are nevertheless prepared to acknowledge this."
"However, this should not take the edge off our criticism of other elements of the report, particularly of its one-sided emphasis on wage restraint or its similarly one-sided praise of flexibility."
"We also regret the inadequate treatment given to the issue of reducing working hours, both in this report and in the Commission's proposal."
"2) In a situation in which, in view of the introduction of the euro, a binding and substantial EU economic policy is indispensable for all those who do not want to surrender the main aspects of economic policy to the bankers of the ECB - and consequently to the dictate of the financial markets -, we are now for the first time actually considering providing the Union with binding directives on economic policy."
"While on the one hand we might criticize the Commission's proposals as mistaken, one-sided or over-cautious, we counter this by opposing all attempts to relegate this process to a mere bureaucratic exercise which commits no-one to doing anything."
"In view of the risk, which has been clearly expressed in the debate, that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in particular might completely drain the Commission's proposal - and the position adopted by the European Parliament - of any specific, and therefore possibly controversial content, our support of Mr Gasòliba i Böhm's report gives expression to our view that a ""European economic government' is in fact required for the euro but that binding and substantial directives on economic policy must be adopted as an absolute minimum measure."
"Van Lancker report (A4-0168/98)"
"Mr President, I voted against Mrs Van Lancker's report because, unfortunately, the majority in Parliament did not support my group which had tabled amendments to remove from the text the resolution concerning the situation of frontier workers in the European Union, untruths and the most flagrant absurdities and other contradictions that seek to further the belief that all frontier workers are poor victims of discrimination, that they have to put up with wage losses, other disadvantages and so forth."
"My country hosts nearly 20 % of the 380 000 frontier workers employed in the European Union."
"Our employment policy still creates between four and five thousand jobs a year, which are nearly all occupied by frontier workers, and we are thus helping to solve the unemployment problem in Lorraine, Belgian Luxembourg, the Saar and the Rhineland-Palatinate. I would point out that, in our country, frontier workers are happy to benefit from wages and employment and social security conditions that are more favourable than those in their country of origin."
"I told you yesterday that Mrs Van Lancker, unfortunately, along with our colleagues on the left, sees only the holes in the cheese."
"We export, for the benefit of frontier workers, for example, family allowances and education allowances which, basically, were designed for our own residents, for demographic reasons."
"Yesterday, our Parliament approved a good law setting up a dependency insurance scheme for the elderly."
"Our frontier workers will also benefit from this, although no such insurance exists either in Belgium or in France."
"All allowances are financed by taxation and they are rather more generous than those in neighbouring regions."
"That is why I wish to restate that the principle of levying taxes on the wages of frontier workers in their country of employment must be rigidly enforced."
"There is no question of departing from that principle."
"It gives me great satisfaction to welcome the report from our colleague Anne Van Lancker."
"It is frequently viewed as good form to congratulate a colleague, but I am sincere in wishing to commend the author of a report which, let us hope, should put an end to the ludicrous situations in which some of our fellow citizens live, whereby progress in the construction of Europe results in complicating their situation even further."
"Nine years ago, as a Member of the European Parliament, I came face to face with the problems of the dual taxation of French employees working in Belgium. Consequently, I support unreservedly the rapporteur's proposals, whilst not overlooking the problems of social security and CSG (General Social Contribution)."
"Yes, it is high time we created a new status for the frontier worker, in the widest sense, both for tax collection and for social security benefits."
"I hope that this status will be understood by all and accepted by all."
"We cannot allow this erosion of the quality of the frontier worker to continue much longer and which, on occasion, differs between one person and another in the same location, on the pretext that there is a radical difference between the occupations pursued."
"Finally, I hope that the Commission will be able to persuade the Member States to settle the differences between these administrations."
"It is not uncommon to hear contrary interpretations within the same administration, concerning the application of an agreement governing the status of the worker."
"Free movement, the right to live in the place of one's choice and the right to work where one can all call for new European rules and the ""modernization' of those that predate the Single European Act."
"It is more than urgent!"
"It is vital!"
"It is a good thing that the frontier worker problem crops up at regular intervals in Parliament, since it helps us assess the situation."
"This special and rather limited category of workers - about 630 000, of which more than half work in Switzerland - faces quite different problems, depending on their country of residence and the host country in which they work."
"I am a keen supporter of bilateralism, in other words, I favour a pragmatic approach to the main problems that beset the principal countries concerned."
"That was the focus of the report that Elmar Brok and myself drew up during the last Parliamentary session."
"My country, Luxembourg, employs 60 000 frontier workers out of a total of 210 000, that is, around 30 %."
"I believe that because of bilateral agreements relating to taxation and social security, the situation of the frontier workers and their families is most satisfactory, indeed more favourable than in their own country of origin."
"This is why we stress the need for income tax on employment to continue to be paid in the host country and, of course, the same applies to welfare contributions."
"In this respect, it should be noted that the government of Luxembourg has made significant efforts to eliminate the distortions that worked against the interests of frontier workers."
"The discriminatory regulations that frontier workers might encounter differ widely from one country to another."
"For this reason, I find the report by Mrs Van Lancker most interesting in that it proposes that all national legislation affecting frontier workers should be investigated beforehand to determine its effects on the situation of those workers."
"With regard to the compensation fund posited by Mrs Van Lancker, we should say that it is obviously very difficult most of the time to assess the damage sustained by the frontier worker quite as precisely as in the Belgium-Netherlands case, which formed the basis of Mrs Van Lancker's report."
"At all events, we must approach this matter of compensation in a pragmatic way, with a spirit of goodwill on both sides."
"The report on frontier workers encapsulates brilliantly the problems which these pioneers of a united Europe have to face every day."
"The potential solutions put forward by Mrs Van Lancker are quite logical and deserve our support."
"It is good that Parliament, as the representative of the citizens of Europe, is again taking the initiative in drawing the public's attention to this matter."
"As a Member with responsibility for part of the German-Dutch-Belgian border region, I know that a great deal has to happen before national frontiers cease being an obstacle to those who seek the right to freedom of movement."
"Fundamental solutions will probably only be forthcoming when the number of frontier workers, and hence the pressure on national governments, becomes much greater than it is at present."
"However, practical improvements - which would at least provide interim solutions and benefits for those affected - could be introduced right now if such moves were not being blocked in the Council, and here the German government is primarily to blame."
"I am counting on it that by the autumn a new German government will give up on this blockade and will provide a clear passage for those amendments to the regulation which have already been in existence for several years, and which have been endorsed by this House."
"Arias Cañete report (A4-0159/98)"
"Mr President, it is incumbent upon me, on behalf of my group, to explain our voting procedure on this report."
"The vote has been a shambles."
"The rapporteur himself voted against his own report."
"It illustrates the risk, when writing reports on subjects in Agenda 2000, of going too far."
"The future of the Cohesion Fund from 2000 to 2006 must be dealt with within the regulation."
"I hope that Members have learnt from this exercise and that they will not now table amendments and reports on the future of funding which will be dealt with by a future rapporteur."
"I was deeply disappointed by Mr Novo undermining the consensus agreed with the other groups on this issue."
"At the end of the day we have been held to hostage by 12 Members."
"These are not the issues which should come to plenary and result in a shambles of a vote."
"They should be thrashed out in committee so that we have a smooth vote in plenary."
"I am sorry to have to say it but the only option for my group in the circumstances was to abstain on the vote on this report."
"The Arias Cañete report dealing with the Cohesion Fund for 1996 offers a very interesting review of the progress concerning the operation of this fund in 1996."
"This is a quality report, although not entirely irreproachable and has gained a favourable vote from our group."
"The Cohesion Fund was established mainly to promote single currency membership amongst certain Member States: the Community manna was allocated in order to bolster the budgetary diet imposed by the terms of the Maastricht Treaty."
"We might add that it contributed to the sleight of hand that produced a truly miracle cure for certain Member States of the monetary union."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, which even opposed the principle of a single currency must maintain a cautious stance with regard to this Fund and the use made of it."
"This is especially true since it harbours serious defects: I am thinking of its questionable effectiveness and certain financial irregularities concerning the use of appropriations."
"Moreover, it is an instrument of federalist redistribution, the purpose of which is to induct into the ranks of the Commission faithful the beneficiary regions, rather than let them sort out their own problems."
"The birth of the single currency may further disturb the imbalances between states through the accelerating relocations, either to states or regions that are more competitive than others, or from those regions in difficulty towards the more dominant economic powers."
"In this context, the Cohesion Fund, rather than offering a genuine solution to the overwhelming problems of certain regions of Europe, may simply serve as a stop-gap to limit the repercussions."
"Like Aesop's tongue, it could equally be the best or the worst of things."
"Everything depends on the use made of it."
"And from this point of view, I prefer to remain optimistic, having learnt from past experience that this type of institution is too often put forward as a means of promoting the emergence of the large centralized European state of which many dream so unashamedly."
"I voted against this report because of the European People's Party's Amendment No 4 which sought in future to exclude from cohesion funds all Member States participating in EMU."
"I disagree with the proposition in itself and in principle since a report on 1996 should not set the agenda for future policy."
"The Portuguese Socialist Members will vote against the Arias Cañete report, because Amendment No 4, which the Socialist group list was committed to voting against, was narrowly approved in the end."
"The principle approved, namely that the Cohesion Fund is only for countries which are not members of EMU, is a new one that bears no relation to the commitments we have accepted and has been rejected by the Commission several times."
"This vote represents a case of retaliation after the event, penalizing the southern European states which have joined EMU. The amendment is an irresponsible act on the part of the PPE, except for its Spanish and Portuguese Members, who will be voting against it."
"For that reason we reject the report."
"Klaß report (A4-0160/98)"
"As usual each year, the Commission submitted its annual report on the state of implementation of the Structural Funds."
"The document submitted for scrutiny by our Assembly relates to 1996 and, more importantly, the third year of the programming period."
"Like our rapporteur, we must express our delight at the way in which the Structural Funds have been used in 1996."
"In fact, we note a 98 % expenditure for available commitments and 95 % for payments."
"However, we cannot award full marks overall since some problems remain."
"A number of large-scale programmes have been delayed and, because of that, the matter of complementarity has not been resolved."
"Finally, how can we fail to endorse the conclusions of our rapporteur regarding the shortfall in terms of Community initiatives and innovative actions?"
"It is indeed regrettable that the total represents more than 70 % of unused appropriations."
"Given this situation, I feel sure that our Parliament - when it gives its opinion on the reform of Structural Funds - will keep a close eye on events and will introduce specific recommendations."
"This is the eighth annual report on Structural Fund spending."
"Mrs Klaß has highlighted a number of problems especially regarding the unsatisfactory take-up in the early part of the current programming period."
"This of course has improved in 1996."
"My own country has always used Structural Funds well and efficiently."
"The successful application of these funds in Ireland has undoubtedly played a significant part in the 'Celtic Tiger' economic performance."
"This makes it all the more important that our access to future structural and cohesion funds does not end abruptly."
"I hope that the Commission will be able to deliver on its promise to ensure that Ireland is designated as an 'Objective 1 region in transition' ."
"Mrs Klaß has presented us with a very dense report, examining the improvements, as well as the shortcomings of European structural policy."
"1996 was a critical year in the 1994-1999 planning phase since, following two years of delays and difficulties, it proved to be a year of intense activity."
"I agree entirely with the comments concerning the budgetary implementation and, especially, the invitation extended to Member States to comply with the three-month deadline for transferring appropriations to the designated recipients."
"The same applies to the partnership principle, which is crucial in setting up viable, sophisticated projects at regional or departmental level."
"I would like to stress this aspect because, as the elected Member for Pas-de-Calais and a member of the monitoring and planning committees, it seems vital to me that we intensify this partnership, which ensures that we avoid mistakes in the future."
"Everybody has something to gain from this, from local and regional elected representatives through to territorial officials and social partners and, finally, the Member State itself."
"The same applies to the principle of additionality, since it lies at the heart of the construction of Europe."
"I have only one comment or, rather, one request to make: Mrs Klaß is right to state that ""the successive adaptations to the financial perspective necessitated by the failure to take up the appropriations available in previous years means that funding will be concentrated at the end of the current programming period."
"The correct conclusions must be drawn from this development in order to improve the situation during the next programming period' ."
"So therefore we must not lose those appropriations, especially if they are attached to a programme that had been delayed for a particular reason; and might not one of the possible solutions be to ask the European Commission to extend the programme?"
"I mention this because I have experienced this situation in the Pas-de-Calais region and we ourselves have considered just such a solution."
"Quite rightly, everybody agrees that the Structural Funds constitute one of the pillars of the construction of Europe, in that they contribute to its economic and social cohesion."
"Therefore, I was even more pleased to hear our rapporteur explain that after two years of groping around in the dark, mainly as a result of the delays that have occurred in the programme authorization procedures, the problems have finally been sorted out and 1996 now seems to have been the first year in which the programming period took off in full flight."
"However, as our rapporteur does, we should still be ready for some problems that are waiting in the wings."
"So, for instance, the systematic monitoring and evaluation of the steps taken continue to pose practical difficulties that still seem to be far from resolved."
"Similarly, the contribution of local authorities and social partners still falls short of the mark, even though it lies at the very heart of the goals set for the current period."
"There is another concern: technological disparities."
"The regions covered by Objectives 1 and 6 certainly give precedence to technological research and development, but in a most uneven way: half of the Objective 1 regions scarcely have the infrastructures needed and exhibit a weak innovative impulse, compared with just a quarter that demonstrate a strong potential in that respect."
"This observation is confirmed by the fact that 60 % of public expenditure set aside for civilian technological research and development in the Union is concentrated on two Member States of the Union: Germany and France."
"In line with our rapporteur, we believe that the lead given to technological R&D, telecommunications and information technology within the context of the Structural Funds might well contribute to a reduction of the existing disparities."
"Yet again, is it really essential that regional managers and practitioners in the field take on the entire decision-making responsibility for research and development in a framework of international competition, which actually belongs to us as a whole?"
"Moreover, too frequently, they pool their efforts to ensure the continued service life in the immediate future of tools that have no real future, to the detriment of lucrative investments that could stimulate economic revival in their region."
"I find the large number of irregularities in the sphere of structural support shocking."
"This matter should have been given more attention in the report."
"When a support system has cases of fraud amounting to ECU 61 million for 1996, something drastic needs to be done."
"The best thing would be to wind up the Structural Funds and restore regional policy for the Member States."
"In large systems it is easier to engage in fraud without being discovered."
"The logical conclusion should be that the current system cannot continue, even if the Commission says it is getting better at discovering irregularities."
"Instead, steps should be taken to abolish the system so that it is simply not possible for irregularities to be perpetrated."
"Viola report (A4-0118/98)"
"We have chosen to vote for Amendment No 6, which emphasizes the fact that winding up duty-free sales will have economic and social consequences."
"However, we would like to point out that these consequences will not only affect island regions, but also various Swedish regions, such as the West Coast, Skåne, and the Stockholm and Kvarken Straits areas."
"Ferry traffic is a necessary prerequisite for cooperation and exchange."
"In certain cases, duty-free sales finance up to 60 % of the costs of this traffic."
"To wind up duty-free sales without providing any form of support for continued ferry traffic would have serious consequences for employment."
"Ferry traffic as a means of communication would be adversely affected."
"This in turn influences the sense of kinship, corporate collaboration and the positive development of business in the affected regions."
"The practical purpose of this report on the problems of island regions is to extend to all island regions those specific measures which up to now have been confined to the ultra-peripheral ones, on the grounds that the Treaty includes a specific section on ultra-peripheral regions and islands."
"The specific position of the ultra-peripheral regions, however, continues to demand special treatment, in recognition of their unique situation, their enormous isolation and distance from mainland Europe and their particular development problems."
"Paradoxically enough, in Agenda 2000 the Commission is withdrawing REGIS from the list of Community initiatives in the proposed framework regulations, and merely re-adopting the 10 % increase in the Community distribution of the Structural Funds."
"In a difficult negotiating context, and in face of a financial outlook that falls short of what is needed to meet the challenges facing the Union, it would not be fair if the unique nature of the island areas had the paradoxical result of reducing the amount of aid to the ultra-peripheral regions as well as the islands."
"In the wake of the new provisions incorporated into the Amsterdam Treaty, recognizing the cultural identity of island regions, our Parliament - aided by the own-initiative report from our colleague - is asked to decide on the measures to be introduced to overcome the handicaps suffered by those regions."
"I myself endorse the recommendations made by our rapporteur, especially with respect to the reform of the Structural Funds."
"This provides us with the opportunity to boost those regions by recognizing, for example, their entitlement to special treatment in taxation matters."
"The European Commission must understand that an official aid policy is required, one that is perfectly in keeping with European law, but one that pursues the goal of harmonious economic development in those island regions."
"Similarly, we must consolidate the support that already exists in certain sectors and I am thinking here of environmental protection."
"This support must be properly balanced."
"Finally, a special effort must be devoted to the question of transport."
"We all know that the competitiveness and economic development of those islands suffer because of the high cost of transport for goods and people."
"We must thus take action at this level by introducing an integrated policy."
"Madeira, Porto Santo and the Azores are particularly deprived island regions in the context of the European Union."
"But they are also ultra-peripheral regions sharing common structural characteristics covered by Objective 1, the defining one being that their per capita GDP is less than 75 % of the Community average."
"It is true that some situations apply to all islands."
"But it is no less true that some of those islands have a level of economic development equal to that of some of the richest Member States of the European Union."
"And it would not be appropriate in this case for us to treat different situations in the same way; that is to say, such wealthy regions need no special assistance."
"This is why I consider it important to separate the wheat from the tares."
"The necessary solidarity between the most highlydeveloped countries of the European Union and the most under-developed regions must be based on pre-defined and easily measurable principles, which must continue to include the per capita GDP."
"Mr Viola has produced a commendable work."
"It is a pity that his loyalty to his island has led him to support policies of indiscriminate privilege, which do not conform to the principle of economic and social cohesion."
"I therefore hope that the debate and the vote on the report will make it possible to restore the European Union's responsibility for its island regions to its proper proportions, without prejudice to the provisions of the Treaty on the ultra-peripheral regions, and I would remind the House that these consist only of Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries and the French overseas departments."
"Island communities throughout the European Union are seriously disadvantaged."
"Ireland is both an island country and a country with a number of small islands off its coastline."
"We therefore fully understand the problems."
"I believe that the production of Mr Viola's report is both timely and opportune, particularly as it comes in advance of the forthcoming reform of structural fund regulations."
"I support the proposal that the special needs of islands should be acknowledged in changes to these funds."
"This is especially important to Ireland's island population, particularly as we are likely to lose our Objective 1 status."
"The proposals to examine transport, alternative energy and tourism as sectors where innovative measures could be applied are worthy of consideration."
"The production of 'island quality produce' and the introduction of financial and tax incentives are also interesting ideas which would provide answers to the long-term survival of the island way of life."
"Very briefly, I shall be voting in favour of this matter which is so important to the island regions, especially since I drafted an opinion."
"I am sure the Commission will have taken good note of the requests we have made during today's long, emotional debate to establish compensatory measures to address the situation faced by islands. I am sure the Commission will also be able to provide an adequate response to the dual insularity or double discrimination suffered by small islands with a population of less than 100 000, such as Minorca."
"Since time is short, I base my position on the speech I made earlier today."
"We maintain and insist that the Community structural policy provided and continues to provide insufficient funds, has a levelling effect when applied and is unbalanced and unfair in that it fundamentally and deliberately ignores local differences between regions and areas."
"Given this distorting influence, it is only to be expected that there continues to be divergence rather than convergence and cohesion and that the situation in poor areas is getting worse, especially in the mountainous and island regions in the Community covered by the report under discussion."
"The report contains accurate findings and appropriate proposals."
"However, within the report, paragraphs 2 and 4 pervert and distort the real aims of cohesion and everything else which has been promised."
"To be specific, we consider that a ceiling of 75 % of GDP, which the rapporteur contests, is already too high and will deny assistance to a large number of areas with serious, fundamental structural problems, including the Greek islands, whose GDP is less than 60 % of the Community average and which account for some 42 % of the inhabited island regions of the Union."
"Secondly, the proposal to classify island regions under the administrative regional divisions set out in NUTS III is an indirect but clear way of ensuring that they are included in financing for less developed regions and that parts of undeveloped regions obtain assistance, thereby reducing the level of assistance to poorer countries. This is proven by the Structural Fund financing percentages for the 1994-1999 period which show funding down approximately 20 % for Greece and Portugal and up 45 % for Germany and 20 % for Spain."
"There is yet another unacceptable aspect to this blatantly unfair treatment, which is becoming increasingly worse: the exclusion of the Greek islands from the operating programmes of the Community support framework for energy, transport and communications which, as we all know, are the most serious problems facing these regions."
"Finally, I would like to draw attention to a very particular and important problem faced solely by the Aegean islands which has never earned the attention it merits, despite repeated reminders. I refer to Turkish expansionism, which is tolerated in the upper echelons and by insiders at the EU and which, apart from anything else, impedes the development of the islands in these regions and prevents them from acquiring the confidence of investors and any investment activity."
"Our fear is that the regional and structural policy of the Union is being mapped out using measurements made by a very peculiar pair of compasses which shape programmes and regional, that is, island assistance, not in accordance with fundamental problems and real needs but in order to accommodate the interests which prevail at the time."
"At a time when a new Community support framework is being set up, with the aim of implementing the principle, or rather the objective, of economic and social cohesion enshrined in the Treaty, we should in my opinion be concerned with three very specific situations."
"Firstly, we should look at rural areas, which have suffered from creeping depopulation and desertification as a result of an unbalanced common agricultural policy.-Secondly, consideration must be given to areas of serious poverty and social marginalization in big cities that are considered to be wealthy when taken as a whole; -And finally, we need to consider island areas, which have very special problems and therefore need special structural aid.While the inclusion in the Amsterdam Treaty of an express reference to those particular needs, even if only in the form of a declaration annexed to it, and therefore of a lesser specific legal weight, is a step in the right direction, it is necessary and even imperative that we should give practical expression to that show of political will."
"The Viola report quite rightly draws attention to the problem of double insularity."
"This means that in many archipelagos the development effort is often channelled into the governing island or centre, thus creating further regional disparities."
"I therefore support the Viola report."
"The fact that a special report has now been prepared on the problems facing the island regions of the EU is a positive development."
"I am, for the most part, giving my backing to the report, but I would like to emphasize the following points."
"There is a risk that the current proposal in Agenda 2000 regarding the future of the Structural Funds will mean a deterioration in EU support compared with the situation today, when aid provided under Objective 5b ceases and is incorporated into the more generalized Objective 2 system of aid."
"The reportʼs proposal of a special form of aid for islands within the scope of Objective 1 aid is therefore a positive development."
"I would particularly like to emphasize that not all islands have the same problems simply because they are islands."
"There is a massive difference between a large island such as Sicily, the home of the rapporteur, and the hundreds of small islands in the archipelagos of Stockholm, Åland and Åboland."
"This must be taken into account during the implementation of the proposal."
"The proposal made under point 29 of a European year for the islands - with the possibility of a Forum on the islands, in Brussels, for example - seems rather unwarranted."
"A better proposal might be a European ""court' for the islands, in which the problems of the islands are discussed every year on a European island, together with an evaluation of programmes and Structural Funds for the islands."
"The Viola report relating to island regions is a very comprehensive text that highlights the natural handicaps and socio-economic difficulties suffered by those islands."
"He quite rightly emphasizes the need to adapt corporate policies to their special needs."
"Thus, he proposes in their favour an entire range of measures that are, on occasion, interesting, even if they appear at times to be somewhat overzealous: compensation to cover higher transport costs, preserving and promoting the cultural and natural heritage, sanitary equipment and drainage, the development of new power sources to reduce island dependence on external supplies, waste disposal and so forth."
"Some of these measures, however, run counter to the convictions of our group: for instance, paragraph 35 relating to the common agricultural policy, which calls for the incorporation of ""corrective factors for aid on the basis of the size of the farm, the area in which it is situated...' , rather than the size of the active workforce engaged in that operation, as we propose."
"Nevertheless, this report reveals a major defect: it is blatantly federalist in persuasion."
"It appeals for an integrated policy in favour of island regions."
"It seeks to confer considerable powers upon the Commission, in contempt of the most basic subsidiarity and even asks it to cofinance projects, whereas - let us not forget - those finances do not fall within the purview of the Commission, but the European Union."
"It also cherishes the notion of coordinating tax measures in favour of islands, although taxation is one of the pillars of sovereignty."
"Our group, anxious to demonstrate the interest it seeks to convey with regard to the problems of islands, has tabled about ten amendments and several requests for a separate vote to get rid of this federalist leaning and make it wholly acceptable."
"That is why the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has been unable to approve the Viola report."
"Mr President, I am not totally convinced with the answer you just gave."
"I am happy to accept that it was a corrigendum and that we therefore had recitals A to K. What is certain now is that we should have arranged them in the same order in the voting list."
"You, Mr President of the sitting, are one of the rare Vice-Presidents, who, in my view, allows the votes to take place in the correct order, that is, firstly the votes on the amendments, then the texts they relate to, and to end with, the final text."
"So, in this situation, I think that we should have voted on recital K."
"Thank you for your comment."
"Nevertheless, all of the Presidents of the sitting follow the same procedure, which is determined by the President of our Parliament."
"We are his humble servants."
"I hereby declare that Parliament has completed its agenda."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 1.00 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 28 May 1998."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Thursday, 28 May 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, last Friday Mr Eric Tabarly, a very distinguished French yachtsman, was knocked overboard in heavy seas off the Welsh coast and is missing, presumed drowned."
"My father, Sir Francis Chichester, was a great competitor of Mr Tabarly's."
"I would just like to pay my tribute to this very great, French, single-handed yachtsman, and I crave your indulgence, Mr President, for so doing."
"Mr President, as I speak a football match is taking place in Marseilles between England and Tunisia."
"The latest score is 2-0."
"It has finished and it is 2-0."
"However, I was very concerned, indeed, to hear of the actions by mindless hooligans during that match, and I want to say to this House that the behaviour of those people in no way represents the genuine English football fans who are as disgusted and appalled as any by the behaviour of those people in France."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I intended to vote against, instead of for, Amendment No 4 to the Arias Cañete report."
"I wish the record to be changed, if possible."
"Mr President, I wish to speak about something that does not concern the Minutes, but is a question of procedure."
"This week the results of the working party's discussion on MEPs' pay, travel and other expenses will be made known here."
"These have been leaked to the public, to the Swedish press for example."
"We Finnish parliamentarians, at least some of us, have had to answer questions on this working party's conclusions."
"I do not know whether they are right or wrong, but this kind of leak must not be allowed to happen."
"We have to be familiar with the contents of a report at least at the same time as the media, to be able to reply to the questions we are asked."
"Mrs Matikainen-Kallström, I think Mr Martin wants to speak about the same subject."
"Mr President, the Press Services have just drawn my attention to the coverage in the Swedish press of the Members' Statute."
"I wish to say that, firstly, they are not leaks, because they are entirely inaccurate: they do not reflect the contents of the report."
"Mr President, as you know, the report will go to the Bureau tonight and until it has been to the Bureau it is not an official document of this House."
"Secondly, the report does not mention a salary at all."
"It simply suggests that, in future, an MEP's salary should be a percentage of a judge at the Court of Justice's salary but does not mention what that percentage should be; and, thirdly, it states that the percentage should be set by common accord between this Parliament and the Council, so Parliament would not be able to act unilaterally to set its own salary."
"The reports and the figures quoted in the Swedish media are entirely inaccurate."
"Mr Martin, you have just answered it for me."
"Mr President, unlike the previous speakers, I would like to make a point about pages 17 and 18 of the Minutes and the vote on the Arias Cañete report."
"An amendment was tabled to this report, Amendment No 1, which was the subject, on the one hand, of a request for a roll-call vote, on the part of the GUE/NGL group, and on the other hand, for a split vote, on the part of our group."
"The results of the roll-call vote are recorded in the Minutes, both for the first and the second part of Amendment No 1. However, in the results of the roll-call vote, in the Annex to the Minutes, we are told that the roll-call list for the first part of Amendment No 1 will not be published for technical reasons."
"I would like to ask you why this is, and if any measures have been taken to ensure that such an incident does not happen again."
"In fact, I think that as regards requests for roll-call votes, it is not just a question of having the exact result, but it is also a question of knowing how the votes are divided up for each group."
"So, have measures been taken to ensure that such regrettable events do not reoccur?"
"Certainly, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"The electronic system broke down."
"We have done everything we can to ensure that this problem does not reoccur, and in particular to ensure that the electronic system in the new building is even more advanced and at least provides us with the possibility of an alternative system."
"Mr President, I am getting a little disoriented, because I am constantly seeing something approaching on my left, on your right, and it says PPE here."
"But I no longer know whether that is the right name, and whether since the merging with everything related to the Allianza Nazionale and so on, there will merely be one group here in this Chamber as far as cooperation is concerned."
"Could you please establish that the centre will remain here where I stand?"
"Mr Wijsenbeek, it is a matter of Members' freedom, which I am sure you recognize."
"Mr President, I wish to draw attention to this magazine called the Parliament magazine which purports to be a record, and to represent the opinions, of this House."
"This is a special edition on nuclear safety, for which I was asked to write a piece, which was later censured because of the heavy advertising of the nuclear industry in this magazine."
"Either this does or does not represent the views of Members and if it does represent the views then it should not be censured in this way."
"If this happens in future, I would like Parliament to request that this masthead be removed from this magazine."
"I will be distributing to Members the article which I was asked to write for the magazine on the nuclear question so that we will not be censured in this House."
"It is a private magazine."
"If they reduce the length of the articles which are given to them, unfortunately we cannot do anything about that, because it is freedom of expression."
"It is not an official magazine of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, that is my point: it should not purport to be an official magazine and should not carry the masthead or purport to represent the views of this House."
"We will check that it is not, in any case."
"Mr President, I just wish to make two points."
"Firstly, I wrote to you in connection with the Arias Cañete vote, because there was some confusion there."
"Secondly, could the Commission make a statement to the House this week regarding the recent Court of Justice ruling, which effectively means that many of the NGOs and the programmes that most directly affect the people of the Community have been put on hold as a result of this Court of Justice opinion of 12 May."
"This is causing considerable alarm and great distress to many NGOs which have had their funding put on hold as a result of this Court case."
"If the Commission is not going to make a statement about this week, why not?"
"And, if not, could it make one at the next part-session at the beginning of July in Brussels?"
"That has been raised in the trialogue, and we are seeking clarification of the question you raised."
"Mr President, briefly and sadly I wish to inform this House that a fishing boat from Mallaig, a small town in the far north-west of my area, was split in two by a German tanker."
"It sank instantly with the total loss of crew."
"The saddest thing of all is that they are all from the same very small town, which is devastated."
"I wonder if it would not be impertinent to ask if you could perhaps write some kind of letter of condolence."
"I can assure you that I will do that immediately."
"Mr President, I believe I speak on behalf of the vast majority of the people of England, and I use the term 'England' today advisedly, to say that we are shocked, angered and ashamed at the antics of certain people in a French town who have purported to be English soccer fans!"
"I wish to say to the people of France that I apologize for their behaviour."
"I would particularly like to apologize for the behaviour of those English fans who have been attacking French citizens of North African descent."
"They are fascist thugs!"
"They do not represent the people of England."
"I wish to conclude by saying that if this behaviour continues, then the British Government and the English Football Association should consider withdrawing the English team from the World Cup."
"Mr President, if we are going to sympathize with every misfortune that occurs in the European Union, or at least many of them - and indeed rightly so - I would like to ask that we also acknowledge the rail accident which occurred in Germany and I would ask you to write a letter of condolence to those involved."
"You are absolutely right, Mrs Mann."
"In any case, I can inform you that I sent telegrams expressing this Parliament's condolences to the German authorities, the President of the Bundestag and the Chancellor immediately after the accident."
"Mr President, I assume that you too will have heard that dioxin levels from the wasteincineration plant in Strasbourg have been as high as 360 nanograms."
"In Germany 0.1 nanograms are permitted - I say this to give you an idea of the dimensions, that is those of you who do not work in the environmental field."
"We could perhaps say that this is our job, but we must show concern for our colleagues so I would politely ask you to write to the authorities in Strasbourg to ask that this waste-incineration plant be closed down immediately, as we have a responsibility towards our colleagues."
"I shall tell the mayor this evening. He is dining with the Bureau."
"Mr President, as you are aware we have a serious problem with Sellafield and British Nuclear Fuels that cannot be ignored."
"I would like to call on you, in your capacity as President of this Parliament, to demand that the Commission investigate BNFL which has already applied to the British Government to considerably increase discharges from its nuclear operations into the Irish Sea and which would result in over thirty billion litres of effluent being released into the Irish Sea over the next ten years."
"Secondly, that BNFL and Siemens, the German..."
"(Interruption by the President )"
"I am sorry, Mr Fitzsimons, there have been quite a lot of resolutions on Sellafield, and I cannot add anything to what this Parliament has already said."
"Mr President, we have changed the subject now, but I cannot help going back to what we were talking about a little earlier."
"A short while ago, a British Member very rightly said that people who behaved badly with the French at football matches do not represent the whole of Great Britain but a part that he and many others disown."
"I am happy to hear this."
"I would nonetheless like to recall here that when the Italian police were put on the alert for a match in Italy, given the fact that the bravado of these fans was no secret and that prevention is the best thing - it is better to prevent problems than to try and solve them afterwards - the British press unfortunately severely attacked Italy and the Italian Government."
"So, considering......"
"(Interruption by the President)"
"Mrs Marinucci, we cannot start telling stories about incidents at football matches."
"This is not the time."
"Mr President, thank you for your letter which I received today in reply to my question to you."
"I noticed in your letter that the Bureau will be meeting tonight, 15 June, to discuss the 50 % attendance."
"Will they take into consideration the contents of your letter which seems to indicate that the majority of people not able to attend 50 % of the votes have some difficulties in either arriving in Strasbourg or departing from Strasbourg?"
"I do think that some consideration should be given to these points."
"Of course, I expect that Members of the groups will discuss these matters within their own groups and reach a final decision on it."
"You can be absolutely certain of that."
"Mr President, I would actually like to endorse what was said by a number of my colleagues, as well as by David Martin, about Members' salaries."
"A similar article appeared on the front pages of the Dutch regional press."
"I would like to ask you as a matter of urgency, Mr President, whether you could issue a press statement this evening, perhaps jointly with the working party, saying what is true and what is not."
"It is absolutely essential that, for once, this is also reported."
"I also have a second comment."
"Today is the deadline for tabling amendments to next year's calendar of part-sessions."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party would greatly appreciate it if we had a little bit more time to talk about the agenda."
"Amendments to this agenda are not terribly labourious."
"I would therefore like to ask you if it might be possible for us in the group to have until tomorrow, let us say until 7.30 p.m., to do something about it."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, you are absolutely right."
"If there are no more interruptions, I hope we shall have approved the agenda before 7.30 p.m., and the matter can be discussed in the political groups."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Calendar of part-sessions 1999"
"The Conference of Presidents has decided to propose the following calendar of part-sessions for 1999:"
"11 to 15 January27 to 28 January8 to 12 February24 to 25 February8 to 12 March24 to 25 March12 to 16 April3 to 7 May20 to 23 July13 to 17 September4 to 8 October18 to 22 October3 to 4 November15 to 19 November1 to 2 December13 to 17 December"
"The deadline for tabling amendments to these dates is 8.30 p.m. this evening, which gives an extra half an hour for the political groups to discuss it."
"Mr President, that was not what I meant."
"I have a feeling that we should have a look at the Dutch-Spanish interpretation."
"I do not think it is always all that good."
"I had asked whether we could have until tomorrow evening to table the amendments, tomorrow evening until 7.30 p.m."
"It would be impossible to set the deadline as 8.30 p.m. tomorrow, but we could make it 12.00 noon tomorrow."
"Mr President, if this might lead to problems as far as translating is concerned; they are extremely simple amendments."
"That is my first point."
"But we could also vote on Thursday."
"Why not?"
"We will also be voting on the Cardiff resolution on Thursday, an important topic, so we could also do this on Thursday."
"So I would like to ask you if we could have until 8.00 p.m. tomorrow to table amendments."
"In that case there is no problem."
"If the vote takes place on Thursday instead of Wednesday, the deadline for tabling amendments can be 8.00 p.m. tomorrow."
"Amendment of Rule 48"
"The next item is the report (A4-0293/97) by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the amendment of Rule 48 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure on written declarations."
"Mr President, Mr Dell'Alba has been detained and has asked me to take his place as rapporteur, which I am of course happy to do."
"Mr Dell'Alba's report relates to an amendment to Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, which concerns written declarations."
"This amendment to the rule is based on a proposal for an amendment to the Rules of Procedure submitted by Mrs Aglietta in October 1996, pursuant to Rule 163 which states that any Member may propose an amendment to the Rules of Procedure and have it referred to the committee responsible."
"This proposal related to Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure and was drawn up on the basis of a decision by the enlarged Bureau on 7 July 1989, according to which written declarations (Rule 65 of the previous Rules of Procedure) cannot be signed by more than one Member when being submitted."
"Following this proposal, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, which appointed Mr Dell'Alba as rapporteur, drew up four amendments to Rule 48, which I would like to summarize briefly."
"The first amendment relates to the fact that, up until now, only individual Members have been able to submit written declarations of not more than 200 words."
"It aims to allow written declarations to be signed by up to five Members, in order to take account of the fact that within Parliament there are many collective actions and that it must also be possible for written declarations to be submitted by several Members."
"The declaration must then be entered in a register, along with the names of the signatories."
"The second proposal is that the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities wants the declaration to be included in a register located in the immediate vicinity of the Chamber."
"Until now, Members had to sign written declarations in an office which was not always very easy to find, which explains this reference to the location of the register."
"Other important changes include the fact that when a declaration has been signed by more than one half of the component Members of Parliament, the President will immediately inform Parliament of it, and the declaration will immediately be forwarded to the institutions to which it is addressed."
"In addition, it will be included in the Minutes of proceedings of the last sitting of the corresponding part-session."
"Those are the various amendments that have been introduced."
"They will make it easier for Members to exercise their right to table declarations."
"In a way, it is a kind of democratization, an additional step towards a more broadly based democracy, which makes the right to submit such declarations for possible signatories a reality."
"I would like to add that in addition to the four amendments tabled by the Rules Committee, which were in fact approved unanimously, a fifth amendment was tabled by Mrs Crawley and Mr Janssen van Raay, who would like such declarations to be entered in a register."
"This is of course already contained in Mr Dell'Alba's report, but this fifth amendment would mean that the names of the signatories would also be recorded."
"Personally, I wonder if it would not be rather labourious to enter not only the declaration, with the names of the initial signatories, but also the names of all those who have signed it."
"I have not been able to determine the rapporteur's feelings on this matter and I am therefore only giving you my personal opinion: I believe that it would be somewhat tedious."
"Mr President, that is a brief summary of the proposal that has been submitted to you by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"I call upon the House to approve these amendments."
"Mr President, I should like to say that I will be broadly supporting the Dell'Alba report that has been put in front of us by Mr Fayot, the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"There is a past history to this report."
"It used to be possible - at least in the previous Parliament - for Members to collect signatures on the basis of Rule 48 resolutions which meant that on a reasonable number of occasions - perhaps three or four times a year - the requirement of half of the Members of Parliament signing was actually achieved."
"The reason that was changed some time ago was due to rather over-enthusiastic lobbying - some might say arm-twisting - by one of the opposition groups, which led to a demand for a change in the interpretation of the Rules."
"The present interpretation was adopted which, in fact, only allows for one initial signature to be on a Rule 48 resolution and for people having to sign it in a special office, which avoids having to walk a line of people demanding that they actually sign up to particular Rule 48 resolutions."
"The result of this has been essentially to kill Rule 48 as a means of getting a resolution passed."
"On only one single occasion in the past three years have we actually obtained the necessary number of signatures, and that was fairly recently on a Rule 48 resolution on violence against women."
"While the Dell'Alba report addresses a minor part of this problem, we will be supporting it save possibly, in my view, Amendment No 3, which means that we will no longer get a running total of how many Members have signed, or the second part of Amendment No 1 which seems to be overly cumbersome and not recognize the procedure which is actually followed in the office - because you do have a record of who has already signed."
"Nevertheless it would have been preferable to return to the status quo ante , but that would require Members to be sufficiently confident of their politics that they did not feel the need to be protected against overly attentive lobbying."
"Obviously this is not the case in this Parliament."
"Hopefully the next Parliament will have more about it than the present body or the lobbyists will have less about them."
"Mr President, Mr Ford has spoken about the history of Rule 48."
"The question now is about the opening up of democracy and returning to somewhere nearer Parliament's former position."
"It is about allowing Members not only a clearer and more positive way to express their own political points of view on matters of topical and international interest, but also, perhaps more importantly, the chance to put down a motion on behalf of their constituents - those they were elected to represent."
"The rapporteur should be congratulated for his amendments which generally, with the reservations that have been outlined by the previous speaker, seek to simplify these rights and opportunities and also to make the publication of the motions more open and more easily available."
"Mr Dell'Alba, the rapporteur, has also made provision for more than one Member to initiate the process, and five Members collectively may do so."
"Once again Mr Ford has outlined the history of this process and I need not go into it any further."
"Many reports are complex and lengthy."
"This report and the amendments distinguish themselves by their simplicity and clarity of presentation."
"These features are also reflected in the aims and objectives of the report, which are clarity, openness and simplicity and those are objectives which this Parliament should welcome and which we should be supporting."
"It is for these reasons that I and my group have no problem supporting this motion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Article 366a of the Fourth ACP-EC Convention"
"The next item is the report (A4-0194/98) by Mrs Aelvoet, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the draft Council Decision on the procedure for implementing Article 366a of the Fourth ACP-EC Convention (5644/98 - C4-0156/98-96/0050(AVC))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in January last year the Council consulted the European Parliament about the proposal for a Council decision on a framework procedure for implementing Article 366a of the Fourth Lomé Convention, as revised in 1995."
"This is the article that stipulates that in the event of an ACP state having failed to fulfil the essential components of the Convention, namely respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, this can lead to the suspension, either partially or fully, of the Convention."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation subsequently decided to draw up an interim report pursuant to Article 80(3) of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, and also called for the opening of a conciliation procedure with the Council."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation, followed in this by this entire Parliament during the part-session of June 1997, laid down recommendations in the interim report to amend the Commission's text so as to give Parliament the right of assent on each proposal to suspend or resume cooperation."
"The Commission's text had proposed that Parliament merely be informed afterwards."
"Unfortunately the Council's response on 6 March 1998 completely ignored the opinion of this Parliament, arguing that the assent of the European Parliament is, legally speaking, completely ruled out."
"The situation has not improved because the Treaty of Amsterdam, which will be ratified by the fifteen Member States at the beginning of next year, provides only for information to be given to Parliament subsequently in such matters."
"We do not have a legal leg to stand on to enforce this assent from the Council."
"It would therefore have been enough for the Council to wait until the beginning of next year to present us with a fait accompli during the implementation procedure."
"That is why we responded very quickly in this interim report and developed a fallback position which amounts to the setting up of a consultation procedure instead of an assent procedure."
"We are therefore taking a step backwards, but are still asking for a little bit more than has been provided for according to the letter of the Treaty."
"For that matter, this request for consultation is not new."
"When we were discussing the Oostlander report on enlargement towards central and eastern Europe Mr Henderson, President-in-Office of the Council, gave us a commitment which goes in the same direction, namely that Parliament would be given a suitable opportunity to express its views to the Council before the Council takes a decision; a perfect description of consultation, in fact."
"That is why, as a result of this decision and Mr Henderson's statement, I immediately contacted the President-in-Office responsible for development cooperation, namely Mrs Clare Short, to ask her whether the British presidency would also grant consultation to the European Parliament."
"In the meantime we have had two discussions with text proposals which are aimed in the right direction."
"Not everything has been acquired yet, but we are on the road to consultation."
"It is essential that we conclude this issue before the end of the British presidency, which is approaching fast."
"That is why we have an interim report proposal before us, which received unanimous support from the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"The essential components are provided for in parliamentary consultation."
"Secondly, Council decisions must be made by qualified majority in the case of a partial suspension of the Convention, and unanimously in the case of a full suspension."
"To give you a clear idea of this, ladies and gentlemen, even in the case of Nigeria, the full Convention has not been suspended."
"It is therefore only in highly exceptional circumstances that unanimity would be called for."
"The third element is obviously the call for conciliation with the Council, in active cooperation with the Commission."
"I therefore venture to express the hope that approval of this report may lead to us being able to reach an agreement with the presidency within a few weeks time."
"Mr President, Mrs Aelvoet deserves recognition in drawing our attention to a very important issue, in order to stress the role of the European Parliament in such a very remarkable situation as the EU reacting to the fact that human rights are being flouted in a country working in cooperation with ourselves."
"I also congratulate her on being so coherent in this matter earlier on."
"It has to be said that it is not just a matter here of the European Parliament getting its opinion across and having the opportunity to discuss it. This is also linked to that big problem the EU has at the moment, namely its approval by the general public."
"It is very easy to imagine that Parliament might well have been rebuffed here on judicial grounds, for political reasons."
"However, I do not wish to claim that that is the case."
"That is why it would be a good idea to approve this report and take it very seriously."
"Furthermore, it must be realized that the matter will be taken more seriously in the country in which these human rights violations have occurred if the European Parliament focuses attention on it in its capacity as a public forum."
"Mrs Aelvoet's report deserves support and I hope it will be approved with not too much opposition."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur very warmly for her work, and as she described the whole legal background for us with her usual clarity I would now like to go into some political aspects of this procedure in the two minutes I have available. It has become a tradition in the European Parliament that we ask our partners in development cooperation: ""How do you deal with human rights?"
"How do you manage the running of the state effectively, in terms of good governance? How do you ensure legal certainty for your citizens in the legal system?'"
"I believe we must not limit the discussion to the area of human rights alone. We must always bear in mind the other two areas as well."
"Of course, one is not necessarily conceivable without the other, but from that point of view we have actually always adopted this joint approach in discussions."
"With this procedure - if we implement it in the way the rapporteur described - we have clear legal certainty for the ACP partner countries and beyond, as we are in the process of extending our cooperation to include to a greater extent the least developed countries which do not belong to the ACP."
"Some parts of this procedure could therefore be applied here."
"It is sometimes noticeable that when human rights violations, bad administration and corrupt government persist for a long time, the stringency with which such sanctions are applied occasionally diminishes to some extent."
"I believe we should agree to proceed with equal intensity wherever we observe such shortcomings, and must continue to do so resolutely until the situation improves."
"Mr President, the Union is getting the opportunity to give its human rights policy flesh and blood."
"The democracy and human rights clause can be made real by the Commission proposals."
"With these proposals, operational agreements are being made about how the democracy clause should be used, and on the basis of which criteria."
"The Union has a powerful instrument in its hands with the human rights clause, and should also wish to use it."
"Clear criteria and procedures will increase the transparency of EU policy."
"The countries concerned will also show more understanding of EU policy, and they will have an impetus to stick to the criteria."
"That is why it all started."
"However, the present state of affairs in this debate on procedure is extremely disappointing."
"The Council wants to decide on the use of the democracy clause alone."
"My group utterly disagrees with this."
"Informing Parliament about the suspension of Lomé cooperation, for example, is by no means enough."
"In these kinds of situations public pressure from Europe's representative body is needed."
"Initiating Lomé cooperation requires assent from the European Parliament."
"So it should follow that this same Parliament should also give its assent to the suspension of cooperation."
"The Council's reluctant attitude should not deter us from our principal position, namely that democratic participation and control is a primary requirement."
"The Council and Parliament must consult with each other in order to find a solution to this conflict."
"We should not surrender something in advance."
"The Council has also given the European Parliament a considerable role in the context of the accession partnership, after all."
"For that matter, this also applies to the start of the procedure."
"Not only should the Council and the Commission be able to initiate a suspension procedure and dialogue with a country, but the European Parliament should also be able to request this."
"The rapporteur rightly asks for this in her report, of which I greatly approve."
"This Parliament plays an important role in the human rights policy of the Union, and the ACP Joint Assembly is also an important instrument."
"On the basis of this, the European Parliament deserves to be given an important role in the entire suspension procedure."
"Incidentally, that is true not only of the suspension of cooperation, but also when cooperation is resumed."
"Precisely now, when the Union wants to make cooperation in the Lomé context more political, the parliamentary dimension must be strengthened, otherwise it does not have a leg to stand on politically."
"Which ACP country, for instance, will allow itself to be convinced by a moralistic European Union, which itself also violates democratic principles?"
"Mr President, I support a strong political dimension for the new cooperation agreements with the ACP countries, especially in the fields of human rights and good government under rule of law."
"It is right that we should consistently emphasize the importance we attach to the steady integration of the ACP countries into the world economy and that new trade arrangements should be compatible with those operating within the World Trade Organization."
"In fact, remaining tariff barriers must and should be removed to the greatest extent possible so that some element of fairness and equality of market access can be introduced."
"In negotiating new ACP agreements, it is essential to stress the need for simplification and rationalization of aid instruments with a view to gradual evolution towards direct budgetary support for African states."
"Due care and attention must be shown so that as trade liberalization takes place no damage is done to the fragile working of the African economies."
"I welcome the declarations which were issued by the leaders of the G8 nations, following their meeting in England last month, relating to reducing the debt which African countries may have to pay back to the wealthier countries in the Western world."
"As the new millennium approaches, African states will not be able to make that stride to self-sufficiency if they continue to be crippled with debt repayments."
"The Western leaders must put in place structures and procedures to ensure that blanket reductions do not apply to all African states across the board."
"Mr President, I, in turn, would like to express my complete agreement with the Group of the European Radical Alliance on the two main proposals contained in the report by Mrs Aelvoet."
"Firstly, in June 1997 we asked that the European Parliament be able to give its assent to the Council in the case of suspension of the Convention."
"However, it would seem that such a provision would be contrary to the Amsterdam Treaty."
"We accept this, but consider that this is yet another example of the Treaty's inadequacy."
"Having said that, we agree with the simple consultation procedure proposed by the rapporteur so that Parliament can at least give its opinion a priori ."
"In addition, following the example of the rapporteur, we think that the European Parliament, just like the Commission or any Member State, should have a power of initiative for the suspension of the application of the Convention."
"I, for my part, am not certain that in a classic, orthodox view of the separation of powers, a parliamentary initiative of this type is valid."
"However, as a militant and firm believer in European federalism, I would say that until the institutions provide Parliament with real legislative power, we will have to encourage similar encroachments by our House on the executive role."
"Nonetheless, with the speed at which the framework procedure for the implementation of Article 366a of the Lomé Convention is being set up, there is a risk that it will really not have enough time to be applied."
"That is why I would like once again to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to one of the provisions contained in the Rocard report on the future of cooperation between the Union and the ACP countries."
"Mr Rocard had proposed - and our House had followed his lead - that the criteria relating to democracy and respect for human rights on which aid would depend should be defined by the recipient countries themselves."
"I believe this proposal would improve the political legitimacy of the provision on conditionality and would lead to increased efficiency."
"But although we agree on the substance of the proposal, we must realize that its adoption would involve the ACP in the procedure itself."
"We cannot ask these countries to define the criteria for aid, and therefore conversely those relating to the suspension of the Convention, without involving them in the decision to suspend aid to their country."
"Consequently, we need to use our imagination and work to restore the balance of the entire procedure, so that it becomes an example of a truly fair cooperation policy."
"Mr President, we support this request and particularly the idea behind it, although in our opinion it does not go far enough."
"A consultation procedure is certainly necessary; an assent procedure would be the better solution."
"We wish to announce one thing now: if there should be no solution during the British presidency, we will try to persuade the Austrian Government that this topic should be accorded particular importance after the change of presidency."
"I also have a few general comments on this very important issue."
"On the basis of its own history, Europe should proceed with great caution in the field of human rights."
"If Parliament succeeds in dealing with this problem itself, every care will have to be taken and we will have to ensure that we are not tempted to make generalized premature judgements."
"The fact that we are becoming active in this area is to be welcomed, but each individual case must be examined closely."
"The relevant countries, which are grouped together here, are at very different stages of economic development."
"A measure may affect one country very severely and another less so."
"The list of human rights which are constantly mentioned does not include, for example, the right to food and education, a right which is threatened when cooperation is terminated due to a lack of democratic development."
"One thing we must bear in mind is that our role is not to act as judge, but to promote and support democratic development in the individual countries."
"Mr President, it has never been so important for the European Union to provide itself with a mechanism for suspending cooperation relations when human rights violations take place."
"This is shown by the great number of urgent resolutions in this Parliament, which devotes a special heading to human rights, session after session."
"By definition, that mechanism - insofar as it is a legal instrument - has to work, both for the sake of the credibility of the EU's foreign actions, which is now somewhat reduced, and, above all, as an inescapable requirement for the real achievement of the objectives established in the Treaties."
"In order for it to work, the procedure for implementing the human rights clause cannot depend on unanimity in the Council, or pass through Parliament surreptitiously for information only."
"The system of unanimity in the Council is unanimously recognized as causing paralysis in the decision making process."
"We have known that ever since the empty chair crisis of 1966, and we are aware of it now, when one of the challenges of enlargement is to modify a decision making procedure which, being based on unanimity, is not flexible enough."
"So we do not think Parliament is making a revolutionary request in asking for decisions on this important matter to be adopted by majority."
"The Council should not view this proposal with suspicion, because it is not an attempt to attack the current interests of the Member States, but to strengthen the policy and interests of the European Union in accordance with the principles established in the Treaties."
"For Parliament to request to be consulted on one of the areas of foreign policy which most affects it - human rights - is not only not revolutionary, as Mrs Aelvoet says in her report's explanatory statement, but is entirely reasonable."
"Consulting Parliament would have avoided a lot of the contradictory situations we now find ourselves in. For example, in this very partsession we will be presenting a resolution on Equatorial Guinea, which has just passed 15 death sentences, asking the Commission to think again about resuming cooperation with that country."
"Let us provide ourselves with the necessary mechanism to sanction the violation of human rights, so basic and essential, and let us do it properly, with transparency and, above all, with guarantees."
"Mr President, I apologize to the House for not being in my place when the debate started."
"Unfortunately my plane was late."
"I congratulate Mrs Aelvoet on this excellent report."
"The PPE Group unanimously supports it."
"Suspension is a very serious matter and it is important that Parliament's views are heard."
"However, it is important to remember that the assent procedure very much ties us in to what happened in Amsterdam."
"If we cannot have that, then at least we should be allowed to comment when some situation like this arises."
"We in Parliament also have to accept that there can be various kinds of situations."
"For example, there was the horrendous situation in Nigeria when the former president hanged 19 people."
"In such cases, where serious violations of human rights have taken place, the Commission may want to suspend a country immediately."
"In others a very slow process may be building up where, simply because of what is happening in the country, it may be possible to alleviate the situation before it goes too far."
"For instance, I have just been in the Comoros and was quite horrified by the situation which appears to be building up there."
"One island, Anjouan, has declared independence and, at the same time, it expects to continue to get aid from the European Union."
"We pointed out to them quite clearly that they could not continue to be in Lomé if they had declared their independence."
"It may be that eventually we will have to suspend them."
"That is the sort of situation which we should discuss."
"Human rights and democracy are vital to our continued support for developing nations."
"Quite honestly, good governance is probably even more important."
"I would have thought that Africa was the natural continent to move on to after ASEAN."
"Having seen the problems of ASEAN, many industries want to move out."
"Unless countries are stable, people are simply not going to invest in those nations."
"It is therefore important to work with other African nations to try and keep countries stable so that we do not have to suspend them."
"I hope that, if we cannot have the assent procedure, the Commission will at least keep us very closely in contact with any situation arising where we may have to suspend a nation, and that the Committee on Development and Cooperation in particular would get any reports that were prepared."
"Beyond that, the PPE Group will be delighted to support this report when it comes before the House."
"Mr President, after years of lip service about compliance with human rights in the ACP countries, Mrs Aelvoet has managed to find a method whereby we have come a step closer to the effective functioning of the European institutions with regard to human rights compliance."
"Moreover, the role of this Parliament has been strengthened."
"I agree with Mr Bertens: it is not good enough yet, but it is a start."
"Bravo, Mrs Aelvoet!"
"But how can this proposal be successful if an important country like Angola continues to arm itself heavily?"
"Angola has sold its oil supply for the coming three years, and with this money it has paid for the weapons in cash , weapons from Brazil and Russia - Russia, a member of the troika which has to supervise the peace process, would you believe?"
"The fact that Angola, a one-party state, can take this decision without democratic consultation with the legal opposition represents a failure of the democratic Lomé test."
"So I urge the Council and the Commission to come up with a concrete proposal and an interim report from the European Parliament for the ACP counties to adhere to the arms percentage laid down in the Treaty. Obviously, they should also adhere to the good governance referred to by Mrs Günther."
"Only then will democracy and human rights have a chance in the ACP countries as well."
"Mr President and Members of the House, it is clear that during the course of the debate a number of issues have been touched on that go beyond the strict terms of the second interim report of Mrs Aelvoet."
"That is understandable because Parliament's interest in the proper implementation of the Fourth Lomé Convention and more particularly its human rights aspects is very great."
"For example Mr Corrie has mentioned some examples of horrific conduct that give rise to consideration of what should be done in view of the close relationship that the Lomé Convention gives to the European Union with the countries where such conduct takes place."
"Therefore the question of the application of the procedure provided for by Article 366a of the Lomé Convention, which is designed specifically to deal with that kind of situation, is obviously very important."
"The Commission has carefully studied Mrs Aelvoet's second interim report and notes the amendments tabled which would envisage Parliament being consulted at the various stages of implementation of the procedure."
"The Commission expressed its opinion when the first interim report was adopted on the desirability of involving Parliament more closely in the implementation of the procedure and it is clear that the current proposal for a Council decision is more explicit in this regard."
"It provides for immediately informing Parliament in full on any decision taken in implementing Article 366a."
"We do not feel that a process of formally consulting Parliament on the various stages of the procedure is feasible; not because we think Parliament's views are unimportant or insubstantial, but simply because of the specific provisions of the Treaties, in particular Article 300 which in effect sets out a procedure which is envisaged for situations such as this."
"What is proposed would run counter to what is provided for in Article 300."
"The Commission wants to be as sympathetic as possible and is certainly prepared to undertake to inform Parliament of any initiatives it takes or any proposal it submits under Article 366a and Parliament of course is in those circumstances more than able to take steps to make its views known."
"If they are known then they would immediately be something that would come to the attention of the Commission and would have to be considered."
"The Commission will continue to take into account all opinions expressed by Parliament in this regard."
"I regret the fact that there has been a delay in setting up the arrangements under which Article 366a can be invoked where necessary."
"I hope that as a result of this debate and what has been said during the course of it, both by Members and by myself, it will be possible to move as quickly as possible into a situation in which Article 366a can be invoked because the necessary procedure for doing so will have been agreed."
"Genetically modified micro-organisms"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0192/98) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive amending Directive 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified microorganisms (C4-0031/98-95/0340(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mr Trakatellis)."
"Mr President, one of the most important fields of biotechnology concerns the applications that are carried out with the use of genetically modified micro-organisms."
"These applications have a significant effect on issues of health and disease, diet, the protection of the environment, agriculture and other important fields of human life and activity."
"As a result, it is essential that increasing the possibilities of genetically modified micro-organisms goes ahead, since it promises a great deal."
"However, since the nature and extent of the risks to humanity and the environment which are associated with these micro-organisms are not fully known, it is imperative that relevant work is carried out in certain areas which are clearly defined for each class of risk."
"Work carried out under containment conditions is regulated by Directive 90/219, which aims to ensure on the one hand a common framework for the development of the new technology, and on the other the protection of human health and the environment."
"Moreover, since the adoption of this directive, new scientific knowledge and applications have evolved, while, in parallel, since its application, relevant legal experience has been gained."
"As a result, it is now right to amend and update the directive."
"In these amendments we must aim for the greatest possible legal flexibility which, however, must not prove detrimental to safety."
"On this point I sound a note of warning since we must not confuse a flexible and clearly defined framework with safety measures."
"The risk of a future accident is increasing since the field is expanding rapidly."
"A simple accident would be sufficient to give the biotech industry a bad name and lead to a crisis. We must avoid that by putting the appropriate safety measures in place."
"Although the Council took on board a number of Parliament's amendments, substantive amendments were finally omitted from the Council's common position."
"Your rapporteur takes the view that the common position only partly reflects the positions adopted by Parliament at first reading."
"As a result, the recommendation for second reading proposes that the amendments which approximate to the position and spirit of the amendments adopted by Parliament in part-session should be reinstated."
"The principal points are as follows:"
"Amendment No 2: the term ""contained use' must be clarified so as to specify the containment measures in respect of work involving GMMs."
"Amendment No 3: provision must be made for the reexamination of risk assessment where the competent authority has been notified that this assessment is no longer adequate."
"This allows the relevant authority to intervene."
"Amendments Nos 4 and 9: provisions must be introduced regarding liability insurance for users, given that despite all the containment measures, a risk exists, even if a very slight one."
"It is therefore legitimate that there should be insurance cover and liability in case third persons are injured by the use of GMMs."
"Amendment No 5: the user should have the opportunity to request formal authorization from the competent authority for category 2 uses."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 8: the public must be notified before contained use begins, not only about the emergency plans, but also about relevant safety measures."
"Amendment No 10: inspections and other control measures must be organized by the relevant authority to ensure the correct application of the directive and the containment measures."
"Amendments Nos 11, 12 and 13: Parliament must be involved in the procedure for drawing up and amending Annex II, Part B concerning the criteria for excluding certain GMMs from the field of application of the directive."
"On the same grounds it is also proposed to amend the risk assessment procedure in Annex III, Part B. We cannot accept the exclusion of Parliament from the process of drawing up such an important part of the directive."
"This will allow the Commission better to exercise its executive powers and will also make it easier for Parliament to control the Commission."
"On this point, we fully agree with the Commission and expect it to support our positions."
"Amendment No 14: this concerns the risk assessment procedure."
"I wish to stress that the precise assessment of the risk is the very ""heart' of the directive."
"The Council has taken on board only general guidelines. We insist that the risk assessment procedure be clarified."
"Finally, I wish to raise once again the matter of the choice of legal base, which should be Article 100a and not Article 130s(1)."
"In industry, work relating to GMMs is regarded, among other things, as having significant repercussions on the terms of competition."
"As a result, I think that Article 100a would be more correct."
"Also, following the approval of the recommendations concerning BSE, it has become clear, and Mr Santer has committed himself to it, that in issues relating to public health we must have codecision."
"I wish to conclude by saying that the Commission must support our positions, which aim on the one hand to ensure the development of this new technology and, on the other, to protect human health and the environment."
"Mr President, first of all, it is important that we all thank the rapporteur because of the enormous amount of work that he has undertaken in dealing with this extraordinarily technical and very complex directive."
"I congratulate him on his grasp of the technical detail and his understanding of the problems associated with it."
"This is a very topical report in the sense that this issue - biotechnology - has attracted a great deal of public interest and concern over the last few years."
"This is an extraordinarily important report."
"Biotechnology, as a science, has the potential to give us enormous new advances in the next century if it is used properly."
"It can bring enormous benefits to the human race in general and increase prosperity for all of us."
"But it is important that we build public confidence and trust in this technology."
"To do that, it is necessary to have higher levels of protection to ensure that public health is protected and to ensure the environment in general is protected from any dangers that might arise from experimentation."
"This directive essentially controls experimentation in contained facilities or the use of GMMs (genetically modified micro-organisms), again in contained facilities."
"The rapporteur's amendments seek to ensure that those requirements are met and that responsible care is exercised by all the practitioners in this field."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group I should like to say that we are certainly in favour of the development of this new science of biotechnology."
"But we believe that it is necessary to ensure that ethical public health and general safety concerns are respected and considered fully."
"The rapporteur's amendments help us in seeking those reassurances."
"I would commend them to the Commission and the Council."
"The common position, as it has come back to us, is not a bad common position."
"But there are still issues of concern, that the rapporteur's amendments address, and that we would wish to support."
"Firstly, there is the whole issue of classification of these micro-organisms."
"It is very true to say that the vast majority of micro-organisms that are experimented upon are, by and large, harmless and cause little threat."
"But there are some that present enormous dangers, particularly those that are associated with traditional diseases, for example, the micro-organisms associated with things like bubonic plague."
"We need to exercise the greatest caution when dealing with those."
"Consequently we need to ensure that the containment and safety measures taken are appropriate to the risk of the micro-organism."
"The rapporteur's amendments recognize that and certainly construct a system which would ensure that."
"I would also echo the concern of the rapporteur on the issue of comitology."
"This is a rather bizarre proposal from the point of view of comitology - two different annexes controlled by two different management systems."
"It is thus something which we are not accustomed to, which we do not like and which we are very uncomfortable about. We recognize that the Commission will be coming forward soon with a new proposal with regard to comitology and the development of the modus vivendi ."
"We would hope that a more rational approach would be taken by the Commission and that the issues which currently present themselves in this proposal can be resolved in that way."
"Finally, I would also draw attention to the question of the legal base."
"This proposal is currently under the cooperation procedure."
"We do not find that satisfactory."
"We would have been delighted to continue the debate with the Council, with the Commission acting as facilitator, through the procedure of conciliation."
"We regret that cannot be done. Consequently we would wish to support the rapporteur's view that the legal base should be 100a."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"There is no doubt that great dangers are associated with genetic engineering and biotechnology."
"We have often discussed these dangers here, for example in relation to the cloning of human beings."
"As a further example, I am concerned that the application of prenatal diagnosis will lead to the selection of disabled persons."
"This is a danger which we must recognize."
"The current proposal for a regulation concerns an application of genetic engineering which, in my view, is associated with great opportunities and regarding which, after twenty years of use, the dangers perhaps envisaged some years ago have not in fact materialized."
"So far there have not been any unforeseen incidents."
"For this reason, I believe it makes sense to remove this directive from the realm of bureaucracy."
"Europe must not fall any further behind in the production of medicines using genetically modified micro-organisms."
"We must catch up, and for this we need fewer bureaucratic rules."
"This does not mean any less security as we have a differentiated approach here."
"The micro-organisms which are potentially dangerous, as Mr Bowe said, continue to be treated with extreme caution."
"Harmless micro-organisms, however, must be treated with less caution as the danger does not lie in the fact that we are dealing with genetic engineering but in the microorganisms themselves."
"That is why I have spoken out emphatically against some of the amendments to the report, which did not come from Mr Trakatellis but were voted into the report, that is Amendments Nos 2, 4, 9 and 14."
"As far as liability is concerned, I also do not believe we need a particularly strict regulation for biotechnology."
"We need a comprehensive regulation, which the Commission is currently preparing."
"But we cannot always apply restrictions in the area of biotechnology or we will never be able to catch up in this area."
"Mr President, this is becoming monotonous, but I am also very grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, for this excellent report."
"Biotechnology is a very young sector and has had hardly any practical experience."
"Unexpected scientific results will be published over the coming years which will affect the risk assessment of these technologies."
"It is therefore best to be very careful."
"There must be clear legislation in which the risks are adequately contained."
"That is why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party thinks that Mr Trakatellis has, as I have said, produced an excellent report."
"After the Council's common position a number of amendments are needed to contain the risks as much as possible."
"The various explanations, such as the definition of contained use, are very important in this regard."
"The liability of the user of genetically modified organisms has now been clearly provided for in a number of amendments, as long as they are adopted by this Parliament."
"The competent authorities will rightly be allowed to intervene when they have indications that the risk assessment is no longer adequate."
"The amendments also mean that the European Parliament is involved in the drawing up and amending of the criteria by which certain GMMs will be excluded from the directive."
"Precisely because all risks have to be avoided, it seems right to me that the European Parliament should keep a distant but sharp eye on these criteria."
"I understand that the European Commission supports Parliament in this involvement."
"I would like to see this reiterated by the Commissioner."
"To conclude, our group is clear about the legal basis, that this must be Article 100a. The directive covers industrial laboratories, after all, and therefore competition in the field of biotechnology."
"Moreover, after the BSE crisis it was agreed that the codecision procedure had to apply in these kinds of matters."
"I hope that this Parliament will also support Article 100a."
"Mr President, I find it disgraceful that, as Mr Liese says, we in the House are saying that genetic engineering offers huge opportunities and would pose no danger in contained use, as in the report we are discussing today, yet at the same time we are avoiding liability like the plague!"
"If we deregulate, and state authorizations are therefore limited, then it is not acceptable that industry need not undertake liability for this."
"If it supposedly poses no danger, then it is more than suspicious that liability is so vehemently rejected."
"I know there has been massive lobbying of Members of this House in recent weeks and, as we can see, this has already had an effect on Mr Liese. The result of this is that no-one wants to deal with the issue of liability."
"This is completely irresponsible as in fact it should be a case of industry showing more responsibility."
"The German Federal Government, in particular, never tires of telling us that industry and science must take more responsibility."
"If we want individual responsibility we absolutely have to have liability; it is not acceptable that every driver has to have liability insurance before he drives a car but this is not required of companies which work with pathogenic organisms and research laboratories which work with viruses which could escape into the atmosphere."
"The report does not meet with our approval because it deregulates many areas; authorization simply because a time limit has elapsed no longer has anything to do with the precautionary principle."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasize once again that the question of liability will be extremely important for us."
"It is not for nothing that a recent referendum in Austria showed that a liability regulation is required."
"There are also Member States who want it."
"So if we want industry to take responsibility itself we must not wait until the damage is done; instead, we must take industry at its word..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the Trakatellis report deals with one of those subjects which make you wonder to what extent the European Parliament should be discussing it."
"It is such a technical matter that you almost have to have worked in a biotechnology laboratory in order to know anything about it. Also, you have not even said whether the regulations from this directive are better as they were or as they are evolving via the common position."
"It is all about the question of whether a laboratory must comply with strict safety regulations when it is working with genetic modification techniques."
"According to the Commission proposal, laboratories must determine for themselves, by means of risk assessment, what the level of safety measures should be."
"This is a curious construction, because what the standards are for a major risk has not been laid down anywhere."
"When, as a company, with strict safety standards in force, you have furthermore to follow a heavier administrative procedure for notification than when you reach weaker safety measures via the risk assessment, then that comprises an element of contradiction."
"If, as a company, you want to be extremely cautious, you are punished administratively, as it were, and if you asses the risk to be a little less high, you do not have to comply with the heavy notification procedure."
"According to my assessment, this leads to a downward pressure on the containment level."
"What we need above all, I think, is a more standardized risk assessment."
"The text of Annex III deals with this, but in far too general terms."
"I am not sure whether in practice the European Parliament amendments will lead to an improved notification procedure."
"To be on the safe side, I will support them, but without much conviction."
"As far as the legal basis is concerned, I cannot make more out of it than 130s. Whether the Member States will reach a high level of protection with this, I venture to doubt."
"Thankfully companies are allowed to exceed the prescribed level of protection, insofar as this is clear."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur so rightly observed, biotechnology and in particular genetic engineering are expanding greatly."
"Within the framework of fair and regulated competition in the European Union it is therefore necessary to form an appropriate legal basis."
"This is a very important point and one which is imperative, partly because all regulations in the area of biotechnology in the European Union are based on Article 100a."
"This includes the issue of comitology."
"It is obvious that the 3b regulatory committee procedure, which the European Parliament completely excludes from the consultations on changing the criteria which allow certain genetically modified micro-organisms to be exempted from the field of application of the directive, is completely unacceptable for us as the European Parliament."
"We recently had to abandon a directive on this issue because the Council could not be moved on it."
"This is not acceptable to us, however."
"If we have cooperation or codecision, the appropriate rights must also be guaranteed for the European Parliament in the committees."
"My second point deals with information for the public."
"It is stated in the common position that the Member States can stipulate that the public be allowed to give their opinion on specific issues."
"What are specific issues?"
"Who defines these specific issues?"
"What can it possibly mean?"
"It is inexplicable that the European Council insists that such an unclear definition, or nondefinition, should remain."
"It is also necessary to clarify the situation, within the context of fair competition, as is intended in the amendments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention briefly why we are dealing with this directive."
"According to the Commission's explanation, on the one hand genetic modification procedures must be applied responsibly, and on the other hand the increase in scientific knowledge and findings in the last 10 years must be taken into account."
"Findings have progressed greatly worldwide."
"Europe has set a very strict standard and this directive actually aims to reduce this strict standard and the high degree of bureaucracy associated with it, as experience has shown that what was considered to be high-risk has not turned out that way, thus enabling procedures to be simplified."
"I am of the opinion that the points made in the common position are responsible, and I would like this directive also to take effect if possible."
"I can support what is proposed in the common position."
"Mr President, I welcome this report and the work of the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, and the Committee in ensuring that the European Parliament will have a role in supervising developments in this very technical and difficult field."
"Recommending that the legal basis be changed to 100a ensures that the codecision procedure will be followed in full."
"It is essential that we learn from past experience and insist on openness and transparency."
"It is also necessary to provide the mechanism to guarantee the safety not only of those working in the field of biotechnology but also of the general public."
"There is a great need to build public trust and confidence."
"This is a new technology and one that offers huge potential in the medical field for the treatment of many diseases for which as yet there are no cures, and for the relief of suffering and pain for millions of people."
"We must push out the frontiers of research but in an open and transparent way."
"Within the highest safety standards, we must encourage and support research and ensure that the industry is not bogged down with so many restrictions that laboratories will move their research out of Europe altogether and cause a brain drain and loss of highly trained people and highly skilled jobs."
"The message to the public with regard to biotechnology must be balanced and devoid of emotion, unlike much of what has happened so far in the area of biotechnological research."
"We have seen many wonderful success stories in the biotech field, the development of genetic insulin for example."
"There are many more untapped possibilities."
"In the interests of mankind we have a responsibility to keep searching for the right answers."
"I hope the outdated mind-set of the past will not stand in the way of the relief of so many in the future."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur and the committee for their report and thorough work on the common position adopted by the Council on this matter."
"The directive was proposed and adopted to ensure that the precautionary principle could be followed with regard to human health and the environment so that the benefits of this technology could develop safely."
"What it seeks to do in a single piece of specific horizontal legislation is to cover a highly technical and rapidly evolving area of work that obviously is of enormous importance."
"A number of problems are identified with the directive in relation to classification of genetically modified microorganisms, such as insufficient guidance on risk-assessment and containment measures, the absence of a linkage of the notification and administrative measures to the degree of risk of the activities, and so on."
"The common position strengthens and clarifies the original Commission proposal designed to deal with this matter."
"The main areas concerned include increased administrative control for Class 3 and 4 work: in cases of doubt in classification of an activity the more stringent safety measures have to be applied; the extension of the requirement for safety plans to all cases where the failure of containment could lead to serious danger; and the strengthening of the containment and control measures by incorporation of the requirement to apply the principles of good occupational safety and hygiene in all cases."
"The Commission was not, however, able to support the common position where it sought to exclude the European Parliament from the procedure to establish and modify Annex II Part B, which affects the scope of the directive, nor Article 21, where the Council would still wish to stick to a 3b regulatory committee procedure instead of the 2a procedure proposed by the Commission following the first opinion of Parliament."
"Of the 36 amendments tabled, including supplementary amendments, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 5, 6, 17, 19, 25, 32 and 36, and can partially accept 8, 12, 13 and 14, and accept in principle 2, 18, 20, 21, 28, 33, 34 and 35, which may need some rewording."
"With respect to Amendment No 13, the Commission can accept a 2a comitology procedure which gives flexibility to the Council to adopt different measures from those proposed by the Commission instead of the 3b procedure contained in the Commission proposal."
"Concerning the requirement in the amendment to present a report on experience with the directive, the Commission considers that the aim of the amendment could be achieved by making available to Parliament the report it is required to produce under Article 18(3)."
"But the proposal in the amendment that the decisions and minutes of the regulatory committee should be made publicly available is not acceptable since that is not in line with the recent agreement between the Commission and Parliament applicable since December 1996 on transparency and the publicity of committee meetings."
"Then there are 17 amendments which the Commission cannot accept."
"Amendment No 1 proposes to change the legal base from Article 130s(1) to Article 100a. The scope of the directive is not being significantly altered and it does not impact directly on the functioning of the single market."
"That is why the Commission considers that there is no legal justification for changing the legal basis of the directive, and that opinion is in line with that given by the Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament."
"An additional consideration is that the change of legal base would restrict Member States from having the flexibility to take containment and control measures going beyond those in the directives which at present they can do, because currently Member States can go beyond the standards set out in the directive in their national legislation."
"The issue of liability insurance and the provision of financial security in Amendments Nos 4 and 9 are under consideration by the Commission which, as has been said, intends to produce a White Paper on environmental liability, and the Commission would prefer to deal with this matter in a horizontal manner to avoid different liability requirements in different directives."
"Amendment No 11 is not acceptable because the requirement to utilize the full legislative procedure for modifications to the risk-assessment procedure set out in Annex III would prevent the rapid modification of the annex which is purely technical in nature, and it could be that such a restriction would lead to safety problems, for instance, where, as a result of additional scientific information, a rapid change to the annex would be needed."
"The Commission considers that the proposed procedure utilizing a committee of representatives to the Member States will give the required flexibility and appropriate rigour for the examination of any proposals to modify the annex."
"Amendments Nos 3, 7, 10, 16, 24 and 31 are not acceptable because they duplicate provisions present in other articles and the technical Amendments Nos 15, 26 and 30 would operate to increase the burden of control measures, seeking to introduce more stringent measures than those of Directive 90/679/EEC, which regulates the protection of workers from risks from exposure to biological agents at work."
"This directive also covers work with genetically modified micro-organisms and the Commission wishes to maintain comparable containment requirements for similar work under the two directives."
"Amendments Nos 22, 23, 24 and 27 proposed increased burdens, but we do not think that they make a commensurate contribution to safety."
"Amendment No 29 is technically invalid since the genetically modified micro-organisms are not required to be in a closed system."
"I wish to finish by stressing the added value of the amendments which have been accepted, wholly or partially, which are a considerable number."
"An example of this is Amendment No 5 by Mr Trakatellis, which would allow applicants to request a reply from a competent authority within a defined time period and thus clarify the applicant's position and obligations under the directive."
"I believe that the amendments clarify and reinforce the common position and, together with that text, will provide a sound and enforceable framework providing the high level of safety that we are all seeking to achieve."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commission a question because Parliament is continually put off with promises of a White Paper on liability, that is, with a horizontal solution."
"We, the European Parliament, have taken an initiative and have been waiting for a regulation of this kind for years."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner - he sits in the Commission after all and must know how difficult it is there - when, in his opinion, there will be a regulation."
"My second question is also based on this: Commissioner, do you believe that the fact that the taxpayer - that is, the general public - must now take responsibility for possible damage is compatible with the responsibility of industry and science?"
"Mr President, we are consulting at the moment with interested parties and hope to put something forward this year."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Humane trapping"
"The next item is the report (A4-0197/98) by Mr Pimenta, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the signing and conclusion of an International Agreement in the form of Agreed Minute between the European Community and the United States of America on humane trapping standards (COM(97)0726 - C4-0014/98-97/0360(CNS))."
"Regrettably, Mr Pimenta cannot be here."
"Mrs Banotti is speaking in his place."
"Mr President, you might be interested to know why Mr Pimenta invited me to present his report this evening."
"I have the doubtful honour of being the original rapporteur on the prohibition of the importation of furs caught with leghold traps."
"I have kept a watching brief on the issue ever since."
"And very nasty things they are, too."
"I received several of them through my mailbox when I was rapporteur."
"I hope Mr Pimenta did not have the same problem when he took over the report."
"We have already discussed at length the arrangements between the Canadian and Russian Governments in relation to this."
"Mr Pimenta believes that the American authorities are attempting to get round the leghold trap Regulation 3254/91 on the grounds that they have legislation on humane trapping already in existence."
"He does not believe this is correct."
"The central focus of the regulation is the prohibition of leghold traps."
"The Canadian and Russian commitment to ban so-called conventional leghold traps is at least unconditional."
"But the same cannot be said for the US which has only offered a six-year phase-in period that is subject to some substantial derogations."
"These derogations are specified in sections 423 and 424 of the standards."
"Although this text is similar to the text incorporated in the agreement with Canada and Russia, the US commitment on leghold traps is pursuant to the standards, that is, it is conditional."
"That is in addition to the fact that it has demanded a longer phase-in period."
"In October the US undertook to phase out the use of conventional leghold traps within four years subject to the existence of 'viable replacement traps' ."
"This proviso was removed from the December text."
"The whole episode has immediate consequences for animal welfare where many millions of animals will continue to be subjected to the indiscriminate cruelty of leghold traps for many years to come, perhaps even resulting in some forms of these traps being inappropriately classified as humane."
"It also reveals much of the inadequacy of the present EU strategy on matters relating to the WTO."
"In a choice between fulfilling their legal obligation to implement Community legislation and responding to a possible breach of WTO rules, the Commission and Council opted to ignore their statutory EU obligations in favour of WTO considerations."
"The Commission and Council repeatedly chose to ignore the opinion of the European Parliament, including its many constructive proposals to balance the various interests: for example, to ensure the proportionality of trade measures and to take account of the interests of native people."
"At the same time, and despite a range of related problems also including cosmetic testing and farm animal husbandry, the Commission has failed to present any formal analysis or proposals on how to approach or resolve the complex issue of trade and animal welfare: for example, with respect to utilization or modification of the existing Article XX exceptions within the WTO rules."
"The Commission has similarly failed to raise these concerns in Geneva or to support the development of a high-level dialogue on the subject, an idea first proposed at the Globe Symposium held in 1996."
"Regrettably the Commission has also shown no willingness to engage in a debate to enable appropriate and legitimate distinctions to be made between products on the basis of their method of production - an issue which is of central importance both to animal welfare and to the progress of the trade and environmental debate."
"That is why Mr Pimenta, as rapporteur, is asking Parliament to reject the proposed agreement."
"Mr President, you can beat your head against the wall in many different ways."
"This has been evident on a number of occasions when Parliament has expressed its opinion on agreements dealing with painless animal traps."
"On the basis of Mr Pimenta's report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has now recommended the rejection of the agreement, initially drawn up with Canada and Russia, and now with the USA."
"This is the way Parliament has gone, then."
"The Commission has thus listened to Parliament, but has implemented - and may now, on the Council's recommendation, implement - the agreement they negotiated."
"A good thing is not always the best thing."
"This old Finnish saying is obviously unknown to Mr Pimenta, the Committee responsible or Parliament generally."
"We set our sights on traps inflicting absolutely no pain."
"However, no-one has come up with a system that does not cause at least some pain."
"The agreements have been a clear step forward."
"Their rejection logically signifies the continuation of the present pain-inflicting system of trapping animals."
"The REX Committee has unanimously taken a positive stand on the agreement that is to be discussed."
"When, furthermore, the USA is involved, as the latest party to the agreement, this view is well justified."
"I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that we will not be beating our heads against the wall yet again."
"I hope that Parliament will take a step forward in this matter."
"It will not be perfect, but striving for perfection is a good way of achieving nothing at all."
"The agreement should thus be approved, contrary to the opinion of the responsible Committee."
"Mr President, this is hopefully the last sad episode in the sorry saga of the leghold trap, where we have seen the strongly held view of the Parliament, elected by the people of Europe, overruled by the Commission in the interests of international trade deals."
"The victims are the fur-bearing animals of North America, Canada and Russia who are cruelly killed so that rich women in the West can wear their skins."
"There is no justification for this."
"The Socialist Group fully endorses, as before, Mr Pimenta's excellent report calling for a rejection of the agreement on the grounds clearly set out in his report."
"The agreements were wrong before, they are still wrong and we see no reason to change our mind."
"This agreement with the USA suffers from the same deficiencies as those we previously rejected with Canada and Russia, and it is even weaker as Mr Pimenta shows in his report."
"It is also unlikely that it can be monitored and properly implemented because the powers vested in the state governments in the United States, who are not signatory to the agreements, mean that they will not properly implement it."
"We believe that the Commission has taken the wrong path since it refused to implement the regulation of 1991 at its due date of 1996."
"We intend to stick to our guns because we believe that we are right and we can only hope that this unsatisfactory situation does not occur again."
"We also hope that it will underline the need to strengthen Article 20 of the GATT."
"It is outrageous that European legislation is being corrupted in this way."
"I do not believe that these weak agreements will prevent one single bit of cruelty to fur-bearing animals, and therefore they defeat the very purpose of their existence."
"Mr President, the entire leghold trap affair is becoming increasingly ridiculous."
"I might just as well have repeated what I said here two years ago."
"It looks like a never-ending story, because this agreement between the Union and the United States is even worse than the agreement we also rejected between the Union and Canada and Russia."
"Whilst Canada and Russia had at least promised to implement the ban on so-called conventional leghold traps, the same can in no way be said of the United States."
"They have merely offered to phase out gradually the leghold trap over a period of six years, and in addition have stipulated quite a number of derogations."
"This agreement is decidedly insufficient, and must therefore be rejected."
"The entire affair is a serious demonstration of the fact that present EU strategy on issues relating to the WTO is totally unsuitable."
"It is a real scandal that the Council and the Commission have laid aside the positions they had taken earlier, and agreed to an even weaker proposal in order to escape a possible conflict with the WTO."
"It is extremely alarming to see how easily the Council and the Commission lay aside EU legislation."
"The European Parliament has repeatedly pointed out that the 1991 regulation, which totally prohibits the use of the leghold trap, must be implemented."
"Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission have completely ignored this Parliament's positions."
"The entire affair is a serious undermining of EU legislation, and also undermines European democracy."
"But even more serious are the consequences for the well-being of animals, because millions of animals will continue to die a cruel death in these leghold traps."
"Mr President, when discussing humane trapping it is important to note first that the whole course of events is a drama in several scandalous acts."
"First I would like to remind you of Regulation 3254/91, which goes back to 1991, and which states that from 1 January 1996 the furs of animals caught using leghold traps should no longer be imported into the EU."
"The Commission, together with the Council, simply did not enact any implementing rule and thus sacrificed an EU law which now simply does not exist."
"If we look more closely, we find that it was sacrificed on the altar of the WTO."
"Secondly, the title: ""Humane trapping' ."
"There is no such thing as humane trapping using any kind of traps! We are simply deceiving ourselves if we say such a thing."
"To the animals which die a wretched death it is completely irrelevant which type of trap is used."
"We must finally learn that animals are living creatures and not commodities."
"This way of thinking is positively mediaeval."
"Yet we are now approaching the year 2000 and still think in this way."
"Thirdly, the critical point: this agreement with the USA."
"The agreements with Canada and Russia were very rough, in the true sense of the word."
"But this overshadows everything else."
"There are long transitional phases, there are no legal norms whatsoever and it is not at all clear when it will no longer be permitted to trap animals with this kind of trap."
"In addition, it is contempt of Parliament, since we were elected by millions of citizens and are their representatives."
"And the people do not want any more leghold traps."
"For this simple reason we will of course approve Mr Pimenta's report, and completely reject all existing agreements and the Commission's entire course of action."
"Mr President, most of us on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection agree with Mr Pimenta's report, which again criticizes this proposal because of the lack of participation not just of NGO but also of some of the countries involved in this matter."
"So we completely agree with Mr Pimenta's proposal to reject the proposed agreement as totally inadequate, to ban fur imports without further delay, and above all to encourage the participation of native peoples."
"At no time during the debate on this matter in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection did we forget the rights of native peoples, who have been hunting for many years and do not kill animals in a cruel manner, unlike other countries which tend towards that sort of behaviour."
"I am particularly interested in this subject because I live in Asturias, a region in northern Spain which has perhaps the most important surviving population of brown bears - 80 individuals."
"During the last 20 days, three brown bears have died."
"The investigation has not yet been completed, but the suspicion is that an adult animal - especially important for the conservation of the species - died because poachers had set a trap for other animals."
"And that is what tends to happen when traps are set which can affect animals threatened with extinction."
"So, Mr President, we are going to support Mr Pimenta's report."
"We think it is time to make a final decision and pay no more attention to commercial interests."
"And we hope it is approved by a large majority in the House, as it was in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, will the European Union be able to ensure that the ban on importing fur from animals captured in leghold traps is respected throughout its territory?"
"Our debate is just one in a long series of debates, and I hope Parliament will be able to show itself to be logical and consistent with the previous positions it has taken."
"I am one of those people who, up until now, have preferred to show understanding and moderation with respect to the Commission's positions, which were in fact often adopted unilaterally."
"I accepted, although certainly with some reluctance, that the need to reach an agreement meant prolonging negotiations for a year."
"I believed too that the agreements with Canada and Russia were undoubtedly a stopgap measure, but at least they had the advantage of bringing the negotiations out of the deadlock they had reached."
"Having said that, goodwill has its limits and the agreement with the United States which you are proposing to us today, Commissioner, is entirely unacceptable."
"I thus share the opinion of our rapporteur, and I congratulate him on the quality of his work."
"In fact, this agreement lags far behind in relation to the agreement between the European Union, Canada and Russia, which is itself limited."
"The number of derogations and the six-year application period do not augur well."
"Moreover, it is not unreasonable to doubt the will and the ability of the American authorities to impose this agreement on its own states."
"These are some of the many questions to which we have no answer."
"We must therefore ask, along with Mr Pimenta, that this agreement with the United States be rejected."
"Furthermore, the debate must be put into context and we must take account of the fact that as well as the problem of leghold traps, this is a question of the European Union's ability to stand up to pressure from the WTO."
"The Commission should be aware of the consequences of the agreements it plans to approve."
"And we must regret once more that it is presenting Parliament with a fait accompli ."
"In addition, it is forcing Parliament to renounce fundamental principles."
"Today, it is the protection of the environment which is at issue; tomorrow, it will be social clauses or our culture which will be harmed."
"Mr President, by way of introduction I would like to say that safeguarding animal welfare is indeed paramount."
"And that is precisely why I cannot support Mr Pimenta's rejection of the proposal for an agreement with the USA."
"I believe we should recommend the agreement and the REX Committee."
"Firstly, before the agreement can be rejected, the alternative to the agreement must be assessed realistically."
"Secondly, the consequences of the agreement in the USA and, of course, in the EU must be considered."
"And thirdly, the ongoing prospects of developing better, more humane traps need to be considered."
"The alternative to the agreement with the USA is not some other agreement with better standards."
"So it is not a good idea to revert to the Council decision concerning the banning of leghold traps."
"Mrs Pollack used the word 'insulting' , and this is the crux of the matter."
"The European Parliament is insulted because it wanted the 1991 resolution to be upheld, even though - as far as I can see - the agreements with Russia, Canada and the USA would serve to improve animal welfare."
"Why?"
"The resolution on banning leghold traps is very limited."
"It applies only to 13 species, as opposed to the 19 covered by the new agreement."
"It does not ban the use of leghold traps, but only the import of pelts, and in the main, this resolution only covers this one method of trapping."
"As I have stated before, it is hypocritical to focus on this one - albeit barbaric - trapping method, while traps that are no less cruel are used within the EU."
"That - not more stringent requirements for traps - is the alternative to the agreements with Russia, Canada and now also the USA."
"EU fur exports to the USA are currently twice as much as imports from the USA."
"This is an important point, because it shows that we should be focusing more on the standards applicable to trapping in Europe."
"The agreement that has just been established will actually raise standards in several EU countries."
"Perhaps we should begin there instead of scoring cheap animal welfare points at the expense of hunters in the USA."
"Finally - and perhaps most significantly - the agreement makes financial provision for research into better traps."
"In other words, what we have is an agreement bringing in concrete standards for traps and a programme for improving the existing traps."
"That has to be better than an import ban, a case with the WTO and European hunters failing to live up to the standards."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards this draft agreement between the United States and the European Union, we all fully share the rapporteur's opinion that it should be rejected."
"In fact, in terms of this question of leghold traps which has already gone on for a long time, the agreements reached with Canada and the United States have never really received the approval of the European Parliament."
"They were, however, superior to this one."
"Three elements demonstrate the extent to which it is difficult to conduct truly fair diplomatic negotiations with the United States."
"Firstly, the Americans have become accustomed - and it is once again the case in this agreement - to evoking their internal constitutional provisions in accordance with which, in many fields including this one, it is actually the federal states, and not the federal government, which are responsible."
"This allows them, at the time of the application of the agreement, to challenge to some extent the signature appended at the federal level."
"They have already done the same for other unrelated issues, such as the international market in electrical engineering, and this shows that there really is inequality in the agreements we sign with the United States."
"Secondly, the US rejects the dispute settlement procedure and confines itself to a simple consultation mechanism, which is obviously insufficient."
"Finally, the periods of time agreed with the United States for the elimination of leghold traps are becoming longer and longer, which means that the very content of the agreement is called into question."
"Therefore, as far as the substance is concerned, we would like to see the disappearance of all of these traps; however, further to the matter under debate here, there is a problem of principle in relation to the agreements approved between the United States and the European Union."
"We talked in the past about ""unequal' agreements concluded between China and the European powers."
"We often have the feeling that it is also a matter of unequal agreements when the United States and the European Union come into conflict."
"Mr President, naturally no-one can sympathize with the idea or practice of barbarous methods, of cruel methods of torture, in the hunting of fur-bearing animals."
"But I see that several of my colleagues show such excessive sensitivity that, if they continue in this direction, looking for the ideal solution, in other words the abolition of hunting fur-bearing animals, we will arrive at an unacceptable impasse."
"From this viewpoint, we feel that the agreements with Russia and Canada, while they do not provide the ideal solution, nevertheless give a positive thrust to the matter by prohibiting leghold traps and any other methods of hunting which are unnecessarily cruel."
"As a result, we think that these agreements offer scope and that they can be improved and extended by means of steadfast negotiations with the United States."
"On the other hand, we believe that the more stringent these measures are, the more likely it is that they will be violated."
"Past experience shows that no very stringent law has remained inviolate; on the contrary, such laws have invariably given birth to a variety of other ways, some of them criminal, of being violated."
"However, there is another aspect that I wish to talk about: sensitivity towards animals is justified but there must also be sensitivity towards native peoples."
"As an example I shall take north-eastern Greece, around Kastoria. Hundreds of small businesses exist thanks to the treatment, trade and sale of fur, and thousands of people have satisfactory employment."
"As a result, we cannot ignore such vital aspects of the matter."
"Finally, in order to ensure that such species do not disappear, I think that as well as restricting their cruel hunting, it is possible at both a Community and a national level to promote reserves, by means of subsidies and other measures. There could be reserves at a Community level and national parks, which would make it easy to propagate those species which are fur-bearing and, indeed, exceedingly fur-bearing."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Pimenta for this excellent new report on this matter."
"It has turned into a novel, a thriller, a thriller about leghold traps and 13 animal species."
"Let me remind you what this is all about. Animals are trapped, their bones broken, their tendons torn."
"They eat their own paws to try to get free. They drag themselves through the snow, leaving a trail behind them, which if I may say so, makes them easy to track."
"For years, since the 1991 regulation, we have been trying to ban this monstrosity."
"Every year, the European Commission tells us: ""another short delay, Mr Torturer, just a little more time' ."
"We have been told that we should not disturb the Inuit people, as if traditional Inuit fishermen, since the beginning of time, used steel leghold traps."
"We are now being told that we should not disturb the World Trade Organization and that a panel is to be consulted, as for bananas and as for hormone derived meat."
"The Geneva panel is now becoming the divine help."
"We concluded an agreement with the United States in December 1997, just as we had concluded an agreement with Canada and Russia in July 1997."
"Obviously, no funds are being made available; it is simply a matter of an agreed minute, like with the Blair House agreement, which the Commission representative is very familiar with."
"We are in fact reliving the whole Blair House situation and we are being told that the legal scope of the agreement is very limited, due to the federal structure of the United States which means that the states involved disregard what takes place in Washington."
"As regards the substance, the Commission is happy; it obtains a further delay of three to five additional years, with the United States simply proposing to us that they go even further in this unacceptable situation, in this monstrosity."
"The most important thing about this matter is that it is symbolic."
"As with bananas, cheese manufactured from raw milk, and hormone derived meat and milk, we are giving in, as we have done every time, to the United States."
"I repeat, Mr President, and I will finish with this, that as regards the Helms-Burton or d'Amato acts, the United States did not pay as much attention to our concerns as we are paying to theirs."
"As far as we are concerned, we agree with Mr Pimenta's position, which if I may say so, is the only possible position when discussing animals, humanity and dignity."
"Mr President, I would like to say that I agree with the report."
"The thinking behind this report is quite clear because, as everyone knows who has constituents who have written to them and informed them about this barbarous practice and as previous speakers have mentioned, the barbarism which can occur so randomly and leave animals to suffer for so many days is quite clearly unacceptable in a civilized world."
"Many people in the UK put their name down to questionnaires sent to me and it is quite clear from deputations of others in the UK that they feel extremely strongly on this issue as with other issues of animal welfare."
"Europe is one of the major consumers of the fur pelt trade - something like 70 % of which ends up within the European Union."
"It is quite clear that as consumers we have a very strong and authoritative voice on this issue."
"I believe the Commission has been wrong not to challenge the WTO more strongly on the grounds of the ethicality of the environmental, welfare and social issues."
"I think that there can be a stronger voice."
"I know that Sir Leon in particular has made strenuous efforts to bring a balance to world trade from the Commission's point of view."
"There are some lines which we cannot step over: not just in this instance but also with regard to aspects of asbestos, for example, which threatens hormones in beef."
"It is quite clear to my mind and to others in this Parliament that when we choose to reject what is occurring in terms of the deals which are being struck in Europe's name, when we are speaking for the people, our views should be respected and people should be brought to understand that in that respect, and that respect alone, we cannot renege on the issues which Parliament discusses and puts before you, Sir Leon."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Agreement with Guinea on fishing"
"The next item is the report (A4-0178/98) by Mr Girão Pereira, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing the fishing possibilities and the financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea on fishing off the Guinean coast for the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1999 (COM(98)0129 - C4-0245/98-98/0086(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few years the Commission has brought proposals to the Council and Parliament to enter into fishing agreements with non-EU countries, opening up the possibility of keeping Member States' fleets active in the face of a growing shortage of fish stocks in the waters of the Union."
"The agreement with Guinea is thus in line with that policy, which we consider appropriate and obviously support in the light of the importance of fishing to some of our coastal regions, to industry and to the market itself."
"Our relations with Guinea in that sector already go back to 1986."
"This, therefore, is a matter of renewing a pre-existing agreement for the period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1999."
"It is important to highlight some of its most significant aspects."
"The financial compensation has been substantially increased, but there is also an increase in fishing opportunities as a result of the greater number of vessels that can operate in those areas."
"Another aspect it is important to emphasize, and an innovative one, is that approximately 50 % of the overall financial compensation is allocated to specific aid to the Guinean fishing industry, particularly in terms of scientific programmes, technical and professional training schemes, support schemes for the bodies responsible for the surveillance and supervision of fishing activities and artisanal fishermen's support schemes."
"Furthermore, these financial aid schemes have been extended to include some devices for proper resource management, inasmuch as it is stipulated that any vessel operating in the area must have an observer aboard to keep an eye on her fishing activities and gather statistical information on catches."
"In addition - and this is a major innovation - I have to inform you that the Guinean Ministry of Fisheries is under an obligation to send the Commission an annual report on the scientific and technical actions it is taking to increase its knowledge of fish stocks."
"An even more important aspect is that payment of the financial compensation is dependent on the effective implementation of those actions in connection with the development of local fisheries and the conservation of resources. This is explicitly stipulated in the final part of Article 4 of the protocol."
"This is why I am presenting Amendment No 5, which seems more allembracing to me than the one from the Committee on Fisheries, because it invokes that clause of the protocol and the European Parliament's right to inspect the reports referred to in it."
"For these reasons, it can be seen that the contents of this report conform to the guidelines laid down by the Council at its meeting of 30 October 1997, according to which approximately half the Community finance ought to be dedicated to objectives specifically aimed at improving the fisheries situation."
"Furthermore, it incorporates and puts into practice many of the Commission's recommendations for development and cooperation. The Commission has always insisted that a development aspect should be included in agreements of this type."
"Because of the importance of this agreement to the European Union's fishing industry, and because of its innovative measures, we believe it will receive this House's unanimous support."
"Mr President, as far as I am concerned, there are some difficulties with this agreement."
"First of all, there is the problem with the number of fishing boats: 74 compared with the 43 allowed in the previous agreement."
"Furthermore, the agreement was initialled by the Commission without first consulting Parliament for an opinion, which is why I agree with the rapporteur who maintains that Parliament must be informed and that the protocol must be observed."
"In addition to these aspects, there are problems especially with monitoring fishing activities within 10 miles."
"This fishing would conflict greatly with the interests of the 100 000 or so artisanal fishermen who operate in this country and who have repeatedly protested to the European Union and to the local authorities about this."
"Also, the financial compensation proposed for artisanal fishermen has been greatly reduced in relation to the overall amount of ECU 6.5 million: only ECU 320 000 in assistance for artisanal fishing compared with the ECU 800 000 for the ministry and the ECU 800 000 for monitoring and surveillance."
"The fishing vessels, of which there are exactly 74 - and 33 of these have seine nets which are very harmful and also create a lot of difficulties - only pay ECU 20 per tonne, which is practically 40 000 lira per 10 quintal tonnes: a truly insignificant figure."
"However, having said that we realize that this agreement has been initialled, we realize that it has to be submitted for verification, but we undoubtedly hope that in future international agreements will grant at least equal treatment to third country resources."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Girão Pereira on his report. It follows the European Parliament's traditional line on fishing agreements."
"It is a very clear report and I should like to support everything it says, on behalf of my group."
"In essence I think it is an agreement which contains some innovations, because we are basically trying to put into practice an old principle we always follow in this House, according to which money and financial compensation paid by the European Union should benefit the fishing industry in the countries with which we enter into agreements, and I therefore think our argument that at least half the Community financial compensation should benefit local fisheries is correct."
"At least, I think, this is a start."
"Obviously, it would be nice if the principle were applied to the whole of the compensation, but we are in a delicate area where there is a danger of interfering with the sovereignty of each of the countries in question."
"In the case of the Guinean agreement, there is in fact an increase in cost, but also a corresponding increase in fish, so there is an objective balancing factor."
"There are also some other interesting points which deserve our commendation, such as for example an increase in the funds dedicated partly to research and partly to the actual administrative organization of that country's Ministry of Fisheries."
"We support this report and congratulate the rapporteur once again on his work."
"Mr President, as we have seen from the tone of the previous speeches, in general both the rapporteur and the two speakers stress the positive aspects of this agreement, which is in line with the new Community fisheries policy."
"It is a question, firstly, of helping these developing countries to conserve their own resources. The European Community contributes the financial means for that, helping them, for example, to monitor fishing."
"Secondly, by means of financial compensation to these countries, we contribute to their actual economic development. In other words, on the one hand the European Community facilitates the action of Community fishermen who, as we know, have problems in a great many sites, and on the other hand it promotes fishing, but conserving resources rather than compromising their continued existence."
"I believe the budgetary increase which has been made is justified within this new Community policy, and will prove to be to the advantage both of the people of the African countries and the people of the EU itself, and of the preservation of fisheries resources in general."
"So from my point of view, like the previous speakers, I think Parliament should approve the text as it stands, with the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries, and also Mr Girão Pereira's Amendment No 5. On the other hand, I am completely opposed to Amendment No 6 tabled by Mr Teverson."
"Mr President, Mr Girão Pereira's report on the fishing agreement with Guinea, on which I congratulate him, very clearly shows that people are wrong to say that fishing agreements are a means for the Community fleet to exploit the resources of third countries in an uncontrolled manner, without contributing any benefit."
"As if the agreements with Argentina, Morocco or Mauritania were not enough to show how Community fishing activities have contributed to the development of this sector in third countries, the new protocol with Guinea clearly shows the benefits a coastal country can gain from a fishing agreement with the Community. These benefits are at least comparable to, if not greater than, the contributions from the specific development policy, despite the fact that, in this case, we are talking about simple trade agreements."
"As has been said, the increase of more than 50 % in the financial compensation is extraordinarily significant, but the way it is to be distributed is even more important."
"In fact, practically half of the ECU 6.5 million which will be paid to Guinea is directed towards improving training and stimulating Guinean fishing."
"Of particular note are the increases to improve surveillance, which have doubled in relation to the previous protocol, and ECU 320 000 to support artisanal fisheries, representing an increase of a third with respect to the previous protocol."
"Thanks to this sort of help, Guinea has managed to sign fishing agreements with China and Korea, guaranteeing resources in a way which would have been unthinkable without the knowledge of fishing grounds and international conservation regulations to which Guinean society has gained access thanks to the Community's financial compensation."
"Also, as Mr Girão Pereira rightly notes, we need to stress that, as a new feature, the Guinean authorities will have to report to the European Union to show that the funds have been allocated to actions related to the development of local fishing grounds and the conservation of resources. Compliance is strictly linked to the payment of the financial compensation."
"Therefore, like the rest of my group, I shall be supporting Mr Girão Pereira's report."
"Mr President, it is rather strange that everybody is emphasizing what good developmental aspects these reports have for the fishing industry of Guinea, in this case, and for other countries as well."
"I like that: I have always argued that they should have."
"There has been a great improvement in these reports, particularly perhaps since the actions of the Dutch presidency and the taking on board by the Commissioner responsible of my report last year."
"So things are getting better, but still there is a problem with regard to consultation with the European Parliament."
"The Commission does not consult us early enough."
"The Council has some responsibility in this too."
"This is pointed out by the Committee on Budgets in no uncertain terms in its opinion on this report."
"However, we have had to say it over and over again."
"There have been advances: a lot more resources are devoted to the artisanal fisheries, to improving the fisheries of Guinea and so on, in all sorts of ways that have been mentioned before."
"I hope the Guineans have the resources to monitor what is happening when the EU fleet is there."
"I also like the proposal - though perhaps it is not enough - that some of the catch should compulsorily be landed in Guinea for the food supply of the Guinean population."
"This is very important."
"But it is sad that a 10-mile limit was agreed upon when neighbouring states have 12 miles, which seems to be fairly standard."
"Finally, I support the Committee on Development and Cooperation's opinion that it would be useful if the European Commission could negotiate regional agreements to cover areas like Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and so on."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the honourable gentleman for his excellent report on the new terms and conditions for fishing by the Community fleet in the waters off Guinea."
"We consider that these new terms are likely to ensure a more effective implementation of the agreement in line with the basic principles of the conservation of resources."
"With this protocol, the Commission recognizes the action taken since 1996 by the Guinean Government to ensure overall control of access stocks and to develop the battle against illegal fishing and marine research."
"This new and positive climate, which is recognized by Community shipowners, has led to fishery resources in the area having improved and a renewed interest in Community fishermen in Guinean waters, which provide an important potential for the Community fleet."
"The Commission also considers that this new protocol with Guinea contains major innovations aimed in particular at promoting sustainable fishing, while being compatible with both the development policy and the Union's regional approach to fisheries agreements."
"The protocol marks significant progress in our regional approach and that is reflected in a harmonization of the financial terms offered by the Community to the various countries in the subregion."
"In addition, the technical provisions on fishing activities have been brought into line with the rules in force in the countries belonging to the Subregional Commission for Fishing in the Gulf of Guinea."
"The protocol allocates 50 % of the overall financial provision - that is to say ECU 3.25 million - over two years to schemes designed to promote marine research, the monitoring of fisheries to support small-scale fishing and training facilities and to contribute to international fisheries organizations."
"The scale of this support will give Guinea the means of taking part in the subregional programmes for managing resources."
"Guinea attaches great importance to that because this year it holds the chairmanship of two regional fisheries commissions: the Subregional Commission for Fishing off the Gulf of Guinea and the Ministerial Conference of Atlantic Coastal States."
"The protocol provides for close cooperation between the two parties in managing the schemes and gives us the possibility of reviewing payments involved in the light of how it is implemented."
"Turning to the amendments proposed, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 4 since that goes against established doctrines regarding the nature of our international fisheries agreements and would adversely affect the powers of the Commission to conduct negotiations."
"The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 in principle, if not in their present form."
"I should stress, however, that the Commission already gives regular information to Parliament as to the use made of fisheries agreements in its statements and reports to the Committee on Fisheries."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 6, given that fisheries agreements are concluded on a Community level and therefore it is the Commission that pays the financial compensation and the vessels fishing in these waters that pay the licence fees."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.50 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, on the question of Sellafield and the contamination of the Irish Sea, I did not say that the article was edited, but completely excised, at the request, I believe of the nuclear industry, specifically British Nuclear Fuels Limited."
"I want to draw Members' attention to the fact that I will be distributing that article today for their information."
"Mr President, my point of order relates to the trunks that are provided by Parliament for Members' use."
"They enable Members to move their papers between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"In approximately two hours' time, I am due to present the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy regarding the Cunha report. But the trunk containing all my papers has been left behind in Brussels, in the corridors of D3."
"I do not wish to bore you with endless complaints about the incompetence of the removal services. I have however noticed that there are a number of other recurring problems at the Brussels offices, relating to the lifts and cloakrooms, etcetera."
"What I should like to know, Mr President, is how Members are expected to fulfil their obligations, without files, papers, or the bare essentials they need in order to carry out their duties?"
"This is a consequence of having three separate places of work."
"I suggest you write to the President raising this matter."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Decision on urgency"
"Mr President, the overwhelming majority of the Socialist Group will vote for this request to apply the urgent procedure."
"It was on 17 February 1997 that the Commission's document of options to reform the olive oil sector was presented, and the compromise resolution named after Mr Jové Peres was adopted in December."
"The European Parliament has therefore certainly had ample opportunity to give its opinion on this matter!"
"Moreover, the Commission's current proposal, Mr President, does no more than take on board most of the points of the resolution by Mr Jové Peres, demonstrating that the Parliament's pressure has served to condition the Commission's basic guidelines."
"I should not be the one to say it, considering that I voted against this resolution. Rather, it should be the rapporteur, and it is absurd, in my view, that he did not do it in committee."
"The point is that, despite what has been written, there is a country, the leading producer, that does not want to hear about any reform, that has chosen the road of protest from which there is no way out and unconditional and unlimited postponement."
"The beginning of the next marketing year has been set at 1 November."
"Therefore decisions have to be made quickly, and I believe that there are a few absurdities that have to be quickly corrected."
"One of these absurdities is a guaranteed maximum quota for the Community as a whole, which results in the absurd situation of a substantial cut in aid for producers of those countries that have not increased production, only because another country has produced excess quantities."
"In no organization of the market is there a mechanism this unfair."
"If we do not find a remedy for this, Mr President, I think that we will all be overwhelmed with protests from producers and that we will very quickly be asked to account for our short-sightedness."
"In committee, the rapporteur refused to commit himself to any deadline for his report, even when our group made very reasonable proposals."
"Urgency is also the only way to enable the President-in-Office, Mr Cunningham, to conclude the commendable inquiry that has been conducted in a difficult climate and to give producers a positive and definite answer."
"I think the President is mistaken."
"I asked to speak first because I wished to inform the House, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that on 19 May the Committee approved the treatment of this issue as an urgency by 27 votes to 17."
"That is what I wanted to say at the outset, before other Members are invited to speak for or against the motion."
"Mr President, I have been a Member of this House for 13 years and this is the first time I have come across an urgency of this nature."
"A request was made in April for urgent procedure to take place in June on the reform of the olive oil sector due to come into force on 1 November 1998."
"In other words, from the procedural point of view, there is no need for us to debate the question of the olive oil sector reform now, in this urgent manner."
"Secondly, the reform being proposed is not just a simple adjustment of a few problematic details, but an extremely farreaching reform of the olive oil sector."
"It is not just a question of the maximum guaranteed quantity and how it is shared out between countries - which is undoubtedly debatable - but very important elements are being introduced, without having been debated in Parliament."
"For example, the intervention is disappearing, and this is the first sector of the CAP to be affected by that change."
"That is not happening with cereals, milk or meat, but it is happening in the case of olive oil."
"Aid to consumption is also disappearing, without being debated in this Parliament."
"The ban on mixing olive oils is going to disappear, and also the lack of regulation for table olives."
"So we do not think the matter can be dealt with quickly, without discussion in committee, without a rapporteur and without a report."
"I think the dignity of this House is at stake, quite apart from any problems a certain country might have with this sector."
"What is at stake is a serious, in-depth debate of something that must affect Agenda 2000 and which should therefore be discussed fully in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"(Parliament approved urgent procedure)"
"Mr President, I am speaking because it is my dubious privilege to be the oldest member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, since the committee chairman, Mr Rocard, and the vice-chairmen cannot be with us at the moment, for various reasons."
"And I can inform you that the Committee on Development and Cooperation has studied this request for urgent procedure and has agreed almost unanimously in its favour, with the exception of just one political group."
"So, if the request is approved, the Committee on Development and Cooperation will meet this evening at 5.30 p.m. to vote on Mr Liese's report and the amendments to the Commission text."
"(Parliament approved urgent procedure)"
"Mr President, the reason we requested agreement to approve urgent procedure in this matter, and the Committee adopted it, is that we have to debate agricultural prices in this part-session, and we have always demanded that that debate should include the set-aside requirement."
"(Parliament approved urgent procedure)"
"Agricultural prices - common organization of the market in raw tobacco"
"The next item is the joint debate on two reports on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development:"
"A4-0216/98 by Mr des Places, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposals for 18 Council Regulations on the prices for agricultural products and on related measures (1998-1999) (COM(98)0051 - C4-0084 to C4-0101/98-98/0034(CNS) to 98/0049/CNS, 98/0805 (CNS) and 98/0806(CNS)-A4-0218/98 by Mr Rosado Fernandes, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 on the common organization of the market in raw tobacco (COM(98)0019 - C4-0185/98-98/0027(CNS))"
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their proposals and contributions during our various discussions, and for their amendments."
"They have in general supported me, and I should therefore like to thank them for this."
"As far as the prices package for the 1998-1999 agricultural year is concerned, the roll-over of prices and compensatory aids will come as a surprise to no one. They are the same, with a few exceptions, as in preceding years, the same as presented by Mr Sturdy, not to mention the same as in 1993, ever since the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"The prices package clearly has no great claim to imagination, Commissioner."
"But this is perhaps due to the important dates which lie ahead: the reform of the common agricultural policy, with a view to the WTO negotiations in 2003; the reform of the Structural Funds in 1999 envisaged by Agenda 2000; enlargement to include certain Eastern European countries in the year 2000; the changeover by some countries to the euro, and even the exchange rate of the euro against the ECU, which also raises the problem of the ""green' ECU; and finally, the euro/dollar parity because, as I would like to point out, world market prices for the large agricultural product areas are set in dollars, on the basis of the Chicago futures market."
"Unless of course, Commissioner, it would be possible to set up a European futures market for agricultural products, based near the European Central Bank, that is, in Frankfurt."
"All this, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, will take place within a rigorous budgetary framework set until 2006, in which the financial resources of the European Union will never exceed a ceiling of 1.27 % of its GNP. The financial resources available for the common agricultural policy are therefore limited."
"Now I should like to say a few words about the budget situation in 1999."
"The provisional estimate for the 1999 agricultural guideline is about ECU 45.2 billion, that is an increase of approximately 1.9 billion, or 4.5 % in comparison with 1998."
"The budgetary authority adopted the principle of limiting expenditure, during the 1997 and 1998 budget procedures, by voting budgets significantly lower than the preliminary draft budgets drawn up by its departments."
"The Commission considers that this climate of budgetary restraint in the Member States should continue in 1999, the year of the introduction of the euro."
"Within this specific budgetary context, the Commission is proposing a prices package which increases agricultural spending by ECU 9 million under the 1998 budget and ECU 29 million under the 1999 budget."
"It should be noted here that this increase at current rates amounts, in real terms and at constant prices, to a reduction of about 2 % in prices and compensatory aids."
"On this particular point, I have tabled a series of amendments, which aim to update agricultural prices and compensatory aids in order to redress the effect of monetary erosion."
"With regard to the budget, I understand from the memorandum of 10 June 1998 on the early warning system, that there is a difference of almost ECU 1.1 billion between the implementation of the EAGGF Guarantee appropriations and the indicator of consumption."
"This reduction, caused by monetary erosion, will be accompanied by another reduction in prices and compensatory aids of about 2 %, according to estimates, which will be caused by the disappearance of the green ECU with the introduction of the euro."
"The Committee on Agriculture has adopted my amendments regarding the creation of an adjustment coefficient with a view to maintaining equitable levels of income between farmers in all European Union Member States in order to compensate for the possible disappearance of the green rate on 1 January 1999 for the Member States participating in the single currency."
"I should like to point out here that some applications show that a 1 % difference in the values of the green ECU and the euro is equivalent to ECU 400 million."
"The Commission's proposal on the prices package has a number of deficiencies."
"First of all, the set-aside rate."
"Earlier this morning, we voted on a request for urgent procedure with regard to the Commission's proposal on the set-aside requirement."
"I am delighted that the Commission has responded to our request to establish a set-aside rate by the end of June 1998, in compliance with an amendment adopted by the Committee on Agriculture."
"The proposal, which consists of implementing the principle of an extraordinary set-aside and raising the set-aside rate to 10 %, is totally unacceptable."
"Farmers should not have to bear the cost of errors made by the Commission in its management of the markets, which will lead to a 20-25 % increase in stocks carried over."
"Since July 1997 the Commission seems to have been adopting a rather risky approach to its management of cereals exports, with the tax on wheat exports when the European price was below the world market price, abandonment to the competitors of the Saudi market for barley and prolonged delays at the start of the agricultural year, all of which has now led to the risk of a very sharp increase in European stocks."
"If the current delay in export commitments, 4.5 million tonnes less than in 1997 at the same period - 8 million tonnes less than the normal pattern -, is not reabsorbed, the European Union could find itself in the position, on 30 June 1998, of having about 30 million tonnes of cereals as opposed to 28 million tonnes on 30 June 1997."
"And yet, Commissioner, the volume of our exports is less than 25 million tonnes, although the WTO ceiling allows exports of 30 tonnes, plus the carry-over from previous years."
"Furthermore, producers do not understand why it should be necessary to impose more set-asides, when they are being asked to accept further proposed price reductions for next year, to enable them to sell and produce more."
"I should like to reiterate that the set-aside rate affects the budget as well as farmers' incomes. And under these circumstances, I am delighted that we may be able to adopt both the prices package and the set-aside rate, during the same part-session."
"Now I would like to say something on the subject of wine."
"Unlike other major agricultural product areas, the common organization of the market in wine has not been reformed for 15 years."
"The reform is in progress and should be presented to us this week."
"In any case, it will not be applicable to the marketing year 1998/99."
"In its price proposals the Commission provides for an extension of the quota for permanent grubbing up of vines, while failing to create a quota for new plantings."
"This provision on new plantings allows the most dynamic wine growing regions to adapt supply to demand and to improve the quality of the vineyards."
"I therefore tabled a number of amendments on this point, which were furthermore adopted by the Committee on Agriculture."
"I will now turn to the subject of hemp. At the Council meeting in January 1997 the Commission undertook to propose stronger contractual arrangements with regard to hemp."
"In June 1997 the Council asked the Commission to study the possibility of establishing compulsory contracts between hemp producers and processors. Instead of putting forward such contractual arrangements as part of the prices package the Commission has merely lowered hemp prices by 25 %."
"The aim is to discourage producers, as the area given over to hemp production has increased from about 10 000 hectares in 1996 to 40 000 hectares in 1998. I would like to stress that hemp is an agricultural crop, which requires specific investments by both farmers and processors."
"The fibre produced from hemp is used in the industrial sector, for insulation and so on. It is therefore an agricultural product for non-food use."
"The Commission's main proposals on beef and veal are as follows: extension of the reduction of national ceilings for premiums for male bovine animals."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I am going to speak on a hot topic, smoke, or kapnos , as the Greeks say."
"Tobacco, we call it."
"It is a hot topic, because it has provoked passionate reactions."
"It is a hot topic, because it has provoked near-irrational reactions."
"On the one hand false rationalism aimed at the expense it involves, and on the other pious words about the harm it does."
"Health considerations and budgetary considerations have whipped this subject up into a cocktail of passions which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has tried to modulate, maintaining an attitude in which its first concern is for the people who make their living by growing tobacco."
"Obviously all those of us who have children are concerned that young people should not smoke."
"We are all concerned that young people should not drink, but wine has to be produced..."
"We are all concerned that young people should not eat too much fat, or too much sugar, because all these things can affect our health, but there are pigmeat producers and sugar producers..."
"We all agree on that aspect of the matter."
"With regard to the financial cost, the funds invested in tobacco growing, we know that around 600 000 people are involved in the industry, not to mention retailers, and we have of course seen the Committee on Budgets adopt a position which I jokingly referred to as 'Pope-like' , condemning the spending of money on tobacco growing as anathema."
"Yet I know that same Committee voted against the purchase of scanners that could control the smuggling of tobacco products throughout the territory of Europe, in lorries and containers."
"And I have no doubt, from the information I receive, that if those budgetary measures and controls were put into practice the money we would recover from fraud and organized crime would comfortably outweigh the money we spend on maintaining tobacco producers."
"Then again, there is the Committee on the Environment."
"That Committee is entitled to adopt whatever position it sees fit with regard to tobacco and other plants."
"Yet in my judgment it often exceeds its powers, inasmuch as it tries to issue diktats on the ways in which agriculture should be reformed, the money that should be spent, the way people ought to behave."
"The truth, let me say without wishing to offend anyone, is that at the beginning of the Iranian revolution - and you need only read an article published some time ago in the Economist , 'The Ayatollahs' - one of the first measures taken was to ban smoking throughout Iran."
"I do not have to think about anyone else's options, I support individual responsibility and people's ability to choose for themselves, provided they do not inconvenience anyone else and are not a burden on society."
"I think we all have that choice to do right or wrong."
"And I cannot prevent my neighbour from doing wrong."
"In my report I have tried to prevent, and have proposed that we should prevent, the Committee from intervening by purchasing fixed quotas."
"I have tried to defend the argument that tobacco growing, which costs between a thousand and two thousand hours per hectare and is therefore one of the lowest-paid in Europe, should continue in the Greek mountains or the Mediterranean areas."
"I have also tried to support the provision of openings for young growers and to prevent modulation from being too heavy a penalty on growers under the pretext of quality control."
"These are the aspects I have defended and on this point I will finish, Mr President, so as not to overload this speech."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that it is both an honour and a privilege for me, on behalf of the presidency and the Agriculture Council, which I represent here today, to have the opportunity of addressing you all in Parliament."
"Just over a year ago a new Labour Government in Britain embarked upon a sea change in relations between the United Kingdom and the European Parliament and, for that matter, the other institutions of the European Union too."
"We were determined to work constructively and cooperatively with our European partners and with the European Parliament, and we have done so."
"Speaking about my own contribution to that development, this is my fourth appearance in Parliament as President of the Agriculture Council and my sixth visit in 12 months in my role as United Kingdom Minister of Agriculture."
"The UK presidency has been an active one and, as for the brief remaining part, June also looks very busy."
"Apart from the topics we are here to address today at the June Council, we aim to reach conclusions on other items of business, for example on quotas for the production of potato starch, updating the rules on controlling tuberculosis, brucellosis and EBL in cattle and determining the 1990 set-aside rate for arable crops."
"We hope, too, that it will be possible for the June Council to agree a measure which will effectively set general standards on farm-animal welfare, right across the Union."
"Moreover, we were grateful for Parliament's rapid consideration of the ornamental plants dossier, where there is now a wide measure of agreement in the Council, and we expect adoption of that dossier shortly."
"Let me deal first with the question of price-fixing."
"In view of the proposals for reform of the CAP and many of the major common market organization regimes - about which I will be saying more later - the Commission's proposals for the 1998 price-fixing round are centred on those price decisions which are required for legal or technical reasons."
"In most cases the Commission has simply recommended a roll-over of existing provision."
"There is broad agreement in the Council in support of this approach."
"However, not unexpectedly in the course of the Council discussion of this dossier, Member States have suggested a number of additional elements to the 1998 prices package."
"The presidency and the Commission are working closely together to accommodate as many of these as can be realistically adopted."
"I intend to negotiate a compromise on this package at next week's Agriculture Council, having first taken careful note of the views of Parliament."
"Tobacco is an example of a sector where the Union's agriculture needs to be more competitive and open to the market as we prepare for enlargement and the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"With this in mind, the Commission has come forward with some constructive workable ideas which I hope will provide a sound basis for a much improved regime."
"All Member States accept the need for reform and the aim of improving tobacco quality but there is a divergence of views between producer states and non-producer states over the ways and means of proceeding."
"Most producer states accept the need for premium modulation as an important tool in improving quality and helping their growers to get closer to the market."
"They do, however, favour less modulation, phased in over a longer period."
"The main producer states also oppose quota buyback as over time it would result in a progressive reduction in the amount of subsidized production."
"They argue it would cause rural depopulation and unemployment unless surrendered quotas are redistributed to existing producers or new entrants."
"The Commission takes the line that surrendered quotas must be withdrawn permanently."
"Non-producer Member States continue to draw attention to the high cost of the regime and the disparity between the budget for the Commission's anti-smoking programme and the annual spend on subsidies for tobacco producers."
"Indeed, some argue for gradual withdrawal of support from this sector altogether."
"In discussions so far, general agreement has been reached on many issues but some outstanding differences remain to be resolved."
"The presidency has been trying to make headway with this dossier, as with all dossiers we have been responsible for dealing with during our presidency, in a fair, open, constructive and impartial manner."
"We are making every effort to reach a final agreement later this month and, to that end, will place particular value on the opinion that will be forthcoming from Parliament."
"I wish to pay a warm personal tribute to Commissioner Franz Fischler, on behalf of the United Kingdom presidency, for his excellent help and cooperation and constructive working with us throughout the months of that presidency, and, once again, Mr President, thank you for inviting me to open your first debate."
"I now look forward with interest to hearing the views of your colleagues on these important questions."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to look at the context of the price proposals for the marketing year 1998/99."
"The proposals continue the policy of stability of the previous prices packages, providing for existing institutional prices to be maintained in almost all sectors."
"That does not, however, in any way imply that there is no need for a fundamental revision of the common agricultural policy."
"On the contrary!"
"Using Agenda 2000, the Commission wants to introduce a reform that will go far beyond the fragmentary annual adjustments made in the context of the prices package, in order to prepare European agriculture for the future and to provide security for the European agricultural model."
"Therefore, for the 1998/99 prices, we should restrict ourselves to those measures which are absolutely necessary and not deal prematurely with imminent fundamental reforms."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their excellent work of examining the proposals and formulating the amendments."
"My thanks also go to the Members of the other Committees that were actively involved in this work: the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on External Economic Relations, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"I would like to begin by discussing those amendments which deal with the introduction of the euro."
"These propose an adjustment coefficient for prices and subsidies in order to offset the abolition of conversion rates on 1 January 1999 in those countries participating in the single currency."
"In the past week the Commission has adopted a proposal addressing this very matter of the effect of the introduction of the euro on the common agricultural policy."
"The Commission is of the opinion that possible loss of income due to the introduction of the euro can best be offset by payment of compensatory allowances."
"A system of adjustment coefficients would serve only to introduce yet another new type of agricultural conversion rate."
"Thus, the amendments based on this cannot be accepted but, like Parliament, the Commission is aware of the underlying economic problem."
"A whole series of amendments are aimed at increasing prices and direct payments by a blanket 1.7 %."
"I cannot accept this for three reasons. Firstly, this is diametrically opposed to the need to improve the competitiveness of Community produce, indeed both in the internal market and in the global market."
"Secondly, it would result in considerable budget costs - approximately ECU 260 million, which is unacceptable in times of strict budgetary discipline."
"Thirdly, it could jeopardize the international obligations of the Union, affecting in particular the level of internal support."
"In addition, I would like to note that the minor effects of inflation are more than offset by technological progress and improvements in agricultural structuring."
"In Amendment No 11 the Commission is called upon to submit, as soon as possible, a proposal concerning the rate of setaside for the marketing year 1999/2000."
"As you know, this proposal is already in existence and was even accorded urgency."
"In two sectors, those of hemp and beef, the majority of amendments are intended to change fundamentally the Commission proposal."
"Firstly, Amendments Nos 18 to 22 concern the hemp sector, and their primary aim is to delete the proposal concerning reduction of subsidies."
"The Commission is really concerned about the considerable and constant expansion of arable land, and also about the problem of control in this sector."
"On 6 May, the Commission proposed to the Council a clear increase in control, to be linked notably to the introduction of obligatory contracts between producers and processors."
"This point is incidentally also contained in Amendment No 77, the content of which I will split in two."
"In the beef sector, Amendments Nos 48 to 53 aim to reverse the Commission's proposal."
"These provide for a return to the high levels of 1996 for the maximum premiums for bulls - that is, 20 % more than in the last two years."
"In view of the remaining difficulties concerning market situation and in order not to rush the revision of the organization of the single market within the context of Agenda 2000, the status quo must, in the Commission's opinion, be maintained."
"However, in the case of Spain and Portugal, an increase in maximum rates can be directly attributed to an obligation of the Council of November 1996, and we therefore made a corresponding proposal."
"Several amendments also provide for considerable changes to market organization which the Commission cannot, however, accept in the context of these price proposals, which are to be kept as simple as possible."
"Thus, Amendment No 7 provides for a higher compensatory payment for areas set aside to be used for purposes other than food production."
"On this subject, I would like to say that of course we all want to promote the cultivation of renewable primary products with the various instruments available, but to my mind, a specific new subsidy would seem to be far from desirable."
"A set-aside rate of 10 % would also comply in principle with this request."
"Now on to Amendment No 25. Breeders of silkworms have already recently profited from currency devaluations in the relevant Member States."
"I therefore consider a subsidy increase to be inappropriate."
"Approval of renewed planting, premature replanting, the period of validity of planting rights for wine and a subsidy for grape must, as provided for by Amendments Nos 29 to 35 and by Amendment No 37, cannot be dealt with in the context of this prices package."
"The Commission recognizes that these are important issues; it will therefore deal with these in its proposal concerning the reform."
"This proposal will be submitted to the Commission for a decision tomorrow."
"Amendments Nos 41, 85 and 87 aim to increase the premiums for certain higher quality types of tobacco."
"There is no economic reason to favour one kind over another."
"On the other hand, one of the main aims of the tobacco reform, which is also being discussed, is to improve the overall quality of tobacco."
"Amendments Nos 55 and 94 aim to neutralize the stabilizing effect in sheepmeat by increasing the basic premium by 7 %."
"This would mean having to abandon the premium for rural areas and would reopen the debate on the budget made available for this sector."
"Potential supplementary costs would be ECU 85 million."
"I will now look at the amendments which aim to extend or introduce derogations."
"These cannot be approved in their current form."
"Some of them, however, merit thorough examination."
"These are Amendments Nos 2 and 3."
"They refer to the moisture content of cereals."
"This decision falls within the jurisdiction of the Commission."
"The exemption was granted traditionally but this year the higher intervention stocks are also to be considered in global terms."
"Amendments Nos 5 and 9 refer to the suspension of special set-aside."
"They should be judged in the context of the proposal concerning the set-aside rate."
"Amendments Nos 6, 10, 49 and 54 refer to the new German Länder."
"The derogations in question were granted for a limited period in the new Länder because of specific structural problems."
"As far as the base area for arable crops is concerned, I would point out that the proposals of the current prices package provide for a certain flexibility in that the deadline for the choice of partial base area regulation is postponed to 15 September."
"According to Amendment No 8, in certain cases it should still be permissible for the area set aside to be greater than its arable acreage."
"The Commission is aware of this problem but prefers to deal with it within the framework of Agenda 2000."
"Amendment No 36 provides for the derogation on the minimum acid content of wine to be extended."
"Whatever solution is chosen, it must not under any circumstances anticipate the pending reform."
"Amendments Nos 38 to 40 allow suspension of wine growing on small plots of land."
"We could, in effect, consider taking this problem into account."
"In any case, I am pleased to see in the result that the proposals of the Commission largely did justice to its suggestions, as appropriate suggestions have already been submitted for too many amendments - I am thinking here of the euro, the set-aside rate, the tobacco reform, the hemp agreements and others."
"Many of these are considered in Agenda 2000 and we agree that some of these amendments must be examined urgently."
"I would ask for your indulgence if I speak a bit longer today because I have another important topic to discuss: the organization of the tobacco market."
"I will come to this now."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur for having dealt so swiftly with the proposal on the reform of the common market organization for raw tobacco, so that we could discuss it today."
"After the vote on the report which the Commission submitted to Parliament last year, the Council and the Commission agreed to continue to support tobacco growers."
"As you know, the Commission basically proposes to create effective incentives to improve product quality and at the same time to support those who wish to give up tobacco production."
"By shifting the emphasis from quantity to quality, the reform takes into account the business of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Budgets without taking away the possibility of other sources of income from farmers particularly in disadvantaged areas."
"For this reason, the Commission rejects Amendments Nos 29, 30, 33, 37, 42, 53 and 59, and Nos 66, 67 and 76 which aim for a compulsory withdrawal of the Community from tobacco production."
"Community production represents only about one-third of Community consumption and could easily be replaced by imports."
"I am very much in favour of encouraging voluntary withdrawal from production, however."
"I welcome in principle the definition of quality criteria in the marketing of tobacco, as contained in Amendments Nos 4, 7, 15 and 16."
"These criteria should nonetheless be incorporated into cultivation contracts and the individual provisions relating to this should be laid down in the Commission's implementing regulation."
"Please rest assured that the Commission will take the European Parliament's amendments into account in this procedure."
"The Commission would like to offer farmers the most effective incentives possible to improve quality."
"As regards the variable part amounts of the premium in accordance with Amendments Nos 14, 17, 18, 39, 69, 75 and 77, the Commission is of the opinion that at least 35 % of the premium should be graduated accordingly in order to fulfil the aims of quality differentiation and avoidance of social problems to a satisfactory extent."
"By means of the possibility of quota buy-back - the basis for Amendments Nos 8, 9, 27 and 28 - the Commission wishes to provide a safety net for economically weak producers who are not in a position to participate in the campaign for improved quality."
"I am prepared to examine additional safety measures which should prevent this system from leading to a complete cessation of production."
"But I cannot accept any amendments that would render this system ineffective."
"I would also like to note that within the framework of the Structural Funds, Member States already have the opportunity to submit projects which would facilitate the transition to other economic activities for tobacco growers."
"For this reason, I cannot approve Amendments Nos 6, 26, 58 or 63."
"With regard to Amendment No 44, I share these aims but it is neither necessary nor obvious for bought-back quotas to be withdrawn from the guarantee fund."
"With reference to Amendment No 51 I would like to remind you that quota buy-back should be on a voluntary basis, so minimum targets cannot be accepted."
"The Commission welcomes Amendments Nos 24 and 81 and that part of Amendment No 36 which deals with the expansion of the area of application of the tobacco fund."
"However, in my opinion conversion schemes and research into new uses for tobacco should be financed by this fund."
"Therefore, it is my view that we should persist in our proposal to increase the amount to be made available to this fund in order to be able to finance these new initiatives as well."
"Thus, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 11, 23, 25, 48, 49, 50 or that part of Amendment No 36 which refers to this."
"I share the concerns expressed in Amendment No 10."
"The Commission cannot, however, allow research and investigation to take priority over such measures aimed at improving quality."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 52 and 86, I can readily agree to make the report available to the European Parliament."
"However, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 13, 34 or 38, as the additional amount offered to the northern producer states is in accordance with the situation of their producers and thus should also be maintained."
"Amendment No 20 proposes quota compensation at a national level."
"However, quotas belong to individual producers, which is why the existing carry-over possibilities are the correct solution to this problem."
"I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment any more than I can Amendment No 22, as we must respect the stability of annual expenditure."
"Amendments Nos 41, 45, 47, 51, 78, 79, 82 and 85 are directed towards a change in the commitology procedure."
"I, however, am of the opinion that the common market organization regime for tobacco should be subject to the same rules as all other market organization regimes."
"I cannot accept Amendments Nos 35, 60, 61 or 68, as it is important to retain structural improvements and freedom of quota transfer."
"The evaluation of the new regulation in the year 2000 or 2001, proposed in Amendments Nos 52 and 65, seems somewhat premature but, of course, an evaluation is necessary."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 70, 73 and 74, it is my opinion that the agreements on sale by auction would give the producer better opportunities in terms of market prices."
"I would therefore like to keep this option open."
"Amendments Nos 1, 5, 12, 19, 32, 40, 43, 62 and 64 would entail enormous changes to the underlying equilibrium in the respective areas that is intrinsic to our proposal, and this is why I am not in a position to accept them."
"Nevertheless, I can accept Amendments Nos 71 and 72, which allow the Member States a transitional period for the transition to direct premium payments to producers."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 31 and 86, to accept these would not be to increase the quality of tobacco but to reduce it."
"The Commission is prepared, however, to use the national supply of quotas for allocation to young farmers, as provided for by Amendment No 21."
"However, this should take place in conjunction with the usual administrative authorities."
"I would like to thank you for dealing with the reform of this sector so swiftly, and I hope this will also be the case with upcoming Agenda 2000 proposals."
"Mr President, I am surprised that Commissioner Fischler did not wait to hear the opinions of the committees to which the proposal was referred before giving his response, but I shall nevertheless deliver the opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"The 1998-1999 agricultural year is unusual because it will be the last year to fall within the scope of the present agricultural policy. I am therefore tempted to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to endorse these price proposals because they will be the last."
"In fact, the raison d'être of the real debate on the forthcoming reform of the CAP can be found in Agenda 2000."
"That is why the Committee on Budgets has emphasized, by adopting the opinion I proposed, that the budgetary consequences of the present price proposals with regard to the forthcoming agricultural year are limited."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has paid special attention to the introduction of the euro, as the Committee on Budgets asked, and rightly so."
"It is important for the budgetary effect of the introduction of the euro on the agricultural sector to be evaluated as accurately as possible, and appropriate measures proposed as soon as possible."
"From 1 January 1999 the euro will replace the ECU and therefore also the green ECU, whose value is up to 1.5 % higher than the normal - financial - ECU."
"The Commission has not yet made proposals for the transition of the present agri-monetary system to the euro, but intends to forward proposals to Council and Parliament before September this year. It has not been able to do so yet as there has to be certainty about which countries will definitively participate in European monetary union."
"The Committee on Budgets will naturally prepare another opinion on the financial consequences of the proposals."
"With regard to the sectoral amendments, I am delighted that the Committee on Agriculture has taken up my proposal with regard to the authorization of ""new plantations' for high-quality wines produced in specific regions."
"The Committee on Budgets also protested against the European Commission's proposed approach to the question of aid for hemp producers."
"The Commission now wants to discourage the production of hemp as it is of the opinion that hemp is sometimes produced for 'illegal' reasons. But Indian hemp is not the only type of hemp, and not all types can be smoked."
"The Commission has chosen the easiest solution: reduction of the premium to discourage a further rise in production."
"The agricultural sector has invested in this, and is now being unfairly punished by a savage 25 % reduction in the subsidy."
"It is very encouraging to see that the Committee on Agriculture is aware of this problem and has even proposed an increase in the aid per hectare."
"I should like to add a last remark about olive oil and draw to the Commission's attention the tensions and distortions that exist between the amounts of olive oil produced, the amount of financial aid provided, and the uncertainty of current methods of inspection."
"Mr President, I will just be referring to the tobacco report."
"Firstly, I will be ignoring the comments of Mr Rosado Fernandes on the Committee on Budgets."
"Like his report they are flawed."
"I am a realist in these matters and I can assume that the Wynn amendments, the Hardstaff amendments and the Environment Committee amendments will not be carried later in the day and therefore I can imagine that the report will be adopted."
"As you may well imagine, I will not be voting for it except probably for the first amendment from Mr Rosado Fernandes which says 'whereas the Commission has taken no account whatsoever of the European Parliament's opinion of 17 July 1997' ."
"I would change that to say 'welcomes the fact the Commission has taken no notice of our opinion last year because once again it was a flawed opinion' ."
"There is this ostrich attitude, with its head in the sand: look at the second amendment from the committee, which talks about the raw tobacco market being very competitive."
"Where do they get this fiction from?"
"It beggars understanding."
"The truth is, that without European Union subsidies there would be no tobacco industry in Europe."
"Not one gramme can sell on a competitive market without EU subsidies."
"There is no reason to give money to farmers in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria."
"It is a black hole that we pour money into."
"Having said that, the Commission has come forward with a report that is a good deal better than the system that we have at present."
"However, the Budgets Committee opinion is that it is flawed."
"Why not go back, Commissioner, and start again?"
"The consequences are far from perfect."
"As you have said yourself, we are not even saving money."
"It will actually cost more money than the present system when we take into consideration the monies from the Structural Funds."
"This is not a situation that we in the Budgets Committee want to see continuing and quite frankly the best result for everyone would be to take the report back and come forward with something far more bold and dramatic."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not wish to play Ayatollah, as Mr Rosado Fernandes is insinuating."
"When we drafted our opinion on the common organization of the market in raw tobacco, we, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, made two basic assumptions."
"Firstly, the massive production aid for tobacco, and we are talking about no less than ECU 1 billion, is completely at odds with the EU's policy on the prevention of cancer."
"We are supporting a product which is responsible for the deaths of half a million EU citizens a year."
"Secondly, the subsidies are, in principle, temporary."
"We have been supporting tobacco farmers for more than a generation without any prospect of improvement."
"That is why we do not agree with the Commission proposal."
"We are therefore calling for a complete abolition of subsidized production by the year 2006."
"In countries where there are adequate alternative forms of cultivation, such as Belgium and Austria, the subsidies must be abolished sooner."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection realizes that the abolition should happen gradually, and has therefore developed a transition scenario with the following main features."
"Firstly, half of the premium must depend on the quality of the production."
"Those who produce better quality will therefore be able to manage without subsidies at a later date."
"Secondly, quotas must be gradually reduced."
"Thirdly, the transfer of quotas between producers will no longer be permitted."
"Fourthly, 5 % of the premium must go the Tobacco Research and Information Fund."
"The Fund must look into possibilities for the cultivation of other crops and into other profitable economic activities."
"Finally, we are asking the Commission to again conduct a thorough study into the option which was handed to us by the Court of Auditors in 1994, namely direct income support."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my proposals are incorporated in Amendments Nos 29 to 53."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection adopted these unanimously."
"It was co-signed by thirty Members from all groups."
"I therefore hope that a majority in this House will opt for a responsible and healthy use of public funds."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what more can be said about the prices package?"
"That it would perhaps be reasonable to no longer present it in these terms and to switch to a different system that involves our House in deciding basic directions, to offer multiannual guidelines to our farmers who have to make production choices."
"Our group believes that now is the time to do this, because the contrast has become so great between this procedure, which before involved long marathons, and the Agenda 2000 reforms which are the real package of farm prices on the table."
"The only thing to be said is to agree with the rapporteur, Mr des Places, on the urgency of giving a little more impetus to the wine sector."
"We cannot just sit around twiddling our thumbs when there is a policy of new large-scale plantings of vines in countries competing with the European Union: since there are no longer surpluses, the market for quality wines is witnessing renewed vigour and the money in the Community budget for this sector is being reduced to virtually nothing."
"We must avoid the gradual paralysis of a sector that can continue to be an object of pride for Europeans, anticipating with the prices package certain aspects of the reform of the COM that the Commission should adopt tomorrow."
"As for tobacco, I would like to say to my fellow Members: let us try to have a progressive vision of the sector and not always remain confined to a Manichean and ideological debate - tobacco yes, tobacco no -, let us stop criminalizing a sector of production that can continue to play an economic, social and occupational role, worthy of the utmost importance."
"Were people to no longer die from smoking if all aid was cut off, I would be the first to observe this moral command."
"But we know that it does not work that way, that it is an illusion: we would just import more products from outside the Community, the amount being already greatly insufficient, as Commissioner Fischler recalled."
"What is more, we already discussed the matter at length a few months ago."
"We also know that with the billion ECUs of the COM, it is quite difficult to guarantee for other sectors an opening for jobs like the one created by tobacco production, which is the most labour-intensive agricultural product grown in what are usually disadvantaged regions."
"We therefore agree with the strategy proposed by the Commission - significant innovation, emphasis on quality - to make the sector more and more market-oriented and to grant aid also to anyone wanting to leave the sector because of lack of prospects."
"We believe that the rapporteur, although he honourably wants to defend producers, in some passages introduces too much resistance to these innovations."
"But it is only right that tobacco producers also begin to see clearly what the future of the entire common agricultural policy is: less situation rents, more targeted aid, policies of quality and more international competition; on the other hand, new developments in policies for rural development and agricultural structures."
"This is the picture, and it is in the interest of all that it be very clear."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur, Mr des Places, established in his report that average income from agricultural activities, measured in terms of real net product, has fallen by 3.1 %."
"I fully concur with him in this."
"In fact, prices for products from livestock farming have fallen; in particular, pig prices have reached their lowest in years."
"The profits from cereals have also been very much affected by downward pressure on prices."
"This is why monthly surcharges must be retained."
"In this agricultural debate, which differs from previous agricultural debates, I would ask you, Commissioner, to intervene in these two areas of cereals and pigmeat and, as you did in the case of beef, to use all possible means to relieve the market."
"In the context of the reports on Agenda 2000, the decisions on agricultural prices are, as you said, of a temporary nature and consist mainly of an assessment."
"I have a positive suggestion for you in terms of the Agenda."
"Should you accept our proposals, the Agenda will be able to proceed far faster than hitherto envisaged; otherwise, we must prepare to go through a long rigmarole."
"However, we have drawn up excellent proposals which we will be submitting to you in due course."
"I would urge you not to take the path of least resistance in the area of hemp, but to support this environmentally friendly plant so that its introduction to the market can be successful."
"With plants, there is no point in beginning with subsidies, then investing in the market, then immediately starting to reduce subsidies before the plants have been fully introduced to the market."
"The existence of national hemp processing plants is thus jeopardized as well."
"I welcome the extension of the derogation for the five new German Länder."
"In principle, a lasting solution to this problem must be found in agricultural reform, in the beef and veal market organization regime."
"I thank you expressly, Commissioner, for having responded so promptly in the area of set-aside."
"I would like to commend you very highly on this."
"I would like to encourage you to see this 10 % set-aside through to the end."
"Otherwise we will never put an end to this desperate state of affairs and the Agenda 2000 negotiations will once again be crippled before the event by heavy investment; this is not good because once again we would be unable to determine how things really ought to be."
"This path is not practicable as it would lead to a new set of problems."
"New beef and milk surpluses are being produced and for this reason I think set-aside should be implemented in the same way in which it has already proved its merit."
"Mr President, please allow me to make one last comment. I would like to praise the Commissioner for making a sensible proposal regarding how to introduce the euro - not through some complicated mechanism; instead, he wants to even out any losses which individual countries may incur by means of transparent measures."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the President-in-Office for the warm interest he has shown in the activities of this Parliament over the last six months, and we hope that future Presidents-in-Office will use this as a model."
"First of all, the des Places report is not taking place under the most favourable circumstances, as far as prices for farmers are concerned."
"I believe it would be a delusion to think that, both in the light of the budget difficulties and in the light of Agenda 2000 proposals, we might promise farmers higher prices."
"My group will therefore support the general terms of the Commission proposals."
"A few aspects need to be emphasized, however, and the Commission has already been forthcoming with us about this prior to our vote on the amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The transition from the green ECU to the euro must happen gradually."
"At the moment it appears likely that we will be continuing this discussion."
"Secondly, the Commission must do as much as it can to develop new markets. We will therefore support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on agrification, the use of agricultural products for nonfood purposes, especially those amendments which refer to the production of hemp for industrial purposes."
"As far as the Rosado Fernandes report is concerned, I must say that my group is very divided on this issue."
"We will vote in two ways."
"The general line is that we support the position of the Commission that the tobacco which is being produced must meet market requirements and therefore must be of high quality."
"In areas with low-quality tobacco we will have to try to find alternatives so that the farmers living in these areas can also earn their income from products other than tobacco."
"In conclusion, we would like to point to the need to continue the informational campaigns about the dangers of smoking and the like."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, listening to my colleague from the Socialist Group, Mr Wynn, I have to tell you that I too am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament and, naturally, not all the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control share the views that were expressed by Mr Wynn."
"Mr Wynn belongs to a group of colleagues within the Committee on Budgetary Control and, whenever the debate turns to matters of European agriculture in general and the products of the south of the European Union in particular, something happens to them and they start to say ""no' to everything, as, for example, our very dear Commissioner today."
"In your twenty-five minute speech, Commissioner, although you started off by saying that you would give very serious consideration to the recommendations of the European Parliament, when you referred to the amendments, I counted that you rejected 90 % of the European Parliament amendments."
"I ask you this: is that what you meant when you said that you would give very serious consideration to the recommendations of the European Parliament?"
"I wonder whether, if you had rejected them all, that would have been a mark of respect or derision for the European Parliament."
"You also said that you yourself are not against the complete abolition of tobacco production."
"You do not wish to throw thousands of European farmers on the dole."
"You say you are for improvement in tobacco quality, but with all these ""nos' you are not moving towards improvement in quality."
"Secondly, could you tell us whether the tobacco that is imported into Europe is of better quality than the tobacco that is produced in Europe?"
"Have you, the Commission, checked this?"
"And to what extent is it better quality?"
"Thirdly and most importantly, I am a doctor and I know very well whether tobacco is harmful or not."
"But what I have not heard from the Commission today is how much money you will give to teach our children in school that they must not smoke."
"I have not heard you say that, Commissioner."
"Mr President, firstly with regard to tobacco: the campaign against tobacco is a sham, a fraud."
"If the Community really wanted to reduce or to put an end to smoking, it should not implement an anti-smoking policy but should, within the context of an anti-smoking policy, reduce and even ban tobacco imports."
"It should take measures against the tobacco industry, which produces the final product, cigarettes."
"It does not do this and that is why it is a sham."
"Secondly, with regard to the prices package: it is the same as it was before and is getting worse and it will have worse consequences."
"The previous regime brought about a significant reduction in real average prices for the producer and a corresponding reduction in his income."
"Are those measures for the benefit of producers?"
"And where is your concern about quality, Commissioner?"
"You rejected an amendment which said ""special subsidies for special varieties of tobacco of special quality' ."
"Why are you rejecting it?"
"Are you concerned about quality or are you not?"
"As a result, your model, in essence, Commissioner, is the large agricultural enterprise. You are hitting small and medium-sized producers, you are hitting especially those in the south and the products of the Mediterranean region to which my country belongs."
"Tobacco growing has been reduced by 30 % and along with it the number of those employed has fallen by 33 %."
"Where will these people go?"
"What will they do? Neither you nor national governments tell them."
"Mr President, I will limit myself to only a few basic comments."
"Commissioner, in the case of prices - whether we fix them now in this prices package or reduce them drastically in Agenda 2000 - the problem remains that an intervention system still exists."
"Already, prices are insufficient for 80 % of small and medium-sized farms."
"However, it is also a fact that the fixing of intervention prices and the intervention system itself create surpluses in these areas and that the prices - in any case long-term - never rise above the intervention system."
"This leads to a situation where most farms cannot live with these prices."
"As a result, it is a matter of readjusting the market so that farms can obtain higher prices on the market."
"I hope that this is given greater emphasis in Agenda 2000."
"I would like to make a point regarding hemp: Commissioner, please give your support to European money being spent on hemp!"
"Then you will not need to reduce the 25 % because we will then have a huge market."
"In addition, the money rustles so nicely and we would have reasonable ongoing support for a very interesting product."
"With regard to tobacco, it is my view that the true scandal lies not in the fact that we are promoting a product which endangers our health, but in the fact that, although only a low level of our production is destined for the world market - premiums are also a form of indirect support - billions are spent here to put pressure on the price in the world market overall."
"Thus, we are in fact supporting the tobacco industry."
"We should see that our tobacco is also being sold here in Europe and that the industry is accepting it."
"Here, too, we need a positive strategy - not so much a strategy of prevention."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his very good report."
"Since the reform of agriculture a number of years ago, to a large extent the price review process we go through has become an unreal exercise and does not recognize the problems that face farmers on the ground."
"This exercise is largely irrelevant and will not solve the many difficult problems that face the industry."
"The agriculture industry, certainly in my own part of the United Kingdom in particular, has never faced as many difficulties as it does at this moment in time."
"In the past one sector could perhaps have faced difficulty."
"Now we have been racked by BSE in the beef sector and are trying to recover from that."
"If you look at agriculture in the United Kingdom at the moment - the pig industry, the poultry industry, the dairy industry, those producing cereals - all these sectors are facing financial difficulties, with farmers wondering which way to go."
"Young farmers are just not coming into the industry."
"Yes, I know that there has always got to be change; yes, I know that agriculture has to evolve with the times."
"Farmers will evolve, but they have to be given the chance to do so."
"As things stand at the moment they do not have that chance."
"And I have to say to the Minister responsible, who is here in his capacity as President-in-Office, that he cannot stand back and idly watch the agriculture industry disappear and take the hammering it has been taking because of the strong pound and issues over which the farmer has no control. That is a great difficulty."
"Mr President, I want to concentrate on the Commission proposals for raw tobacco and welcome those sections concerning diversification and withdrawal of quotas as growers move out of this sector."
"My reservation is that the Commission, whilst encouraging growing for the market rather than for subsidies, does not propose the final logical step, namely the complete phasing-out of tobacco subsidies."
"I have tabled amendments accordingly."
"Interestingly, yesterday's Süddeutsche Zeitung carried an article about proposals for the abolition of tobacco subsidies in the United States."
"The EU should be doing the same."
"Subsidizing production of food and useful non-food agricultural products is justifiable. Subsidizing - to the tune of ECU 1 billion a year of taxpayers' money - the growing of tobacco, which kills 500, 000 of its consumers every year, usually after years of ill-health, is completely indefensible."
"The Commission has partly conceded this case with its proposals to buy back quota, give support to producers to change to other crops and other activities and its encouragement of production of tobacco types which can command a reasonable market price."
"Currently much of Community production is either destroyed or offloaded on poor countries at below production cost, to add to their health problems."
"The Commission should take the logical next step, moving toward a situation where tobacco competes in the market with no subsidy, if it is grown at all."
"Rich countries like Germany, France, Belgium and Austria cannot possibly claim they are financially dependent on such subsidies."
"Those Mediterranean countries where real hardship would be caused must be given ongoing support to enable growers to diversify and assist local and national government to establish alternative job opportunities in the regions currently heavily dependent on tobacco."
"With political will this could be achieved over the next ten years - I offer two years more than the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"By the year 2008 we could do away with the scandal of spending ECU 1 billion of EU taxpayers' money annually supporting a crop which kills our citizens."
"I urge support for the amendment setting out this programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the advantages of speaking when most people have already done so is that practically everything has already been said, which means you can add the odd finishing touch to aspects you want to emphasize."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr des Places and Mr Rosado Fernandes, on the effort they have put in, and on their clear and positive approach to their subjects."
"I also want to congratulate the Commissioner on his rational proposals regarding prices, tobacco, adapting to the euro and efforts in the area of controls."
"I think this is important, and I would be grateful if the Commissioner would take note of what I am saying at the moment, because it seems he is busy with other things."
"Compulsory contracts have been proposed for hemp, and I agree with the Commissioner."
"I also agree with premiums to cattle, with the increase of 7.7 % and 7.5 % for Spain and Portugal respectively, which is quite right, since it was approved back in 1996."
"It is a bit late, but at least it has arrived."
"On the tobacco question, having listened to the honourable Members, this is opening up the debate again between the people who are wrongly labelled as environmentalists or agri-environmentalists."
"But what really worries me, and what I would like to stress to the Commissioner, is that Commissioner Flynn said in this House not long ago, during the last part-session, that he would spare no effort until subsidies to tobacco producers had been suspended."
"It really worries me, Commissioner, that a Commissioner said that on behalf of the European Commission."
"I do not know if it was said in a personal capacity, but he cannot say that, or at least it is not acceptable for him to say that in this House on behalf of the European Commission, when the subsidies to European tobacco producers are legal and provided for by the rules of the European Union, as part of the aid given to EU farmers."
"So, Commissioner Flynn should be reminded of his obligation to put things right on that score."
"If we want to create jobs at the moment, here we have 400 000 jobs and 130 000 direct producers."
"So notwithstanding any comments we may be able to make about improving quality, agri-environmental measures and so on, if we want to improve this crop we cannot be directly opposed to it, when it represents only 5 % of EU tobacco consumption."
"Mr President, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Commissioner, I congratulate Mr des Places on a clear report that depicts excellently the effects of the EU's agricultural pricing and aid policy on farmers' income."
"The Commission's pricing package proposal will cut farmers' compensatory prices and aid by 2 %."
"The introduction of the euro at the beginning of next year will bring with it a further 2 % cut for agriculture."
"Last year income from agriculture fell by 3.1 %."
"I agree with the rapporteur's insistence on maintaining a pricing package to be made yearly under the terms of Agenda 2000."
"It must not be taken away under any pretext."
"By means of this package we can moderate the losses to farmers in aid and compensatory payments stemming from changes in currency values or other factors."
"As we do not yet know how strong the euro will be, there must be systems for reducing the damage it may do."
"The rapporteur proposes keeping pricing and compensatory payments in line with inflation."
"I support this proposal."
"EU agricultural policy presents a sad picture form the point of view of the farmer."
"Income from agriculture has declined continuously, and it is still falling with the reforms in the Agenda programme."
"How much longer will the farming community tolerate the immense inequalities among population groups which the CAP is increasingly leading to?"
"While other people are getting income increases, the farmers are losing money."
"There are elements of a serious crisis in this policy, and I cannot therefore support it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief. We must support the report by Mr Rosado Fernandes, and in particular, the 28 amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"As I have said many times before in this Chamber, the European Union is a net importer of nearly 70 % of the tobacco it consumes."
"That is why we support the principle of production subsidies. May I remind you that tobacco-producing areas are mainly situated in less-favoured regions, and tobacco growing is extremely labour-intensive."
"However, our group has tabled five amendments, as we are opposed to the principles of the cultivation contract auction scheme tying the producer to the first processor and the creation of a quota buy-back system."
"Mr President, the COM in tobacco must continue and must enable the European Union gradually to become self-sufficient."
"Tobacco consumption must regularly decrease and production must continue to be limited to a constant tonnage of 351 000 gross tonnes of European tobacco, between the proposed new COM and the present COM."
"Mr President, the COM in tobacco should be treated using the same general criteria as govern the rest of CAP production. There is no basis for extremism, or different or unfair treatment compared with the other CAP products."
"Also, at a time when the EU's main priority is employment, it would be very inconsistent to fail to take account of a crop like this, which is very labour intensive and provides jobs for women."
"We cannot on the one hand state that we are giving priority to jobs and then, when it comes to making concrete policies, ignore that principle."
"So I think it would be a very good thing if all the proposals relating to this COM had to take account of the impact on jobs."
"This reform has to favour young farmers in the most depressed areas of the EU."
"I agree that we have to be able to reconcile protection of public health and the environment, but we also have to reconcile the social burden and the social consequences of this product."
"Commissioner, we must also improve the management of the research fund, because it has been doing very badly so far."
"Reduced tobacco production in Europe does not result in less consumption, by any means."
"The result is simply that the European Union will have to buy this product abroad."
"I also think it is right to make the reform more flexible and progressive, to the benefit of the producers. And I think it is good to be bold when it comes to investigating new uses and varieties of tobacco."
"Guarantees of work and income have to take account of the producers. We must prevent their income from falling, otherwise we would be forcing them - not giving them the choice, Commissioner - to abandon the sector."
"I also think it is right that quality should not just be interpreted on the basis of commercial prices."
"Mr President, I agree with the persons who have said that this procedure is now a bit meaningless."
"In the MacSharry reform we were offered maintenance of incomes from agriculture and, at the same time, stabilization of the rural population."
"As we can see today this has not materialized."
"In this decade we have already lost 25 % of people engaged in agriculture and incomes have dropped by around 20 %."
"Therefore any improvement in the position of individual farmers has come at the expense of employment in the sector."
"The situation in Ireland is even worse because of our high dependence on beef and sheep meat."
"As Jim Nicholson stated, the situation is exaggerated in Northern Ireland and the UK because of the strength of sterling and there is a new and very obvious reluctance by young people to embark on agriculture as a career."
"This procedure is fairly meaningless because, taking into consideration the budget constraints together with the GATT decisions, we have very little capacity to influence the price that farmers can obtain for their produce."
"This annual procedure should be looking at the state of the agriculture industry, its long-term viability, recognizing that our share in world production is becoming ever reduced."
"While the market is becoming bigger, Agenda 2000 does not give us any more of a strategy than we had in the MacSharry reform to exploit these expanding markets and maintain the long-term viability of European agriculture."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal concerning the tobacco market is governed by the idea of quota buy-back and, naturally, there are no proposals for improving quality, as Mr Fischler has said."
"Moreover, that is why he has rejected all our amendments which make provision for and promote improvement in the quality of European tobacco."
"The logic of wiping out tobacco growing in less favoured regions will have enormously negative economic, social and political consequences in those regions."
"Mr Fischler, you know as well as I do and as well as all of us here, that in those regions it is not possible to grow alternative crops."
"That is why, traditionally, inhabitants have been cultivating tobacco there for hundreds of years."
"There is the argument that tobacco is associated with damage to health."
"Indeed, but we still do not know just to what extent smoking plays a part in health issues and, secondly, there are other products that can cause health problems, such as dairy products."
"I have not heard you put an end to the buying of dairy products because they raise cholesterol levels."
"Do you know how many heart attacks are due to dairy products?"
"Above all we must understand that even if we put a stop to European tobacco production, smoking will continue in Europe."
"And I believe that behind this anti-smoking campaign is hidden the attempt of large companies to import cheap tobacco which is of lower quality than European tobacco."
"I would like to say to you that the latest statistics from the United States show that the way in which the campaign is being conducted - this American hysteria which has now inundated Europe -, instead of reducing smoking, is increasing smoking among young people."
"Let us not create conditions like the prohibition in America."
"Let us remain Europeans, in other words let us act in moderation."
"I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fernandes, because I believe that his report is along the right lines."
"Mr President, overall I agree with the direction given by the two rapporteurs, whom I thank for the job that they did, and would like to make two brief comments on the two reports - one on wine and the other on tobacco."
"As far as wine is concerned, and specifically regarding the amendments that have been presented - which Commissioner Fischler says will be difficult to accept because tomorrow there will be the organic reform of the wine sector - I would just like to stress the importance of the problem."
"In the prices package these past two years, I myself presented a proposal aimed to renew the regulation on replanting and grubbing up."
"Generally speaking, a certain balance has been found on the market; now it is time to fine-tune the mechanism."
"In my view, management has to be regionalized in such a way that this market balance is found in all the major producing areas."
"On tobacco I only want to say one thing: since I have seen that there are amendments - probably based on good intentions - aimed to cope even with any restructuring and reconversion of production, let us try not to be demagogic in our statements."
"There are areas that earn a living by growing tobacco."
"Myself, for example, I live in an area, lower Veneto, where people earn their living growing tobacco, and this is the case also of the region of Venezia and the province of Verona."
"So, before we start talking about restructuring, let us see what the alternatives are, otherwise we will be acting like demagogues."
"Mr President, I must say I find the results of Mr Rosado Fernandes' work on this report rather disappointing."
"Instead of a progressive report innovatively probing how to improve the reform of the tobacco sector, what we have is a report reflecting old-fashioned thinking, proposing massive support for tobacco cultivation and sustaining farmers in utterly untenable production."
"As if that were not bad enough, the rapporteur also strongly emphasizes the need to support young farmers to enable them to take over production."
"That is simply laying the groundwork for bringing a whole new generation into the trade so that for many years to come, the EU can continue producing poor-quality tobacco that can only be peddled with the backing of hefty EU subsidies."
"I searched the report in vain for any support of the Commission's excellent initiative of buying up quotas from farmers wishing to leave the sector."
"I searched in vain for new thinking on how to support and educate farmers in these vulnerable areas in how to switch production to non-hazardous products."
"Further, I find it most regrettable that the rapporteur did not wish to give more financial support to the research fund."
"How else is the research fund supposed to function effectively?"
"Or is it being muzzled intentionally?"
"Mr President, I must say I am most disappointed with this report."
"Mr President, this is the third proposed modification to the COM in raw tobacco in a very short time."
"Three reforms in five years are enough to define this situation as an unresolved crisis."
"The measures implemented, especially the subsidies regime, have allowed the maintenance of crops and the survival of the sector, but have not resolved any of the structural problems."
"Europe's tobacco-producing regions are among the least developed in the EU, and no new job opportunities have been found as an alternative to the work provided by tobacco growing."
"The only alternative to growing raw tobacco is unemployment, in regions which are already suffering the highest unemployment levels in the EU."
"In this context, Commissioner, I think your proposal is the best one possible, although it may not tackle some of the basic problems affecting the sector, as is clear from Mr Rosado Fernandes' report."
"Because of all this, Commissioner, we are going to vote in favour of your proposal."
"Mr President, the report on tobacco is an opinion on the Council's proposal for certain changes to the market for raw tobacco."
"These changes are aimed, among other things, at certain quality issues."
"However, the overriding question of the justification of subsidies is not taken up."
"This is quite remarkable considering the debate about the harmful effects of tobacco and the ban on tobacco advertising which Parliament decided on a month ago."
"In fact a majority of Parliament's Members considered the problem to be so great that it justified disregarding the requirements of the EU's system of rules."
"The opinion from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection proposes, among other things, that subsidies from the EU budget for tobacco production within the European Union should end no later than the 2006 harvest."
"This objective has also been expressed in Amendments Nos 37, 55, 65, 66 and 67. These proposals deserve full support."
"There is no doubt that it is irresponsible to spend public money, European taxpayers' money, in order to subsidize the growing of a product which does so much harm."
"After all, tobacco is responsible for the deaths of half a million people in the EU every year."
"The amount of subsidy has been around ECU 1 billion per year, or ECU 7 500 per grower."
"This casts a dark shadow over all other support systems in the EU, a shadow which could be lifted by a decision on abolition - an abolition which must of course take place in a socially acceptable way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I agree with the proposal for greater integration between production and processing in farm prices in the case of the hemp sector."
"In the case of tobacco, I would like to point out the difference in style between Commissioner Fischler and Commissioner Flynn."
"Commissioner Flynn definitely had less style in this House when he became very agitated, even gesticulating - it was not very clear what he wanted to emphasize -, and was extremely wrong in his opposition to the reform of tobacco."
"I do not believe it befitting for a Commissioner to behave in this way when the decision has been made by all the Members of the Commission."
"As for tobacco, a lot has already been said on quality and employment."
"I would like to raise a few points."
"I believe that it is important, Commissioner, that the Commission prepare a specific communication for the Parliament regarding the annual 5 % quota set for research."
"We consider it important that the Parliament be informed how the research fund is being used: that means having not only the figures but also an analytical presentation of the results of this fund."
"I agree with the idea of modulating the premium and consider it a useful proposal."
"It seems to me that the modulation of the premium should be linked to employment, quality, but I would like more information about environmental constraints."
"I consider it a good idea, for example, to increase aid to associations from 2 % to 5 %. They could use it especially to improve quality and particularly to develop environmental themes which are very, very important in this production."
"I believe that modulation should also take into account new production techniques, but not to the detriment of the important obligation of keeping people employed, given that if the European Union spends so much on tobacco, it does so especially because it has a major obligation to maintain jobs in the many regions that have very serious problems of employment."
"I am referring to the Mediterranean regions and also to some of the regions in Italy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to justify the position of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the reform of the raw tobacco sector described in the Rosado Fernandes report."
"Our committee thinks the proposed reform presented by the Commission is acceptable, although we want to introduce a series of amendments, mainly aimed at strengthening Parliament's role in the reform procedure for this sector."
"We think the right way to achieve that stronger role is through a procedural change, from Article 23 to Article 43(2) of the Treaty."
"This question of comitology, which the Commissioner has said he will not support, would guarantee that the Commission had to listen to and take account of the political positions defended by this Parliament in all aspects of this reform, particularly regarding the maintenance of a quality Community tobacco production."
"We also regret that the Commissioner does not want to accept this procedural change in other reforms either."
"In any case, we think the position adopted by ourselves and the rapporteur, Mr Rosado Fernandes, is rather more realistic and appropriate to the general problem of Community production than the position expressed, for example, by the draftsman of opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"In any case, the road to reform is open."
"I think we should involve the European Parliament in the defence of farmers and tobacco producers."
"Mr President, Parliament has made a decision to ban tobacco advertising."
"We have also made a decision to ban indirect tobacco advertising."
"We give support to campaigns to encourage people to give up smoking."
"We also give support to research to combat the harmful effects of tobacco on health."
"However, the biggest support we give is to the growing of tobacco, a crop which claims hundreds of thousands of lives every year in the Union."
"Throughout the world, many more people die from tobacco than from Aids."
"That does not make sense."
"I know I speak on behalf of all Swedish Members and with the agreement of all the Swedish people when I say that this policy must come to an end."
"The subsidies cannot be justified on the grounds of employment or on the grounds that someone else would have produced the tobacco."
"By the same logic we could just as easily subsidize the production of nuclear weapons, or of biological and chemical weapons."
"The fundamental issue is not an economic, but a moral one."
"The Union's citizens do not want to finance the growing of this harmful crop."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00 noon."
"Agenda 2000: Economic and social cohesion"
"The next item is the report (A4-0219/98) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the reform of the common agricultural policy (Agenda 2000 - Part One, Chapter III) (COM(97)2000 - C4-0522/97)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the object of this report is to provide the European Parliament with a set of general principles which can be used as a reference framework for the sectorial reports to be approved later on."
"In that respect, as rapporteur I should like to underline a few fundamental points:"
"Firstly, the real world of European agriculture is not limited to the small number of farmers who can export without receiving refunds."
"We must be more careful over price reductions and continue our interventions regarding beef and olive oil, notwithstanding the Commission's proposals."
"Secondly, the reform of the CAP cannot be limited to reducing guaranteed prices and offsetting them against productivitylinked direct aid."
"The Commission's proposals must be amended in that respect, because they represent a fundamental analytical error."
"That error consists of starting from the principle that all farmers are on an equal footing in the face of the external threats arising from the GATT, which is not the true situation."
"Now we all know that the less specialized, more peripheral, more extensive, less productive agricultural systems, and in general those in the less favoured mountain, arid or Arctic areas, start at a major disadvantage and will be the first victims of the globalization of agricultural markets if the CAP does not grant them the minimal response they need to survive."
"Thirdly, this justifies our reinforcing our horizontal measures and the aid we base on territorial areas, the environment, forests, the diversification of the productive fabric of the most highly-dependent agricultural regions, animal and vegetable health, and aid related to employment and the less favoured areas."
"Now, the proposal on rural development is clear enough but it should nevertheless ensure the achievement of that object and it is, in fact, a long way from doing so, in view of the sparseness of the financial resources provided."
"The Commission quite rightly calls that rural development policy a 'second pillar' ."
"But we shall not have a pillar if we keep quiet; it will be no more than a stem or a cane, unless the Commission substantially alters this aid scheme."
"Fourthly, I think the Commission's proposal for the direct financing of the rural development policy is the right one, because this will make it possible to improve the internal consistency of the CAP and prevent double standards and different responses to different kinds of farmers."
"For that reason direct financing should also apply to rural development in the regions mentioned in Objective 1."
"Fifthly, although the question of extension is not in dispute, we must realize that farmers have real fears and apprehensions, in view of the enormous number of reforms and changes they have gone through and the wide present and future implications of GATT."
"For that reason, and also for the sake of clarity and openness, I think finance for all pre-accession measures, whether agricultural or not, should appear under a separate heading, distinct from all our common policies, and should only be integrated as each country becomes integrated."
"Sixthly, although every productive sector of agriculture has its own peculiar characteristics, the fact that direct production aid only goes to those sectors which enjoyed high levels of protection in the past is causing more and more problems for social and political cohesion."
"The truth is that some cultures, such as Mediterranean culture, for example, have never been protected by the price system in the past and are therefore not getting the benefit of income assistance now."
"In the long term this is an untenable situation which will force the European Union to think about systems based on other factors than just set-off for price reductions in the future."
"If this is not put right we shall in future be creating a kind of agricultural apartheid with some cultures entitled to direct aid and others excluded from it."
"Seventhly, it is becoming a fundamental requirement that, in the spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty, the CAP should contribute to the economic and social cohesion of the European Union by creating a basic balance between forms of production, territories and farmers, as indeed has been declared by the Ministers of Agriculture and at the December summit itself."
"Finally, and as my eighth point, it is important to emphasize that the Commission must take the coming negotiations on the future of the GATT very seriously."
"It has now been proved that Europe is in a unique situation based on multi-functional agriculture and the family-sized nature of its operations."
"Its average farm size of 18 hectares is not in the same league as that of its competitors in the world markets, whose average size runs into hundreds of hectares."
"We must not compare two things that are totally disparate, nor must we fall into the trap of following other people's interests."
"Apart from that, the rules of fair trading must cover such important matters as consumer sensitivity, environment-friendly practices and respect for human rights and basic freedoms."
"Finally, I would encourage the Commission to take into consideration these guiding principles which I have suggested and which I hope Parliament will approve."
"If it does, we shall at last have a balanced common agricultural policy that is capable of treating farmers fairly in the future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, CAP reform is a key element of Agenda 2000."
"On that subject, may I underline at the outset the essential need to build an open, constructive dialogue between the Council and Parliament on these issues."
"Such a dialogue, taking place within the requirements of the Treaties, can only benefit everyone involved."
"It can only help the common good."
"It will allow each institution to collaborate with the other so as encourage both to play their part fully in the decisions."
"On CAP reform, the Agriculture Council has already made a successful start, with the Commission's proposals having been put to a special Agriculture Council on 31 March."
"The Council has acknowledged the need for reform in order to establish a clear direction for the development of European agriculture."
"We need this not least in order to take on board the forthcoming enlargement of the Union."
"There are also the challenges posed to us by the forthcoming World Trade Organization negotiations."
"Let me be quite clear about this."
"We have no alternative but to plan ahead now to meet these challenges which we know will face us."
"We have already begun this important process."
"The Council has identified several key issues which will need to be addressed in the next phase of the negotiations on the Commission's proposals."
"These include the need for and appropriate extent of cuts in support prices and the timescale over which any such cuts should be achieved, the appropriate nature of compensation for such cuts, the conditions under which Member States may exercise discretion with regard to agricultural support, the future role of production constraints such as milk quotas in a reformed CAP and the appropriate balance of support between production sectors, producers and regions within the Union."
"Finally, there is the question of development of the rural economy and protection of the rural environment including multifunctional agriculture."
"As well as addressing the need to reform individual commodities, the Council has welcomed the Commission's proposals to address the wider problems experienced in rural areas throughout the Union."
"Agriculture is, indeed, an important part of rural Europe but it is only one part and we need to look at what can be done on a European level for rural communities and areas as a whole."
"The Council has, therefore, established a clear framework for the next phase of the negotiations on the Commission proposals."
"These key issues are currently being put to Heads of Government in Cardiff as we meet to discuss them here in Parliament."
"Detailed work will continue in the remaining weeks of the UK presidency and then continue under the presidency of our Austrian colleagues."
"The key to success will be to balance effectively the interests of the Union's consumers and producers and the needs of the environment in promoting a sustainable versatile structure for European agriculture."
"That structure needs to be robust enough to meet the challenges I have illustrated and to compete effectively on the world stage."
"Madam President, I should like to state straight away that, in general terms, the Committee on Budgets agrees with the report presented by Mr Cunha."
"Obviously, we would have preferred our amendments to have been definitely accepted but, in fact, there are not too many contradictions."
"Indeed, I think there is more agreement than anything else."
"However, as far as the Committee on Budgets is concerned, there is a basic question mark over all Mr Cunha's proposals: is there money or not?"
"Paragraph 36 asks for increased funding and, frankly, in the Committee on Budgets we have to say we think that request is premature. And when I say premature, I mean what I say."
"That is why we asked at the time, in the December resolution, that a clause about the revision of the financial perspectives be included, in order to deal with this additional need should it arise."
"We believe, as Mr Cunha rightly said, that the main aim of the CAP reform - or CARP, including rural policy - is not to make savings, but to improve the policy."
"The fact is that since 1988 there has always been a systematic saving - between the ceiling of the first category and the agricultural budget - of the order of ECU 1000 million to ECU 1500 million per annum."
"Furthermore, the budget has always exceeded the implemented spending."
"That is why we are cautious."
"But I can assure you, were we to see problems approaching, we would support the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in seeking to obtain that extra funding."
"In paragraph 57, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development considers that enlargement costs should remain outside the guideline but, in our opinion, that contradicts what we said in December: that the agricultural costs of preaccession and enlargement should be covered by the guideline."
"In that way, we think EAGGF and the agricultural policy should really form a fund which is part of cohesion policy and not, as people have started saying, an anti-structural fund."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wonder whether there is any point in having draftsmen of the Committees' opinions, if the Council speaks before hearing them."
"I shall however report to you on the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy."
"The reform of the common agricultural policy which is proposed in Agenda 2000 raises a large number of questions and some concerns."
"There is a fear that rural regions will suffer under this reform."
"There is more at stake than just agriculture, important though it is."
"The challenge is to achieve a balanced development of the countryside, which manages to avoid large-scale emigration from rural areas, and all its attendant problems: depopulation of whole regions and the growth of already overpopulated conurbations, which are more and more insatiable where Community funds are concerned."
"However, the importance of rural development for balanced management of the countryside and the preservation of both the natural and cultural heritage and the specific characteristics of the fisheries sector and the financing needs of the Common Fisheries Policy require the creation of an independent sub-objective specifically dedicated to 'rural areas' and 'maritime and coastal areas', within the new Objective 2."
"The fact that the new EAGGF regulation brings together all the measures for the development of rural areas is useful, provided that the EAGGF continues to finance only actions directly connected with agriculture, together with coastal and maritime areas, which must not be forgotten."
"It is also necessary for the Commission to put forward firm proposals to link agriculture with its local region: local products, labelling, etcetera."
"Our ambition should be to enable the harmonious development of agriculture and craft industries, and to promote complementary activities such as rural tourism and direct sales of produce."
"We can thereby provide ourselves with the means to bring the countryside, which is threatened with depopulation, back to life, and to maintain a dynamic rural environment throughout the fifteen Member States of the Union, in accordance with the intention expressed at the recent Luxembourg Summit."
"This means that we must continue the actions undertaken under the current Objective 5a, in order to encourage young farmers and fishermen to invest and to set up, and also to facilitate the processing and marketing of agricultural and forestry products, and to facilitate the development of mountain regions."
"These are some of the concerns expressed by the Committee on Regional Policy, which Mr Cunha and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development were kind enough to incorporate into the body of the report."
"I should therefore like to thank them."
"Thank you, Mr Pinel."
"You are asking about the point of the debate. If the Presidency of the Council..."
"Are you listening?"
"You are not listening!"
"Then I do not really need to say it, but I wanted to point out that the Commission, Mr Pinel, will speak at the end of the debate."
"Madam President, the Committee on Fisheries unanimously adopted the conclusions I proposed in the opinion intended for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The latter also confirmed these conclusions."
"However, on behalf of my group, I have tabled two amendments which revise the conclusions of the opinion on the basis of the Commission's latest proposals."
"A horizontal regulation specific to the fisheries and aquaculture sector incorporating all the measures of the former Objective 5a seems indispensable, as in the case of the proposals relating to rural development."
"What is the point of the Common Fisheries Policy if it is no longer applicable throughout all the Member States, and does not include the areas which are not eligible under the new Objectives 1 and 2?"
"If we implemented the Commission's present proposals, the CFP would amount to no more than a number of technical constraints upon our fishermen and a policy of destruction of fishing vessels."
"This would mean moving in the direction of those who see the CFP as a transitional system, a mere prelude to the complete liberalization of the sector, whereas the aim and the justification of the CFP was to support the fishing industry in all the Member States with coastal areas."
"The Committee on Fisheries therefore asks the Commission urgently to propose a horizontal regulation for fisheries which, like rural development, should be financed by the EAGGF and entered in the budget under the agriculture guideline."
"The fisheries sector requires a limited volume of credits, but they are of great importance, whether they are required in coastal or maritime areas, which are vulnerable, or in rural areas engaged in mainland aquaculture."
"We were all deeply shocked by the total absence of the word ""fisheries' in the initial version of the Commission's communication Agenda 2000, as if the European Union had no coastline."
"Realizing its mistake, the Commission presented to us a draft incorporating the coastal and maritime areas in the new Objective 2."
"This is a step in the right direction. It is nevertheless inadequate because all the fishermen in the European Union operate within common areas, and it would be particularly inappropriate if the rates of aid implementing the Common Fisheries Policy were to vary from 0 to 75 % depending on the home port of each vessel."
"Madam President, I would like to acknowledge the fine work that Mr Cunha did and say how useful it is for the next stages."
"However, greater conviction could have perhaps gone into seeking a clearer and more effective compromise, because this resolution has too many points."
"This also recalls the need to have stricter rules in Parliament's work so that we do not always end up with interminable documents in which a few good things of substance get lost in a sea of repetition and obviousness."
"I cannot see how this gives us a better picture."
"If the aim of this own-initiative report is to condition relations on the sectoral aspects of Agenda 2000, its success will not, however, depend only on the excellent rapporteur, Mr Cunha, but I believe to a great extent on our future work."
"We will therefore have to see whether all together we can use this text as a starting point and advance with a coherent plan to reform the CAP."
"The first signs of discussion in the Council of Ministers, Mr Cunningham, do not augur well."
"At a time when all talk is about the World Cup, we are still passing the ball back and forth and not scoring any goals."
"There is agreement on the laudable definitions, like the European agriculture model, multifunctionality, competitiveness, rural development, but as soon as the focus shifts from statements in principle to concrete facts major differences emerge and everything is engulfed in the sea of special interests, with the risk of seeing a very long shopping list."
"We Socialists see two risks."
"The first is that the entire debate will be conditioned by the price guarantees of market policy and by their exclusive nature."
"In this case, rural policy would still remain the weak pillar of the common agricultural policy, despite the Cork Conference and the commitment of the Commissioners."
"Instead, as we stated at a conference in November, structural policy must increasingly become the key policy in agriculture, with emphasis on investments in various sectors, quality and the regions."
"If the market is to grow in importance and traditional protections are to decrease in importance, the real market policy sustainable in the future is structural and rural policy."
"The second risk is that all the problems with the horizontal regulation of the CAP - modulation, the definition of a maximum amount, cross compliance - will end up being a lost opportunity."
"At a time when subsidiarity is all the rage, we believe that it is a mistake to confer total responsibility for such important matters on the Member States, a choice that some would think too courageous but that in reality shows, I think, the little courage on the part of the Commission to take on decisions at European level that are in keeping with what has been said repeatedly and what public opinion is calling for, a public opinion increasingly attentive to what is happening inside the black box of the common agricultural policy."
"Madam President, I have only two comments on the Cunha report."
"Firstly, it is a good report."
"Why?"
"Because Mr Cunha has succeeded in achieving a sensible, mutually beneficial co-existence between current position papers by the parliamentary groups and future reports on the production sectors within the framework of Agenda 2000."
"Furthermore, the rapporteur has kept to the recommendation by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development not to go into detail in his report, which did not, however, prevent him from - rightly - making the opinion of the Committee quite clear on the focal points of the future Agenda 2000."
"Secondly, the protagonist in the Agenda 2000 discussion is price reductions in exchange for more or less sufficient compensation, Commissioner."
"We can debate it as we wish but there has to be some guarantee that farmers do not derive their incomes solely or substantially from compensation but that they can participate in the market more than before."
"This is exactly the point that affects our voters, the people who put us in this House and who, not being farmers, increasingly fail to understand this system of financing."
"But have our voters ever asked why production price reductions - undertaken, for example, in the MacSharry reform in 1992 - never filtered through to the consumer?"
"What will be the effect of the future Fischler reform, to give another name to the agriculture part of the Agenda?"
"Commissioner, will bread prices fall?"
"Cereal prices are to be reduced by 20 %, after all."
"Will beer become cheaper?"
"A delight to all aficionados of this drink, as the percentage of cereal in this lovely product is by no means insignificant, and the price of cereals is being reduced!"
"Will meat become cheaper, given the planned 30 % price reduction?"
"What about the price of butter?"
"Last but not least, the price of compound feedingstuff in animal feeds should become cheaper."
"Will we be able to expect this?"
"If this were the case, our voters, who are not only concerned with agriculture, would certainly have greater understanding for European agriculture."
"But they will have to be able to see it in their wallets when they go shopping."
"Then European agriculture would be a great deal more credible!"
"Madam President, firstly, I would like to offer my congratulations to Mr Cunha, who has worked with a great deal of enthusiasm on this report. To use a Dutch idiom: we had the impression that you 'felt like a fish in water'."
"The Commission is putting three arguments forward for the Agenda 2000 proposals."
"Firstly, if we do nothing we will have overproduction once more."
"Secondly, we must prepare for the coming WTO negotiations."
"Thirdly, we must prepare for the accession of the central and eastern European countries."
"As far as I am concerned, and as far as my group is concerned, we think the third point is by far the most convincing."
"Maintaining peace and security in Europe is worth paying for, and the agricultural sector will also have to pay for this, just like other sectors in the European economies."
"My group therefore supports the Agenda 2000 proposals in principle."
"The prices in Eastern and Western Europe should gradually start to converge, and this means that in our part of Europe the prices will have to fall."
"We believe that compensation should be awarded for this price reduction. In contrast to the Cunha report, we believe this compensation should also apply to specific products, such as milk."
"In addition, and this concerns a different policy, an active rural policy will have to be pursued."
"I believe this policy is not controversial, and we also support it."
"There is another aspect besides compensation for price reduction. In our opinion, the development of new markets is decidedly missing."
"Much more could be done about the quality of agricultural products."
"How can consumers easily recognize this quality?"
"I hope to make concrete proposals to Parliament about this later in the year."
"Another omission from the Agenda 2000 proposals concerns proposals in the sphere of agrification."
"This can only be effective if the Commission pursues an effective policy by making the use of certain products compulsory."
"This does not concern subsidies or excessive subsidies, but simply saying that a certain product originates from agriculture, that it is good for the environment, and that is why we should be required to use it in a major way."
"This can be an effective new market for agricultural products."
"I should like to recommend this."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Arlindo Cunha on his excellent work, resulting from his experience as the Portuguese Minister of Agriculture and also as the erstwhile President of the Council of Ministers of Agriculture, at the time of the MacSharry reforms."
"We are obviously at the stage where, after its initial pride in the child it has brought up, called the CAP, the European Union has become ashamed of that child and now treats it as though it were illegitimate."
"The truth is that attacks on it in the world market, by American criticism, by Fortress Europe, by the Keynes group and by all the groups whose historical situations are very different from ours, including the United Kingdom itself, have naturally made Europe ashamed of the CAP it created and which it now considers to be an illegitimate brainchild."
"That is the situation we are in and it is that situation which my honourable friend Mr Cunha is at least trying to improve."
"It attributes importance to young farmers, to territories and territorial differences in fertility and climate throughout Europe, it attributes importance to something no-one has previously thought important; on the other hand, it places great emphasis on the expression 'rural development' , which I would rate less highly, because I know it is almost a utopian vision to aim at rural development based on agriculture."
"Rural development has to be effected in competition with services and industry - that is my experience in Portugal - and I, of course, have never seen agriculture bring about any development in any region whatsoever."
"Let us be honest about that!"
"I also appreciate the fact that Mr Cunha has drawn up the report with one eye on the GATT."
"But I would have liked the Commission at least to have thought a little."
"When the price reductions come, apart from the green box and the blue box, which black box will the redundant farmers of Europe be put in?"
"I would like to know the number."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Cunha for his excellent report."
"This report can be no more than a first approach to the reforms contained within Agenda 2000."
"Nevertheless, it has a very important added value because it has done work that the Commission should have done, given that the job of proposing legislative initiatives wrongly belongs to the Commission."
"Before addressing the principles of Agenda 2000, Mr Cunha's report presents an analysis of the defects of the 1992 CAP reform."
"In attempting to tackle a new CAP reform, we first need to analyse the faults of the earlier one."
"However, the Commission has not done this."
"To my mind, that is one of the great merits of the Cunha report."
"In trying to perform an in-depth study of the principles of the 1992 reform, none of the institutions can allow themselves to ignore its effects, which were negative in many cases."
"We cannot ignore the huge number of farms which have disappeared, or the effects on the social fabric of the rural environment and land use."
"We cannot ignore the enormous destruction of agricultural jobs, especially when our policy formulations make job creation one of the political objectives of the European Union."
"Nor can we ignore the fact that the 1992 reform exacerbated all the imbalances already present in the CAP."
"There has been an increase in the extent to which aid is concentrated on a few farmers. The budget has become even more concentrated on a small number of common organizations of the market, while Mediterranean products receive less funding, and are subject to proposals which entail their virtual dismantling."
"If the Cunha report had gone no further than this, that would still have been quite a lot."
"It gives a political signal that with Agenda 2000 we are playing with fire."
"The European Union must understand that it is on the point of taking a wrong turning."
"If we were to add the collateral structural policy proposals, with the new role for the EAGGF Guarantee section in the rich regions, we would be faced with a loss of geographical concentration and a loss of cohesion in the rural zones."
"So we need to thank Mr Cunha once again for all his efforts, and other institutions need to understand that European construction cannot be carried out by means of abstract formulations or experiments."
"The European Union also needs to demonstrate its true weight in settings such as the World Trade Organization, where its stance has most often been one of passivity and renouncing its own position."
"Madam President, Mr Cunha has presented a very good report."
"My group will support him."
"He has made it clear that in the past this intervention system led to great disparities and injustices among producers, countries and regions, and that it had a destructive effect on jobs and the quality of food."
"As I said before, Mr Fischler, a policy of price reduction within the intervention system leads to farms being excluded, and is fatal for farms and regions which are sensitive in their production and do not belong to the favoured sectors."
"Here we must make a radical change."
"We must move away from the intervention system and instead move towards an integrated development of rural areas, as is intended in the second pillar of Agenda 2000."
"It is essential here that we offer a structural policy on a horizontal basis as in many areas we cannot sustain a policy of price reduction or a departure from the intervention system without regional markets being strengthened."
"This would lead to the destruction of further jobs."
"For this reason, we must be able to compete in terms of quality as a matter of urgency, Mr Fischler, and this should also apply to production in the world market."
"Those who wish to produce for the world market may do so, but they should do so without state aid!"
"This would lead to an increase in prices on the world market, giving many farmers in Third World countries a chance once again to secure their livelihood by producing food for their countries and regions."
"If we continue to dump to the tune of millions, this development will constantly be destroyed and it will result in social and ecological dumping."
"I would like to mention external protection briefly."
"This is, on the whole, confirmed by the parliamentary groups and I hope that the Commission will keep to its plan of also protecting regional development within the EU by protecting against external social and ecological dumping."
"This would also help to stabilize the situation in the world market, which in turn would benefit those countries that are weakest in terms of agricultural production."
"Madam President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that our agricultural sector must be capable of contributing towards the expansion of the world market, whilst preparing for enlargement and the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"We all agree that the distribution of subsidies must be improved, taking into account the multifunctional characteristics of agriculture."
"We applaud the Commission's stated intentions, but tremble at the proposed solutions, based mainly on the so-called inevitable trend to liberalize trade, resulting in a general decrease in prices, and with the development of raw materials on the world market as our only aim."
"The competitiveness of European agriculture must not depend upon a single parameter."
"The quality of products, their processing, their suitability in terms of international demand and dynamic commercial policies, as well as low prices, are capable of increasing our export potential."
"We do not need a smaller budget, we need a better budget."
"We need a redirected budget to support the European agricultural model which Mr Cunha described so well in his report, a model which reconciles the necessary economic aims of agriculture with the requirements of public health, product quality, the environment, land use, rural development and aid to young people."
"That is the model on which the strengthened CAP should be based, without opening the door to its renationalization. Community preference must be incorporated, and we must not forget that we have a production deficit in some product areas, such as oilseed proteins, citrus fruits, fish and wood."
"We should not put the cart before the horse, and we must not give up before we begin."
"We shall be in a much stronger position to negotiate the CAP in the face of the WTO's demands if we reform the CAP beforehand in accordance with our objectives."
"Let us not underestimate what is at stake."
"The CAP reform and Agenda 2000 represent a choice we have to make for society."
"It is we politicians who must take responsibility for this. I should like to thank Mr Cunha for reminding us of this."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on the Commission's communication Agenda 2000, I asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to draft an own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy reform, and I am delighted that the task was entrusted to Mr Cunha."
"Indeed, within the framework of a very limited budget, Agenda 2000 proposes the reform of two of our most important policies: the common agricultural policy and the structural policy."
"At the time, I was struck by the Commission's purely budgetary approach in its proposed reforms of the COM for arable crops, cattle and diary products."
"The specific features of European agriculture were not taken into consideration, and in its determination to get into line with the international agricultural model, the Commission failed to define a true European agriculture model which took into consideration the specific nature of our rural development and land use."
"The report originally submitted to us by Mr Cunha was a good report."
"The many amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture have made it much less coherent, and in places it even has a slight bias towards the sort of ideology which disregards the fact that above all else agriculture is an economic activity."
"To conclude, Madam President, let me give an example: if we want European agriculture to continue, young people must enter agriculture."
"The only real policy which will encourage young people to become farmers is to offer them an economically profitable activity based on an agricultural policy which is visible in the medium term."
"What attitude will the European Commission have when the forthcoming WTO negotiations start in June 1999?"
"A strategy of attack has yet to be defined, and the agricultural policy reform proposed by the Commission does not take that important international deadline into consideration."
"On the contrary, it wants to give farmers partial compensatory aid to compensate for price reductions, in the knowledge that such aid is limited within the current framework of GATT regulations and that our fellow citizens do not understand what it is for."
"Madam President, this morning we discussed olive oil, agricultural prices, tobacco? this afternoon, we will discuss bananas."
"Thanks to Mr Cunha's excellent report, we can respond to this third reform of the CAP proposed by Mr Fischler. We have had Sicco Mansholt's CAP, based on prices and incomes."
"As a result, we have lost 12 million farmers, which makes Sicco Mansholt the Pol Pot of agriculture."
"We have had the 1984-1992 CAP, with stabilisers, quotas, maximum guaranteed quantities? which was a failure."
"Only yesterday evening, we were informed that stocks of cereals had increased to 14 million tonnes."
"And now, we have a third reform, which rather reminds me of ""The Leopard' by the Italian novelist Lampedusa: everything must change in order to stay the same."
"The reasons are the same: in 1992, we had to prepare for GATT, in 1998, we have to prepare for WTO."
"It is estimated that 21 % of the complaints addressed to the WTO are about Europe, and more than one third of the complaints come from the United States."
"The system is also the same: it is still Malthusian and budgetarist."
"It is Malthusian because of its price decreases, set-asides, sale of foods on the international market and savage cuts (of vines, for example), and budgetarist, with its petty accounting and rationing, even more stringent now that we have the magic amount of 1.25 % of GDP to finance both pre-accession and accession."
"In reality, the technical questions raised by Mr Cunha, relating to non-food use, the decoupling of production aid, product quality, ceilings on aid and safety, and so on, mask a real choice between two models, American or European, as Mr des Places, Mrs Barthet-Mayer and many others have said."
"The keyword in the American model is ""intensive' ."
"In the United States, agriculture is a combination of chemistry with the added mystique of genetically modified organisms: nitrates, herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, and now GMMs."
"The keyword in the European model is harmony."
"Harmony between producers and family export businesses. Harmony in production areas, in the south - tobacco, wine, fruits, vegetables, olives - and in the north, resulting in a range of products which gives the consumer harmony in health, thanks to the quality of products, harmony between the mountains and the plains, aesthetic harmony, ecological harmony and mental harmony."
"Minister, harmony in agriculture would mean fewer British hooligans in Marseilles."
"Obviously, the consequences of the American model are well known in comparison with our own: soil destruction, ground water pollution, contamination, mad cow disease and alienation."
"So we must first of all protect the European model, if we wish to defend it against the archaic American model."
"We must use Community preference, the essential heart of Europe, to protect it."
"Without Community preference, there is no Europe."
"We must protect it by keeping prices high, which will help to maintain high income levels."
"We must protect it by improving the quality of our products and by increasing their added value, which justifies high prices and the exportation of our model."
"Exporting our model does not mean aligning ourselves with world prices, by decoupling production aid; it means providing export aid as the United States does within the scope of FAIR legislation, which maintains export credits, particularly for the benefit of the Ukraine, Egypt, Russia or South Africa."
"Finally, Commissioner Fischler, we must defend the European model during international negotiations."
"You are European Commissioner for Agriculture, not Under Secretary of State for Agriculture of the United States."
"Madam President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Cunha on the work he has done and, especially, on the arguments put forward in his report."
"I think his work shows that the Agenda 2000 document is tremendously unbalanced."
"It is very clear and very radical in certain approaches, specifically as regards prices. Nevertheless, it is very unclear as regards additional measures."
"Specifically, it is very radical on price reductions, which are compensated partially rather than fully, as before."
"It is also very radical in giving equal aid to all crops without taking their differences into account, which could mean the end of sunflowers."
"On those subjects, the Commission document is tremendously clear and radical."
"However, in other aspects the proposals do not display the same decisiveness."
"As has already been said, it gives the impression that the only reason for this new reform is the demands of future WTO negotiations."
"But the document says nothing about the future of European agriculture."
"As has also been said several times, we want this agriculture to fill Europe's land and continue to play an environmental and social role."
"There is no mention of the need for the CAP to respond to criteria of economic and social cohesion, or the need to guarantee a balance between crops, farmers and land. To give a negative example, we need only remind ourselves that the budgetary imbalance means that southern crops and continental crops receive different protection."
"In the same sense, what role do we really want the aid to have?"
"From this point of view, the horizontal regulation does not clarify things much."
"As regards rural development, I do not think the approach taken in Agenda 2000 comes anywhere near meeting the hopes raised by the Cork Conference."
"It seems that in the future we shall not be able to count on a real, properly integrated, truly multisectoral, adequately funded rural policy, which is capable of alleviating the problems presented by Agenda 2000's lack of balance."
"Madam President, my colleague Mr Cunha had the task of writing a report concerning a number of horizontal problems in the agricultural proposals of Agenda 2000, and of providing a long-term view of these problems."
"He succeeded in this, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also added important insights on a number of points."
"At the same time, this vision of the European agriculture model offers the framework for future policy on the agricultural integration of Eastern Europe."
"For the citizens in their capacity as consumers and tax payers, it also justifies why such agricultural and rural policy must be pursued."
"But the report is, of course, global."
"It does not analyse, for instance, which measures should qualify for EU funding and which for co-funding."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has yet to work out this horizontal problem together with the Committee on Budgets."
"The report tries to create a balance between competitive agriculture and the necessity to support areas and groups which, because they occupy a more or less permanently disadvantaged position, need a larger income."
"Yet the notion of profitability for farms has perhaps retreated too much into the background."
"If prices are reduced to below the cost price of the most efficient farms, then the compensation for these farms must be in proportion to their productivity."
"Otherwise they will also disappear, and this surely cannot be what the common agricultural policy intends."
"Therefore, the section of the report on dairy policy has been carelessly formulated, and as such is unacceptable."
"On the issue of linking environmental stipulations to direct payments, the report rejects the Commission proposals for national criteria."
"Still, we shall find out that it will never be possible to formulate environmental stipulations at the EU level for all EU regions."
"The reality will force us into the direction of greater subsidiarity."
"Moreover, this offers a better guarantee that EU farmers will not be saddled with more rules and bureaucracy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Cunha has managed to move a number of goal posts, which was much needed."
"He has broadened and deepened the debate, and this is something we should continue, because I believe that otherwise we will not be able to cope with the next WTO negotiations."
"It is my view that at the next WTO negotiations we should not raise the issue of product amounts with linked price support, but rather issues such as food quality, environmental demands and social criteria."
"I am therefore pleased with Mr Cunha's proposals that we should ultimately aim for decoupling production aid."
"In this context I would like draw the Commissioner's attention, although you are undoubtedly familiar with it, to the Buckwell report, which contains a number of interesting proposals for switching over to decoupled aid."
"Perhaps the report requires a little more attention from the Directorate-General of Agriculture than it has been given until now."
"Madam President, I believe that the Americans with their FAIR act will most certainly take over a section of the global market, and that we have not progressed as far with our system."
"They also give a certain type of aid."
"We will therefore have to think a lot more creatively about this aspect."
"To conclude, Madam President, I would like draw attention to rural development."
"The demographic data show that in large areas of Europe, the rural population is continuing to move into the city."
"We will not be able to stop this migration with agricultural policy alone; it requires a broader rural policy, as well as the resources to develop this policy."
"For this reason I look forward to the actual implementation of the proposals which were developed in Cork."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Cunha."
"He has produced a very objective report."
"All of us in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development very much appreciate his work."
"The recent proposals issued by the European Commission to reform the common agricultural policy must indeed be substantially changed, from an Irish perspective."
"Unless the proposals are extensively amended many marginalized Irish farms will come under pressure and some may not survive."
"Such a development would have serious consequences for the socioeconomic infrastructure of rural communities."
"The Commission proposals as they stand now, if implemented in their entirety, would have the following detrimental effects on Irish agriculture."
"Firstly, in relation to the discrimination in the share-out of the milk quota, Ireland has a very legitimate claim in relation to additional quota."
"The proposals which do not provide for full compensation would have devastating effects on the Irish beef sector."
"In Ireland, as everybody knows, beef and milk represent 71 % of our entire agricultural output."
"The proposals, as they stand, would result in income reductions for Irish farmers, destabilize the structure of family farms, dissuade young people from taking up farming as a profession and would lead to continued rural depopulation."
"We must remember that, in comparative terms, agriculture is nearly three times as important to the Irish economy as it is to the EU as a whole."
"In 1997 the common agriculture policy was worth £5.1 billion to the Irish economy."
"In the context of the Agenda 2000 proposals price reductions can only be supported if they are accompanied by full payment to farmers so as to offset the effects of the proposed price reductions."
"The direct payments being proposed by the Commission are not adequate and must be addressed before we can agree."
"In conclusion, the CAP reform proposals are unacceptable to Ireland because they are not balanced, they do not protect the interests of Irish farming and they do not enhance rural development."
"Madam President, I hope the European Parliament will adopt Mr Cunha's excellent report. In doing so, it will express an opinion on the reform of the CAP, and will also express the reaction within the agricultural sector against the Commission's proposals."
"Commissioner Fischler, the Commission has not learnt any lessons from the 1992 reform, which has increased job losses in agriculture and rural areas, exacerbated inequalities in the distribution of Community funds, kept agricultural incomes down to 60 % of the average wage, and caused imbalances in land use."
"Worse still, the Commission continues to confine itself to a doctrine of price decreases and productivity races, which threaten jobs, social, environmental and regional stability, and the independence and quality of food."
"As the rapporteur emphasized, what agriculture and European society actually need is a CAP reform which offers a real alternative. It must fundamentally redirect a number of measures, consolidate the European agricultural model and enable agriculture to face the new challenges ahead of society, in the areas of employment, food, energy, the environment and water supply."
"How can we do this?"
"What tools must we use?"
"The rapporteur correctly reminds us that prices and markets policy must be based on the three traditional pillars of CAP, particularly Community preference."
"And he makes proposals for the future. One such proposal relates to the basis of agricultural income, which must be derived essentially from the production and sale of agricultural products."
"By prices rather than subsidies."
"He raises the question of ceilings and the adjustment of subsidies on the basis of criteria which promote employment, and for the same purpose, a readjustment between northern and Mediterranean production areas."
"He proposes that the definition of international commercial relations should be based on clauses relating to production costs and environmental, social and employment standards."
"He even refers to the question of the principle of rural exception, which must set down the limits to globalization in the sector."
"This report provides an excellent basis for discussion and suggests alternatives to the Commission's proposals."
"It will be of benefit to the farmers and people of Europe, and the Council should take inspiration from it."
"Madam President, I would like to add my thanks to Mr Cunha and congratulate him on a very excellent report."
"It proves beyond any shadow of doubt that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which sometimes comes in for tremendous criticism from Members in the Committee on Budgets and elsewhere can, on occasions, come forward with very constructive reports."
"As we are all aware, the report looks towards enlargement of the European Union and the WTO discussions - the whole Agenda 2000 process."
"It will have a very long-term effect on agriculture and as we have known it within the European Union."
"There are a number of points I wish to make."
"It is important that we ensure that the existing family farm structure of the European Union is protected in order for it to survive."
"Member States are extremely enthusiastic about enlargement, but at this moment the Council in Cardiff is probably trying to cut back the contributions to the European Union."
"On the one hand they want enlargement while, on the other hand, they are not prepared to pay for it."
"They cannot have it both ways."
"Member States are going to have to face up to that principle no matter what approach they take."
"We must have a longer transitional period and extend the time before enlargement."
"One other point I want to make very strongly: we must not allow the renationalization of the common agricultural policy as we have known it."
"I am very concerned at the proposal for national envelopes because I believe that will bring inequalities between Member States."
"Indeed, there is the whole problem of additionality, which we have seen in the past."
"Personally, I would like to see Parliament and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development fully involved in the whole Agenda 2000 process."
"Madam President, my honourable friends, our colleague, Mr Cunha, has in fact presented a report which we can approve."
"However, we will see that problems will arise when it comes to details."
"As you all know, it is easy to agree on general issues but we all have different views when it comes to specific details."
"With regard to the Commission's address I would say that the Commission's proposals in Agenda 2000 are definitely a move in the right direction."
"But they are flawed."
"The proposals rely too heavily on product-related subsidies."
"Anyone who now persists in ignoring the pressure for change in the area of agricultural policy and the opportunities of Agenda 2000 by introducing half-hearted reforms or changes, will receive his just deserts from life, the WTO and the enlargement process."
"For this reason I believe we must concentrate."
"The so-called second strong, sturdy leg or the second pillar, as the Commission says, in policy for rural areas is a very narrow support to which a heck of a lot of flesh has to be added."
"What we need in this reform is help to adapt farms to the markets."
"This can only be done by means of quality of products or quality of production, and not by means of quantity."
"Those who still place too much importance on going to market with huge quantities will discover that we are putting ourselves under pressure."
"In the WTO negotiations we, the EU, must set the conditions and not allow them to be dictated to us by the Americans or the Cairns Group."
"We need to promote employment in rural areas."
"We need to meet unmet demand in a harmonious and well-balanced system of environmentally sustainable production."
"In this area, the Commission's proposal remains inadequate."
"And it is not right for the European farmers' associations to be telling the same tales of woe as they did two years ago."
"At that time the common agricultural policy was supposedly on its way out, but this was not the case."
"Nor will it be in future."
"But we can lose out - that is, if we only make a few minor changes instead of carrying out real reform."
"We will now suspend the debate on agriculture."
"The debate will continue at 3.00 p.m."
"Votes"
"We cannot support Mr Pimenta's motion to reject the proposed accord with the USA."
"This is not because the agreement is the best it could be, but because it is better than the alternative."
"The alternative to the accord with the USA is not some other agreement with better standards."
"The Council's earlier decision on banning leghold traps implies that an import ban could be introduced, but that is basically all it provides for."
"The resolution on banning leghold traps is very limited; it applies to only 13 of the 19 species covered by the new agreement; it does not ban the use of leghold traps, only the import of furs; most significantly, the resolution only covers this one particular trapping method."
"In our opinion, it is hypocritical to focus on this one trapping method, however barbaric, while traps in use within the EU are no less cruel."
"That - and not more stringent requirements for traps - is the alternative to the agreements with Russia, Canada and now also the United States."
"I fully endorse the views of our rapporteur and wish to make it plain that I totally disapprove of the agreement between the European Community and the United States on so-called ""humane' trapping standards. These do absolutely nothing to prevent cruelty to animals."
"I believe that it is high time we put an unconditional end, I repeat, an unconditional end, to the use of leghold traps, which inflict terrible suffering on millions of captured animals indiscriminately."
"Furthermore, this agreement does not go nearly as far as the agreements with Canada and Russia, which many of us considered inadequate when we were consulted."
"Indeed, I consider this to be a step in the wrong direction, both from the legal point of view (with regard, for example, to the method of settling possible disputes) and in substance (I refer in particular to the increase in the time period)."
"It is unfortunate for animals that our competence in this matter is only consultative. We know that in all likelihood the Council will ignore our opinion and approve this proposal."
"But this should not prevent us, as a Parliament, from loudly and clearly recommending the rejection of this unacceptable agreement!"
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the Pimenta report urging the Council to reject the proposed accord with the USA."
"However, we must admit that we find ourselves in a dilemma."
"We do want to find alternatives to leghold traps."
"Leghold traps are cruel to animals and must be banned."
"The difficulty is that political efforts mainly focus on doing away with leghold traps in areas where wild animals are trapped by people who rely heavily on trapping."
"Political efforts are even touching on the enormous number of leghold traps used in the EU to keep 'pests' at bay."
"The logic appears to be that if a woman wants to wear the animal's pelt as a fur, then it must not be caught using a leghold trap, but if the animal is regarded by humans as not very attractive, then we can do what we like to it."
"In the EU, we use thousands of traps to catch animals that are not very highly rated among animal lovers: rats and water voles."
"Moreover - to a positively hideous extent - international negotiations on this matter have been so long-drawn-out, have been manipulated so much and have produced such poor results that the whole exercise ought to be done again."
"In weighing up the one factor against the other, we have come down on the side of supporting the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection in its rejection of the motion, even though we do not endorse a hypocritical majority in the House who would like to hit the earning potential of native populations while failing to see the beam in their own eyes (to put it mildly)."
"Council Regulation 3254/91 laid down provisions whereby third countries wishing to export the furs or associated products derived from 13 species should either have prohibited the use of leghold traps within their jurisdiction or ensure that trapping methods used meet internationally agreed humane trapping standards."
"Although this Regulation was adopted some years ago, it is not always implemented."
"There is a simple reason behind this: a threat by Canada and the United States to take the issue to the World Trade Organization, if the ban is enforced."
"The Commission has now presented to us a draft bilateral agreement between the European Community and the United States."
"Like the rapporteur, our group rejects this agreement."
"Once again, it reflects the tropism of the Commission, bending before the United States and Canada's determination to refuse the introduction of environmental clauses within the framework of the WTO."
"If the agreement were enforced, it would furthermore create a situation verging on the grotesque. In fact, the European Union could continue to import furs derived from animals captured using leghold traps, whilst at the same time refusing to use the same type of trap to destroy animal pests in its own territory."
"In fact, in wetlands in particular, great damage is done by animal pests with no market value, such as nutria, to dykes and ditches, which have to be repaired at considerable cost by local authorities and marsh associations."
"It would be more logical if we adopted exactly the opposite stance instead of the Commission's proposal: for animals which have a market value, it would be logical to use the most humane traps."
"However, in order to eradicate animal pests, which have no market value, it would be preferable to use the cheapest and most effective traps."
"I have no option but to vote against the agreement drafted with the USA on humane animal trapping standards."
"It is simply not tough enough on the cruel leghold traps which so many of my constituents naturally oppose."
"The author of this report has rightly concluded that millions of defenceless animals will suffer the painful death caused by leghold traps for years to come as a result of this agreement not going far enough to ban them."
"The view of our citizens in the EU, not only in nations traditionally known for their love of animals like the British, has been set out in the statutory obligation of the European Commission to ban the import of furs caught in these cruel traps wherever practical."
"I trust that trade considerations with the USA will not be used as a reason for not continuing the push for better standards in animal traps."
"We are the largest trading block in the world's history and it is time that the EU's negotiators used our influence to get a better deal for animals in these kind of international agreements."
"If the deal is not good enough, then they must go back to the talks table until it is."
"Girão Pereira report (A4-0178/98)"
"We voted in favour of the Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing the fishing possibilities and the financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the EC and the Government of the Republic of Guinea on fishing off the Guinean coast for the period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1999, for the following reasons:"
"1.We think there is a very positive improvement on the previous protocol as regards controls on fish stocks and the corresponding allocation of financial resources to local scientific and technical programmes and to methods of supervision and control of fishing activities.2.We think the renewal of the Protocol - maintaining previous catch levels for practical purposes, but significantly increasing the amounts of financial compensation - will make it possible to reach a compromise between the need for Community fleets (Spain, Greece, France, Italy and Portugal) to continue to have access to local resources, supplying their own raw materials, and the obvious need for less developed countries to increase their financial profits."
"We only hope Community owners (and particularly Portuguese owners, who will be entitled to catch 200 grt a year of shrimps and send two surface longliners to Guinean waters) will make better use of the opportunities created for them.3.We must, however, express our doubts over the fact that the Community fleet will have access to Guinean waters outside a 10-mile limit when its vessels should only have access outside the usual 12-mile limit."
"Similarly, we have doubts about the period specified by this Protocol - only two years, and therefore less than in most EC agreements of this type - which will not provide sufficient operational stability for the Community fleet."
"Our group is speaking today on this report relating to the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea, in order to highlight an essential aspect of Common Fisheries Policy."
"At the last Fisheries Council, a ban was adopted on the use of 2.5 km drifting gill nets in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic."
"I strongly opposed this decision, which was adopted without any scientific basis. It deprives fishermen and coastal areas of an economic activity essential to their survival."
"May I remind you that this decision is even more unacceptable because in order to obtain the Council's agreement, the Commission maintained the use of 21 km drifting gill nets in the Baltic, although an international regulation established by the UN recommends a limit of 2.5 km."
"Let us return to the fisheries agreement with Guinea. What do we have here?"
"This agreement provides fishing possibilities for 33 freezer-seiners and 13 pole-and-line tuna vessels."
"Pursuant to international law, these vessels may if they wish use drifting gill nets."
"What is the logic behind this according to the Commission?"
"As a defender of the principle of controlled resources, and supporter of professional fishermen, I cannot fail to very strongly condemn these absolutely scandalous contradictions in the Commission's attitude."
"The Commission should restrict itself to ensuring compliance with international regulations which permit the use of drifting gill nets. It must stop using false excuses in order to enable fishermen from one specific Member State to snatch the market shares of other Member States, by the artificial means of banning a type of fishing gear."
"If a drifting gill net of limited length is environmentally acceptable and not detrimental to resources, it must be acceptable for all fishermen, in every sea and every ocean."
"All of the fisheries policy which is based on the Community buying fishing rights from the poor countries of Africa is wrong."
"Therefore we cannot support it."
"In addition, the proposal before us from the Commission entails an increase in aid compared with before."
"Apart from the reservations on principle, you should also ask whether the aid which the EC pays to Guinea really benefits the poor population of the country."
"It is worth remembering that Guinea is not a proper democracy, which makes you wonder where the money actually ends up."
"Trakatellis report (A4-0192)"
"In our opinion, it is of course appropriate to revise the provisions on genetically modified micro-organisms on an ongoing basis as new knowledge is acquired in this relatively new area of research."
"We believe it is particularly important to safeguard high safety levels, and this is one of the aims of the report."
"However, we have been obliged to abstain from voting on a number of amendments."
"This is largely because lay people cannot pretend to comprehend the content and consequences of these proposals."
"We feel it is questionable to allow such complicated, technical issues to go to the vote when people have no real hope of understanding them."
"The common position adopted with the Council at the end of the first reading provides a framework for the restricted use of genetically modified micro-organisms, and safeguards the interests of Member States."
"The 35 amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection broadly take up the amendments presented during the discussion of the proposal at first reading. The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations is unable to support either the amendments which aim to prevent Member States from reinforcing minimum environmental protection regulations, or those which are likely to make the proposal unenforceable, by trying to establish too high a level of precision."
"The important amendments include a proposal to change the legal basis from Article 130s to Article 100a. This proposal is unacceptable as it stands, because the directive does not establish rules relating to the harmonization of the internal market; it establishes minimum environmental and public health protection regulations, which Member States must be able to reinforce if necessary."
"The directive does not, in fact, regulate the movement and marketing of genetically modified micro-organisms, but only the conditions of their use in contained facilities."
"Another important point (Amendments Nos 4 and 9) makes it compulsory for operators to obtain insurance cover for the contained use of GMMs."
"This provision is out of place in this document, because operator liability should be governed by general rules at the European level and by specific rules in the Member States."
"This document must not be used as an excuse for an indirect attempt to reform insurance legislation."
"The wording of most of the amendments (Amendments Nos 2 to 14) is more accurate and appropriate in the common position than in the initial document."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection seems to have taken great pleasure in amending the document in such a way that it has become too complicated to adapt to technological change and unenforceable as it stands."
"On the other hand, our group supports all the containment provisions proposed in Amendments Nos 15 to 35 because, unlike the preceding amendments, they are more appropriate than the common position."
"Finally, our group supports Amendment No 36 tabled by the Green Group, which provides for a better description, and therefore better knowledge, of the GMMs used."
"des Places report (A4-0216)"
"We think the Commission's proposal is better than the draft report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"We are voting against the proposal to increase prices and so we cannot vote for this report."
"We are particularly opposed to hemp, wine and tobacco."
"It is our opinion that there needs to be a proper reform before 1999."
"The Commission proposals for the 1998/1999 prices package rely on the availability of limited funds for the common agricultural policy and, according to the rapporteur's report, will lead to a reduction of approximately 2 % in prices and compensatory payments in real terms."
"Also, this reduction will in all probability be accompanied by a further 2 % reduction with the disappearance of the green ECU and the introduction of the euro."
"According to the rapporteur, European agricultural income as a whole fell by 16.4 % in real terms during the period 1990/96, and the rural population decreased by more than 2 million people."
"The continuation of price-fixing and compensatory aids for the thirteenth successive year can only be expected to lead to a further reduction in the number of farmers, while incomes in European farming will continue to fall."
"The proposals for the 18 Council Regulations are simply a roll-over of existing provisions, with some exceptions which are necessary for clearly legal reasons or to fulfil Council obligations."
"They do not tackle the problem of farmers' incomes and their continued employment."
"They cannot come about through our vote."
"This year's proposals are basically a roll-over from last year's prices."
"This would superficially imply that the situation in agriculture is fine."
"Nothing could be further from the truth in relation to Ireland."
"Irish farmers are experiencing major problems, particularly in the beef sector."
"The BSE crisis, the reduction in export refunds and licensing and additional problems relating to access to third country markets have all contributed to the problem."
"A roll-over indicates a complete absence of a policy direction on the part of the Commission."
"Farmers need to know in what direction the Commission intends to take them over the next decade."
"They need a clear indication of a well-thought-out Commission strategy."
"What is needed is the development of proposals which have as their objective the revitalization of rural economies, including the agriculture sector."
"We take a negative view of the Commission's adoption of an agricultural prices proposal in line with its policy of maintaining some sectors and reducing others, such as arable crops."
"In our view, even for those it maintains, this always represents an actual reduction in agricultural prices, because it fails to take inflation into account."
"On the contrary, we would like to see agricultural prices updated to allow for at least a 1.7 % rate of inflation, at the EU level, as a way of guaranteeing the farmers' income."
"We also regard as extremely negative the fact that once again there are no changes or revisions for the common organization of the markets in the Mediterranean countries on the grounds that they have not yet been reformed."
"In that context we find it unacceptable that no set prices have been fixed for olive oil, with the clear strategy of prioritizing the need for rapid approval of the new draft regulation under discussion."
"Although we consider the proposal for the extension of new plantations for special-quality vines to be a positive step, we would reject at the outset a strategy that continues to support the abandonment of viticultural land, because of the importance of viticulture to southern countries, especially Portugal."
"In the same way, we reject proposals to allow the blending of different musts and viticultural products, because they will encourage the sale of poor-quality wine and cause consumers to be defrauded."
"We voted against the report because, amongst other things, we are opponents of the EU's agricultural policy in general on the grounds of its high costs and, not least, its unfair distribution which favours big farmers."
"This policy area should be returned to the Member States as soon as possible."
"In addition we consider it to be particularly inappropriate for Parliament to decide on price levels in a market system for agricultural produce."
"However, we voted for the setting up of a vineyard register, which, remarkably enough, there has not been in spite of continuous reports of abuse of Community funds in the wine sector."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations is extremely satisfied with the quality of the report and the amendments proposed by Edouard des Places."
"However, we regret that the Commission has shown such a lack of imagination and has presented such a predictable prices package."
"We are nevertheless pleased that in response to the amendment we tabled asking for the set-aside rate to be set by the end of this month, that is, for a decision on the set-aside rate to be adopted at the same time as the prices package, the Commission has proposed a new regulation applicable to the forthcoming agricultural year."
"However, at this stage, the Commission's proposals are totally unrealistic."
"That is why my group has tabled two amendments, one asking for the withdrawal of the extraordinary set-aside, that is, the application of a penalty depending on the required set-aside rate, and the other asking for an obligatory set-aside rate of 5 % instead of the 10 % proposed by the Commission."
"As well as supporting all the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, my group has again tabled amendments in the House proposing a 1.7 % increase in institutional prices, which aim to reduce the effects of monetary erosion on farmers' incomes."
"It is quite unacceptable for anyone to think that production costs in agriculture are not affected by inflation."
"We have already criticized the fact that a constant level of prices and aid has been established in the Commission's proposals on Agenda 2000 for a period of seven years."
"Would it be acceptable in any other profession for income to fail to be indexed to price increases?"
"I personally do not think so."
"Finally, my group was pleased to see that the Committee on Agriculture adopted Mr des Places' proposed amendments regarding the creation of an adjustment coefficient with a view to maintaining equitable levels of income between farmers in all Member States of the European Union in order to compensate for serious drawbacks resulting from the possible disappearance of the green rate on 1 January 1999 for the Member States participating in the single currency."
"Defenders of the euro claim that it will naturally be of benefit to farmers, as it will put an end to competitive devaluation, as well as the budget for agri-monetary measures."
"This overlooks the particularly serious consequences for farmers of the disappearance of the green rate entailed in the transition to the euro."
"In France, for example, the difference between the green rate and the financial rate is in the region of 2 %: there will therefore in fact be a further 2 % decrease in institutional prices and aid, from 1 January 1999."
"Thanks to the rapporteur's amendments, a European Parliament document will highlight an important weakness in the euro."
"Should farmers, whose opinion was not sought, have to bear the cost of the transition to the euro, which has been introduced for ideological reasons?"
"Thanks to the work of Mr des Places, Parliament will be ready to issue an opinion during this part-session. This will enable the Council, during its meetings on 22 and 23 June, to define the general legal and regulatory framework applicable to our farmers, thus allowing them to adopt decisions in full possession of the facts."
"Rosado Fernandes report (A4-0218/98)"
"Madam President, it is ironic that the European Union heavily subsidizes tobacco while, at the same time, it tries to fight against cancer and also educate people about the danger to health of smoking."
"What it should do is get rid of subsidies."
"It is an absolute disgrace that the other members of the Commission would not support Commissioner Flynn on this."
"It is one of his most positive proposals and it is disgraceful that the Commission will not support his attempts to get rid of tobacco subsidies."
"Every year over ECU 1 billion of taxpayers' money is going to subsidize something which is detrimental to public health and which has a detrimental effect in countries around the world where there is no proper regulation to ensure that smokers are aware of the dangers of smoking."
"The European Union is extremely wrong in subsidizing something which shortens the lives of its users."
"The tobacco industry and tobacco growers have to realize that they will have to turn to alternative crops."
"One ironic aspect of this report is that they are trying to push for alternative types of tobacco."
"There is no alternative type of tobacco which is not dangerous to health and it is ridiculous to promote the idea that there is."
"The Commission should support Commissioner Flynn on this matter and get rid of tobacco subsidies in the interests of public health and of consumers."
"As tobacco consumption has harmful effects on the health of users, it is absurd for public subsidies to be given to tobacco production."
"In the vote on this report we are supporting the amendments which will phase out tobacco subsidies."
"If these amendments are not adopted, we will vote against the report in its entirety at the final vote."
"We have finally started a thorough debate on the vital changes necessary in some specific areas of the COM which face particularly strong competition from other continents."
"I therefore share the opinion of the members of Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who have adopted the Rosado Fernandes report on tobacco."
"We have an opportunity today to endorse the need to provide support in this sector according to the quality of the product and to reconsider the problem of subsidies between tobacco-producing countries in the south and north."
"We must find a permanent solution to this problem."
"Tobacco produced in the north cannot continue indefinitely to be the subject of discrimination in comparison with southern varieties."
"Why do we confine ourselves simplistically to defending the interests of our countries of origin, depending on whether or not they produce tobacco?"
"Substantial support will be of benefit to the whole of this sector, which has made a consistent effort for many years to improve quality."
"We must remember that tobacco, with 135 000 producers and 400 000 seasonal jobs, is a great rural employer."
"Even if tobacco were no longer cultivated in Europe, this would not reduce the consumption of cigarettes, as some Utopians would have us believe."
"We must therefore insist upon the enhancement of all high-quality tobacco products, including those produced in northern Europe."
"We must acknowledge their value because there is a market demand for them and their production costs are higher."
"As well as this type of encouragement, the results of research, particularly genetic research, need to be more widely distributed."
"New plant improvement programmes must also be implemented which reflect the progress achieved in other areas."
"It is now possible to produce tobacco which is less harmful to human health."
"Let us work positively in that direction."
"By banning tobacco advertising, the European Parliament recently took a balanced decision to protect the health of young people."
"We must now continue along the same lines, by approving the provisions of the Rosado Fernandes report."
"The Commission plans to create a quota buy-back system, the stated aim of which is to decrease the volume of tobacco produced in Europe gradually."
"However, it is wrong to pursue such an aim when tobacco imports from third countries are so large."
"May I remind you that the European Union is the largest importer of raw tobacco in the world, with a self-sufficiency level of no more than 30 %."
"Moreover, the intended system will not help to modernize production methods or enable young farmers to set up."
"This policy is therefore contrary to producers' interests."
"However, within the framework currently imposed on French producers, Mr Rosado Fernandes' report defends positions which are the lesser of two evils. We therefore have no hesitation whatsoever in voting for this report."
"In light of the detrimental effects of tobacco on consumer health, we cannot subscribe to maintaining or increasing EU support for the production of raw tobacco."
"We believe all forms of official support for tobacco production should be phased out."
"Out of consideration for the tobacco producers, this should be a gradual transition over a short period of time to allow tobacco producers to switch to other crops or trades."
"In my opinion no subsidies at all should go towards tobacco growing within the EU."
"Since none of the proposals before us are aimed at an immediate decision of that kind, I have voted for Amendment No 66 (which means a rejection of the report in its entirety) and against the final adoption of the report."
"Otherwise I have voted neither yes nor no."
"At the May plenary session we agreed to ban tobacco advertising."
"This decision was consistent with EU health policy."
"However, the subsidization of tobacco farming is clearly in contradiction of the EU's Treaty obligation to protect the health of our citizens."
"I regret that the Commission rejected the proposal to phase out subsidies in 1996 and instead opted for reform proposals."
"The 1994 report from the Court of Auditors on the issue concluded that the abolition of tobacco subsidies would lead to considerable budgetary savings without destroying the livelihoods of tobacco farmers."
"For these reasons and to be consistent on health grounds, I have supported the amendments put forward by Mr Collins and others from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"The tobacco producing sector illustrates all the contradictions and hypocrisies of society."
"Tobacco is a poison and a drug."
"The fight against cancer is dependent upon the prevention of addiction to tobacco."
"As medical research has identified one of the causes of one form of cancer, we have a moral obligation to deal with the problem at its source."
"We do not have any other alternative."
"But the tobacco industry provides jobs and incomes for many families, and experience has shown us that prohibitions are useless as they only lead to fraud and increased criminality."
"What we must do is to work in gradual stages:"
"Europe has without hesitation adopted costly and difficult solutions in order to reduce agricultural surpluses and prevent the depopulation of rural areas."
"Europe must also find the courage to solve this problem."
"This does not mean we have to choose between protecting jobs or health; it means we have to protect health and ensure the redeployment of jobs."
"We in the Green Group consider the fact that the EU has a system of tobacco subsidies to be quite wrong and that it sends out the wrong signals to the general public about smoking tobacco."
"Not very long ago the European Parliament approved the Council's proposal to ban indirect tobacco advertising."
"The European Parliament has also expressed the view that tobacco is a danger to health which must be taken very seriously."
"The Green Group shares these points of view and was instrumental in getting the European Parliament to make these decisions."
"The risks of smoking are considerable."
"We must therefore work to get people either to stop smoking or not to take it up in the first place."
"At the same time it is a fact that the EU gives substantial subsidies to the growing of tobacco within the EU, currently around ECU 1 billion per year."
"In our view, this double morality is totally absurd."
"We are therefore working towards achieving an end to these subsidies as soon as possible."
"It would of course be best if these subsidies were phased out over the next few years. It would be best for those who currently grow tobacco and it would send out the right signal that the EU takes the tobacco issue seriously and is working towards a reduction in smoking."
"The conversion premiums which exist to enable tobacco growers to grow other crops must be encouraged and given a larger budget."
"At the same time the budget for subsidies to tobacco growers should be reduced."
"Some people claim that these conversion premiums are of no help because tobacco is the only crop which can be grown where tobacco is currently grown."
"That is just political rhetoric and not a serious argument because growers get larger subsidies for tobacco than for other crops."
"Conversion to other crops must be intensified and made more attractive."
"The Green Group's objective is a complete end to subsidies for tobacco growing."
"When the common organization of the tobacco market is reformed, the emphasis must not be put on the harm tobacco causes to health, because if we do that we shall have to start by prohibiting the importation of tobacco, of which there is a severe shortage for the European curing industry."
"Questions of public health should be dealt with elsewhere and in other ways, within the context of education and prevention."
"When the sector is reformed, the emphasis should, on the contrary, be placed on the direct and indirect employment which the sector provides, particularly in the most backward areas of the EU, many of which have no alternative crops to produce."
"Or, after that, it should be placed on the very important contribution which tobacco growing makes to the struggle against increasing rural desertification."
"When the sector is reformed, priority should be given to measures aimed at improving the quality of the product, and there have been and are clear proposals by the European Parliament in that respect."
"When the tobacco sector is reformed, we cannot deliberately promote and encourage - as the Commission's draft regulation does - the total abandonment of tobacco growing without creating credible alternatives, but quite the opposite. We should be creating conditions in which production can be maintained and new generations can follow the present growers, especially with young growers coming in."
"We are worried that the Commission is ignoring - on an increasingly systematic basis - all the opinions and strategies relating to this reform that have repeatedly won majority votes in the European Parliament."
"I am voting in favour of the report that has just been presented to us for three main reasons."
"Firstly, this report makes a clear distinction between the issues of tobacco production and the prevention of smoking, because they are not directly connected with production in the Union, which only covers 30 % of consumption."
"Secondly, the report rejects all the amendments relating to the withdrawal of production aid, thereby defending the principle of Community aid for production, jobs and associated activities. It promotes improved quality, greater coherence between supply and demand and, within that framework, proposes to reinforce professional organization and increase the payments for some varieties."
"Finally, although this report presents voluntary reconversion measures, it does not support quota reduction measures. On the contrary, it proposes to assist young farmers to enter this sector."
"However, I do not support the idea of increasing the amount withheld from the payment allocated to the Community Fund for Tobacco, for the prevention of smoking. It means that tobacco producers would take the blame for, and bear the cost of, an activity for which the whole of society is responsible, despite the fact that the Fund is also used to finance research into cultivation methods."
"Finally, I share the concern expressed in the report on the consequences of enlargement of the Union. I call for appropriate measures to defend the interests of producers, inasmuch as the internal market offers great potential for the development of production and jobs in this sector."
"Consistent action is imperative in politics."
"This is why I cannot accept European provisions on tobacco growing."
"Recently the European Parliament approved a directive banning the advertising of tobacco products."
"I endorsed this ban with conviction: tobacco advertisements are directed mainly at young people in the knowledge that nicotine addiction mostly takes hold in youth."
"The result is 548 000 tobacco-related deaths per year including 654 in Luxembourg."
"We cannot ban tobacco advertisements while at the same time subsidizing tobacco growing."
"Yet this is exactly what the Union is doing by guaranteeing an annual production of 350 600 tonnes of raw tobacco and spending approximately ECU 1 000 million on it."
"Admittedly, the system was improved considerably by reducing the quantity (by 24 % over just 4 years) and by means of subsidies for relinquishing arable land."
"However, it remains to be seen whether or not control is at an optimum level."
"I welcome the relative reduction in subsidies and the reconversion measures which must not, however, lead to abandoned land being taken over."
"Yet I am of the view that there is a significant contradiction between health policy (for which very little EU money is available) and the promotion of tobacco growing, which, moreover, is of very poor quality in Europe."
"For these reasons, I cannot approve the report."
"We voted against the proposal because it will not solve the issue of the tobacco growers' dependence on extensive EU subsidies in either the short or the long term."
"The proposal does not contain any reduction in financial support for the tobacco sector. Nor does it take into consideration the serious consequences tobacco growing has for health and environmental protection."
"Our group supports all the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, because European tobacco production must be allowed to continue."
"The aim of a large number of amendments tabled by our British colleagues is to withdraw all European aid from tobacco production."
"We are naturally opposed to this, because the European Union is a net importer of very large quantities of tobacco."
"Tobacco is also mainly produced in disadvantaged regions, and it is therefore necessary for tobacco production, which is very labour-intensive, to continue in order to protect jobs."
"However, my group has tabled five amendments. Their main aim is to reject the Commission's proposal to create a quota buyback system."
"This system will not only lead to a reduction in the quantities receiving production aid and, therefore, to a decrease in European tobacco production, it will also do nothing to help modernize production and it will prevent young farmers from setting up in this area."
"This system will also have the adverse effect, in the medium term, of giving quotas a financial value, which will create a further financial burden on producers."
"It could in fact lead to quotas being considered as assets, whose value would be based on the quota buy-back value."
"On the other hand, we have proposed the creation of national quota reserves to maintain the production capacity of Member States, and to contribute towards the financial stability of existing or new farms."
"This would also prevent the appearance of any additional costs created by quota values."
"May I remind you that a national reserve system already exists in other production sectors, such as sheep, cattle and milk."
"My group has also tabled other amendments to the Commission's proposal, with regard to the cultivation contract auction scheme between the producer and the first processor."
"We consider that this is a very restrictive measure, which forgets that the tobacco production is a specific, very highly organized sector, in which distribution and processing are carried out by a small number of multinational or national companies."
"I cannot back the Commission proposals for the future of the European tobacco sector."
"I am amazed and angered that after all the recent progress in getting tobacco giants to admit that their products cause diseases such as cancer, we have a proposal to keep using public money to subsidize tobacco producers!"
"Is this a crazed method to keep our hospitals busy with new patients?"
"What exactly is meant by the idea of subsidizing higher quality tobacco - is this to promote more addictive versions of cigarettes or ones which take longer to kill their smokers?"
"Even with the fig leaf of more publicity about the dangers of smoking, the taxpayer is still expected under these plans to stump up millions to pay the cigarette makers to make people ill."
"The continued misuse of public money for this kind of tobacco subsidy is no longer acceptable."
"Perhaps when it all began it could be excused on grounds of ignorance about the effects of smoking - but not in 1998."
"If we must have tobacco production, let it succeed or fail by its own efforts as any other industry has to, not with people's hard-earned money as subsidy."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.17 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Reform of the CAP (Agenda 2000)"
"The next item is the continuation of the report (A4-0219/98) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the reform of the common agricultural policy (Agenda 2000 - Part One, Chapter III) (COM(97)2000 - C4-0522/97)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I congratulate Arlindo Cunha on an excellent report."
"It reveals the rapporteur's expertise in the subject."
"The report emphasizes the different circumstances surrounding production in the EU."
"It is a totally Utopian gesture to try to apply EU regulations uniformly right across the region, from Finnish Lapland to the Canaries."
"The greatest challenge of Agenda 2000 will be the integration of the special needs that exist in northern, southern and mountainous regions into the EU common agricultural policy."
"The CAP suits the best agricultural regions in the EU."
"Production costs are higher in the northern regions, the mountainous regions and other parts of the EU area."
"This fact has to feature far more prominently in Agenda 2000."
"Agenda 2000 weakens competitiveness between the production of crops and that of fodder, to the detriment of the latter."
"Maize feed storage aid is improving the competitiveness of milk production in six Member States, and weakening the profitability of fodder-based milk and beef production."
"Thus there is a need for fodder storage aid, just as the report explains."
"The viability of crop growing also requires equivalent special arrangements in northern EU regions."
"Agenda 2000 extends EU aid to forestry."
"Forestry has been and must in the future be within the sphere of the free market economy."
"In no case must we make the forestry sector as tightly regulated and aided as agriculture."
"The acceptance of Agenda 2000 requires larger regional investment as part of EU agricultural policy."
"We have the European model of the family farming based unit, which we have to defend."
"Mrs Anttila, I am sorry that I had to tell you to hurry up, but I am not to blame. Your Group must give you more time."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report but concentrate my contribution on rural development."
"It is inevitable that within the EU and, to an even greater degree, in the EU applicant states the number of jobs in agriculture will fall as a result of mechanization."
"Without alternative jobs in rural areas young people will leave for the cities and many more people will commute daily to towns and cities with all the negative implications for the environment of increased car use on inadequate rural roads."
"Food packaging and processing jobs are currently supported by Objective 5a grants."
"However, there is an urgent need for additional non-agricultural jobs and small-scale enterprises in rural areas."
"LEADER programmes have already demonstrated great success in generating additional finance for investment in such jobs."
"If the rural pillar of the CAP is to become a reality we need some continued form of the LEADER programme after 2000 to maintain thriving rural communities, particularly in areas no longer covered either by Objective 1 or Objective 5(b) after 1999."
"Production of wholesome food, protection of the environment and good animal welfare standards must also be key elements of CAP reform."
"Mr President, Mr Cunha's report is characterised by honesty and courage."
"It is an impartial demonstration of the anti-agricultural line taken by the common agricultural policy."
"It is quite correct when it says that the continued reduction in prices and other related measures have contributed to a reduction, to extremely low levels, in the number of small and medium-sized farms, and to an increase in the number of large agricultural holdings."
"This is the model of the agricultural policy of the European Union that Mr Fischler told us about this morning."
"Unfortunately, whatever compensation the Commission has introduced to counteract these negative measures has been outweighed by the exorbitant fines and excessive quota reductions which are imposed on small and medium-sized businesses, especially on Mediterranean agricultural production."
"Agenda 2000 will only make the situation worse. It will serve the mammon of fat profits and work against SMEs, especially those which operate in the south, in the Mediterranean region."
"I have a number of recommendations, which I shall not elaborate on as I do not have the time, as you say."
"They are formulated as amendments and many of them have been approved by the Commission."
"I just want to say firstly that perhaps Mr Cunha has made an omission: he does not give the reason for this anti-agricultural policy or say what interests it serves."
"We must denounce this here."
"Secondly, farmers will revolt and take a stand against it, and arbitrary and violent measures, such as those implemented in Greece, with 10 000 farmers taken to court and punished with stringent penalties, will not be enough."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to emphasize the high quality of the work Mr Cunha has produced on a subject as sensitive as the CAP reform proposed by the Commission. The Commission's proposal needs, moreover, to be thoroughly reworked in order to provide a real future for all the farms in the European Union."
"Various aspects need to be taken into consideration."
"First of all, the expectations of our fellow citizens with regard to farmers, in terms of product quality, environmental protection and even the distribution of farming throughout the countryside."
"Then there is the international context, particularly the WTO. We have been forced to reduce public export subsidies, and are likely to come under strong pressure to reduce official production aid unless we modify some of our distribution methods."
"Finally, the evaluation of the CAP, which has been in force since 1993, and from which there are lessons to be learnt."
"I must be brief, and will simply say this: a decline in raw material prices and a reduction in, perhaps even the withdrawal of, official aid does not add up to an acceptable agricultural policy."
"Priority must however be given to two areas: competitiveness and the rational distribution of official aid."
"Competitiveness must in fact be increasingly achieved by supplying goods and services which satisfy the expectations of society, which relate to wholesomeness and taste, local know-how which enhances the countryside, the technology of sectors which generate added value, and diversity in increasingly segmented markets."
"These are the qualities, within our overall performance, which will enable Europe to show strength and originality by comparison with our competitors."
"Official support for agriculture, although still necessary, will not be permanently acceptable to European taxpayers or to our competitors within the WTO, unless it takes on board legitimate social, environmental, and regional concerns. Hence the idea of ceilings of aid per farm and national adjustments, based on the principle of subsidiarity, within a framework of Community rules, to prevent distortions of competition and the renationalization of the CAP."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, for his report."
"I welcome in particular the reaffirmation of the need to be especially careful about severe price cuts in any area of agriculture."
"I also welcome the report's commitment to compensate fully for any cuts in the institutional price."
"This is in marked contrast to the Commission's document, which proposes only a 50 % compensation for one of our major agricultural products."
"In the light of already collapsed beef-farmer incomes in Ireland, the Commission proposal is totally unacceptable and must be changed without delay."
"The report also confirms the three cornerstones of the common agricultural policy, but calls on the Commission to revise the Agenda 2000 proposals in many respects, recognizing that the continuing exodus of young people from agriculture is causing huge social and economic difficulties in large tracts of rural areas."
"For example, in my own country, a shocking statistic: the suicide rate now exceeds the number of people killed in motoring accidents on our roads."
"A high number of these totally unnecessary deaths are due to financial despair in rural areas."
"Under present policies, with rural depopulation rife, it is not attractive for young people to make a career in farming."
"The system of prices for products which are set below production costs and where income depends solely on the payment of decoupled compensation, which itself falls far short of bridging the gap to price reduction, does not provide the long-term security which well-educated young people see as a necessary requirement to their future."
"This report strongly suggests that the reform proposals in Agenda 2000 should be radically altered, as it is now very clear that cutting prices has not resolved the problems of market balance, nor has it arrested the continuing decline in farm incomes, which are a vital factor in stemming the haemorrhage of young people from rural areas."
"Mr President, I do not wish to sound even more pessimistic than the previous speaker, but I cannot help noticing that the number of farms is continuing to decrease, and that the number of employees in agriculture has fallen dramatically... so what kind of European agriculture model do we want for the future?"
"A model based on enlargement, the WTO model, or a distorted European model?"
"This is the most important period in the history of the CAP."
"We must understand that a new direction is needed, to enable farmers to live off the land, to produce food for Europe, and also for the world market, and to keep the countryside alive, by protecting the environment and the rural landscape."
"Does Agenda 2000 really offer us this?"
"Our group is more concerned about safeguarding the livelihoods of farmers and their families than about the international market."
"The issue at stake is the continuity of agriculture. Above all, we must enable young people to enter agriculture, by enabling them to purchase land and have the right to cultivate it, and by making them feel confident that in Europe it will always be possible to work on the land."
"Mr President, I wonder if Commissioner Fischler has considered the fact that the Cunha report is supported on all sides of the House and by all political groups and that, in contrast, intense criticism has been expressed regarding Agenda 2000 and the regulations for a policy on agriculture."
"I think that this is well founded, since, through Agenda 2000, the Commission is doing what we see throughout the societies of the European Union, that is, it is demolishing the social state and introducing models along the lines of the United States."
"We see this happening in agriculture too."
"We cannot accept a system of agriculture based on compensatory income subsidies, which are temporary in nature and which will transform farmers from productive forces in society into recipients of the temporary charity of the state, as the European Union at present envisages."
"It is necessary that we support the European model of agriculture, whereby the farmer is a producer, a custodian of the environment and of cultural traditions, and the family smallholding is a nucleus of employment."
"This is what is important in the Cunha report and my colleague opposite described very vividly, I think, the problems resulting from its disintegration."
"In this sense I think that we must support the Cunha report and oppose the Commission proposals for the enlargement 2000 programme."
"Mr President, I in turn wish to congratulate Mr Cunha."
"Indeed, I believe that the primary objective that we must bear in mind in any attempt to reform the CAP is the support of the European model of agricultural development and the promotion of the economic and social cohesion of the European countryside."
"This is described quite rightly in the Cunha report."
"I would just like to dwell on a few points."
"The first comment I wish to make is that, with the new structure of the objectives that is envisaged in Agenda 2000, actions belonging to other objectives are being transferred to the EAGGF, which will naturally involve new expenditure."
"However, it is not clear where the resources to cover this new expenditure will come from."
"There is a danger that we will identify, at a financial level, the policy to develop the countryside with the common agricultural policy, and we are facing the possibility that the CAP will be assimilated and fragmented in the long term within the frameworks of other policies, such as the policy for the regions, for example."
"The second is that we must pay particular attention to the danger of the renationalization of the CAP."
"This may come about either through granting Member States too much leeway in the management of existing resources, or through a wider interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity."
"The possibility of hidden national subsidies will only increase inequality between developed and less developed regions and will cause a chain reaction of problems in the economically weaker Member States."
"Thirdly, we must look again at the issue of parity when looking both at the different sectors of European agriculture and the different regions of the European agricultural area."
"We must look again at the relationships when subsidizing small and large agricultural holdings, less favoured and developed regions, products from the north and products from the south."
"We must look again, for example, Mr Fischler, at the advisability of some common organizations of the market having the year 2006 as their horizon and others the year 2001."
"And those that have the year 2001 as their horizon happen to be the products of the south."
"Finally, we must look carefully at the source of financing for the area of enlargement which concerns the modernization of the agricultural sector of the applicant countries."
"The possibility of financing such measures from the resources of current agricultural guidelines will cause tremendous problems. It will also transfer a large part of the cost of enlargement onto the shoulders of the less developed regions of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Fischler, the number of farmers in Europe fell continuously from 8 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 1995."
"Small family farms are disappearing."
"Since 1990, the number of agricultural employees has decreased by 3.7 % per year."
"This is detrimental to the fabric of rural life, and to town and country planning in Europe."
"The Commission has proposed to reduce prices and provide compensatory aid by means of direct income support."
"Would any other industry agree to sell its products at less than cost price?"
"Not to mention the lack of job security for farmers, whose incomes would be even more dependent on direct aid, which we all know would not be everlasting."
"What does the Commission intend do with all those acres which will remain unsold?"
"It is quite understandable that young people are reluctant to enter agriculture when they hear that Agenda 2000 intends to take 10 % off milk, 20 % off cereals and 30 % off beef and veal."
"Farming is an admirable occupation, but you have to really love it to want to become a farmer today, and unfortunately, love does not pay the bills!"
"What advice can parents responsible for the future of young people interested in agriculture give them?"
"Nevertheless, young farmers are our only guarantee of a future for European agriculture."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Arlindo Cunha's report is much better than the Commission's draft, although it goes no further than is absolutely necessary."
"If I may explain, Commissioner: you are spending half the budget on about 1 % of the richest people in Europe."
"As you know, 80 % of that money is distributed among 20 % of the farmers."
"That is a profoundly unfair policy."
"And the report does not define a firm ceiling or a firm modulation so as to create a fair basis for the distribution of the Community's funds."
"I would remind you that every Community citizen pays around ECU 350 to support this policy, which makes me think the Commission cares little what it does with the taxes citizens pay."
"The second point is that the agricultural policy still militates against the environment and quality, inasmuch as it is still geared to the support of production rather than production methods and the defence of quality in the food chain."
"Today, Commissioner, you are confronted with the problem of a growing lack of credibility in the food chain itself."
"With this policy, Commissioner, you are going to aggravate all the existing problems in the Community, which have not been capably dealt with."
"In addition, there is no solidarity between the regions."
"It is unacceptable that two farmers producing the same product should not be similarly classified and equally compensated because they live in different areas of the same Community."
"Aid has not been regionalized."
"There is no absolutely obvious need for family farms to receive aid, to the detriment of large-scale producers."
"The whole of this policy benefits a mere half-dozen farmers and the result is plain to see: there is total desertification, at present 5 % of the population are farmers, in 2000 this figure will be around 2.5 % and we shall be distributing half the Community budget among 0.5 % of the richest producers, and the richest people, in the entire Community."
"Mr President, I do not believe Agenda 2000's proposed increase in aid for the forestry sector is in harmony with the principle of market-based forestry, which does not rely on aid."
"The present Union aid for afforestation, forest improvements and averting forest fires is enough."
"Our money could certainly be invested more productively."
"In addition, the proposal would clearly lead to an extension of EU forestry policy, that is, to less authority on the part of Member States in the forestry sector."
"This, however, does not mean that the Union does not nor should not have an important role in forestry matters."
"For example, the certification of forests, which led to much heated discussion, should hopefully be clarified under some sort of EU umbrella certificate."
"I cannot but consider the proposed price cuts for milk and crop produce, coming as I do from a northern Member State, too harsh."
"Where is the promise that was made at summit level to preserve the viability of the rural environment by practising agriculture in all regions of the Union?"
"One very important question has been completely ignored by the Commission, which is the situation young farmers find themselves in, and their future prospects."
"We must do something about supporting young farmers when they inherit farms, and their circumstances in respect of sufficient levels of social security."
"On enlargement and Agenda 2000 I finally wish to say that it is not worth prolonging the discussion as long as the institutional problems in the EU today remain unresolved."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Cunha for his report."
"I want to repeat some of the concerns I have expressed elsewhere."
"One of the problems with the report is that it does not address the issue of falling employment in agriculture."
"When we talk about rural areas, it does not necessarily mean that we are talking about agriculture as a form of industry and employment."
"We need to ensure that there is more diversification on the farm but we also need to ensure there is more diversification within the local economy."
"We need to look at the role of rural areas in providing dormitory accommodation to large conurbations, second ownership, recreation, tourism and so on. We also need to look at what sort of jobs are being provided."
"We need jobs which are based on technology, in particular the use of the Internet and ISDN technology. We also need to look at providing small-scale industrial units for starter firms in our rural areas."
"We need to look at a new role for the countryside."
"Mr President, I would also like to compliment Mr Cunha on his report."
"One of the problems we have had in agriculture - not as a result of Mr Cunha's report but as a result of BSE - is that we have had to see vast changes in our approach to agriculture."
"It is not often that I can agree with the opposite side of the House but on this particular occasion I happen to agree with Mr Hallam's position."
"One of the problems with agriculture is that we are not bringing young people back into it and one of the things we must do is move away from the constrictions of quotas."
"This is something we have to look at in the future and part of Mr Cunha's report talks about it."
"We also must look at getting the returns for agriculture from the marketplace."
"It is vital that agriculture understands that it cannot continue to have an open bucket of funding available for it permanently."
"But the most important issues are, firstly, that we have a single market and that single market for agriculture must remain across Europe."
"Otherwise we shall see discrimination against Member States."
"That is why I am opposed to modulation, because it attacks the large and efficient farms."
"Secondly, I am opposed to the national envelope."
"This allows governments to control spending and hold it up."
"Mr President, the Cunha report is a key one, since this report will be indicative of the overall position of the European Parliament on the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"In my opinion, the report smacks of a compromise of many diverse positions on how to view the reform."
"Personally, I think the report is also deficient of vision."
"I looked in vain for any strong pronouncements in specific areas such as the environment and animal welfare."
"Regarding the section in Mr Cunha's report on imminent expansion, I am nevertheless pleased to see that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted the amendment I tabled to include the first applicant countries in arrangements for environmentally friendly production methods from 1999 onwards."
"After all, we must not forget that environmental improvements are not purely the domain of the 15 current Member States."
"Environmental pollution does not respect boundaries."
"The nations of central and eastern Europe applying for admittance to the EU also have significant agricultural production."
"Thus, through support and collaboration, we must help ensure good, environmentally sound production for these farmers."
"We must avoid a situation whereby these farmers resort to sacrificing the environment as they strive to keep up with the competition of the internal market."
"Commissioner, Mr Cunha, Mr President - Mr Cunha has been praised so much today that I would like to turn this around slightly with a minor criticism, because, as he knows himself, he did not discuss the role of women in agriculture in his report."
"He will certainly reconsider this before the vote and include it in the motion for a resolution, as he is in fact pro-women."
"Throughout the EU, approximately 50 % of all those employed in agriculture are women."
"They derive a high level of income for farming families by means of field work, shed work, book-keeping, direct marketing and farm holidays, etcetera."
"Farms have now got the message of the European Commission and it does not surprise us very much."
"On the whole, it is having a very negative impact, particularly among women farmers, and I believe that the Commissioner for agriculture, Mr Fischler, felt this when he joined us at our meeting in Berlin."
"Women farmers are refusing to accept Agenda 2000."
"Their criticism is levelled at the increased adjustment of agricultural market policy and price policy to world market levels."
"Income policy and price policy are not sufficiently balanced, for example, in the high environmental costs, so that within a short time a considerable number of farming families will find themselves in a situation of extreme hardship."
"Farmers - men and women alike - fear the loss of their essential material possessions and their jobs."
"We also find the increased pace of gearing European agricultural policy to the world market quite unnecessary."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report by our honourable friend Mr Cunha includes two particular goals: firstly, the comprehensive approach to farming, and secondly, the ability of farms to survive and adapt, and the strengthening of this ability."
"However, these very two aims are under threat in the geographically disadvantaged regions of the new German Länder due to the Commission's proposals on degression and upper limits."
"In terms of the ability to survive and adapt, no one in Europe has anything to teach East German farmers."
"Between 1945 and 1992 these farmers had to deal with three periods of short-term radical restructuring."
"They managed that."
"In the last period of restructuring, however, 80 % of the population involved in agriculture were eliminated from agriculture within two years."
"This was necessary."
"Commissioner, particularly in these regions, there is simply no alternative to the farm structures which have survived - mainly cooperatives - that is, no alternative which could guarantee comprehensive management, which is what we all wish for."
"An improved, modern agricultural policy, which we all desire, must not further destabilize this form of management, as this would be contrary to the European Union's new employment policy."
"Mr President, I should like congratulate Mr Cunha on his excellent report, which does not fall into the trap of using the same tactics as the Commission at the Council of Ministers, that is, it does not divide in order to rule."
"It effectively addresses the concerns of the agricultural world."
"Parliament's position is therefore of great importance with regard to the survival of the European agriculture model."
"The Luxembourg Presidency's approach, the definition of the identity of European agriculture as a reference point for CAP reform and the position of European agriculture on the world market, was ratified by the European Council of December in Luxembourg."
"And the model which is emerging from that approach is that of a multi-functional, long lasting, effective agricultural sector spread right across Europe, including less favoured regions, which respects the natural landscape and open spaces, and is capable of responding to consumers' concerns regarding the quality and safety of food."
"Unfortunately, a number of reform measures tabled by the Commission do not take this approach into consideration."
"The proposed price reductions are excessive and unjustified."
"The proposed compensatory aid is inadequate, and will make farmers dependent on benefit. It is also likely to affect the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"The future of compensatory aid, on which the survival of most farms depends, particularly in less favoured regions, is uncertain after enlargement, not to mention the fact, Mr President, that the eco-conditionality of the compensatory payments distorts them and is therefore exaggerated."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Cunha on his very good and timely report."
"I very much welcome the Commission's proposals as a step in the right direction but no one in this Chamber should really be under any illusions."
"This is not a substantive reform of the Common Agricultural Policy."
"It is, as the Commission has said at the beginning of its document, an evolution and an extension of the MacSharry proposals."
"As long as the basic objectives and mechanisms remain in place with the CAP there will be no significant restructuring of agriculture within the EU."
"A significant majority have indicated that a common rural policy rather than a Common Agricultural Policy would bring greater benefits to Europe's rural communities."
"I urge the Commission to re-examine its proposals very closely so as to ensure that Europe's rural communities are not disadvantaged when they must compete for structural funding under the changes when rural areas are included in the new Objective 2."
"Furthermore, although Agenda 2000 purports to adopt a more market-led approach, the proposed payments to compensate farmers for a reduction in price are not time-limited and will do nothing to break the cycle of dependence of European farmers on European subsidies; nor will they address the legitimate concerns of the taxpayer."
"Compensation for a change in market circumstances should be reduced and eventually stopped after a reasonable period of readjustment."
"Given the turmoil of the BSE crisis and the many unresolved issues surrounding food safety and imports from outside the EU, I believe that the Commission should use the opportunity presented by Agenda 2000 to ensure that consumers enjoy the highest level of protection when we enter the next century and that Europe can compete with cheaper non-EU products."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first want to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, and on having moved on very skilfully to set the guidelines for what our future CAP should look like, in view of Agenda 2000, eastwards enlargement and future WTO negotiations."
"My colleagues have already dealt with questions such as price reductions, farmers' participation in the market, getting people to stay in the countryside, and involving young people and women in the sector."
"We still have to see how price reductions affect consumers."
"However, we must prepare ourselves to be on the offensive in the WTO negotiations, in order to defend our agriculture model, reject foreign models, and make the reality of rural life really matter, by protecting our social and environmental situation."
"It is important to implement integral action in the rural zones, going beyond agricultural activity, although that is the basic focus - the crux, I would say. Additional financial means should be provided for other, distinct activities."
"Account also needs to be taken of everything to do with land use, the environment, rural tourism, job creation and the improvement and conservation of our rural and cultural heritage."
"Commissioner, in the spirit of Cork, rural development should be the second pillar of the CAP."
"This reform of yours could and should turn into the common agricultural and rural policy - the CARP."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a real reform of the CAP would mean abandoning once and for all the guidelines introduced in the 1992 reform."
"This has not been done, and for that reason the Commission's proposals in Agenda 2000 can be sure of opposition from farmers and their representative organizations all over Europe."
"A reform of the CAP would in fact have to be comprehensive and cover all forms of agricultural production."
"The Agenda 2000 proposals, however, favour the meat, cereals and dairy sectors, and restrict themselves to a little individual fine tuning of sectors such as olive oil, fruit, vegetables and wine, which are fundamental to the agricultural economies of the southern countries."
"Furthermore, to produce a real reform and overturn the 1992 strategy we would have to give unequivocal support to rural development, defend and above all generalize the application of Community priorities, make a special case of rural development in the world context, give decisive support to young farmers and fight rural desertification, maintain and develop market regulation mechanisms and iron out imbalances between regions, forms of production and farmers of different kinds, giving priority to family farms."
"We appreciate the introduction of these aspects into the report, to which we have otherwise contributed certain amendments in the direction we suggested years ago."
"At the Plenary session we insisted on amendments in favour of the open and universal award of certificates of quality, support for the production and marketing of regional products, the rejection of productivityrelated criteria and most of all the introduction of a clear concept of modulation."
"With these guidelines, and if our amendments were accepted, we should have created a policy framework which the Commission ought to take into consideration, and ought to amend the proposals published in connection with Agenda 2000 in accordance with that policy framework."
"Mr President, the report is noteworthy for two reasons that might seem contradictory: first of all, it can go into meticulous detail and at the same time it provides a broad overview of the future of European agriculture."
"This occurs when the rapporteur combines the economic dimension of agricultural reform with its natural calling, which is related to the sustainable development of the area, the safeguarding of the living conditions of those working there - therefore farmers' income - but especially to the development of regional productions."
"It might again seem paradoxical, but to guarantee the basic principles of the CAP - which today is suffering from a growth crisis, in the sense that it has grown too much - we must go back to the beginning."
"We must move away from the large industrial concerns and return to the old family farm where it all began and where in many areas it is still the best guarantee of continuity."
"The future of agriculture in Europe - in the Europe of today and in the Europe of tomorrow, with an additional ten or so CEECs to take into account - depends on its ability to become the driving force and vehicle of economic and social cohesion, especially in disadvantaged areas where farming is still a challenge and an act of faith."
"I am thinking of mountain areas which are continually threatened by a plague called exodus, especially the exodus of young people attracted by easier incomes in the lowlands;"
"I am thinking of Arctic areas; I am thinking of areas threatened with desertification, the last front of those who do not want to give in."
"That is why I agree with the rapporteur when he says that support for production can be a double-edged sword that can cut the cord of solidarity with the disadvantaged areas, favouring the growth of two forms of agriculture, one rich and one poor, and create a gap between developed regions and regions lagging behind in development."
"In future programming, a series of mechanisms must be guaranteed to regulate interventions and harmonise production in Europe and the Mediterranean."
"These mechanisms must be based on guaranteed income and forms of integration between complementary professions, definitely treating farming as the main profession."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that the common agricultural policy is the fundamental pillar European construction."
"It is, in fact, the only really integrated Community policy."
"What does the Commission propose, in its communication on Agenda 2000?"
"The Commission proposes a complete reform of the CAP and structural policy limited, for budgetary reasons, to 1.27 % of the GNP of Member States."
"With regard to agriculture, its proposals are confined to reducing the prices of arable crops, milk, beef and veal in order to maintain a socalled balance, by providing partial compensation, theoretically enabling farmers to adapt to these price reductions."
"However, at the end of December 1999, the European Union and Member States will meet at the negotiating table of the WTO, and the issues under discussion will, of course, be the reduction of agricultural aid and the almost total withdrawal of Community preference."
"So what proposals has the Commission made with regard to those discussions?"
"None, or rather an increase in compensatory aid, which as we all know will be unacceptable to our various partners. The GATT agreements set a ceiling for this type of aid, so I do not believe that such a rise would be acceptable."
"What strategy is the Commission going to adopt?"
"Will the Commission have enough courage to force our American partners to accept social and environmental clauses, or the ability to do so?"
"Commissioner, European agriculture dates back more than 2 500 years."
"It cannot be compared with agriculture in countries which have existed only two or three hundred years."
"We are going to destroy the rural world by copying them and we will destabilize the regional balance of the whole of the territory of the Member States of the European Union."
"I wish to conclude simply by thanking Mr Cunha, and congratulating him on the excellent draft report he submitted to us, but which unfortunately was amended extensively by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, so that it became slightly less coherent."
"Mr President, my honourable friends, it would of course be a very attractive prospect now to go into detail on the observations made by my honourable friend Mr Cunha, and on his report."
"In view of the late hour, however, I will speak only briefly."
"I will therefore distribute to you the statement I had prepared and at this juncture I will restrict myself to a few points which I feel to be important."
"First of all, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, and the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for this report."
"It was with great interest that I read it and I also agreed with many points in the report."
"However, I would have placed emphasis on quite different areas."
"Allow me to illustrate."
"One of the main aims of the Commission is of course to consolidate the European agriculture model, but in a changing world consolidation cannot mean limiting oneself to consolidating what already exists."
"To do so would be to serve agriculture and our farmers badly."
"The common agricultural policy must be adapted and reformed because in the coming decades our agriculture will be faced with more and more new realities, new conditions and new challenges."
"Only thus can we guarantee the continued existence of the European agriculture model."
"This is exactly what the Commission is aiming to achieve by means of these proposals."
"Let us speak openly: I have not yet seen an alternative to the Commission's proposals which is consistent, credible and capable of consensus, at least not where longer-term prospects are concerned."
"A distinguishing feature, if not the distinguishing feature, of European agriculture, is its multi-functionality, as stated in the report."
"This involves firstly the economic dimension."
"Today we basically have the choice between two different paths: we could return down the path of production using strict volume limits, but the question is whether this is really an attractive programme for the future, especially in view of a comprehensive agricultural system, enlargement towards the East and the new world trade round."
"The strategy which the Commission proposes goes in another direction."
"It is based on improving the competitiveness of domestic agricultural products, both internal and external, a task entrusted to the Commission at the Luxembourg Summit."
"This brings me to a point in the report, regarding which I must warn against any false impressions."
"The price reductions proposed by the Commission are not an end in themselves."
"They are the means to improve the competitiveness of our products and thus to create new sales potential."
"Reduction of institutional prices must take place in such a way that, even in the case of fluctuating market prices, there is enough scope to maintain a market presence."
"From this point of view, I do not believe that the price reductions proposed by the Commission can be regarded as excessive."
"In future, intervention should serve only as a safety net in case of significant price collapses."
"In relation to the arrangement of direct payments, I cannot confirm, on the basis of the available analyses, that the proposal for a single form of aid for cereal and oilseed would make the production of oilseed crops uneconomic in most of the EU."
"In addition, the relationship between the beef and veal sectors is in our experience not nearly as direct as the report seems to assume."
"What surprised me is that there would be a deviation from the general rule in the milk sector."
"It states that the level of compensatory payments should be allocated in accordance with regional or individual productivity."
"It must be obvious that such an approach would have not insignificant redistribution effects."
"At a later point the report seems to suggest the increased use of direct payments for redistribution."
"If this is the wish of Parliament, it must be stated loud and clear."
"I have taken note of the clearly expressed wish to considerably increase area subsidies and subsidies related to service to society in comparison to production-related subsidies."
"After all, I see a confirmation of the Commission's view in what the report says about subsidiarity and decentralization."
"Subsidiarity - yes; decentralization - yes; renationalization - no!"
"I am pleased to discover that the report follows a similar guideline to that of the Commission as regards expanding policy on rural areas and environmental protection in agriculture into a solid, second pillar of agricultural policy."
"I note that the direction taken by the report in a series of points actually goes much further than the Commission's proposals and that these points refer explicitly to the conclusions of the Cork conference and support a greater financial contribution for rural development on behalf of the Community."
"This possibility exists under the agricultural guideline, provided that the political will is to hand and that the agricultural guideline remains in its current form, a point on which the rapporteur and I are in agreement."
"I also share the opinions expressed in the report in the areas of food quality and food safety."
"I find the report - and I can say this here - very encouraging in many points, but it also opens up many issues which we will disagree on."
"I am grateful for both these facts and am already looking forward to further discussions on this and to our continued cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"2000: Economic and social cohesion"
"The next item is the report (A4-0210/98) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on Agenda 2000, Part 1, Chapter II: Economic and Social Cohesion (COM(97)2000 - C4-0523/97)."
"Mr President! Economic and social cohesion in Europe is facing its second test within a short period of time."
"Whenever the EU integration project is facing a severe test, an attempt is made to put cohesion policy aside, although this is precisely what has made the European single market a success."
"Harmony and uniform development are prerequisites for stability."
"For this reason it is imperative that the large export countries, who owe their profits to the single market concept, be involved, at least in some very small way, in realizing the European social model."
"We must not allow fate to decide whether people within the European Union are numbered among the winners or the losers."
"I would like to say very clearly once again: anyone wishing to terminate the EU's solidarity project is attacking the very heart of the integration process."
"We reject outright any net contributor discussions, as these deny the basics."
"On the other hand, it should certainly give us food for thought that, despite considerable financial expenditure, we have not succeeded in overcoming the divide between rich and poor regions."
"Unemployment in the ten poorest regions is still seven times higher than in the ten richest regions."
"This split economic development is now continuing in rich regions, forming islands of prosperity and cutting right across society."
"The human tragedy of mass unemployment, poverty and exclusion are affecting increasing numbers of the population."
"In view of this desperate situation in terms of economic and social cohesion, enlargement to include the ten countries of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus is an enormous challenge, making the structure of politics the key to the EU's ability to enlarge."
"The Commission's revision proposals must not be restricted to concentration."
"The goal of efficiency means that we must above all recognize that traditional economic methods cannot be used to meet the challenges of increasing unemployment and the process of transforming the economies of the Eastern European countries."
"Jacques Delors stated in the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment that such methods needed to be adapted for sustainable development."
"Essentially, we must achieve development models which are based on low consumption of non-renewable resources and achieve a balance between economy, ecology and social development."
"I would like to emphasise once again to the Member States: ""Administrative arrangements are not to be equated with dismantling democracy' ."
"The European Structural Funds grant the local and regional authorities and the social players extensive rights of participation."
"These rights can, however, only be used by the regions in question if the Member States involve them early enough in helping to formulate plans and projects."
"Due to the delay in the Structural Funds Regulation by the Council - the first half of 1999 is too late for planning - we find ourselves in a dilemma in that the principle of participation is laid down in the regulation but cannot take effect because the plans have already been drawn up to ensure that the implementation period could begin on time."
"If we are to take ""Citizens' Europe' seriously, we must succeed in securing the participation of local and regional authorities early enough and to a sufficient degree."
"The situation cannot be simplified by putting together different areas to be supported."
"Thus, Objective 2 in the Commission's proposal seems to simply pass the problem down."
"In my opinion it is the responsibility of the Commission to remove competition at the European level between urban and industrial areas on the one hand and rural areas on the other."
"The report's proposal offers the opportunity to develop transparent procedures and guarantees the rights of participation of those affected in the rural areas and the rights of the European Parliament."
"In this report, Parliament confirms once again its determination to support the euro region at the borders with its Eastern neighbours by means of a joint fund."
"The Agenda provides us with the unique opportunity of setting up this fund in a budget category and under the responsibility of a Directorate-General."
"Why does the Commission continue to refuse to make concrete proposals?"
"I am very pleased that we have succeeded in achieving broad consensus in this report and in adopting it unanimously in the Committee on Regional Policy."
"It is my responsibility, as rapporteur, to ensure that this consensus remains, and it is a unique opportunity for the European Parliament to demonstrate to the Council that we can reach consensus within a very short space of time."
"I thank all those colleagues who contributed to this succès d'estime in the Parliament, and I hope that we succeed in it."
"Mr President, the rapporteur's consensus extends beyond her own committee because, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I think we would go along with most of what her report says."
"So I just want to say that although most of our amendments have not been formally incorporated, most of them have been taken on board implicitly. Basically, our amendments only reflect this House's decision of 4 December 1997."
"So I do not think there is any problem on our part."
"I do want to make two brief comments."
"For one thing, we expected a stronger reaction from the Committee on Regional Policy."
"As we see it, the provisional pre-accession instrument, from the structural point of view, is not a structural fund, ladies and gentlemen, but an alternative Cohesion Fund."
"And that could cause problems in the future."
"It does not have the same mechanisms and aims as the Structural Funds, so we think the candidate countries are still not really being prepared for the Structural Funds. They are going to get used to the idea of a Cohesion Fund, which is a different matter."
"In the general context of the agreement, I should like to mention a point we think is perhaps fundamental."
"We in the Committee on Budgets want a revision clause on the financial result of the structural fund reform - and enlargement, of course."
"But whereas we accept the Commission's hypotheses and figures at the moment, we must point out that if the costs corresponding to pre-accession and enlargement are added to the current figures for the Structural and Cohesion Funds, there is still room for manoeuvre within the 1.27 % ceiling."
"In other words, if the structural appropriations are reduced for the Fifteen, it is not to avoid exceeding the 1.27 % ceiling, but in order to keep it much lower."
"This year, we stand at 1.14 %."
"And I wonder, how many decimal places of GNP are we talking about?"
"What we are really talking about at the moment - it was discussed at Cardiff - are mere pittances, in percentage terms."
"Mr President, I would just like to add that we must be really aware of the economic and political importance of Heading 2 for the process of European political construction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I can but welcome Mrs Schroedter's report."
"It shows awareness of the problem and really gets down to the issues of enlargement."
"It shows that justice has been done to ideas on achieving economic and social cohesion and it shows a political effort to avoid incoherence."
"Enlargement is of course not only an opportunity for positive development but shows us all today, at this early stage, that not all questions of enlargement can be looked at only from an economic point of view, nor will they be a stroll in the park."
"Basically, all motions for a resolution, all resolution issues of 4 December are to be found again in the Schroedter report."
"My concern is that we need to strike a balance between the areas of infrastructure, transport, environment and human resources in order to achieve cohesion."
"This must be regarded as unilateral."
"It must be done as a single unit and this must be discussed."
"Of course, the role of the social partners is also important in this context, a topic which was broached here as well."
"Without the social partners we cannot achieve ratification in the developing countries, in the countries which will be joining."
"We need instruments for this and thus we must reorganize PHARE in order to be of significant assistance."
"All of this must be done."
"Thus, for me it is still a point for discussion."
"The new definition of Objective 2 is also very important."
"I would just like to point out that the combination of industry and rural areas could represent an opportunity for the future."
"I would also point out that in the three regulation proposals shortly to be under consideration, dealing with instruments of structural policy for preparation for accession, there is sufficient time for discussion in order to create a plausible framework for the whole area and to do justice to what we want to achieve, which is a homogeneous enlargement to include the countries of the former Eastern bloc."
"Mr President, I welcome today's debate on the Schroedter report on the Agenda 2000 chapter on economic and social cohesion as a solid basis on which to launch Parliament's more detailed and comprehensive work on the regulations governing the Structural Funds."
"As Mrs Schroedter said, there was a unanimous vote in the Committee on Regional Policy but I think she would also admit that was as a result of very substantial amendments tabled by many political groups, and, indeed, we have much more work to do in this area."
"In response to Mr Colom i Naval, I would say that now is not the time to deal with the very detailed regulations in the Structural Funds: we will look at them when we draw up specific detailed reports."
"This is a timely debate, following on from last week's discussions under the British presidency in the Informal Council in Glasgow and the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, and in the light of today's very topical discussion at the Cardiff Summit on the progress report on Agenda 2000, prepared by the British presidency to identify those areas where a consensus exists in the Council."
"Therefore, in the light of these discussions, I wish to take some time to highlight a potential approach that my group will be taking during the reform process."
"There is no doubt that this reform of structural and Cohesion Funds represents the most significant changes in the last ten years with a view to meeting the challenges of enlargement and EMU."
"Enlargement will surely offer opportunities to our regions but we will want to ensure that the proposals presented by the Commission match our objectives and priorities as socialists, namely to continue the Delors legacy of promoting jobs, sustainable growth and the competitiveness of our regions and the central objective of economic and social cohesion of the Treaty to enable all citizens, regions and Member States to participate on an equal footing."
"The Union's benefits must be at the forefront of our policy process."
"This is just as much about creating equality of opportunity as removing the disparities between poorer and wealthier regions."
"We should be clear about the internal challenges we face: one in five of Europe's youth is out of work, unemployment among women is consistently higher than among men, long-term unemployment persists as a scourge of modern society."
"The reform process must, therefore, combine fairness with affordability and durability, with more simplification and efficiency."
"It must be fair in order to ensure we give priority to our poor regions without abandoning those problem regions going through the process of economic and social restructuring in wealthier Member States."
"Solidarity, if it is to enjoy mass support, must be a two-way, and not a one-way process."
"Subsidiarity and decentralization must be the cornerstone of our future policies to ensure that our regional policies are relevant to the needs and interests of local communities."
"I would, therefore, like to welcome the decision that Parliament should be fully associated with the reform process."
"We welcome the interinstitutional agreement and wish to see it signed and sealed under this presidency."
"We have had a positive letter from Robin Cook, the President-in-Office, but we need to move forward now on the more fundamental items."
"Finally, I wish to raise some areas where we need to consider the Commission's proposals in more detail: efficiency, of course, is fundamental to ensure the better use of funds but if the efficiency reserve leads to more red tape and bureaucracy and an increased monitoring role for Commission staff, then I fear that all we will be doing is employing more private consultants in order to monitor those processes."
"So we need to look very carefully at how that reserve would work."
"I would be in favour of looking at an innovation reserve with the appropriate procedures of decentralization and subsidiarity."
"We will be judged by our citizens on how we handle the challenge of reform."
"Only when the EU is seen to be contributing to the solution of major problems in society, such as poverty and unemployment, can we expect to enjoy their support and ensure the credibility of the Union and its policies and institutions."
"My group will take this challenge seriously and we look forward to cooperating with the Council and the Commission in improving the Agenda 2000 proposals to gain support from the public."
"We sincerely hope we will be given the opportunity of sharing in the executive powers - in a spirit of codecision, I might add."
"In this way we can only add to the democratic legitimacy of the reform process."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for her willingness to cooperate."
"She made a significant contribution to the quality of the report."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party I would like to note the following: the Structural Funds must adjust their support objectives in accordance with the objectives of the treaty and the tasks of the Community."
"This includes inter alia the balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and of social protection, equality between men and women, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among Member States."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be considered to a high degree in this context, as must the financial framework."
"Under no circumstances must enlargement be used to reduce the upper limit of 0.46 % of Community GNP for structural spending or that of 1.27 % for total expenditure."
"In my view, countries participating in monetary union can no longer receive additional support from the Cohesion Fund."
"Moreover, solidarity does not mean taking more assistance than necessary."
"Thus, for Objective 1 the 75 % threshold of per capita GDP must be adhered to rigidly."
"I therefore welcome a transitional period for regions currently eligible for aid within the framework of Objectives 1, 2 or 5b."
"The new Objective 2 is, unfortunately, not logical, Madam Commissioner. It is and remains a scrambled objective."
"80 % of EU citizens live in towns, and if rural areas become increasingly disadvantaged in terms of EU support the relationship will deteriorate further."
"This means that migration from rural areas to the towns will increase even further."
"There are two possible ways to improve the Commission proposal."
"The first is an independent objective for rural areas and the second is a subdivided objective with two separate budget lines."
"The criteria must be capable of being extended and weighted by the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Under no circumstances must the planned concentration of funding hold the Member States back completely from determining the level of assistance they are to receive."
"The upper limit of the de minimis rule must therefore be raised considerably."
"Aid from Objective 3 must be flexible and easily applicable."
"The reduction of Community initiatives to just three is to be welcomed. But PHARE-CBC funds previously earmarked for cooperation with Interreg cannot under any circumstances be used at the borders between the CEECs."
"SME assistance must be increased but, even more importantly, it must be simplified, Madam Commissioner."
"The 10 % level for reserve funds is too much."
"In this way, the Commission is attempting to gain greater influence because in the end it also determines the use of these reserve funds."
"In my view, this is a clear violation of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I would first like to tell the rapporteur, Mrs Schroedter, that she has produced a good report on Agenda 2000."
"I am not going to go into the details of the future debate on the Structural Funds, but I must repeat that economic and social cohesion is a fundamental aspect of European construction and, in that sense, we should value the role of the Member States and the regions, and the contributions they should make, together with the EU, towards directly applying the principle of subsidiarity."
"I think the desired simplification of the Structural Funds is a good thing, with a large Objective 2. Study is needed to find the best way to include rural areas, industrial areas in decline, urban areas and fishing areas, with a proper application of the principle of subsidiarity in all cases."
"Consideration should also be given to the role that regions with a legislative capacity can play in the implementation of these Objective 2 development frameworks."
"In that sense, I do not think a single regulation would be valid without taking account of how each Member State will decide to apply this Objective 2, according to its internal organization."
"I think the suggestion about Objective 3 is very important, especially in view of the EU's biggest problem at the moment - unemployment."
"And all the thinking in that area should bear in mind the future eastwards enlargement of the EU."
"In that respect, I think it is a good idea for the Interreg Community initiative to also provide funds for the central and eastern European countries, but without compromising the funds which go to the current EU Member States."
"Finally, I would like to say that it is always good for the Structural Funds and the allocated resources to be implemented efficiently, so I hope it will be possible to determine a good approach, to distribute these EU funds as efficiently as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is the last opportunity that this House will have to express our positions on the broad principles of the reform of the Structural Funds before we start to examine the detailed legislative proposals in the coming months and it is therefore an extremely important report."
"From the outset I would stress that economic and social cohesion is an enshrined principle now and for the future."
"It is not about the very short-term fortunes of any national political party for electoral purposes."
"We have an obligation to be serious about our contribution to the future development of the Union and our ambitions for a better way forward have got to meet the expectations of all the citizens of the European Union."
"Broadly speaking, I am in agreement with the Schroedter report."
"There are, however, a couple of points that are of particular concern to me."
"I am in total agreement with, and strongly support, the Commission's view that there is no link between EMU participation and eligibility under the Cohesion Fund."
"I would stress to certain colleagues that there is no basis in the Treaty to support such a link."
"Amendment No 25 by Mr Novo Belenguer and others correctly represents this position and I will be glad to support it."
"I can accept the principle of a mid-term review for the Cohesion Fund."
"However, I would find it unacceptable if there were not to be provision for transition arrangements for any Member State that ceases to qualify under the mid-term review."
"It is essential that adequate transition arrangements be put in place for regions such as my country, Ireland, which cease to meet Objective 1 qualifying criteria."
"Transitional arrangements for Ireland must be adequate in terms of the level and duration of funding so as to address our continuing significant developmental needs."
"Whereas the level of funding must in particular meet the needs of the less-developed Irish subregions, it is my view that they should cover the whole country during the entire seven-year period of the next financial framework."
"Building a solid house is a long term investment."
"You do not build a house on foundations that have not been consolidated."
"Yes, we in Ireland have made rapid progress towards the EU average in GDP but - yes - we still need new significant levels of funding for the period ahead if we are to consolidate our economic progress achieved to date."
"Finally, I do not believe that anyone would seriously contest our aim of reaching a situation in which our higher levels of prosperity are copper-fastened and ensured on a permanent and sustainable basis."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Agenda 2000 caused a great commotion but there is, as yet, no coordination to be seen, as the Member States are rejecting the Commission's script."
"Heated fights for allocation, owners of assets who make their presence felt - and in the midst of all this, we lose sight of what is actually at stake; the great, great settlement with central and eastern Europe."
"But what are the rules of the game?"
"The first is that enlargement is only possible if the agricultural and structural policies are reformed."
"Secondly, some better-off regions are excluded from current aid, and indeed this applies both to Germany and to Sweden or, for example, Spain."
"If the German Länder demand that budgetary risks for the Länder be prevented in the finance regulations, it is recommended that they use the interim deadline of four to six years to guarantee this for themselves."
"Thirdly, unlike the previous speaker, I believe the Cohesion Fund should be dissolved following monetary union."
"However, if the Spanish government and others wish to cling desperately to it, it should be said honestly - and the rapporteur does allow this opportunity - that we cannot in principle deny Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia access to it; this is the logic of the game."
"Those who demand things for themselves also achieve things for others."
"Fourthly, if we are going to haggle about money, then let us do it properly; this would mean clarifying the net contributor debate, particularly as far as Mr Waigel is concerned."
"The justice gap can only be closed on the income side and not on the expenditure side."
"Those in favour of reform must also be in favour of dismantling agricultural subsidies."
"A reduction of the British rebate in agricultural subsidies and a possible move to co-financing would at the same time pave the way for a general corrective mechanism."
"If we adhere to these rules, there will be some kind of coordination and we will have a script which will finally allow us to reach the end of negotiations."
"It calls for an enlarged Europe, enlarged to the scale of the continent, where the first fifteen Member States are committed to raising to their own level the central and eastern European countries, whose average per capita purchasing power is up to five times lower than in the Member States. At the same time, in Cardiff, our intrepid Heads of State have agreed upon one thing only: to pay less, and to receive more, so Europe will take a huge step backwards."
"We have invited them to join us, but at the same time, we see a mote in their eyes, their lack of democracy, when in it is our western democracies that are moribund. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a contemporary version of the torture of Tantalus: the harder we try to reach out to Europe and the benefits it could give our fellow citizens, the more it eludes us."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have less than a year; by then everything must be in place - everything that we want to have discussed and decided in relation to Agenda 2000."
"Less than a year is not much time."
"So we really must set about rolling up our sleeves and getting started."
"I believe Elisabeth Schroedter's report is a good start."
"It provides a great deal of information without anticipating decisions which we have yet to debate intensively."
"I believe this is exactly the right approach."
"In past debates - at this juncture, I would remind you of the plenary session in Brussels - we have experienced what happens if we try to lay down measures rashly or in hasty speculation."
"These cannot be the terms under which we work; instead, we must discuss matters seriously and thus find useful solutions."
"The report provides some guidelines, even if I would not accept in blank everything contained in it."
"There are also further amendments."
"We will vote on it tomorrow."
"Then we will finally have a result."
"But I believe it is important that this step has been taken."
"What is the aim of all this?"
"The aim in developing Agenda 2000 is not only to distribute money."
"It is to achieve a balanced system."
"It is also a question of working together to improve and develop an instrument of aid, and of how we get along together."
"There can be no question of our standing here and saying ""We have received money from the Member States, ' and the Member States saying, ""Give it back to us - we know best how to distribute it.'"
"No, the aim is not to achieve a European added value."
"We must work together on this."
"I believe that in many places we must point out weaknesses."
"In the conflict between globalization and regionalization, it cannot only be a question of bringing as much as possible back and saying to the people at home, ""Do what you want with it, ' and sufficing with that."
"Nevertheless, we will have to examine the Commission's proposals carefully."
"Here, in many places, it is necessary to introduce simplification and the transparency which has been announced."
"We will examine this carefully, as it has been pointed out to us that simplification, for example in partnership or in programming, would, of course, bring with it an increased level of pressure and bureaucracy, which we do not want."
"We will consider this very carefully."
"In my view, our task over the next few weeks and months will be to look at which countries need money and which countries receive it."
"Of course, we must also ensure that this Community instrument is developed into a transparent instrument with which we can work together for the future of our regions."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is easy to agree on principles, certainly when the principles in question make sense."
"Thus, in principle, we happily agree with the Schroedter report and the proposals for the reform of structural policy within Agenda 2000."
"Recognizable areas of concentration instead of spreading funds too thinly, objective criteria for the allocation of EU funds, bottom-up partnership, evaluation, what more could we want?"
"In the interests of those affected, we must want more!"
"Rural areas, which have already been mentioned today, have not yet been given the necessary consideration, at least not in the initial drafts."
"Rural areas must at least be worthy of a subgoal within Objective 2, with guaranteed funding."
"In order to meet with the wide approval of our citizens, for the next round of enlargement we will need the opportunities offered by Interreg and a guaranteed level of Interreg funding for the Union's border regions."
"Indications from Brussels regarding funding constitute better advice than words of concern from various political ultra-peripheral regions."
"Moreover, without upper limits on finance, some so-called net contributors will feel that too much is being asked of them."
"The Schroedter report will meet with broad approval only when we allow room not only for the principles but also for particular interests, and I use the term advisedly."
"Let us work together with the Commission and the Council to achieve a good balance in the coming months, so that we will have a result which meets with broad approval throughout the Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, reforms in EU regional and structural policy have to be able to meet the growing challenges that spring from regional inequality."
"The development of the global economy, mass unemployment, enlargement and EMU are all factors that require a structural policy that will level out differences and create new opportunities."
"EU regional policy must be more adept and flexible in its attention to differing circumstances."
"For example, more flexibility is needed in assessing population cover and national funding, according to the circumstances of the country."
"We have to keep rigidly to the Agenda 2000 timetable for debate."
"The effective implementation of the programmes and the participation by the different parties involved requires sufficient preparation time."
"Large rural areas such as eastern and northern Finand are in a critical situation as far as the future is concerned."
"These areas are suffering acutely from population loss."
"We are now in urgent need of a policy of reform for these regions that will help to bring opportunities for the development of human capital, entrepreneurship based on the new technology, and a diverse array of incentives."
"The focus has to be the creation of permanent jobs locally and the support of local initiative."
"Mr President, I would like to underline the importance of the partnership principle, especially when defining programmes and their methodology."
"I would particularly like to underline the fact that, if the measures for the development of rural regions are not clearly defined and decided, we risk causing great damage to local and regional cooperation."
"Meanwhile, there is another concern that should not be underestimated, and that is the danger that in the new view presented in Agenda 2000 economic and social cohesion will tend to blur the competences and control of the European Parliament."
"If this were to occur, it would truly be paradoxical that at a time when we are faced with the decisive issue of enlargement, the democratic guarantee of the European Parliament would be weakened."
"At the same time, we are of the view that it is useful to facilitate cooperation with non-EU countries through Interreg and PHARE, creating appropriate legal and financial instruments like, for example, common funds."
"We are puzzled as to the actual usefulness of the proposed 10 % reserve mechanism."
"Similarly, we would like to highlight the paltry amount of credits made available."
"Enlargement requires a rational and effective structural policy, in spite of the budget restrictions that are imposed."
"In general, when we look at the innovations of Agenda 2000, we see that the number of Community initiatives is reduced from 13 to 3, that the budget for the Cohesion Fund is only ECU 3 billion, that the eligibility criteria for aid seems simplified; we also see that no major progress has been made in structural policy, which is even more important today because of the new countries seeking membership."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our financial forecasts for the years 2000 to 2006, upon which our cohesion policy depends, will be decided in March next year, according to the Cardiff Summit, after the effects of the German elections have been put into perspective."
"Thus Mrs Schroedter's report, while it is a good piece of work, is merely a preliminary step, although it is imbued with the best of cohesion philosophy."
"But we are bound by circumstances, in the light of the vote a fortnight ago in the European Parliament, which was unexpectedly hostile to the countries that benefit from the Cohesion Fund, to take the matter up again in the form of some amendments to the Schroedter report."
"The vote on these proposals represents a significant test of the present sensitivity of Members of the European Parliament."
"It will indelibly mark out the difference between national selfishness and Community solidarity, between the laws of the market and the ethical imperatives of cohesion, in short between words and actions."
"And let it not be said that the Cohesion Fund is intended to help its beneficiaries to join the euro, and nothing more."
"That is mere sophistry: false reasoning masquerading as sound argument."
"The fact is that the need to keep the Cohesion Fund is even further justified with the coming of the euro."
"Economic geography and history show us that when the market is unified, harmonized, extended and supplied with a single currency there are advantages for the whole, but on the other hand there is also a strong tendency for already existing geographical centres and economic groups to be strengthened, to the detriment of the most peripheral and outlying regions."
"These are real risks which should not be underestimated; on the contrary, the Fifteen should be working to counteract them."
"How?"
"By giving priority to the principle of balance within our territory and to policies of cohesion."
"This is why the Cohesion Fund must be kept and why, in short, it would be a very serious mistake to abolish it."
"The European Parliament, which over the years has championed the principles of solidarity, would seriously compromise its reputation if it did not now unequivocally keep faith with its traditions and the values on which it is built."
"Madam Commissioner, the efforts of the European Union to achieve economic and social cohesion within its borders must continue unabated while there remain substantial inequalities at both regional and national level and while such tendencies are, in certain cases, on the increase, despite the significant steps that have been taken towards achieving nominal convergence."
"This situation, together with the imminent enlargement towards countries of central and eastern Europe, places increased responsibilities on the European Union, which impose a new way of dealing with social and structural policies in the future."
"Against such a background, the first substantial issue to be raised is that of the structural perspectives, which is an issue which must be clarified as soon as possible so that we know what money we will have at our disposal, in order that we can determine in a responsible way the relevant policies."
"This is an issue which, of course, belongs chiefly within the powers of the Council."
"The Community budget, up to 1.27 % of Community GDP, of which 0.46 % is allocated to structural policies, may well prove to be inadequate in the future to cover satisfactorily both existing and new countries and policies."
"On no account must enlargement turn out to be at the expense of current Member States, especially the poorest."
"That is why the financial perspectives must be re-examined, before the first wave of enlargement, with a view to dealing with the new requirements and developments which will have arisen or which, by then, will have become more apparent."
"The regions of Objective 1, which are those with a per capita GDP lower than 75 % of the Community average, in other words the poorest and those with the greatest needs, must continue in the future to receive two-thirds of Structural Fund resources, as recommended moreover by the Commission."
"The share of financing for these regions must remain high, while they must be even higher for island regions due to the special problems they face, as recognised moreover by Article 130a of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The implementation of an integrated policy, based on this provision in the new Treaty, is also necessary for the islands, in order to deal with the special problems that arise because of their island status."
"It is also right to reduce the Objectives from six to three as well as the Community initiatives from fifteen to three, for the purposes of simplification and focus."
"Finance equivalent to 5 % of resources also seems logical to me but there certainly needs to be a doubling of resources for innovative actions which, precisely because of their pioneering and guiding nature, may prove to be especially advantageous."
"I would like to finish by stressing that in the future there must still be a Cohesion Fund for the financing of large structural projects in the fields of transport and the environment, in which countries with a per capita GDP lower than 90 % of the Community average must once again be able to participate."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Schroedter on her report, and tell her that the best thing about the report - and she should not be upset by this - is that it is indebted to the proposals made by the Commission, and specifically the Commissioner here with us today, Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"This report is in line with the Commission proposals, and that is exactly where its strength and positive nature lie."
"It has another positive aspect: it is going to allow us to go back over the incredible events of the last part-session when, because of a series of mistakes, a conclusion was reached on the Cohesion Fund which does not represent the majority view of the House, as we will have the chance to find out in tomorrow's vote."
"I want to ask Mrs Schroedter to please try to educate a certain member of her group a little, because she has certainly taken full account of what the Cohesion Fund is, and what cohesion means. The Cohesion Fund is provided for in the Treaties, should continue to be provided for in the Treaties, and to change it would mean changing the Treaties."
"It cannot be presented as an option for some countries which do not want to give up certain subsidies."
"We are talking about the Treaties, and those countries with less than 90 % of Community income have a continued right to the Cohesion Fund, because that is what is said by the rules of the Fifteen with which we have provided ourselves."
"Mrs Schroedter certainly has understood what cohesion is."
"And cohesion cannot be understood without the fundamental link to the internal market which now, with the single currency, is a full internal market."
"The positions achieved are also the positions achieved by those countries, regions and companies which, in a common market, have enjoyed a situation of privileged competition. That is why cohesion arises: so that this competitive privilege can be borne in mind, and the least favoured regions can be helped."
"Let us be logical when we talk about cohesion, Mr President."
"She certainly deserves those congratulations, because of her hard work in preparing her report and, especially, because of the efforts she has made to seek compromises between the various political groups. These compromises have meant that this report was approved almost unanimously in the Committee on Regional Policy."
"Among the report's conclusions, I would like to emphasise - because it is so important for cohesion policy - the express recognition that two-thirds of the total Structural Fund resources should be allocated to the Objective 1 regions. Only by concentrating resources on the least favoured regions can we reduce regional disparities within reasonable timescales."
"I think the reference in recital A to the Cohesion Fund's important role in promoting the harmonious development of the Community is very positive. However, not only do I think the statement in recital L should be incorporated into the conclusions, but I also think it needs to be worded in such a way as to clarify the debate currently underway, in view of the vote on the Berend amendment in the last Brussels part-session."
"These amendments support the maintenance of a Cohesion Fund after the year 2000, without prejudging the final position of the European Parliament, which will be expressed in the context of the legislative procedure on the Cohesion Fund. They allow this House to begin the debate with the necessary composure and respect for the Treaties, in an atmosphere of parliamentary calm, unaffected by electoral stances arising from the important national elections underway."
"I think that, as the report underlines, it is very important to reclaim powers for the bodies responsible for European regional policy, with respect to the programming and monitoring of programmes within the framework of rural development, otherwise the coherence which should characterize all aspects of regional policy will be lost."
"I conclude by thanking our rapporteur again for her excellent work, which will serve as a guideline for the Committee on Regional Policy in its task over the next few months, in analysing the highly reasoned and balanced legislative proposals presented by the Commission."
"Madam Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we must be careful - in the context of the solidarity always mentioned in connection with economic cohesion of the Union - not to repeat the fairytales told to us by the Council and other powers, sometimes even the Commission."
"On the one hand, we cannot plan, with the approval of all Member States, an enlargement of the kind that is obviously planned here - the poorest and most sizeable enlargement which Europe's history of integration has ever known. On the other hand, we cannot believe that we will have to pay less than in the past or indeed that we can maintain existing structural policies and Member States' incomes as they were in the past."
"Our fellow citizens will not accept this and indeed it is also an insult to our own intelligence."
"Thus, it will be a question of proper distribution."
"In this regard, some colleagues are indeed right."
"We not only have a north-south conflict in the area of cohesion but also, to a certain extent, a north-north conflict."
"Here I must point out to some of the preceding speakers that there is no point in only considering structural policies as such."
"Of course, no later than October, when the Commission adds up the income side of Agenda 2000 and says that this country has to pay so much and that country has to pay so much, we will have a new debate on expenditure in category 2 of the structural policies."
"For this reason it is also important that we include, for example, expenditure on agriculture."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development cannot make its own decisions on this and say that none of it is its concern."
"I am directing this particularly at our Bavarian representative here."
"Of course, this is to be included as, if we have major new tasks ahead of us, and that is a certainty, then it poses a challenge to our solidarity."
"Then it will no longer be possible for the second richest country in this Union to be a net beneficiary because of this - crazy - agricultural policy; then our fellow citizens of the Union will no longer accept such a policy."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to express my approval of the priorities of this report, which owes its current form not least to the cooperation of the rapporteur and to many changes in committee."
"We are in favour of the proposed concentration of funding for development and structural adjustment of underdeveloped regions (Objective 1), as proposed by the report and by the Commission."
"We support the strict application of the criterion of a regional per capita GNP, expressed as purchasing power parities of level NUT 2, less than 75 % of the Community average, for the selection of future Objective 1 regions."
"Two-thirds of the structural funds appropriations for Objective 1 do in fact guarantee the necessary concentration of funding for the regions most in need."
"In this context, however, I would remind the Commission not to deviate from the strict application of this criterion."
"In simple terms this means that all Objective 1 regions are entitled to receive equal funding."
"In view of the regional orientation of Objective 1, the criterion relating to national welfare is not suited to equal treatment."
"On the contrary, it creates new inequalities and thus, we reject it."
"Like the report and the Commission, we are in favour of financing European structural policy while maintaining the ceiling of 1.27 % for own resources and the percentage of structural funds at 0.46 %, and also of not deviating from these central points in the context of enlargement."
"As far as the Cohesion Fund is concerned, we agree with the rapporteur that after the year 2000, we should have a Cohesion Fund as support for reaching the convergence criteria."
"However, we do not want the continuation of the existing one, as currently provided for by Agenda 2000."
"A translation error relating to this will be corrected tomorrow by means of a corrigendum."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, economic and social cohesion is an essential objective of European construction, and just as important as monetary union or the single market. If the effort towards cohesion has been important, the economic data show that so far it has not been enough."
"To make sure that people understand what we mean, we are not talking about charity here, or about indefinite, indiscriminate subsidies."
"Cohesion is synonymous with solidarity and fairness in the different efforts of the various European regions to achieve competitiveness."
"Cohesion is the other face of the single market and monetary union. In that context, and in the context of enlargement, economic and social cohesion will be needed more than ever, and rightly so."
"Monetary union and the single market will mean that investment is centred on the rich countries more than ever."
"Enlargement will make solidarity even more necessary, when cohesion has still not been achieved among the Fifteen."
"So the Cohesion Fund is an essential instrument."
"The Cohesion Fund is needed by the current Member States which have a per capita GNP of less than 90 % of the Community average, as established by the Treaty, regardless of whether or not they join monetary union."
"Lastly, the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries attached to the Schroedter report mentions an injustice which I want to underline: the inadequate structural attention paid to the fisheries sector in Agenda 2000."
"The special nature of coastal regions, which are generally peripheral and highly dependent on fishing, with no easy employment alternatives, means they need the structural support of a horizontal regulation to include the whole European coastline, to give these zones the concrete actions they so badly need and should have, but which do not exist at the moment."
"So I conclude by congratulating the rapporteur and calling for real improvements in economic and social cohesion in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and say that Agenda 2000 puts a brake on the development of cohesion policy with a cut in the percentage of the expenditure objective decided in Edinburgh from 0.46 to 0.39 %, considering that heading 2 of the budget must give up ECU 7 billion to pre-accession."
"That is why we are calling first of all for the creation of a new budget heading - heading 7 - a reflection on the 1.27 % that should be revised when the dates and numbers concerning enlargement are known, and a distribution of funds that leaves the cohesion policy the way it was decided, without reducing it to a kind of privilege for a few."
"I actually wonder whether Agenda 2000, in wanting to concentrate the distribution of funds as much as possible, has taken into account the actual needs of regions or whether it has blindly chosen a figure as the maximum criterion."
"I also have doubts as to the choice of per capita GDP as an absolute reference."
"This figure should be examined thoroughly so that it accurately reflects the socio-economic condition of a region, otherwise, we will find ourselves with obvious distortions of reality like, for example, in the case of the island regions."
"How does a Eurostat parameter show the major difference that exists between the 76 % achieved by an island region and the 76 % achieved by a region on the mainland?"
"Several items in the chapter on cohesion policy in Agenda 2000 leave me puzzled, beginning with the 10 % reserve."
"I will just say here that I would like to see some rethinking of the Cohesion Fund as soon as possible so that in the near future it is not eliminated but regionalized."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the report and the resolutions which are critical and constructive and offer a further opportunity for discussion of Agenda 2000 in the European Parliament."
"I would like to emphasize in particular the broad agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission, which is very positive, especially as regards the significance of economic and social cohesion, but also as regards common goals such as sustainability, combating unemployment, increasing the competitiveness of the regions, the importance of human resources and equality of opportunity."
"We are starting to see some progress in the Council too."
"The British Presidency has gone to great lengths in recent weeks, not only in the Council working parties but also in the informal Council in Glasgow, to initiate a first political discussion on the reform of the Structural Funds."
"Perhaps the most important message from Glasgow is, in my view, that there was no fundamental opposition."
"The political philosophy of the Commission's proposals was broadly confirmed."
"It is also significant that the Ministers accepted the connection between simplification and decentralization on the one hand, and increased accountability on the other."
"But on this issue - as several speakers said - considerable discussion is, of course, still required."
"Allow me to clarify the following once again in relation to the balance of the overall package."
"Firstly, enlargement will not be at the expense of the poorest regions."
"On the contrary, genuine Objective 1 regions will be the beneficiaries of this reform."
"I would specifically mention, in this regard, that the existence of the Cohesion Fund and adjustment in line with the Stability Pact are part of the Commission's overall proposal."
"Secondly, concentration efforts are distributed equally and fairly among all Member States and are not at the expense of either rural areas or other problem regions."
"Thirdly, the pre-accession package contains an attractive offer for those states wishing to join and does not place excessive strain on the current Member States."
"Allow me to say, regarding your doubts on the financing of enlargement, that Agenda 2000's overall package is financed cleanly."
"However - and I would emphasize what was said here - the proposals on the reform of more important Community policies and on the gradual inclusion of applicant countries form one unit."
"One is not possible without the other."
"The applicant countries are also required not to allow their efforts to achieve the Community acquis to diminish."
"If all participants proceed rationally, enlargement can be achieved without additional cost to the European taxpayer, even if growth should prove to be lower."
"In addition, when discussing finances we should not forget the advantages of enlargement, politically and in terms of security, but above all for democracy and economic progress."
"I believe that we are not exactly giving a welcoming impression to those Members who view accession to the Community as a way of belonging to a democratic system which guarantees peace."
"With regard to your request that a single financial instrument be provided for the pre-accession strategy, I would point out that the Commission, in accordance with the instructions of the Luxembourg European Council, has proposed three financial instruments."
"Because of the different legal bases, one would not, after all, simplify things for us any more than the attempt which we have now made, which is to try to make the process as uniform as possible by means of the coordination regulation and the functioning of the three regulations."
"You, like many Member States, are in favour of a close interlocking of the pre-accession instrument with Interreg."
"I would point out that it is not sufficient, in the area of cross-border activities, to restrict ourselves to ISBA; instead, we should place emphasis on Interreg, PHARE-CBC."
"Moreover, PHARE will continue to be responsible for introducing regional policy in the accession countries by means of small projects and institution building."
"In continuing PHARE-CBC, the Commission considers it necessary, in the context of cross-border cooperation and in contrast to the decisive ""No' of the draft resolution, to devote greater attention to the Eastern borders; this is also linked in with the pre-accession strategy."
"However, and here we are in agreement, this must not result in the Western borders being neglected."
"Strengthening cross-border cooperation is of particular importance, not only for acceptance of enlargement towards the east but also for purposes of introducing the procedures and substance of regional policy."
"Partnership and an integrated approach are the innovative elements of the new Structural Funds regulation."
"I thank you for the support of the European Parliament for the growth of this partnership."
"However, it surprises me that after years of discussion about the necessity of integrated regional development strategies, the integrated approach should suddenly be called into question."
"And yet all the experiences summarised in the cohesion report show that structural policy was particularly successful in all places where infrastructural measures, support of private investment and the development of human capital were components of a uniform regional policy."
"I would consider it to be dangerous if we were to end up with fragmented activities and a sectoral patchwork, which would be inconsistent with an integrated regional development strategy and thus particularly with efficiency of aid."
"Moreover, one programme per region is a considerable simplification which, nonetheless, in no way excludes the possibility of a detailed consideration of various problem areas or an objective examination of rural areas."
"I considered your request for a subdivision of Objective 2 into two subgoals - or indeed the creation of an independent goal - to be counterproductive."
"It is precisely this competition between town and country that we wish to overcome by means of a regional development strategy, Mrs Schroedter."
"There can be no question, dear Mr Schiedermeier, of the rural areas being disadvantaged."
"Looking to the future, that is first of all the application of Objective 2 in line with the principle of subsidiarity, with the opportunity for countries and regions to select a considerable number of the areas, and the horizontal support in Figure 3, goodness knows this cannot in any way be seen as neglect of rural areas."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament's proposal for a performance reserve is approved at least in principle, and hope that we can still dispel your scepticism by means of range and feasibility."
"This also applies to the Commission's proposal to create incentives for good financial management of the programmes."
"I agree that we must yet discuss this critically but I would ask you not to allow yourselves to be affected by particular ministerial interests."
"The Austrian Presidency is determined to have the main points of the reform ready for judgement before the Council Summit in Vienna so that the whole package can be adopted early in 1999."
"Here I hope for the active support of the European Parliament and ask you to focus all your efforts on this and not on an interim regulation."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Could you inform Commissioner Fischler's cabinet that mobile phones are not allowed in this House."
"It is discourteous to Members and interrupts the debates."
"Thank you, Mrs McCarthy."
"We have all noted your remark."
"That includes the Commissioner, of course."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"Common organization of the market in bananas"
"The next item on the agenda is Mr Thomas's report (A4-0220/98), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending (EEC) Regulation No 404/93 on the common organization of the market in bananas (COM(98)0004- C4-0046/98-98/0013(CNS)."
"Mr President, today we are considering a Commission proposal which will bring the European Union banana regime into line with a ruling delivered by the WTO dispute settlement body."
"Although many of us would like to, we are not at liberty to alter the judgment and many of us, myself included, would criticize the way that decision was reached and the method by which the original complaint was taken."
"However, that said, the European Union is required to put new arrangements into place by 1 January 1999."
"The world trade in bananas is a very complex business with many players and conflicting interests."
"I firmly believe that although we must work within the legal framework of our international commitments, our primary objective must be to protect EU producers and those countries to which we have committed our support in the context of the Lomé Convention."
"The provision of quality fruit at a reasonable price is just one aim of the banana regime."
"However, world trade should not be driven solely by economic considerations."
"We have a duty to contribute to the fight against poverty and towards the protection of acceptable social and environmental standards."
"I broadly support the Commission proposals which make as few changes as possible to the existing regime."
"The Commission proposes maintaining the existing tariff quota at its current level of 2.2 million tonnes at the same rate of duty of ECU 75 per tonne with an additional autonomous tariff quota of 353 000 tonnes at a rate of ECU 300 per tonne to take account of an enlarged European Union."
"My main concern with the Commission proposals is that duty-free access to bananas from traditional ACP suppliers up to a ceiling of 857 000 tonnes will continue while at the same time the current licensing system will be abolished and individual countries will no longer be allocated a share of the quota on a country basis."
"The licensing system is one element of the banana regime condemned by the WTO which must be replaced."
"The Commission proposal does not detail how licences will be allocated and this gives rise to concern."
"I urge the Commission to preserve a balance in the supply of bananas on the EU market and to ensure that in allocating a quota they use the best possible statistics which take account of changes in trade flows in recent years."
"It would be totally unacceptable if those ACP countries which have traditionally provided bananas for the EU market and whose economies depend on the revenue they receive from the banana trade lose out when new arrangements come into effect."
"The Lomé Convention refers to individual states and not the ACP as a whole and the WTO ruling recognizes the commitment the EU has made to the ACP states."
"Traditional ACP suppliers also risk losing out as a result of the increasing involvement of American multinationals in banana production in some of the non-traditional ACP states."
"I trust that the Commission will monitor this situation very carefully and bear this in mind when allocating market access."
"I am pleased that in this context the Commission has brought forward proposals for a financial package of ECU 370m to assist ACP banana producers and bridge the competitive gap between the ACP and Latin American bananas."
"Mr Liese is the rapporteur for the Committee on Development and Cooperation for these proposals and they are linked with mine."
"They should be treated as an urgency this week."
"It is important to have a mechanism which will enable ACP states to expand their production."
"I have suggested that the Commission include an expansion coefficient in their calculations."
"It is easy for an Englishman to forget that 17 % of the bananas eaten in Europe are produced domestically."
"I would like to thank my Spanish and Portuguese colleagues for the time they have taken to ensure that I was fully instructed on this fact."
"We discussed EU banana production and its importance to the industry in some of the more peripheral areas of the Union at some length."
"The Commission proposal does not contain any specific measures to favour our own banana producers who stand to lose as a result of the changes to the regime."
"I therefore proposed in my report that the maximum quantity for EU bananas be increased by 15 % from the present level of 854, 000 tonnes to 982, 000 tonnes and that the standard reference income be raised by 20 %."
"In this way we can ensure that EU producers also benefit from the growth in the market."
"The ECU 78m which will be saved as a result of higher duties should be redeployed to facilitate banana production in those regions of the EU such as Madeira, the Canaries and Crete whose economies to a large extent depend on this crop."
"Finally, I would like to make a special mention of Somalia."
"The civil war and severe flooding have devastated the banana industry."
"We have a duty to extend a helping hand to the people of Somalia and ensure that they can rebuild what was a flourishing industry."
"I urge the Commission and the Council to be flexible and show some compassion."
"There is much more I could say about my report."
"I hope colleagues will support it as it was overwhelmingly supported in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union consumes approximately four million tonnes of bananas every year."
"76 % of these are imported from nonEU, non-ACP countries, most of whose plantations are controlled by American companies."
"So far as we know, this form of production, or this way of producing bananas, has no environmental or social concerns."
"Thus, from the point of view of production in the European Union - which, as you know, includes the island of Madeira, which is part of the territory of Portugal - we have been protecting either common production or production in the traditional ACP countries."
"That protection has been provided by subsidies and preferential treatment which is expressed in a special system of import certificates and a customary duty-free import quota."
"That system, as you know, has been challenged by the United States and some Latin American banana producers as an alleged breach of Article 13 of the GATT."
"As a result, the Union has been requested to change the system by the dispute-settling body of the World Trade Organization."
"The Commission has accordingly put forward a amendment to Regulation 404/93 on the common organization of the market in bananas."
"That amendment is the subject of our report."
"Having examined and studied all its aspects, particularly its budgetary implications, the Budgetary Committee essentially agrees to the proposals on the legal side of the matter; however, particularly bearing in mind the resulting implications for its own producers and for traditional ACP producers, the Budgetary Committee has drawn up a series of amendments to the law - which it hopes may be included in the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - the purpose of which is, by means of an annual report by the Committee, to control and keep checks on the financial consequences of the new system and examine the proposed aid framework."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Fischler, the establishment of a European market for bananas in 1993 has had largely positive results: a sevenfold increase in intra-Community flow, convergence and stability of prices, renewed confidence in producer countries and, finally, an increase in the market shares of European operators by comparison with American operators."
"More specifically, of the three great multinational companies which control three-quarters of the world market in bananas, only Chiquita's market share is decreasing, which I have to say is the result of strategic and management errors. Chiquita therefore only has itself to blame."
"However, this company with its colonialist attitude, which is used to getting its own way, by force if necessary, and which has been convicted several times for abusing its dominant position, blames European regulations, and what is more, the American government and certain other countries have followed its example."
"Of course, Chiquita's president has an important political role and great political influence, as he gave over one million dollars to the big political parties during the presidential elections in the United States."
"So, the problem has nothing to do with the principle of liberalization of the European market in bananas."
"The COM has apparently expanded the market."
"The essential problem has something to do with our view of the economy which is opposed to that of the United States, especially when such an important country allows it decisions to be dictated by an utterly unscrupulous company."
"Faced with the WTO rulings, and after having exhausted all other means of recourse, the Union has in fact decided to bring the COM in bananas into line with the rules of international trade."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation accepts the solution proposed by the Commission and amended by the rapporteur Mr Thomas, whom I must thank for having incorporated many of our proposals."
"We accept it because it complies with the 1993 compromises: it respects the interest of the various sources of supply, and takes into consideration the Union's commitments, that is, Community preference and preferential access for ACP countries, pursuant to Protocol 5 of the Lomé Convention."
"In many African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, bananas are the main crop, the only crop to generate exports, the main employer."
"They are the ""single engine' of fragile economies, trying courageously and obstinately to enter the modern world."
"This new regulation will test the Union's political ability to defend its policies and its identity."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating David Thomas, the rapporteur, on his excellent work on this crucial issue of our trade in bananas."
"I also wish to offer an apology, Mr President, to you, Parliament and Commissioner Fischler, for I have to leave immediately after this speech for a bilateral discussion with my Dutch colleague, Jozias van Aartsen, about this dossier and price-fixing generally, before the Council next week."
"After all the hard work that has gone into this dossier, I am optimistic that the Council will be able to arrive at an agreement at our June meeting."
"Today is an opportunity, therefore, for me to express my sincere appreciation to Parliament, David Thomas and all his colleagues for the speed with which this issue, this complex and, as we know, controversial dossier, has been considered."
"Ever since the latest WTO dispute began two years ago, we have accepted that, in the event of an adverse ruling, the Union would have to bring its arrangements into line with those WTO rules."
"The Union committed itself to do that immediately, once the ruling was published."
"We now have until 1 January next year to get the revised system into place."
"That is why we must reach agreement at next week's Council so that there is enough time for the detailed rules to be agreed and implemented before that deadline."
"The revised arrangements will not be as favourable as the present arrangements for the producers in the ACP countries, to whom we have obligations under the Lomé Convention."
"Taking my presidency hat off for a moment, we in the United Kingdom are particularly concerned about the situation of the Caribbean producers."
"Because of our long-standing relationship with the region we are acutely aware of their current dependence on banana production to sustain their whole economy."
"The Council recognizes the importance of bananas, both in terms of exports and employment, for those Caribbean and, indeed, all ACP countries, and for the ultra-peripheral areas of the Union."
"At the same time, we accept that the revisions the Commission is proposing are the best way forward in the very difficult circumstances following the ruling by the WTO."
"It is important, therefore, to reach agreement as soon as possible, both inside the European Union and outside it, too, in order to provide the stability in the market that both producers and traders require."
"Regrettably, while we seem to be moving towards an acceptable deal within the European Union, the signs from some of the WTO complainants are less helpful."
"These countries have, of course, been following the negotiations on the revised arrangements with close interest."
"They claim that what the Commission is proposing is not sufficient to bring the bananas regime into line with the ruling."
"I must say that I find this attitude very disappointing."
"I hope that once the United States and others have a chance to look at what the Council agrees, they will accept that we, working together with the Commission, have found a reasonable way of honouring all our international obligations - that is obligations under the Lomé Convention as well as obligations under the WTO."
"I certainly hope that is so, because the uncertainty created by the ongoing threat of further WTO action would be neither conducive to the proper functioning of the market nor to the ability of ACP and EU growers to adjust to the new arrangements."
"I firmly believe that the proposal represents a carefully judged reconciliation of the Union's obligations under the WTO and its commitment to the ACP countries under the Lomé Convention."
"I am determined to reach agreement in the June Agriculture Council, and I am most grateful for the European Parliament's helpfulness in making this objective possible."
"I once again apologize for having to leave."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Thomas, for his report on the reform of the common market organization in bananas."
"The starting point which made it necessary to reform those points of the common market organization in bananas which regulate trade with third countries is well known."
"I would like to add at this point that the WTO rules do not affect internal Community rules; for this reason they do not need to be changed."
"Nine major series of questions stand out from among the large number of amendments."
"The first problem concerns autonomous tariff quotas and the balance sheet."
"In the Commission's view, the relevant amendments do not take into account the supply requirements of the enlarged Community of Fifteen."
"We must also ensure that we fulfil the valid expectations of those traders who previously had privileges."
"I would also like to note that each increase in autonomous tariff quotas benefits non-traditional ACP countries and that EU producers always profit from an increase in consumption as their production quantities are not limited."
"The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 11, 15, 23, 27, 28, 30, 31, 46 or 53."
"The second problem concerns the regulation on deficiency payments."
"The Commission proposal ensures that the regulation is in line with the WTO provisions, which nonetheless do not affect internal Community rules."
"Thus, in the Commission's view, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to change the deficiency payments regulation."
"I would like to emphasize, however, that the income guarantee for EU producers is always granted, without full compensation, regardless of the actual market price."
"Amendments Nos 5 to 8, 10, 21, 22, 24 to 26, 48 and 51 therefore constitute a problem for the Commission."
"As far as the ACP suppliers are concerned, a subject dealt with in Amendments Nos 3, 6, 9, 36, 48, 55 and 57, the existing preferences are retained in the Commission proposal."
"We believe that access is gained to the Community by means of the third preamble in the original regulation."
"Special assistance should be laid down in the Commission proposal in the form of a special framework of assistance for the traditional ACP suppliers which, it is to be hoped, will be accepted soon and which was previously the subject of the vote in the urgent procedure."
"Thus, the Commission believes that in this context, changes to our proposal will not be necessary."
"I should add, in relation to Amendments Nos 48 and 55, that the revision of the WTO mechanisms lies outside the scope of this regulation."
"As regards Amendments Nos 14, 28, 45, 50 and 52 concerning non-traditional ACP bananas, in the Commission's view access of non-traditional bananas to the Community market by means of the ECU 200 preference is already sufficiently guaranteed."
"With regard to Amendment No 50, it should be noted that the allocation of 857 000 tonnes applies only to the traditional ACP suppliers and that this fixed provision guarantees access to the Union's market."
"Amendments Nos 16, 17 and 32 refer specifically to Somalia."
"If we were to grant Somalia a special quota, this would clearly be an infringement of WTO provisions, as would preferential granting of licences."
"In any case, Somalia benefits from the overall ACP quota, although it did not sign the last Lomé Convention."
"The next problem area concerns import licences and the licence system."
"A balanced supply is guaranteed by the quotas for third countries and not by the licence system."
"Furthermore, the details of the licence system for bananas and the coefficients of expansion to calculate the number of licences to be allocated every year to each group of traders are decided in the course of the management committee procedure."
"I cannot, therefore, approve Amendments Nos 12, 13, 33 to 35, 44 or 49."
"I will now turn to the question of proper conditions of competition, which I know is very important to many of the Members of this House."
"This question concerns Amendments Nos 1 to 4, 18, 19, 37, 38, 40, 44, 54, 55 and 58 to 60."
"I would emphasize that the Commission is very much in favour of proper conditions of competition and organic production methods."
"In our opinion, the corresponding measures should be taken across the board and not just for bananas."
"This question is currently being discussed by the services concerned in order to clarify the position of the Commission on the issue of proper conditions of competition."
"Thus, I do not wish to pre-empt the results of these Commission discussions."
"Amendment No 29 aims to ensure that smaller suppliers, in particular smaller ACP countries, are not disadvantaged by the introduction of tariff quotas."
"The WTO provisions, however, already offer smaller suppliers higher protection and we will comply with these provisions."
"Thus, in the Commission's view, it is not necessary to change the original wording."
"In the Commission's opinion, there is still sufficient time, before the review at the end of 2005, for the regulation to prove that it is fully workable and for its efficiency to be tested."
"For this reason I cannot accept the amendments which suggest different limits for the duration of the regulation or for the review."
"The Commission welcomes the European Parliament's constructive cooperation in this extremely difficult and sometimes emotional subject, which is of the utmost importance both within the EU and from an international point of view."
"The Commission's caution regarding the amendments tabled is linked to the fact that we must strive to avoid a second WTO panel in this matter, as this would certainly cause considerable harm to the standing of the European Community and its institutions."
"Thank you, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is questions to the Commission (B4-0474/98)."
"Having welcomed Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, and once she has got settled, I invite her to reply to Question No 45 by Richard Corbett (H-0501/98)"
"Subject: Money-laundering and transition to the single currency"
"Article 3 of the 1991 Council Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money-laundering establishes an identification requirement for customers involved in any transaction amounting to ECU 15 000 or more."
"Will this be applicable to monies changed from national currencies to the euro?"
"If not, why not?"
"If necessary, will the Commission put forward proposals to ensure that the transition to the euro provides a unique opportunity for nullifying the value of large sums of money in the hands of criminal gangs and others?"
"Mr President, the terms of the Council Directive on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering also apply fully to the period of transition to the euro in terms of the exchange of national currencies into the single currency."
"However, according to the Directive, only the laundering of drugs money is prohibited."
"This is why it is planned to extend the ban to a broader spectrum of serious crime."
"According to the Directive, anyone wishing to open a bank or savings account must provide identification and the data recorded regarding identification must be kept for at least five years."
"Moreover, identification is required of all customers concluding transactions of over ECU 15 000."
"This is the case regardless of whether the transaction is carried out in a single operation or whether it spans several operations which are, or appear to be, linked."
"Where there are grounds for believing that customers are not acting on their own behalf, measures must be taken to determine the real identity of the persons on whose behalf those customers are acting."
"If there is any suspicion of money laundering, the identity of the customer must be established regardless of the amount of the financial transaction."
"All suspicious transactions must be reported to the relevant authorities."
"The Commission expects continuous vigilance on the part of credit and financial institutions in the run-up to the changeover to the euro; during this transition, criminals may attempt to channel their cash back into the financial system or to exchange national currencies into other currencies."
"This applies equally to the actual changeover period."
"At the same time, the Commission admits that banks could face further difficulties in exposing suspicious transactions, in particular those under the ECU 15 000 threshold, if a large number of unknown customers appear at their tills."
"The Commission is continuing its internal consultations on the effects the changeover to the euro may have on the fight against money laundering."
"This problem should also be tackled by the money laundering contact committee set up within the framework of this Directive."
"In addition, the Commission will soon be adopting its second report on the incorporation of the money laundering Directive into national law, and expects to present it to Parliament before the summer recess."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for that detailed answer which is quite encouraging."
"But I would urge you to go further and ensure that this unique opportunity is seized."
"The black economy is largely a cash economy."
"Drug dealers and others like dealing in cash rather than through bank accounts because it leaves no trace."
"With the transition to the euro, they will at some point have to convert old notes and coins into euros and, at that point, there is an opportunity for control and follow-up of leads that have perhaps been given from other sources."
"That is why a full and proper application of this directive and the further measures that you refer to is essential so that we can use this occasion to have an extra bonus in the transition to the single currency, over and above the economic benefits that it is going to bring us."
"May I urge you to persevere."
"Mr President, I think we are in agreement on the most important points."
"We will continue to observe matters carefully and will endeavour to respond to potential problems using the proposed new directive."
"However, we must recognise that old banknotes may be exchanged by honest citizens, too, who simply prefer the piggy bank to the High Street bank."
"Thus, above all we must exercise great care in ensuring that banks provide the necessary information and precautions."
"Question No 46 by Georgios Anastassopoulos (H-0542/98)"
"Subject: Commission obligation to monitor the use of Community funds to prevent them being used for Government propaganda"
"Given that the Greek Government is using substantive amounts of Community funding (for instance, Drs. 1.5 billion from the CSF) for Government propaganda and television broadcasts, without respecting the balance of political power in Greece and without giving MEPs the opportunity to inform Greek public opinion, will the Commission say:"
"What Community funds have been used over the last three years for actions of this kind and why has it failed to carry out controls so as to ensure compliance with the principles agreed on with Parliament?"
"Since prefectural and local elections are taking place in Greece in 1998, does the Commission intend, in the light of the accusations which have been levelled, to change the present system so as to prevent the unilateral use of Community funds for government and ministerial propaganda and to highlight the Community contribution to the development of Greece?"
"Mr President, under current Community law the Member States provide appropriate publicity for campaigns assisted by the Structural Funds to draw the attention of potential beneficiaries and of trade associations alike to the opportunities offered by these campaigns, and to inform the general public about the work of the European Structural Funds."
"The operational programme ""Technical aid within the Community support framework for Greece' provides for the implementation of an action plan for publicity and information, for which ECU 6.2 million was made available."
"The national and regional programmes and the Community initiatives also include publicity and information campaigns which are provided with less funding."
"In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Greek authorities are responsible for proper implementation of the tendering and award procedure for information and publicity campaigns."
"Before the invitation to tender was issued, the Commission was consulted on the corresponding specifications."
"The Greek ministry responsible consulted the Commission on the action plan and on the national ""Publicity and information' guide, in order to ensure a consistent approach."
"All actions taken by the Greek authorities in terms of publicity and information are in accordance with the provisions of relevant Community guidance."
"As far as the Commission is aware, the advertisements on television and radio and in the press are politically neutral."
"Also, there have been no complaints so far regarding the campaign introduced in 1997."
"Indeed, Mr Vice-President, as we understand it, the person asking the question played an active role in the campaign himself."
"Again, in the talkshows held in 1997, participation of Members of the European Parliament to represent the major political groupings was secured."
"The Commission will ask the Greek authorities responsible to guarantee ongoing balanced participation."
"As municipal elections are being held in Greece in October 1998, it has been agreed with the Greek government that the publicity and information campaign co-financed by the Structural Funds is to be postponed from August to October in order to forestall any possible criticism."
"I wonder if the Commissioner can be satisfied with the reply she has given me, when there are complaints."
"And I am afraid that the neutrality the Commissioner asserted does not exist."
"Have the Commission services not informed the Commission that use is being made of Community resources for government propaganda and for the promotion of ministers?"
"Let us not confuse certain information action plans in which the European Parliament also participates and in which I co-preside over a committee with Commissioner Marcelino Oreja and give guidelines, and in some of which Greek MEPs have also participated."
"The one has nothing to do with the other."
"Recently Greek MEPs have not been taking part in some of these information programmes and this is one of the aspects of the complaint."
"Mr President, I believe I made it abundantly clear that with the exception of one isolated case we were not aware of any complaints and that we have now taken preventive action."
"I believe this guarantees sufficient impartiality."
"Of course, where such information is concerned, we cannot prevent the relevant Ministers from issuing this information."
"In my opinion, this is even necessary in the interests of correctness of information."
"But allow me to emphasize once again that in Greece, in our opinion, not only is party political neutrality guaranteed; some particularly positive steps have also been taken, for example Commission and European Parliament projects in high schools in Greece, which we consider to be exemplary."
"I wish that other Member States would make this a subject of study in schools."
"In this respect we assume, therefore, that the necessary precautions have been taken to prevent abuse."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Wulf-Mathies. However, I would ask you to spend a little longer on the subject matter of this question, because I have received two requests for the floor, and according to the Rules of Procedure, I am obliged to grant them."
"Mr Hatzidakis has the floor first, for one minute."
"Madam Commissioner, what you have told us is of course constructive, that is, that between the end of August and the end of October the transmission of these ""politically neutral' advertisement slots will stop because, in my opinion, they are not."
"Nevertheless, I thank you personally for this intervention on the part of the Commission, because it really is important, in view of the municipal and prefectural elections in Greece, but over and above that I wish to dwell on two points."
"Balanced participation in these programmes does not exist."
"There was a programme, Commissioner, in which there was not a single representative of the New Democracy Party, which is the second largest party in the Greek Parliament, representing 38 % of the electorate, and we did not have a representative. You must look into that."
"It is interesting to note that, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party on issues of regional policy, I have never been invited to appear on such a programme."
"I do not say this as a personal complaint, but simply so that you can understand the climate and act accordingly."
"I will conclude by asking you this: do you know whether, in the regional business programmes, the regulations concerning the allocation of advertisement slots to advertising companies have been complied with?"
"I am not referring to the national slot, where the regulations have been observed, but to the regional programmes."
"Has the Commission been informed that the regulations have not been complied with there?"
"According to our information, the Community Directives and provisions have been adhered to."
"I would consider it appropriate if you would pass on to us any specific cases of complaints you may have."
"We are not some kind of general remote monitoring organization."
"If there are problems, we look into them individually."
"But I do not believe that a theoretical debate here in Parliament will serve any useful purpose."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, but as I said, I would like you to stay on the same subject because Mr Seppänen also wants to ask you a supplementary question."
"Mr Seppänen has the floor for one minute."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this problem does not just concern Greece. I maintain that in Finland too Commission money and resources are used for purposes of political propaganda that are biassed and ignore the fact that there are various national groups in our country that view critically the decisions that are taken by the EU."
"For this reason, I would turn your attention to the fact that in Finland money is used, for example, for the purpose of bringing the euro into the market, and that money is for the exclusive use of citizens' organizations that have a positive view of the euro."
"Commissioner, do you really believe that only the people who said 'yes' should be allowed to use funds for propaganda?"
"I will say it once again. It is a question of the principle of subsidiarity."
"That means that the Member States are responsible for publicity campaigns within the framework of the general provisions laid down by the Commission."
"If there are specific complaints, we should investigate them."
"I consider it difficult to pursue this theoretical discourse."
"Question No 47 by Charlotte Cederschiöld (H-0556/98)"
"Subject: Excise duties"
"The Swedish Government has introduced a bill (Proposition 1998/97: 100) to extend powers to carry out checks on the payment of excise duties, owing to the increase in cross-border trade in alcohol and tobacco."
"One firm involved in such trade is the German company, Warendienst OCC GmbH, which arranges deliveries from Germany to individuals in Sweden via the Internet."
"It is proposed that the customs service should have the right to seize and, in some cases, confiscate goods if there is a risk that the excise duties will not be paid."
"It is also proposed that customs should be given powers to open private consignments where it is suspected that they contain alcohol or tobacco."
"Does the Commission consider this draft law to be compatible with the principles which govern the internal market and those enshrined in the European convention protecting personal correspondence?"
"Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, the provisions of the internal market do not preclude Member States from exercising domestic controls."
"Community rules expressly provide for excise duties to be charged in accordance with procedure in the Member State concerned."
"Member States can therefore set up their own monitoring systems, provided that these do not give rise to any frontier formalities and are in accordance with the general principles of Community law relating to non-discrimination and proportionality."
"The Commission was not able to examine the proposed amendments in detail but, according to the information available, the provisions in question do not appear to be inconsistent with the principles of the internal market."
"Thank you for your reply."
"However, my question was whether this proposal was compatible with the Convention on Human Rights, since the personal import of tobacco products and alcoholic drinks from other EU countries is a civil right under EC law."
"The law which is to become effective on 1 July gives the customs authorities the right to open private mail and parcels from other EU countries."
"This is not compatible with Swedish constitutional law or with EC law, according to the learned EU specialists who have expressed an opinion."
"Even the Law Council, the Attorney-General and the bar association in Sweden do not think this is allowed."
"The proposal is in fact contrary to human rights, which only allow restrictions on mail confidentiality if the country's economic well-being is threatened, which is not happening in this case."
"Here people would be able to seize and forfeit 'suspected' lorries through a simple court order without impartial, public legal proceedings."
"I would just like to ask whether Commissioner Wulf-Mathies thinks this is compatible with human rights, and whether crossborder trade is not more important than a Member State's right to charge taxes."
"Yes, Mrs Cederschiöld, I am afraid I must disappoint you, as the Community is not a party to the European Human Rights Convention."
"For this reason it is not appropriate for the Commission to comment on whether national legislation is in agreement with individual provisions of the European Convention."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for her reply which clarified matters."
"As I see it, the question put by Mrs Cederschiöld was a contribution to the Swedish election debate since we have an election in September."
"There is one party in the Swedish Parliament which is opposed to the proposal currently before the Swedish Parliament, namely the Conservative Party."
"However, the rest of the parties think the current proposals to maintain the excise duty rules and to maintain the age limits which we have on the sale of alcohol and tobacco are compatible both with the single market and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Besides, these issues can be put to the test."
"An overwhelming majority of the parties in Sweden share the Commissioner's view that the proposals we are discussing here do not conflict with the single market."
"Mr President, the agreement reached between the European Union and the USA at the London Summit on 18 May is a package solution with the realistic prospect of a lasting settlement of the disputes with the United States concerning the Helms-Burton Act, the law on sanctions against Iran and Libya and the more general problem of extraterritorial sanctions."
"Despite this agreement, the Commission holds to its position that these laws violate the law of nations."
"Thus, at no stage did the Community recognize their legality."
"In case measures should be taken against persons or companies from the Community, it has reserved the unlimited right to take the case up again within the framework of the WTO."
"The agreement reached is of a purely political nature and does not constitute the legitimization of US laws which continue to be illegal."
"The first is an agreement on certain disciplines which prohibit new investment in illegally expropriated properties. The second is the USA's promise to eschew future extraterritorial legislation in an agreement on the transatlantic partnership for political cooperation, and, of particular importance for the Community, the assurance of the US government that it will suspend application of the two contentious laws to the Community and to businesses from the Community - that is, the guarantee of the so-called waiver."
"The Community has received clear agreement that the US government will immediately try to obtain authority from Congress to issue an unlimited exemption from Title 4 of the Helms-Burton Act, the waiver."
"It is important that the Community does not apply the agreed disciplines before the exemption is actually issued."
"The European Union will only fulfil the agreed obligations when the USA complies with its part of the agreement."
"There will therefore be no advance concession from the European Union."
"A very important factor in the agreed disciplines on the prevention of new investment in illegally expropriated properties is that investments made before 18 May are exempt from this ban."
"These disciplines therefore apply only to future investment in properties which the Member States are convinced have been expropriated illegally."
"They state essentially that no aid may be granted either by the state or by businesses for investment in illegally expropriated properties. Investments which have not received state aid are not affected."
"I will repeat this to ensure that it is clear: the disciplines are not applied by the Community before the US Congress has given the President of the United States the authority to issue an exemption from Title 4 of the Helms-Burton Act and this exemption has come into force."
"In addition, the agreement on disciplines for investment in illegally expropriated properties provides that the Community and the USA bring these disciplines up jointly in the negotiations on the multilateral investment agreement."
"Madam Commissioner, first of all, thank you for your full and thorough reply."
"Nevertheless, I continue to harbour understandable doubts about the behaviour of the European Union in these negotiations of 18 May, for the following reasons."
"Firstly, I should imagine the Commissioner is already aware of the importance to Spain of our relations - economic, social, cultural and everything else - with Cuba, and that any type of sanction would therefore do great harm."
"But the second question I would like to ask, in the light of your reply, is that on the one hand, the text released to the public said that the European Union undertook to inhibit and discourage future investments, and in your reply you said, also directly, that this referred to expropriations which are considered illegal."
"So, my specific question is whether that means acceptance of the US position on these questions and the indirect adoption of the Helms-Burton Act."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasize once again that we are in fact dealing only with future investment and state aid for future investment."
"It is crucial that, before we actually implement this, the American government should commit itself to waiving extraterritorial legislation and also that it issue this waiver."
"This means, therefore, that it is a deal based on mutual interest, if you wish, and first of all the American government must repeal the effect of the HelmsBurton Act for European investment before the European Union reciprocates."
"Thank you very much, Madam Commissioner."
"I still have two supplementary questions on the agreement of 18 May on the Helms-Burton Act. Mr Newens has one minute to ask the first of these."
"Mr President, if the waiver on titles 3 and 4 of the Helms-Burton Act goes through - which is unlikely in view of the statements of Senator Jesse Helms - would not efforts to deter future public support for investments in so-called expropriated properties be contrary to agreements made by individual European Union Member States and Cuba?"
"In that case, which would have the overriding force?"
"Should not the United States be encouraged to make a settlement with Cuba over compensation for nationalized properties as other states, including those in Europe, have done?"
"In these circumstances there would be no case whatsoever for the Helms-Burton Act."
"Mr President, I really would not like to speculate on what might ensue if Congress did not adopt this regulation as both we and the American government would, of course, stake everything on it being passed."
"Furthermore, the agreement is not concerned with a ban on investment in Cuba but only on the part relating to state aid."
"With that reply, we have come to the end of this block of questions."
"I thank Mrs Wulf-Mathies for coming here and answering our questions."
"Mrs Cresson, we welcome you, and I invite you to take the floor to reply to Question No 49 by Bernd Posselt (H-0567/98)"
"Subject: ""Destructive embryonic research'"
"What is the Commission's position on ""destructive embryonic research' , and are such research projects assisted with EU resources?"
"The legitimacy of research using embryos is one the most complex and sensitive ethical questions which can arise in science."
"It is also an issue on which there are the widest possible differences in the perceptions, approaches and regulations of the various Member States."
"The main problem is to strike a balance between the interests of infertile couples and the sick, and respect for fundamental ethical principles and the moral and religious convictions of various sections of the population."
"Careful attention is generally paid to ethical aspects of research in the field of life sciences and technology during the implementation of the Union's research programmes."
"Some types of work are therefore explicitly excluded from the Fourth Framework Programme on biomedicine and health."
"This is the case with research on human cloning or research leading to transmissible genetic modifications in particular."
"On the other hand, research using foetal and embryonic tissues is not prohibited as such."
"This type of research is of great interest in areas such as medically assisted procreation, and the diagnosis and treatment of cancer or genetic diseases."
"Like all proposals presented within the framework of the research programme on biomedicine and health, proposals relating to research involving the use of human embryos or foetuses nevertheless have to comply with regulations and legislative provisions, defining the ethical requirements in force in the countries where the research is carried out."
"Proposals of this type that have been submitted under the Fourth Framework Programme have been examined by a group of experts on the embryo and foetus, set up by the Commission, with particular responsibility for evaluating the ethical aspects of research carried out within the scope of EU programmes."
"One of the aspects taken into consideration in this evaluation was the lack of alternatives to the proposed method."
"The group's opinions have been forwarded to local or national ethics committees responsible for granting the preliminary authorizations as required by the Commission."
"All the provisions in force relating to ethics in the field of life sciences and technology will be maintained in the Fifth Framework Programme."
"Considering the sensitivity of this question, I shall ask the ethics group chaired by Mrs Noëlle Lenoir to issue an opinion, before the specific 'Life Sciences' programme comes into force."
"The approach to ethical questions relating to research involving embryos is therefore based on the need for such research in order to increase our scientific knowledge in the interest of patients, whilst at the same time respecting fundamental ethical principles and the diversity of national feelings."
"Madam Commissioner, if I understood your reply correctly, exhaustive embryo research projects are assisted."
"In any case you have not expressly ruled it out and you pointed to national standards."
"But are there not also EU standards now?"
"I would remind you of the most recently adopted patents directive for biotechnological inventions; here, with regard to cloning, we said quite clearly that a human being is a human being from the beginning - that is, from the moment of conception, and thus has the right to protection, and in this regard we clarified this considerably in the interinstitutional dossier, the result of which goes far beyond the statements of the advisory body on the ethics of biotechnology."
"I am of the opinion that the standards we have developed in connection with the patents directive are the clearest EU standards thus far, and that we must develop our own EU standards on this basis as it cannot be satisfactory in the long term, as we have said, for the Commission to proceed differently in terms of aid depending on the state concerned."
"Yes, Mr Posselt, I agree with you entirely that it would be highly desirable for us to have European standards."
"Apart from a number of basic regulations, to which I referred earlier, such as the prohibition of human cloning, I also said that the regulations are different, perhaps even extremely divergent, in the various Member States of the Union."
"I have furthermore had a table drawn up showing the situation as it stands today, country by country."
"I do not think this is an ideal situation, and we must do everything we can to draft a general regulation."
"But it will also need to be acceptable to the various Member States."
"However, the Commission does not consider that research involving embryos should be excluded as such from the Union's research programmes, and just now I referred to the opportunities that such research can provide in very important sectors."
"Provided compliance is ensured with fundamental ethical principles, such as those I have mentioned, the Commission believes that research of this type may be legitimately carried out, in the interests of scientific progress and in the interests of patients."
"It seems to me that a precedent would be created if we were to align the relevant provisions with the most restrictive national legislative provisions, because, of course, it would be possible to try to adopt common standards on the basis of the most restrictive provisions. That precedent could mean that the same principle would be adopted as a solution whenever there are differences between national legislation."
"You will be aware that this is the case in a large number of areas, which could have negative repercussions with regard to research and for citizens."
"We have not yet completed our discussion of this subject and I understand your question perfectly, and agree that it is pertinent."
"However, we are in a situation where some Member States have a very restrictive attitude, and others, on the contrary, have a far more lenient attitude."
"Should we authorize the manufacture of embryos for the purpose of experimentation?"
"Some Member States, one in particular, would go so far as to allow this, whilst other Member States - in fact most other Member States - have a far more restrictive attitude."
"The Commission cannot impose the most restrictive standard as a single standard, nor do I think that would be desirable."
"Furthermore, we must be extremely vigilant from the ethical point of view, and we have only just started our discussions. I therefore consider that we have some very important work ahead of us."
"With the resources at our disposal today, we have no option but to continue our discussions, and to try to persuade Member States to adopt a common definition, but I repeat, we do not have any means of compelling them to do so."
"This is why we can only adopt a position of principle, the principle of respect for fundamental ethical values, and for the time being all we can do is accept the situation as it stands in the Member States."
"As the author is not present, Question No 50 lapses."
"That brings us to the end of the set of questions to Mrs Cresson."
"I thank her for attending and for her collaboration."
"Question No 51 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0498/98)"
"Subject: Cultural cooperation between the European Union and international organizations"
"Article 128 (3) of the Treaty on European Union states: ""The Community and the Member States shall foster cooperation with third countries and the competent international organizations in the sphere of culture...'"
"The UN organization UNESCO is an authoritative and universally recognized world body responsible for cultural, educational and scientific cooperation."
"Will the Commission say whether the European Union cooperates with UNESCO and what action is taken to implement European Parliament resolutions?"
"Mr Oreja Aguirre, I welcome you and invite you to reply to Mr Alavanos' question."
"Mr Alavanos, cooperation between the European institutions and UNESCO goes back many years. It was basically established through an exchange of notes in 1964, followed by another in 1973, and was confirmed by Article 128 (3) of the Treaty."
"More recently, a cooperation agreement signed by the Community and UNESCO in 1996 removed certain normative barriers which had considerably hindered cooperation actions in the past."
"But project related cooperation problems still exist, caused by the current differences between the financial regulations of the Community and UNESCO, and by their implementation."
"In practice, although relations between that organization and the Community institutions are excellent, cooperation between them has not so far resulted in a significant number of joint activities, for various reasons. In particular, because of its global remit and scant financial means, UNESCO does not consider Europe to be one of its main priorities in regional terms."
"From that point of view, I can only stress that the fields of intervention of the European Union and UNESCO complement each other."
"With respect to the cultural sphere, UNESCO and the European Union, within the context of their respective competences, regularly exchange information and data in certain sectors of common interest, such as statistics or goods, often take part in specialist meetings organized by either one, and sometimes finance certain projects jointly."
"We also cooperate with UNESCO in the areas of education, information and the fight against the illegal use of drugs."
"This collaboration could serve as an example for closer collaboration with UNESCO in the cultural field, in the context of the EU's external action."
"As for the future, cooperation between the EU and UNESCO is mentioned in Article 5 of the proposed Framework Programme for Culture for the period 2000-2004, which I had the honour of presenting to the Commission very recently. That programme has been approved by the Commission, and I have presented it to the European Parliament and the Council."
"Once it has been approved, this programme will constitute the frame of reference within which cooperation on an equal footing can be strengthened, including from a financial point of view."
"I hope Parliament will approve this framework programme, and after that we shall have to see how we can operate in the future."
"I very much thank the Commissioner for the comprehensive reply that he has given me and for giving me the opportunity to make the rejoinder which is at the very heart of the debate."
"One of the fundamental positions of UNESCO which relates to Europe, which is not totally cut off from Europe, and which was decided upon by the General Assembly in 1982, is the return of the Parthenon marbles from the British Museum to Athens."
"This concerns Europe directly and you know that there is tension between the Member States of the European Union on this matter."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner if, in his opinion, a country has the right to place this issue within a European Union context, based precisely on Article 128, paragraph 3 of the Amsterdam Treaty, which provides for cooperation with international cultural organizations."
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner how he would comment on the great devastation that has befallen the Parthenon marbles and which was revealed last week in the British press."
"Mr Alavanos, I am aware of what that represents, and I share your concern."
"But you know that with the means available to us, with the means provided by the Treaty and, furthermore, within the context of cooperation with UNESCO, that route does not offer any solution."
"I know your sensitivity towards an institution such as UNESCO, and I must tell you that the matter you have raised, like many other matters, demands that we should cooperate more, and not ignore each other."
"And I want to tell you something else."
"We are here in a hemicycle which is also used by the Council of Europe."
"And in this hemicycle, in other capacities, I have proclaimed the need for greater harmony between three institutions concerned with culture: the European Union, which has a restricted range, the Council of Europe, which has a wider range, and UNESCO."
"And I think we are at least going to try to achieve that."
"A few years ago that was not possible, because we did not have the instruments to do it."
"This is no longer the case."
"Today the Community has such an instrument in Article 128."
"So I would like to see how the three institutions concerned with the cultural sphere can progress together in the same direction. In many cases, we turn our backs on each other instead of looking in the same direction."
"Mr President, I must say that the Commissioner has tried to respond to the significance of the issue and the question."
"But I would like to ask him not to regard the matter as simply of concern to Greeks."
"It is a sensitive issue which must affect every civilized person and this Community as an organization, since much has been declared about respect for our cultural heritage, which in this case is at risk, not only from the event that Mr Alavanos referred to and which was denounced in the English press, but also because of the fact that these marbles do not have independent artistic value."
"They of course have autonomy, but they gain their value when they are united with the body they belong to and that is the Acropolis."
"The English are dragging their feet in this affair in the most uncivilized way - how can I describe it? - and they are still refusing to return them."
"There are similar cases which may concern your own country."
"I would ask you, as the European Parliament, to address the matter more courageously and more realistically, regardless of the cooperation you may ensure with other organizations."
"Mr Ephremidis, when we consider Classical Greece and its artistic riches, we are all Greek."
"So I sympathize with your wish to identify with something which, of course, goes far beyond its national meaning."
"And allow me, as a European, to share that sensitivity with you."
"I also want to say that, at the moment, we have no further legal routes by which to address the matters you raise. You know that very well because you are very knowledgable about the Treaty."
"But for that reason, I want to go back to the idea of sensitivity."
"I think it is very important because, in the end, sensitivity is also a part of our European cultural tradition."
"Mr Alavanos, the Commission has already started proceedings against Greece, in accordance with Article 169 of the Treaty, because of the incorrect implementation of certain provisions of Directive 89/552."
"At the moment, the Commission is studying that country's reply. I am sure you will appreciate that I cannot give you any further information at this delicate stage of the proceedings."
"It would be highly indiscreet of me to go any further."
"However, I repeat that the procedure has been initiated in accordance with the rules laid down in the Treaty."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank you for your warm words about the drama that our colleague, Mihail Papayannakis, is going through."
"I think that you express the feelings of all the Members and of the whole of Parliament."
"I would next like to thank the Commissioner for the reply he gave to my question and to simply say to him that I understand the reply."
"I just wish to express my fear, my intense concern, that, with all this bureaucracy, the time-consuming procedures which are in force in relation to Article 169 and the commitology procedure, this blatant violation which is occurring in Greece concerning the advertisement slot will continue for a long time to come."
"I will just say that now the procedure is underway, we are exchanging correspondence with the Greek authorities."
"The Commission's services are currently studying the latest reply from those authorities."
"It is a difficult case."
"It is not simple because Greece has incorporated the directive properly and has imposed fines on the broadcasting organizations which break the rules."
"So what the Commission has to do now is show that these fines may perhaps not be enough to actually dissuade those broadcasters from breaking the rules."
"That is what we are studying at the moment."
"Question No 53 by Robin Teverson (H-0568/98)"
"Subject: European Cultural Institutes"
"I understand that a European institute for cultural itineraries is opening in Luxembourg in addition to a cultural centre funded by UNESCO, the Council of Europe and the European Commission."
"Given the importance of Europe's cultural tapestry, I would like to have details of the European Commission's role in these centres, from their inception, and the financial implications."
"In addition, what other kinds of organizations which promote Europe's rich heritage does the Commission support?"
"Mr Teverson, the Commission is not participating financially in the creation of the European institute for cultural itineraries in Luxembourg."
"According to the information we have received from the Luxembourg authorities, the centre has been created within the context of a cooperation agreement between the Council of Europe and the Luxembourg authorities."
"Of course, the Commission takes a favourable view of this initiative because, given the importance of the European cultural network, the centre can make a positive contribution to improving the link between cultural heritage and cultural tourism on a European scale."
"At present, the Commission has the means to provide financial support for European cultural centres in the context of the Raphael programme, which supports joint and cooperation activities, but does not give aid for them to be set up."
"It provides aid for the development of joint and cooperative activities, but not for their establishment."
"That is what I wanted to clarify in relation to Mr Teverson's question."
"I thank the Commissioner for his reply which is fairly comprehensive."
"I do not wish to say much more as a supplementary except that we, in Cornwall - in the south-west of the United Kingdom - which I represent, have been very thankful for the support that some of the Commission and Council of Europe programmes have given to upholding our Celtic cultural identity."
"One statement I would like to make as a British Member of the European Parliament, in response to some of my colleagues' comments earlier on, is that I personally would like to back the campaign to move the Elgin Marbles back to Greece."
"That is right and it has my support."
"Perhaps that may be necessary, in any case, because Mr Rübig has requested the floor for a supplementary question."
"You have the floor for one minute, Mr Rübig."
"Mr President, I believe that educational systems are of particular importance in Europe because our culture is based largely on educational values."
"It would be a considerable contribution not only towards promoting education but also an essential basis for lifelong learning."
"We should therefore investigate the method to see whether best practice models and benchmarks could not be included so that we can see how an opportunity for Europe can be developed in the various educational possibilities offered."
"I want to say to the honourable Member that I think one of the things we must consider when putting the framework programme into operation is precisely the fact that, in cultural matters, we must not get bogged down in what we might think of as high culture. We have to project it towards other areas, such as culture and nature, culture to combat the problems associated with a lack of solidarity - in other words, how culture can help with social inclusion - and also culture and tourism."
"For all those things, I think training is essential."
"In that sense, the proposals I will be presenting for the development of the framework programme will be along those lines, if the honourable Members approve it."
"You should not imagine that I am ignorant of the role played by high culture."
"It forms part of our heritage, of course, but I do not think we should limit ourselves to high culture."
"Two weeks ago I attended a meeting between nine large cities, which addressed the subject of culture as a means to combat exclusion, and I was very encouraged by that meeting."
"That is a step in the same direction as the honourable Member was just talking about."
"So let us open up the field of culture to new horizons and new frontiers."
"Question No 54 by Ioannis Theonas, which has been taken over by Vassilis Ephremidis (H-0595/98)"
"Subject: Preservation of the historic bridge to Monemvassia"
"The bridge linking the Pelopponese mainland and the historic fortress of Monemvassia is in imminent danger of collapse."
"This sixth century bridge is a monument of great historical value and still carries the only road to the ancient fortress."
"It has suffered severe damage from both the action of the sea and the huge amount of motor traffic which crosses it, especially throughout the tourist season."
"Do the Community programmes for preserving the cultural and architectural heritage include shared funding for the repair of the damage to the Monemvassia bridge so that they may make a contribution to the urgent action needed to preserve an important monument from the Byzantine period?"
"Mr Ephremidis, the Commission shares your concern about the conservation of the historic Monemvassia bridge, which I have had the good fortune to visit, and which really is part of the heritage of us all."
"As you know, the framework for action to support cooperation initiatives to conserve and improve our architectural heritage is provided by the Raphael programme, which was adopted last year, and has a budgetary provision of ECU 30 million for the four-year period from 1997 to 2000."
"I would like to inform Mr Ephremidis that the Commission's services - the DG X services - will give very careful consideration to any application from the relevant authorities as long as they meet the eligibility requirements for action through Raphael, as published in the Official Journal on 31 March."
"I also want to tell you now that the deadline for applications this year is 10 September."
"So I would request that the application be made before 10 September, and you can rest assured that, although I do not make the final decision, I will personally ensure that this important matter receives special attention."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner and to assure him that, as far as I am concerned, I will do what I have to do, that is, I will convey to the inhabitants of Monemvassia the interest that you have shown."
"I will say that, before September, as you have said, they must put forward the proposal in any way they think necessary."
"What is more, I will go with you, because I think that they will spontaneously invite you to visit Monemvassia again."
"To the extent naturally that you have pushed forward the issue and the damage to the bridge has been repaired, you will be able to go and see the monument, the Castle, and the whole of Monemvassia, because the whole of Monemvassia is a historical place full of monuments, history, reminders of the past and culture."
"And in this way you will be helping thousands of tourists who go every now and again to the Peloponnese and want to visit this place, but the destruction and the damage to the bridge prevents them from doing so."
"Mr Ephremidis, I am glad you are so enthusiastic, but I would be grateful if you would wait for me to give you the floor before you speak."
"Please do not do my job for me. I have to earn my pay."
"Mr Marcelino Oreja Aguirre, would you like to reply to Mr Ephremidis' supplementary question?"
"(Interjection from Mr Ephremidis)"
"But I have not given you the floor."
"Why are you speaking?"
"Mr Marcelino Oreja Aguirre, you do have the floor, granted by this Presidency."
"Mr President, I want to tell Mr Ephremidis, whom I have known for many years and respect greatly, that I undertake to do what I have stated here in this House. I hope we will be able to watch the start of the restoration works together."
"Of course, the application will have to be presented in the correct manner. Although I am not the one who makes the final decision, I am responsible for making sure that decision is taken properly, and will do so."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"You can rely on Mr Ephremidis to accompany you, even if the work does not start for 20 years."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is the end of that block of questions."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Marcelino Oreja Aguirre."
"Having welcomed Mr Van Miert, I propose that we now move on to Question No 55 by Felipe Camisón Asensio (H-0500/98)"
"Subject: Unfair competition in international trade"
"In the Commission's view, what are the common principles which should be established to prevent practices of unfair competition in international trade?"
"Mr Van Miert, I invite you to reply to Mr Camisón Asensio's question."
"I would be glad to deal with this question, as it is a problem the Commission has recognized for a number of years. That is also the reason why we as a Commission took the initiative as far back as in 1994 to set up a group which we asked to consider a number of measures we might propose if necessary."
"This group produced good work, and the Commission subsequently made some suggestions to the Council of Ministers, which accepted these suggestions. This meant that, for the first time, this affair was put on the agenda of the World Trade Organization."
"This explains why, in the context of the World Trade Organization, a working party is looking into the problem of competition and trade, with a view to making a number of suggestions."
"I obviously cannot anticipate the result of this work, although the work in itself seems to be progressing very well."
"I cannot hide the fact that not everyone is completely happy about this initiative from the European Commission."
"In America, for instance, there is some hesitation. However, during my recent visit to Washington I noted that there is also the will and desire to continue thinking with the European Union about how this problem could be dealt with positively in future."
"What kinds of things are we thinking of?"
"Firstly, we are trying to, as it were, expand a number of basic rules regarding competition policy at the global level, and to see these rules incorporated into the legislation of various countries in the world."
"We also want to improve the enforceability of these rules and, if necessary, deal with certain conflicts afterwards in a specific framework, which we believe would ideally be a global framework."
"This is roughly the state of affairs."
"There is no more I can say about it, unfortunately, but I am pleased to be at the disposal of the European Parliament, and I will return to this issue once the working party has finished its task, in particular with regard to the talks we will be having with our American colleagues."
"Commissioner, you recently told the WTO ambassadors - and have confirmed it here today - that there is a lot of unfair competition at international level in the current global economy, and that since it is subject to different jurisdictions, it therefore causes serious problems."
"You even said today - and then as well - that the ideal solution would be a global agreement able to solve the problems which arise at national level, by jumping to a different scale."
"It would indeed be ideal to create competition structures which include basic principles, such as restricting abusive practices and concentrations, common principles to prohibit unfair competition in the international sphere, and the development of a cooperation instrument based on experience gained in this field."
"We think that all sounds very good, Commissioner."
"It would be ideal. I think it is a good idea to carry on thinking about it, but it is urgent."
"When are we really going to see something practical done about this urgent matter?"
"Unfortunately I cannot predict when there will be concrete results, because as I have just indicated, there is still some hesitation from the side of America, as well as in South-East Asia, where there is a great deal of resistance."
"After all, as you know, their markets quite often remain tightly closed, whereas it is competition which allows markets to open."
"At the moment we are trying to get as much support as possible for this initiative from the World Trade Organization in the context of the working group."
"Because one thing is clear; the European Union is the most active member of the most active authority actually trying to make progress."
"But it is also very important that we reach a certain understanding with our American friends to be able to pursue the objectives with more force."
"But having said this, I am not naive, nor is the Commission; it will take a lot of time, but is important that we support this issue, and that we send out a clear signal."
"Because globalization is moving forward and because more and more problems are arising globally, it is necessary to have certain rules which can also be enforced worldwide."
"As you say, Commissioner, competition policy is a way of opening up markets."
"We in this House have urged you to apply it to World Cup tickets, which I see have now become a subject of intercontinental trade."
"Could I ask you, Commissioner, what you think about President Chirac's reported attack on President Santer at the European Council for the way the Commission intervened to make more World Cup tickets available to non-French citizens, and what the Commission will do to defend the powers conferred upon it by the Treaties; what you think about the current ticketing arrangements, in the light of recent World Cup matches; and whether you will now take FIFA and the CFO to the European Court of Justice on the basis of the legal opinion that has been obtained by Parliament?"
"This seems to be a slightly different question but I am happy to give an answer or to state my position."
"There is no doubt at all that this question goes far beyond the national boundaries: it is a question of common interests."
"Therefore, the Commission, which received a considerable number of complaints, as you know, had to do its job, which means it had to investigate these complaints."
"Since there was, and is, clear discrimination, the competition rules apply."
"Therefore we will continue with this case, and the statement of objection is under preparation."
"But, as you know, we have to stick to the rules ourselves, in particular the procedural rules."
"If new elements are brought to our attention, obviously we need to have the opinion of the organizing committee as well."
"That is the way things have to be tackled."
"So we will continue, in spite of some comments which have been made."
"By the way, if we want to be nearer to the public - to the citizens - we have to behave as we are doing."
"It brings our institutions nearer to the public when they see that we do indeed take their complaints seriously."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Thank you for interpreting the content of the original question so generously, given that the Rules of Procedure do not oblige you to reply to questions which go beyond the strict scope of the original question."
"I know how generous you are, and I thank you, and I hope we can still go back to the real subject of Mr Camisón Asensio's question."
"Mr Wibe has requested the floor to ask a supplementary question."
"You have the floor for one minute, Mr Wibe."
"I will try to be very brief and to the point."
"I was interested when you, Commissioner, spoke of the fact that you discussed urgent measures against unfair competition."
"Could you say more precisely what these measures concerned?"
"Did they concern taxes, capital income or any kind of common treatment for foreign investors?"
"Could I just have a little clarification on this issue?"
"Mr President, indeed, this is the subject of further discussions and deliberations as to what could be put into what I would call a basket of basic competition rules, which would then be applied worldwide, but by national competition authorities."
"One of the things we are considering, for instance, is that export cartels are carving up the markets worldwide."
"That this might happen in some cases should be considered by all competition authorities as flying in the face of one of the most basic principles of sound competition policies."
"This is just one example of what may be discussed."
"That being said, we should continue to make a distinction between trade issues and competition issues, because trade issues concern attitudes or measures taken by authorities, while competition-related issues are mainly derived from attitudes by companies, so constitute private behaviour."
"We should keep this distinction."
"Let me give a concrete example to illustrate what kind of difficulties might occur."
"The Americans had a very high-powered case, the Kodak case, where their complaint was that the Japanese market was too close and did not allow American competitors real access to the market."
"They took the case to the World Trade Organization but at the end of the day the panel said it was none of their business because these restrictions, or the difficulties put in the way of market access in Japan did not arise because of governmental measures, but were the result of the private behaviour of Japanese competitors."
"So it was a competition case and this case showed the Americans that they could not tackle this kind of question through the instruments of the World Trade Organization."
"For that, either you would need a bilateral agreement with Japan to ensure that they would also apply competition rules in a normal way to open up the markets; or else we could think what might be done in a broader framework like the World Trade Organization, but specifically designed to tackle competition issues and competition problems."
"Question No 56 by Sören Wibe (H-0511/98)"
"Subject: Support for production in peripheral regions"
"It recently became clear that the Volvo plant in Umeå is not being allowed to receive assistance towards transport costs from the Swedish government."
"The consultants' report on which the Commission's decision was based was secret."
"Volvo and the Swedish government believed the report to be flawed, but, because it was classified secret, any errors that had been made could not be corrected."
"The decision has now been taken, but all those involved must learn a lesson for the future, so that events such as these are not repeated."
"Will the Commission operate more openly in future and allow the authorities of the Member State concerned to see the documents on which its decisions are based?"
"Commissioner, I invite you to carry on your discussion with Mr Wibe and reply to his question on production in peripheral regions."
"Once again this question is being put to me by the honourable Member and I am happy to reply to this question."
"Firstly, we have sorted out with the Swedish authorities how this regime has to be phased out."
"As you know, it is regarded as operating aid, which is out of the question in the transport sector."
"We have an agreement."
"It is a fair and balanced one which will phase out this type of aid by 2002."
"So we have an agreement."
"The question is related to a report drafted by an expert who is consulted from time to time by DG IV when we have to deal with automotive issues or problems."
"But this is only done for internal use by my department."
"In this case this report was drafted with the aim of conducting some fact-finding as to whether the Commission should open the procedure: not take a decision but open the procedure."
"Some of the elements of this report were taken on board."
"The facts presented by the Commission when we opened the procedure have been published in all official languages."
"Everyone who was interested was invited to give their opinion about our fact-finding in relation to the opening of the procedure."
"Therefore, it is an internal business matter and I would like that fact to be understood."
"It could happen that some of these reports will be of very little use to our services."
"Sometimes they may be of more use."
"But it is a strictly internal matter."
"Obviously, the position taken by the Commission when it opens a procedure and the basis on which this is done can be challenged by the governments or by the companies concerned."
"The Swedish Government and the Volvo company were in a position, then, to respond to what we put as evidence, according to our findings, at the opening of the procedure."
"There should be no misunderstanding about the aim of such a report."
"It is not for taking the final decision."
"It is just for opening the procedure which then starts the real investigation."
"As I said earlier, fortunately we have now reached an agreement with the Swedish Government and it is a fair one."
"That is the general context."
"I would ask you to understand one thing."
"We have to tackle so many cases - about 600 state-aid cases per year."
"Some of them are very complicated."
"From time to time we have to call in experts to help our services; not for taking decisions as such but for trying to construe the facts."
"I hope you will allow us to continue to do so."
"Take, for example, the Crédit Lyonnais case."
"We had to call in some experts."
"If every piece of expertise had to be made public, it would be impossible for my services to conduct their business as they should."
"By the way, from time to time the information involved is very sensitive and the companies are the first to ask us not to divulge it."
"So please understand that we are adamant about being as transparent as we can."
"The Commission has been criticized in Cardiff by some people because we explain our policies over and over again, why we take decisions or why we do not."
"Some people are not happy with the fact that we explain our policy and try to be as transparent as possible."
"Please understand that in order to be able to do our job properly from time to time we have to call in experts in a confidential way."
"I would first like to thank the Commissioner for his very detailed reply."
"However, I believe we have somewhat differing views with regard to transparency."
"In Sweden it is quite impossible to imagine that something a civil servant does should be kept secret from the elected representatives."
"As the Commissioner quite rightly says, the contents of the report concerned have become outdated, but the report itself has become an important issue of principle for us in Sweden as far as transparency is concerned."
"The Ombudsman of the European Parliament, Jacob Söderman, has now intervened on this issue and written a letter to Jacques Santer requesting that this report should be published retrospectively."
"My precise question is this: Are you now going to publish this report, and, if so, when?"
"We have already had a meeting with the services of the Ombudsman."
"Obviously we allowed them to look into the document."
"But, for the reasons I explained earlier, we have to stick to the working method which has been used successfully."
"In order to investigate - because it is part of the investigation, not part of the decision-making, that is the difference - from time to time we have to find out some specific things and so we call in experts."
"So we still feel very strongly that this should remain within the limits of the services being able to come up with something substantial."
"Accordingly, it does not belong to the part which should be publicized."
"It is part of the investigation."
"Once that has been done then you have the next phase which is completely transparent."
"What the Commission publicizes is available to everyone."
"That is the difference we would like to keep."
"Apart from that, we have demonstrated over and over again our eagerness to be as transparent as we possibly can."
"By the way, the Commission is now being taken to the Court because some companies and some people find we are too transparent."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for the detailed reply he gave."
"I have two supplementary questions."
"Firstly, has this issue been formally decided by the Commission in that the Ombudsman has made a formal request to the Commission to publish the report?"
"Has the matter been rejected by the Commission collectively, or is it the Commissioner's own opinion that this report should not be handed over?"
"Secondly, does the fact that the company concerned and the Swedish state, that is, the parties concerned, will read the report and have access to the information play any part in the Commission's judgement?"
"Or is the judgement based solely on the Commission's internal situation?"
"I am a little sorry that Mr Sjöstedt has put a question that has already been put to me previously."
"As I explained earlier, we were asked this question by the Ombudsman and our services were immediately able to explain to him what was happening and a copy of the report was supplied to him."
"This is the correct way to handle things when the Ombudsman makes a request."
"We also explained why we think that in future we should be able to continue to work as we have been doing because this report looked into the various kinds of activities which took place in the plant."
"There can be no operating aid to assist the automobile industry."
"This is a general rule."
"It cannot be allowed in Germany or in Belgium or in Sweden."
"As far as that problem was concerned, there was no difference of opinion but we had to be given some advice about the nature of the various activities at the plant."
"Once advice has been received, the services, under my responsibility, who discuss the situation with me, try to assess what is relevant to the opening of the procedure, but this is not a decision."
"We feel that we should have the option of establishing the facts and constructing a case."
"What happens later should be completely transparent."
"I am in full agreement with you, but if we are required to make public every single piece of advice, sometimes in very complicated cases, it would make life completely impossible."
"We already have a lot of trouble monitoring all the state aid cases."
"There is a lack of human resources."
"Cases are becoming more complicated so please allow the Commission services to do their job properly."
"If we are asked to explain things - e.g. why something was done or was left undone - we are always available to you, to the Ombudsman and to other people as well."
"Thank you very much, Mr Van Miert."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is now 7.00 p.m."
"We have come to the end of the time specified by the agenda for questions to the Commission."
"So Questions Nos 57 to 105 will be dealt with in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Common organization of the market in bananas (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the report (A4-0220/98) by Mr Thomas, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 on the common organization of the market in bananas (COM(98)0004 - C4-0046/98-98/0013(CNS))."
"Mr President, many of us in Parliament and in the ACP were rather unhappy with the proposal for a global quota."
"With that in mind, last week I secured for my group agreement to an amendment which I believe will help to ameliorate the consequences of the proposed changes."
"I very much hope that this House will support that amendment."
"The Commission proposal does not in any way safeguard the access of the smaller and weaker ACP suppliers."
"The risk is that they will be displaced because the traditional volumes will be grown and supplied by others."
"Therefore, if we are to have a global quota, can we not have a guarantee that all traditional suppliers will be able to sell their traditional volumes?"
"We should insist that if there is a global quota, we must have enforceable and effective guarantees that ACP traditional bananas will be able to get into our markets on at least the level of access assured by Lomé."
"I would hope that a form of words can be devised in the Council meeting on Monday that will take this issue of guaranteed access into account."
"Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire and Belize are expanding their production and export capacity."
"They will be able to increase production up to and beyond the point at which the quota will be over-subscribed."
"Thus, multinationals in these countries will follow their usual routes of putting profit first and the interests of the ACP will never figure in their calculations."
"Is it fair to give these multinationals still further advantages over our traditional producers?"
"Should we be persuaded to do their work for them and should we be bullied by the continuing ability of multinational companies and the United States of America to collude so well with the WTO against our interests and the interest of our traditional suppliers?"
"Indeed, today the President-in-Office of the Council was able to tell us of a very offensive letter he had received from the Secretary of Trade in the United States."
"I do not think the European Union should be pushed around in this way by the United States and its friends in the multinational banana-producing countries."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Thomas, on his balanced report and his willingness to negotiate, which has fostered dialogue and compromise at all times between the representatives of the various interests involved in the COM in bananas."
"In my opinion, the Commission proposal, which aims to adjust the COM in bananas strictly to the WTO decisions, has to be criticized on a basic point: its unbalanced treatment of Community producers and operators, in neglecting to include alternative mechanisms to compensate them for the loss of category B licences."
"So we think it is essential to implement a mechanism to encourage marketing, since the current compensatory aid is only granted to the marketed product. This means that in order to receive such aid, the Community banana would have to opt for lower prices in order to make its marketing more attractive, thereby upsetting the market and increasing aid costs disproportionately."
"It is also necessary to review the regimen of aid for loss of income, as laid down in Article 12 of Regulation 404/93, through an increase in the overall reference quantity and the flat-rate reference income, as Amendments Nos 22 and 33 to Mr Thomas' report reflect so well."
"As for the licence regime, we fully agree with the views expressed in the report, where it says the reference period should be taken as the shortest and most recent period for which data exist. It also talks about retaining a two year transitional period, justified by the legitimate confidence inspired among category B licence operators by being able to transfer the certificates, as provided by current Community regulations."
"As for the Commission proposal on the autonomous tariff quota, I would just like to recall that we also agree with the Thomas report and with the tradition which has been followed here since the Santini report. I do not think we should disturb the balance of the Community supply sources."
"Lastly, export certificates should be reinstated into Community regulations and demanded from all the countries which supply the Community, including the ACP countries, since including them in that way would be compatible with GATT regulations."
"They should be seen as a way of avoiding fraud with respect to banana origin, and the risks of falsifying the repetition of import quantities."
"Mr President, having listened to the Commission this afternoon and noted Mr Fischler's numerous and categoric rejections of our amendments, I think it is time we reflected on the usefulness and role of Parliament in this matter, as well as the importance which is accorded to the political wishes we express through our requested opinions."
"I do not want to repeat the reasons for the Union's lack of control over the destiny of this sector, sacrificed as it is on the altar of globalization."
"Nevertheless, I would remind you that Community production of bananas is specific in every way, for it is an activity carried out in the ultra-peripheral areas which suffer the difficulties we are all aware of, and that it covers only 20 % of market requirements."
"Furthermore, given the aims laid out in Regulation 404/93, and more particularly the assurance of sufficient income for producers, it is difficult for us to understand why the Commission has considered it unnecessary to provide for adjustments to Title III of the regulation, due to the significant amendments which will be made to the trading arrangements with third countries."
"Furthermore, in spite of some reluctance on the part of the rapporteur, I am happy with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's proposals and reaffirm that Community production must benefit from the consequences of the most recent enlargement and a possible increase in the market."
"The system of support to Community production must be adapted to the new rules, due to the raising of the flat rate reference income and to a development in the measures which opens up the right to compensatory aid."
"The reestablishment of Article 16 of the regulation is a necessity for better developments in market prospects."
"Mr President, this is briefly my opinion on the direction which the European Parliament's opinion must take with a view to reconciling our interests with those of other producer countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is right to denounce the desire of the American multinationals to obtain the dismantling, by the WTO, of the Community system for trade in bananas."
"Our determination has enabled the Community preferential arrangements and aid to Union producers, who have long been in line with social and environmental standards, to be respected."
"The Commission's attitude has, unfortunately, been a very different one in which their proposals yield to the WTO's injunctions, with a 16 % increase in the tariff quota which takes no account of the risks of job and income losses on the part of Community producers."
"Conversely, the concern of Mr Thomas' report is to propose ways of supporting the incomes of Community banana producers."
"It modifies the Commission's proposals by reducing the increase in additional tariff quota from 353 000 to 100 000 tonnes, by increasing by 15 % the Community banana quota eligible for compensatory aid and by increasing this compensatory aid by 20 %."
"By adopting these measures and this report, which has my full support, we will be appealing to the Council to reconsider the European Parliament's amendments."
"Mr President, this organization of the market in bananas demonstrates that politics can still take precedence over economics."
"Protesting before the panel still does nothing to alter the fact that we are taking a political stance, that we are setting up external protectionist measures geared to social and, not least, ecological points of view."
"However, it also demonstrates it is not only the interests of the producers that are coming to fruition here."
"In considering the position of the Americans, who scarcely have any banana producers of their own - if any at all, or only in Hawaii - then it becomes apparent that they are now making use of the panel to push through their own capital interests, or those of the major fruit companies."
"Germany's position, too, was not carried by banana manufacturers or producers, but by the interests of commercial enterprise."
"But it is a very positive sign that, despite this, we are able to talk about a political settlement."
"Commissioner Fischler, this should enable us to take courage in other areas of agricultural production in which we do not produce any surpluses either - we should take courage in disputes with the WTO and take a political stance, not worrying about the possibility of having to face a panel, but instead making use of this or accepting it in the interests of achieving sensible settlements for agricultural production in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the most important tropical fruit produced in the world, the banana constitutes a considerable economic concern for producers in the ultra-peripheral areas of the European Union and for the ACP countries."
"Produced under unfair conditions often based on non-existent or disregarded social criteria, the dollar banana competes unfairly, and often immorally, with producers working within more regulated production systems which are fairer but of course more expensive."
"Naturally the dollar banana is cheaper to produce - for a reason!"
"Mrs Carlotti this afternoon outlined the Chiquita company's practices to us."
"Furthermore, a great deal of well-founded information reveals that some exporting countries practise production methods which are contrary to our own technical and environmental standards."
"I am thinking of the numerous health problems, even deaths, caused by pesticides used on banana plantations."
"What is worse, social conditions are often unacceptable and this should encourage us to demand a clean up of the rules of international trade at the forthcoming WTO discussions, where the Commission's negotiators would do well to put the social and environmental clauses back on the agenda."
"A more reasonable estimate for the autonomous quota is 100 000 tonnes. Above all, let us make our trade conditional upon the principles which we uphold within the European Union, especially respect for human rights and sustainable agriculture, and let us encourage the actions of those producers who wish to move in this direction, as suggested in a number of the amendments."
"Finally, let us apply the principle of Community preference, whilst at the same time respecting the commitments made within the framework of the Lomé Convention."
"I would not wish to end without also congratulating Mr Thomas on his report, which on balance we support."
"Mr President, revision of the organization of the market for bananas is urgently needed."
"Under the pretext of development aid, the Union has set up a costly and inefficient organization of the market."
"As far back as 1995, the World Bank condemned the European banana policy."
"Although the regulation was designed for small producers in the developing countries, according to the World Bank it is hardly benefiting them."
"The European banana policy is based on a system of import licences."
"With the introduction of the B-licences, the European traders, who traditionally had been importing bananas from the ACP countries, secured an important share in the market in ""dollar' bananas."
"While this was in the interest of these importers, the farmers in the ACP countries were none the better for it."
"The lively trade in category B licences has pushed up the price of bananas on the European market, which resulted in a reduction in consumption."
"So there is every reason to take the WTO complaint about the category B licences seriously."
"But it is precisely in this crucial component of the organization of the market that the Commission has displayed little creativity."
"The Commission is simply opting again for an allocation of the licences on the basis of traditional trade flows."
"This proposal has also been adopted by Mr Thomas in his report."
"Truly a missed opportunity!"
"It is high time a change was made."
"Instead of the traditional importers, we must give preferential treatment to those who grow bananas in an environmentally and socially responsible way."
"This change is lacking in both the Commission proposal and in the Thomas report."
"I support the rapporteur's proposals for a promotion fund and the specific provisions for fair trade bananas."
"But as long as the European market remains closed to new initiatives because of a licensing system, I am afraid that the fair trade bananas will not get a fair chance."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Fischler for being kind enough to join us again this evening because I think it is important for him to follow the debate, although it has to be said that the Chamber is not exactly full."
"I should like to disagree a little with Mr Martinez about how much we knew about the WTO decisions."
"The matter was discussed in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and in that committee we studied both the WTO working group's statement and the Appellate Body's decision."
"And it turns out that the European Community was very badly defended."
"We find that the WTO Appellate Body was chaired by a former US senator, and that nobody was present in either the working group or the WTO apart from representatives of what we might call free-trade theories, or the new or dominant theory. So the views of the agricultural sectors of the EU were virtually undefended."
"Furthermore, the Commission's legal advisor told us that, in all, he only had five lawyers to defend the Commission's point of view, against the battery of hundreds of lawyers available to the US Government, assisted moreover by the multinationals."
"I am glad Mr Fischler is here."
"At the moment, a group of Canary Island banana farmers is in the public gallery. These people have devoted their whole lives to their work, and at the moment they have no alternative to banana farming."
"If the Commission proposal goes ahead as it stands, and the sector does not receive more protection, we are going to find ourselves with a production sector which is now unprotected, whereas prior to the adoption of Regulation 404/93 it was fully protected."
"And these people cannot move elsewhere or turn to alternative crops."
"So in my opinion, I think the Commission would do well to support a lot of the amendments presented by this Parliament - those tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I hope that next week the Council can finally achieve a good Community regulation which allows a certain level of protection to be retained."
"Mr President, it would be good if the European Union resisted the temptation to thoroughly revise the present banana regulation."
"There are a great many diverging interests in this sector."
"That is why there is the risk of creating one problem by solving another."
"We therefore have to start by aiming the revision at solving the WTO problems which have arisen."
"This apparently has been the Commission's intention."
"This is why I support the Commission proposal to set the autonomous tariff quota at 353 000 tonnes in connection with the expansion of the EU. I also accept the duty of ECU 300 per tonne for this autonomous tariff quota, assuming that this will not give rise to new WTO difficulties."
"After all, the present duty is ECU 75 per tonne. In doing so, the European Union is giving a good signal."
"The costly, extremely artificial and bureaucratic category B licensing system will be abolished and the ACP countries compensated for lost income. The liberal banana import system of the new Member States will be integrated politically even further into the considerably less liberal EU system."
"The burden of this extra bit of protection is borne proportionally by the EU tax payer and the EU consumer, and it does not discriminate between the non-privileged banana-exporting third countries."
"It would be good if the European Union would also give an adequate response to another unmistakable development, namely the EU interest in fair trade bananas."
"The problem is not so much the need to support commercialization of fair trade bananas; access to the import quotas is actually the biggest problem."
"The Commission must not close its eyes to this."
"It should reserve definite space for this category in the daily management of the import licences, while being authorized to do so by Council and Parliament."
"Mr President, with this regulation we will have five different import quotas and customs duties for the import of bananas."
"That is absurd."
"Moreover, I do not believe that this new system will be approved by the World Trade Organization, so presumably we are going to have a new solution in a few years' time."
"Nor do I think that it is right for us to use trade policy for our aid to developing countries."
"The great risk of such a policy is that we lock the countries into an obsolete production structure, in this case into the production of bananas."
"Our policy towards the ACP countries resembles what we in Sweden call 'Döbeln's medicine' , that is, it helps for the moment, but in the long term it is harmful."
"Both for European consumers and for the populations of the ACP countries it would be better to have free trade combined with direct aid than the present complex quota and customs duty system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must voice my opposition to the Thomas report."
"I am speaking on behalf of a large segment of the Group of the European People's Party; not the whole party, but a very sizeable segment of it."
"The Thomas report calls for increased protectionism, whereas what is really needed is less protectionism."
"We find Amendments Nos 11 and 28 particularly unwelcome, as they represent a drastic reduction in quotas for the three new Member States."
"A total of 10 % is being cut from Latin American bananas, and still more problems will ensue."
"I very much doubt whether the Commission's proposal is in keeping with WTO ratios."
"However, I am quite certain that the demands made by Mr Thomas and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would in any case lead to enormous problems with the WTO."
"We keep hearing - as we have heard in today's debate - that we must protect the small, independent producers in traditional ACP countries and the EU against the 'big bad' multi-nationals in Latin America."
"The organization of the market clearly does not do this."
"You are all invited to a talk in the press room tomorrow morning with an independent producer from Costa Rica who produces fair trade bananas and has great difficulty with the way the market is organized."
"Small producers in Latin America - of whom there are many, in Ecuador, too, for example - are the hardest hit, and that is why we must give more support to fair trade bananas and vote against the Thomas report on this point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by congratulating the rapporteur, David Thomas, on an excellent report on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation No 404/93 on the common organization of the market in bananas."
"The rapporteur's proposals are an excellent attempt to reconcile the interests of all the parties involved, that is to say of Community producers, of the ACP countries and other non-EU countries and of consumers, in a fair and balanced way, keeping to the rules of the internal market and the common organization of the market."
"All the same, the question of abolishing the system of allocation of B certificates ignores the consequences this decision will have for Community producers."
"As you know, the distribution of import licences has been one of the basic principles of the common organization of the market in bananas, and serves to restrict the quantities of Central American bananas coming in so as to safeguard sales of Community bananas."
"The Commission and the Council will have to define the measures they propose to take to stop this gap, clearly and without time limits."
"Among the various measures that should be taken, we think the overall reference income should be adopted and increased by around 20 %, so as to restore the necessary income guarantee to Community producers, and the Community should undertake to reduce the independent quota to prevent a possible glut on the market which would jeopardize sales of Community bananas."
"Quite apart, that is, from vital additional aid which will be needed to give Community producers back the necessary resources for disposing of their production, thus offsetting the high cost of transport."
"For all these reasons we unreservedly support Amendment No 25, Article 1 (new), in order to protect the interests of banana producers in the Autonomous Region of Madeira."
"Mr President, once again we are faced with a debate on the reform of the COM in bananas, and we need to recognize that this time the reform has been forced on us by the result of the dispute within the WTO."
"I must say, Commissioner, that this time, in general terms, we share the views expressed in the Commission proposal, because we need to modify the current import licence regime and make it compatible with WTO rules."
"Our experience of market behaviour during the last few years suggests that we should take this into account when it comes to setting import quotas, in order to avoid flooding the markets and causing prices to drop, as happened last year in the case of France."
"So we think an autonomous tariff quota of 100 000 tonnes, as already requested by Parliament, is better suited to market demands than the 350 000 tonnes proposed by the Commission."
"Furthermore, we need to find a formula to allow continued exempted access for traditional ACP producers with whom we maintain economic, commercial and political obligations which cannot be ignored."
"Maintaining this sector in the banana-producing regions of the EU is the very reason for the existence of this COM. Nobody has been able to call into question the validity and legitimacy of this COM, despite the constant attacks it has been suffering."
"We need to guarantee the survival of Community production, and the EU's banana farmers need their current income levels to be guaranteed."
"The banana sector is one of the most important economic resources of the ultra-peripheral regions of the EU. They cannot do without it, not just for economic reasons, but also for employment reasons."
"Taking it for granted that the Commission shares these objectives, we need to know what mechanisms they are contemplating in order to sort out the import regime for third country production. Also, we do not yet know how the Commission plans to compensate Community producers for losses they suffer as a result of not having a licence regime like the one currently still in force."
"Commissioner, it would be good to clarify and overcome the two uncertainties I have just indicated: guarantees for maintaining production and income levels."
"That is what the sector is hoping for from this new reform."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by praising the Commissioner's proposal, for it endeavours to strike an admirable balance between the different producers' interests."
"Reasonable consideration must be given to EU producers, while we must maintain our Lomé and WTO obligations."
"In reality, there is precious little room for manoeuvre."
"However, fair trade bananas are one area in which we can improve the Commission's proposal."
"The Commission's proposal to support ACP producers paves the way for changes in production, and there must be due regard for the environment, but that is not specific enough."
"Thus, it is vital that our amendment should propose arrangements for fair trade bananas."
"In this regard, I am not suggesting a particular quota, but rather, support for changes in production, a definition of fair trade bananas, arrangements for labelling and monitoring, and support for publicity and marketing of fair trade bananas. Arrangements for fair trade bananas would benefit EU producers and ACP producers alike, and I therefore hope these aspects will be worked into this proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of the banana market has given us another opportunity to declare in this House that it is the principal obligation of the institutions of the European Union to defend the interests of its Member States and their regions in every situation, and to honour the commitments they assume in agreements with other countries, without submitting to the interests of the World Trade Organization."
"In the case we are now debating, the Commission may be given the benefit of the doubt when it tries to reconcile the interests of Community and ACP banana producers with the requirements of the World Trade Organization's panel of judges."
"The Commission must understand that the flooding of the European market with large quotas of cheap bananas from non-EU, nonACP countries will seriously affect the income of Community producers and make it almost impossible for traditional ACP countries to compete with Latin American producers."
"We cannot set aside the fact that some of our ultra-peripheral island regions, which are marked out by their isolation and low levels of economic development, are among the European banana-producing regions."
"It is not enough to recognize the existence of ultra-peripheral regions in the Treaty of the Union; it is more important that in all circumstances there should be specific and substantive expression of the support which those regions, which expect a great deal of us, call for and demand from the Community."
"In Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, it would cause incalculable economic, social and environmental damage if the European institutions gave in to pressure applied to them for the purpose of defending interests which are not those of European citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.."
"Freedom of establishment in the transport sector"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0215/98), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive amending Directive 96/26/EC on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator and road passenger transport operator and mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications intended to facilitate for these operators the right to freedom of establishment in national and international transport operations (C4-0174/98-97/0029 (SYN))."
"(Rapporteur: Mrs Maria Berger)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, even if he is leaving us now, ladies and gentlemen, the Community had conceived regulations as long ago as 1974 with the goal of harmonizing conditions of admission to the occupation of road haulage operator and road passenger transport operator. However, in recent years, central, basic conditions in the transport industry have undergone major changes."
"The present proposal for a directive comes in response to these changes."
"The proposal aims to guarantee that at least somewhat similar statutory terms will apply for all hauliers right across the EU."
"The occupation of road haulier is already second to none in terms of being a truly European occupation."
"In a matter of days, from 1 July 1998, this will be reinforced still further through the final clearance of cabotage."
"This occupation, too, will thus be able to benefit fully from the terms of the internal market, and hauliers will enjoy unrestricted admission to the market throughout the Union."
"In fact, the directive under discussion here today should have been in force by 1 July 1998."
"I must therefore emphasize that Parliament has worked extremely fast and that the Council has been responsible for the delays, having spent rather a long time on the common position; that is why this deadline has not been met."
"Regardless of the actual date, however, we must respond to the fact that changes in operating and production processes in industry and retail in line with the just in time strategy have led to faster, more flexible and, at the same time, higher quality transport services, demanding ramified and ingenious systems of logistics."
"Today, we are confronted with a situation whereby smaller and smaller consignments need to be transported with increasing frequency."
"There is also a noticeable shift from traditional company transport to professional goods transportation, and larger and larger operators are emerging, offering both haulage and logistics solutions."
"On the other hand, we are also seeing increasing numbers of small enterprises entering the market place by virtue of their flexibility and the cost savings they offer, accepting haulage suitable only for smaller vehicles, even for transboundary movement."
"The public is becoming increasingly exacting as regards transport services, especially in terms of environmental protection, technical safety and abiding by social provisions."
"The emphasis varies greatly from country to country."
"Standards in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in particular are, without doubt, decidedly lower."
"Thus, we have to be aware that operators from these countries in particular will be competing more and more with operators within the Union."
"Thus, quite apart from the present concrete directive, I would like to pick up where I left off at first reading in my quest to examine the extent to which steps can be taken under the auspices of existing European accords with the nations of central and eastern Europe, prior to their joining, to bring them gradually into line with EU regulations in this area."
"At first reading, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights expressly welcomed all the Commission's proposed harmonization measures."
"These concerned greater requirements with regard to financial capacity, personal efficiency and specialized knowledge as well as the enlargement of the area of application of the directive."
"As rapporteur, I also wanted to see stricter regulations adopted to combat fraud in joint transit procedure and to regulate the transit of live animals. I wanted to see regulations adopted setting greater requirements with regard to financial capacity."
"I wanted a tighter definition of the concepts of share capital and reserves to be adopted. My proposals at that time were adopted by a very sizeable majority both in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and in the plenary session."
"However, in its common position, the Council has only accepted two of our proposed amendments and these changes are actually more in the nature of legal technicalities."
"I am particularly disappointed that in the common position, the Ministers of Transport did not even take up my amendments on combating fraud, when these had the support of the Commission."
"Thus, I have resurrected most of my/our demands from first reading, and once again, they have been unanimously adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"As before, I still consider it extremely important to bring anti-fraud provisions into the domain of haulage operators."
"I also propose deleting various items added by the Council, as well as introducing supplementary tests for hauliers who have acquired their credentials in a different Member State."
"I would ask for your support in the vote."
"Mr President, the second reading of Mrs Berger's text deserves to do well."
"At first reading, I thought we and the Commission had made good progress."
"I can understand the Council being a little more cautious in the text we received subsequently."
"But what is it all about?"
"As Mrs Berger said in her introduction, it has something to do with fair competition."
"It also has something to do with transportation, environmental considerations, integrity, etcetera. I am in no doubt that the House agrees on what it is about, but perhaps we are more worried about how to get it through."
"Regulations are fine."
"That's great."
"But in my view, free will can go a long way."
"For instance, I am confident that in the trade - within Member States - road haulage is being developed along the lines of sustainability, focusing on quality and service."
"There has to be the will to make implementation a reality in all Member States."
"The committee's proposal on Community transit and procedures is sensible and deserves the support of Parliament and, in due course, that of the Commission and Council as well."
"I would like to ring a little alarm bell about one proposal, however."
"The amendment in question is Amendment No 11, where there is a kind of weighting of offences."
"The amendment proposed by the House reads, ""... convicted of serious offences against the rules in force concerning road haulage' . What is ""serious' supposed to mean?"
"Who is going to define how serious something has to be before intervention is necessary?"
"This is a kind of grey area, giving free reign to spite, so I would prefer us to retain the original text, stating: ""... convicted of offences against the rules in force ...'"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as always, differences in national regulations lead to distortions of competition."
"Moreover, competitive pressure from third countries has also recently increased considerably."
"The proposed amendments to the common position bring the harmonization process one step further forward; they are based on the revised basic conditions - the newly-developed just in time strategy, for example."
"They take account of trends in the road transport of goods."
"To my party, an important consideration is that in addition to the requested greater requirements with regard to the integrity of the operator, environmental protection and professional duty, there is also a need for greater requirements with regard to combating fraud in Community and joint transit procedure."
"This is one inference from the conclusions of the report by the committee of inquiry concerned."
"Regrettably, we cannot agree to Amendment No 8, part 1."
"In this respect, we prefer the text of the common position."
"In reviewing an operator's financial capacity, both capital and reserves should be considered."
"In a time of crisis, for example if a major customer leaves, a haulage operator needs to be able to use more capital as a temporary measure for restructuring purposes without running the risk of failing a test of financial capacity during such an emergency, while if elements of reserves had been considered, such as unrealized gains, credit guarantees and similar banking information, the operator's financial capacity might have been judged positively."
"This would ensure that financial capacity would be appraised primarily on the actual solvency of the operator."
"The criterion of haulage operator integrity serves to protect the public from injury and danger."
"Thus, for serious violations of relevant regulations, an operator's licence would be withdrawn."
"Withdrawing licences for any offence, as originally proposed, would mean that, in extreme cases, even exceeding the speed limit could have far-reaching consequences for the fate of the firm."
"This would surely be unjustifiable in terms of the proportionality rule; this was why the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights rejected this proposal."
"I really must thank the rapporteur both for her report and for taking this line."
"Mr President, I welcome Mrs Berger's report which seeks to bring common standards to road haulage operators in Europe."
"However, I must say that it is simply not good enough for British authorities to allow a situation to arise whereby Irish hauliers are denied access to and use of British roads, as happened when ports were blocked last Sunday for 16 hours."
"The European Treaties have espoused a need for the freedom of movement of goods, persons and services within the territories of the European Union."
"This should be protected and maintained at all times."
"This freedom is enshrined in the legal right upon which the basis of the European Union is founded."
"In fact, one must welcome the recent position of the Internal Affairs Council of Ministers' meeting, at which it was agreed that the procedural red-tape would be cut, to allow the European Commission to demand reasonable action by Member States to unblock roads or ports within days of blockades being set up as a result of strikes, or face action in the European Court of Justice."
