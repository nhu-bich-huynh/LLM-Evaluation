"In this way, Europe will continue to invest in a youth policy as a way of reinforcing its citizens' sense of belonging to Europe and of developing its young people, on the basis of solidarity and mutual understanding among all people."
"in writing. I welcome the Youth in Action programme, which aims at promoting experiences of European citizenship by young people."
"This should contribute to solidarity and mutual understanding among young people throughout the European Union."
"For the individual the programme should help promote a sense of initiative, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit."
"Finally, it should contribute to fostering youth organisations and activities in all Member States."
"in writing. I want to put on record my support for this report."
"in writing. I welcome these proposals, which bring together the existing internal education and training programmes, allow for increased coherence and complementarity of Community programmes and should lead to more efficiency and flexibility in the Community's actions in the field."
"These programmes have demonstrated palpable success over their lifespan and have contributed to the modernisation of the educational and training systems in Europe."
"As the new Integrated Programme is open to some third countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, Switzerland), it has a huge potential for contributing to intercultural understanding."
"The Integrated Programme is unfortunately, however, not open to all countries in the Union's neighbourhood."
"I believe that establishing and maintaining contacts with the peoples of the Union's Southern and Eastern neighbours through education and training activities is of crucial importance."
"I call, therefore, for the programme to be gradually opened to all countries covered by the EU's Neighbourhood Policy."
"I would also like to see the inclusion of the Erasmus Mundus programme in the Integrated Programme as of 2009, when the present programme has run to the end."
"in writing. (SV) I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the June List's rejection at first reading in October 2005."
"It is true that the June List is a supporter of, for example, the Erasmus programme, but there are other parts of the draft component programmes that we need to examine carefully in order to establish whether they are justified on the basis that, under the Treaty, each Member State is responsible for the organisation and content of education and vocational training systems."
"Overall, too much money has been appropriated to far too many projects."
"We question why some of these projects exist and are funded via the EU."
"in writing. I voted for this report and welcome the intention to replace the existing Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, e-learning and other related programmes (which expire at the end of 2006) with a new integrated lifelong learning programme for 2007 to 2013."
"I support the creation of four strands Comenius for general education activities in schools, Erasmus for higher education, Leonardo da Vinci for vocational education and training and Grundvig for adult education."
"I believe this programme addresses important needs concerning the modernisation and adaptation of education and training systems in the light of the Lisbon goals."
"(NL) Mr President, I have voted against the amendments to the report on the Europe for Citizens Programme, because this programme, like its innumerable predecessors, is about as much use as sticking a plaster on a wooden leg."
"Attempts are made to bring the citizens closer to the European institutions, but these will never be successful as long as policies are being adopted which, in some areas, are diametrically opposed to what the majority of the people actually want."
"One example of this is enlargement policy, and, more specifically, the possible accession of Turkey."
"A programme such as Europe for Citizens can be credible only if the European Union does something about the democratic deficit and the lack of accountability towards the European citizens."
"What has now been approved by Parliament does nothing to change the essence of the problem, and is therefore yet another way of wasting money."
"Even this programme is testimony to the scant attention that the EU pays its citizens."
"For a start, the funding amounts proposed are very low, some 60% down on the amount originally earmarked."
"It is also true that the programme is ambiguous."
"Although there are some worthwhile objectives - for example, the twinning of cities, civic projects, various surveys and studies, art events and conferences - there are others that are indicative of unacceptable political influence, such as excluding fascist crimes from support under new Action 4 - Active European Memory."
"As regards the amendments to budget appropriations within the programme, the strengthening of education-related measures is to be welcomed, although such projects will hopefully be incorporated in such a way as to ensure that all opinions on the EU and its policies are heard, and not so as to transform it into yet another platform for propaganda."
"We also welcome the inclusion of amateur sports organisations and hope that it is extensively applied."
"in writing. (SV) I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the June List's rejection at first reading in April 2006."
"We very much reject quite a few of the positions adopted by Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education where this programme is concerned."
"The work on this matter has primarily proceeded from an attitude of incomprehension regarding the low turnout at the 2004 elections to the European Parliament and regarding the fact that the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"The 'Europe for Citizens' programme has no contribution to make to changing the political situation."
"The work involving local amateur sport organisations within the framework of this programme is redolent of contempt for Europeans."
"We also note that it is important for the peoples of Europe not to neglect their memories in relation to dictatorships and tragedies in the histories of their countries."
"However, this should be done at national level."
"It is not something for Eurocrats in Brussels to get involved in."
"The June List has therefore rejected the amendments tabled by the Committee on Culture and Education to the result of Parliament's debates on this matter."
"in writing. - (FR) As early as at first reading, in April 2006, we came out against this report, so significant were the absurdities that it contained."
"This proposal at second reading is no worse."
"It is quite simply unacceptable."
"With a total budget of EUR 190 million, this programme is, indeed, a new propaganda tool in the service of the European Union."
"We could, without a doubt, find better uses for this sum - I am thinking, in particular, of the social sphere, agricultural aid and business creation - than to allocate it to this vague and artificial notion of European citizenship."
"Couched entirely in black and white terms, the document concerned is brilliant at pointing out to us what is desirable, namely to be an enthusiast of active European values; what is bad, namely to be a passive citizen; and what is worse, namely to be a Eurosceptic."
"Whatever happens after the inevitable approval of this report and the wasting of all that money by various associations, we shall all remain, above all, nationals of one country or another and proud to be so."
"The Europe for Citizens programme is aimed at bridging the gap between the citizens and the EU, and will be provided with instruments to promote active European citizenship."
"It fosters cooperation among citizens and their organisations from different countries, so that they meet, work together and develop their ideas in a European atmosphere that transcends a merely national outlook and respects diversity."
"I voted in favour of this report, which will help to improve the Europe for Citizens programme, with the two following amendments:"
"Firstly, a reduction of the budget earmarked for Action 1 'Active Citizens for Europe' from 47% to 45% will make it possible to raise the appropriation for Action 2 'Civil Society in Europe', which is particularly well-suited to funding projects on Europe, its values and its cultures."
"Lastly, as regards the programme's overall objective, I welcome the rapporteur's idea of integrating the idea of strengthening tolerance in order to ensure that projects funded as part of this programme will contribute towards the kind of active citizenship that promotes mutual respect and intercultural dialogue, and combats racism, xenophobia and discrimination."
"in writing. I voted for this report, which seeks to address a major challenge facing the EU: how to connect the EU with its citizens."
"The 'Europe for Citizens' programme ensures the continuity of the civic participation programme established for the period 2004 to 2006."
"The programme provides the Union with an instrument to promote active European citizenship."
"It responds to the need to improve citizens' participation in the construction of Europe and encourages cooperation between citizens and their organisations from different countries in order to meet, act together and develop their own ideas in a European environment which goes beyond the national vision."
"I welcome this."
"in writing. I want to put on record my support for this initiative."
"Perfluorooctane sulphonates (PFOS) are toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative substances present in applications such as chromium plating, waterproofing and fire resistance."
"This report, in contrast with the Commission's original proposal, proposes the gradual phasing-out of PFOS from the market, with a view to eliminating their use."
"Furthermore, some derogations initially laid down - cases of chrome plating of metals and fire-fighting foams for which there are now safer viable alternatives - are to be removed."
"By means of a compromise amendment, the administrative threshold has been lowered from the 0.1% proposed by the Commission to a new threshold of 0.005%."
"The report also proposes that each Member State draft inventories of all products in which PFOS are used in order to prevent these substances from being released into the environment."
"I particularly welcome the amendment proposing that current derogations can only be maintained where there are no safer substances or technologies that are technically and economically viable, and where the best techniques available are put in place in order to minimise PFOS emissions."
"The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs welcome the amendments aimed at preserving the quality of the environment and accordingly endorse Mr Schlyter's report."
"in writing. I voted in favour of this proposal, which aims to restrict the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), substances widely used in materials such as textiles, carpets, paper and general coating."
"Studies conducted by the OECD, the UK authorities and the Scientific Committee on Health and Environment Risks have found evidence that PFOS are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic."
"It seems right that the EU should act to get rid of another substance of high concern."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over two years have passed since we joined the EU."
"Yet internal border controls in the EU remain, and that is a cause of profound dissatisfaction for us."
"As a representative of the Czech people, I am not particularly interested in the technical and legal problems involved in the introduction of the SIS II system, to which the Commission has recently referred."
"The new Member States and their citizens must become fully-fledged members of the EU, with equal rights, at the earliest opportunity."
"In this context, any delay to our entry into the Schengen area is utterly unjustifiable."
"I therefore voted for the adoption of the Coelho report on the Schengen information system, because its smooth, quick adoption will lead to the fulfilment of the four fundamental freedoms that lie at the very core of the EU."
"(DE) Mr President, much as I would like to see improvements to the Schengen Information System, I have nevertheless voted against the Coelho report, believing as I do that an emergency solution to the immediate extension of the Schengen area - as mooted by the new Member States of the EU - needs to be firmly rejected."
"My reason for saying this is that the security of the public must take precedence over any sensitivities on the part of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, who, as we know, are bringing a great deal of pressure to bear in this regard, for the ability of the new Member States to actually secure the EU's external border to the east is very much in doubt, not least by reason of the large number of illegal immigrants caught on the eastern border of Austria, the country from which I come."
"Premature participation on the part of the new Member States would promote illegal immigration and criminal tourism on a massive scale and should therefore, I believe, be rejected."
"in writing. Although the UK is not part of the Schengen Information System (SIS), I welcome this package of three reports for two reasons."
"Firstly it is the very existence of SIS that has allowed internal borders in the Schengen area to be removed and this new system SIS II will allow new Member States to be linked up to the system and subsequently allow them to dismantle their internal borders and thus allow their citizens to gain the advantages of full free movement."
"Secondly, I welcome this from a UK point of view because, while not taking part in the Regulation, I hope the UK will eventually have access to its information for purposes of security."
"The adoption of the Coelho reports created the legal basis for the practical implementation of the second-generation Schengen Information System."
"By means of its new electronic interception network on the new eastern borders, SIS II makes the EU a safer place."
"Among the new characteristics of SIS II, its storage capacity has been enlarged to accommodate 27 Member States; it facilitates the storage of biometric data and the European Arrest Warrant, the correlation of data and persons, together with, moreover, the improvement of data protection standards."
"SIS II opens up new options for the police and the justice system when it comes to searching for wanted persons and also creates the conditions for the free movement of European citizens in a larger area of freedom, security and justice."
"For all these reasons, I have voted in favour of the adoption of Mr Coelho's reports."
"I voted in favour of Mr Coelho's reports because I feel that they are of paramount importance in protecting our citizens' interests and security."
"The SIS II system will enable the Schengen area to be enlarged to cover the new Member States as quickly as possible, by updating it, increasing its capacity and introducing the new possibilities offered by the most recent technological developments."
"The bottom line, however, is that this system offers greater security in the management and control of personal data, without people's fundamental rights being overlooked, and in so doing guarantees our citizens that effective measures are being taken to combat organised crime, illegal immigration and other crimes that undermine their security and interests."
"in writing. - (FR) The Schengen Information System (SIS) is a police cooperation tool, the purpose of which is to centralise, and facilitate the exchange of, information relating to persons and vehicles, or other items, jointly sought by Member State police services."
"Some 13 million items of information are at present stored in the current system."
"It is proposed that we create a second-generation SIS - SIS II - which would be extended to the new Member States."
"That is something to which we cannot subscribe, any more than we subscribed to Schengen I, which arranged for the free movement of persons by removing the Member States' internal borders."
"The problem is not one of having a super-computer capable of making an inventory of all the people or goods sought by the police."
"It is one of ensuring that each nation state is able to establish an area in which security prevails."
"Each day, the immigrants arriving in huge numbers on the coasts of Europe prove that what we need to protect are our borders and that it is because these are so porous that we are faced with illegal immigration and lack of security."
"What this means is that all the computers in the world could collect as much personal data as is available without altering the fact that the main source of the problems of illegal immigration, lack of security and trafficking of all kinds is the lack of effective control of the European Union's internal and external borders."
"The purpose of this report is to broaden the characteristics of SIS beyond its original scope. It seeks to develop new features, extend access to new authorities, interlink alerts between those authorities and introduce new categories of data, such as the arrest warrant and biometric data, and the visa information system, a technical platform for sharing information."
"This extension to the previous system brings additional risks to citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees, given that further elements are added to a database that is also shared by more bodies and accessible to more people, with no guarantee that these data will be able to remain confidential."
"There are further worrying aspects in this proposal. For example, records may be 'kept longer if they are required for monitoring procedures which have already begun'."
"The question that thus arises is who defines what is 'necessary' and the vague notion of 'monitoring procedures which have already begun'."
"Another all too vague area is that of sharing data with third countries, as provided for by the proposal."
"The fundamental objective is to make SIS compatible with the new circumstances arising from enlargement and from the dangerous, unacceptable objectives of the current securitarian crusade in the EU."
"The report, as formulated with the agreement of the political mouthpieces of capital (Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, social democrats and liberals), adopts as acquis communautaire the creation of a gigantic mechanism for monitoring and keeping files on every European or foreign citizen inside or outside the borders of the ΕU."
"The SIS II system abolishes every guarantee of protection for citizens' personal data by granting the right for personal data, including biometric data such as photographs, fingerprints and distinguishing marks, to be recorded and for any person who, in the arbitrary and uncontrolled view of the forces of repression, is suspected of committing crimes or who, according to information from the secret services, is a threat to national security, to be put under surveillance."
"These personal data may be kept for an indeterminate period of time by decision of the prosecuting authorities and will be accessible, in addition to the police and judicial authorities, to the secret services, Europol and Eurojust, who will have the right to pass them to third countries or organisations (such as the CIA and so forth)."
"The famous area of freedom and security of the ΕU is now revealing its repellent and nightmarish form as an area in which basic human rights and fundamental freedoms are throttled, an area of uncontrolled action by the forces of repression to protect the power of Euro-unifying monopolies from the peoples' resistance and the workers' and grassroots movement."
"in writing. (SV) The establishment of SIS II is seen by forces critical of the EU as a further step towards building a common EU police force and as part of the web that, in specialist area after specialist area, is forming an EU state."
"The EU is in the process of being turned into the ultimate closed 'big brother' state that, at the time of Sweden's accession, many Swedes feared it would become."
"This is happening with the blessing of politicians on both the left and the right who, with populist messages concerning, for example, external border controls and the fight against crime, are helping to construct a non-fictional Orwellian society."
"The June List is in favour of cross-border police cooperation."
"It is necessary to confront contemporary international crime, but this has been done successfully for decades by the international police body, Interpol."
"To find the money for a further information system, and one that only applies within the European Union, would, then, be superfluous."
"The June List is very sceptical about allowing the Member State bodies responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles to have access to very sensitive personal data."
"That type of information should be handled by the individual nations."
"All the Member States must be able to guarantee their citizens protection against unauthorised access to their personal data."
"The June List is thus voting against all three reports on SIS II and access to the system."
"in writing. The assassination of Anna Politkovskaya bring shame to Russia and I hope that at every level the Russian authorities will spare no effort to bring those responsible to justice."
"in writing. The murder of Anna Politkovskaya should be condemned, as should all killings of journalists, human rights campaigners and others who seek to expose the truth."
"""Freedom of Expression"" is still met with death in too many places in our world."
"Russia is still a country where freedom of expression is a myth."
"The Russian authorities must bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice."
"Greater pressure must be placed on the Russian authorities to guarantee the freedom of the media and human rights organisations on Russian soil."
"in writing. I fully support this motion and abhor the fact that, although the EU guidelines for breast cancer screening were first drawn up in 1992, mammograph screening is currently only offered nationwide in 11 Member States (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom)."
"For me it is particularly unacceptable that in Ireland, which has recorded the highest economic growth rates in recent years, about 600 women are victims of breast cancer each year, and a sizeable number of those deaths could be prevented if periodic screening and diagnosis identified the problem early enough."
"It is a disgrace that in Ireland we are still waiting for the rollout of a national breast screening programme."
"However, we do expect that rollout to be completed in 2007, although the cervical cancer screening programme won't be completed until 2008 at the earliest - some 15 years later!"
"All Member States must introduce - urgently - nationwide breast screening."
"The Commission should now work with the new Member States and accession countries to assist them in using the European Regional Development Fund and the pre-accession funds to create a comprehensive health care infrastructure."
"in writing. Members of the UKIP-delegation regard EU initiatives of any kind as an undemocratic abuse of power and will not vote for them under any circumstances, even when they seem well-intentioned."
"In this case, the EU is attempting to intrude its influence into the sphere of health service provision, which, like all spheres subject to EU intrusion, should remain under the control, which only nation-states can provide, of democratically-elected governments."
"in writing. (SV) Are EU measures to combat breast cancer more effective than similar measures within the framework of established, internationally recognised organisations with broad expertise, such as the World Heath Organisation (WHO)?"
"The June List's answer to that question is 'no'."
"The European Parliament must not dictate to what extent the Member States are to implement significant measures such as breast-screening, information campaigns about breast cancer, research into breast cancer, the setting up of cancer registers and the establishment of centres designed to provide information about breast cancer."
"It is better for urgent coordination and cross-border cooperation to take place within an organisation such as the WHO than within the EU."
"I have thus voted against the current resolution."
"in writing. Every year 275,000 women in the EU are diagnosed with breast cancer and the wide discrepancy in care and treatment standards they receive is simply unacceptable."
"That is why I voted in favour of this resolution calling for Europe-wide standards for early detection and treatment of the disease."
"Breast cancer patients often suffer discrimination in the workplace and I hope that, following Parliament's overwhelming vote, the Commission will now draft a charter for the protection of breast cancer patients at the workplace."
"I believe if this report was fully implemented we could improve the quality of life for surviving breast cancer patients and significantly reduce the estimated 88 000 deaths a year in the EU from Breast Cancer perhaps by as much as 35% thus saving 30 000 women a year."
"in writing. Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged between 35 and 59."
"The earlier the diagnosis, the greater the chance of survival."
"Most women with breast cancer do not want 'tea and sympathy' but concerted action to improve treatment and tackle the causes."
"One simple action which could be taken is to minimise the wait from tests to diagnosis."
"From talking to women with breast cancer, it is the waiting which is the most worrying."
"We must do all that we can to help and improve the treatment of women at that most concerning time."
"Member States must do more to share best practice."
"The work of Europa Donna is essential in helping all European women and I want to place on the record my support for this pan-European organisation."
"(DE) Mr President, although I have to say that delivering a statement of vote to an empty Chamber is a new experience for me, I would nonetheless like to state why I abstained from voting on the Muscardini report."
"Following the demise of the quota system, which had been in place for ten years, there has been, since 2005, a marked increase in the quantity of Chinese leather shoes exported to Europe, as we are all aware, and there is now, understandably, a hail of criticism raining down on the punitive customs duties from China and from those entrepreneurs who benefit from Chinese supplies."
"It may well be the case - as the critics of the punitive customs duties suggest - that we will lose for good the European shoe industry, in which, for years, fewer and fewer workers have been taken and more and more workshops have moved to countries outside the EU, but, that notwithstanding, we surely cannot look on and do nothing while a whole industrial sector heads for destruction."
"That being so, we should, during the two years during which the punitive tariffs are to apply, use the opportunity to seek out solutions to this major problem for European employment."
"We are here to listen to you because an explanation of vote is an opportunity for a Member to explain something he cannot explain with a 'yes' or a 'no'."
"Your point is something for the record and not really for the other Members."
"It is understandable, but we are here to listen, as long as there are explanations of vote."
"(DE) Mr President, I am in complete agreement with you and am obliged for your attention."
"in writing. - (FR) Globalisation has been imposed on the peoples of Europe with the assurance that, in the end, they will be the winners because it promotes exports and opens up our competitors' markets just as much as it does ours."
"It is quite clear, however, that this globalisation is far from being a 'win-win' situation, and that so-called 'fortress Europe' is full of holes, but that it allows the construction of real fortresses all over the world, particularly in the most promising markets."
"The problem, as Mrs Muscardini's report explains, is that the European Union's responses to the improper trade protection practices of certain third countries towards the EU, which are nothing more than disguised, unfair protectionism, are weak, inappropriate or completely lacking."
"Mrs Muscardini quite rightly emphasises the need to strengthen the EU's trade defence, but the specific solutions put forward are not up to the challenges, so unshakeably dogmatic is people's faith in the benefits of ultraliberal globalisation and in the virtues of multilateralism."
"This system has now reached its limits: the WTO is no longer the solution, but the problem."
"It is because the proposals do not reflect the accuracy of the analysis that we are going to abstain on this report."
"in writing. (SV) The June List believes that free trade is a good thing because it leads to an increase in prosperity for everyone involved."
"It is worth noting that, until it joined the EU, Sweden was one of the countries in the world most sympathetic to free trade."
"The EU at times conducts a very protectionist policy in order to protect those sectors that are not competitive in the international market."
"This approach is exemplified by agricultural aid, whereby agricultural products are subsidised with the result that similar products from other countries - in many cases, developing countries - cannot be sold in the EU market."
"An efficient world trade system is extremely important if free trade is one day to become a reality."
"The Muscardini report is, however, redolent of protectionism, which is why I voted against it in today's vote."
"This report promotes the liberalisation of trade and the principle of reciprocity, and proposes the imposition of retaliatory measures."
"Its entire ethos is one of a battle for market quotas in the name of competition, rather than one of cooperation, in which trade has a role to play in development but is not the be-all and end-all."
"Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are tantamount to interference in the internal decisions of each country and threats that could be imposed by the WTO."
"The losers are the developing. and the least developed, countries."
"The report also defends the WTO and the dispute settlement mechanism, and seeks to speed up all of the most offensive (anti-dumping) and defensive (safeguard) trade defence mechanisms."
"Speeding up the dispute mechanism and giving it more power will serve to beef up the influence of the major powers in the WTO, because they are the ones with the strength to impose rules."
"The crux of the matter is that trade liberalisation runs counter to the idea of fair development."
"Each Member State should have the right to decide its economic and social development model, to industrialise and to protect its industries."
"This is an alienable, sovereign right, which calls into question the approach of promoting exports and free trade."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Union is worried that the industrial powerhouses of China and India are taking protectionist measures against our exports by using trade defence instruments."
"The United States, therefore, is no longer Europe's only economic competitor - we are also up against Brazil, other countries in South America and Australia."
"The WTO, which should be acting as a global regulator, is not only powerless but complicit."
"Thus, the bubble of ultraliberal globalisation is about to burst."
"Unlimited, unregulated speculation on goods, commodities and people has now reached its limit."
"Having achieved spectacular economic growth, the emerging economies are now consolidating and protecting themselves, with a view to overtaking us one day if we do not react quickly enough."
"During this time, the ultra-Europeans in Brussels have been recommending that we open up our borders more and more and keep helping the whole world blindly and with no checks and balances, forgetting our fellow citizens."
"We must follow the example of the new world powers by establishing protection and Community preference in Europe and protection and national preference in France."
"in writing. I voted in favour of this report, which analyses the use of trade defence measures against the EU by third countries and makes sensible recommendations on how the Community should react, especially in cases where those measures are a disguised form of protectionism aimed at unlawfully restricting access by EU products to foreign markets."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Welcome"
"I would now like, on behalf of the whole House to extend a warm welcome to our visitors in the official gallery, namely Mr Igor Dodon, Minister for Economic Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Moldova, together with a delegation from the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova."
"(Applause)"
"The delegation from Moldova will be attending our sessions today and tomorrow and will be joining with this House's delegation in a session of the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee."
"I am delighted to see you there and hope that you will find our debates of interest."
"Moldova (Transnistria), Georgia (South Ossetia) (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Moldova (Transnistria) and Georgia (South Ossetia)."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recent developments in Moldova's geographical and political situation have had an impact on the basic state of the Transnistrian conflict."
"Ukraine's initiative to resolve the conflict in Transnistria since the Orange Revolution, the involvement of the European Union and the United States in the peace negotiations, and the activities of the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) have strengthened Moldova's unity."
"Transnistria has reacted to this by holding a referendum on 17 September."
"According to the Transnistrian authorities, the referendum resulted in overwhelming support by the people for independence and joining Russia."
"The international community, including the European Union, has not recognised this or the earlier referenda in Transnistria."
"This was expressed clearly in the declaration by the Presidency on behalf of the EU on 18 September, and also in the EU's positions stated at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in September and within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in July."
"In its declaration, the EU condemned the referendum, regarding it as contrary to Moldova's regional integration and its internationally recognised sovereignty."
"Moreover, the EU openly cast doubt on the idea that the outcome of the Transnistrian referendum actually reflected the will of the people."
"The EU has also discussed the referendum with Russia on several occasions."
"Although the public statements made by Russia have given rise to other interpretations, Russia has assured the Union that it respects Moldova's territorial integrity and has denied supporting the referendum."
"The activities of the EUBAM are an example of how the Union can best lend real support to the conflict resolution process in Transnistria and bringing the control of the Moldovan-Ukrainian border closer to European standards in general."
"Both Moldova and Ukraine have shown gratitude for the transfer of know-how to their border authorities."
"It is essential for efforts to resolve the conflict that the EUBAM should have helped to steer the supervision of Transnistrian foreign trade in the direction of the Moldovan authorities."
"This, too, contributes to Moldova's national unity."
"The decision by Ukraine to start implementing the Ukrainian-Moldovan customs cooperation protocol in March has done much to improve the EUBAM's prospects."
"It is the parties themselves which have the key roles in the Transnistrian peace process."
"The European Union hopes that the parties to the peace process will return to the negotiating table."
"The EU's chances of making an effective contribution to the process are bolstered by the Union's Special Representative, who participates in resolving the Transnistrian conflict in accordance with agreed EU policy objectives and in close coordination with the OSCE."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan between the EU and Moldova is the instrument that will enable the Union to lend purposeful, long-term support to Moldova."
"Ultimately, Moldova's development towards a politically and economically stable state may be the key to resolving the Transnistrian conflict."
"To achieve this, Moldova must, for example, improve its capacity for administration, extirpate corruption and foster a climate for investment."
"Moldova must make itself attractive to both foreign investors and Transnistrian businesses."
"The EU is committed to supporting Moldova in these efforts."
"Now I will move on to the other topic of our debate."
"It has to be said that the European Union is extremely concerned about the tense relations between Russia and Georgia."
"This crisis is also affecting the situation in the separatist conflict zones in Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"At the informal summit in Lahti last Friday, President Putin even warned that the situation might escalate into bloodshed."
"He blamed Georgia for preparing for war."
"In its conclusions of 17 October, the EU appealed to both Russia and Georgia to do their utmost not only to improve their bilateral relations but also to concentrate their efforts on finding a peaceful settlement to the conflicts."
"The Union also urged the parties to comply fully with earlier agreements."
"The current situation in South Ossetia is tense."
"On 12 November a referendum will be held in the region for the purpose of consolidating the region's independence."
"As with the referendum on independence in Transnistria, the European Union does not recognise this referendum."
"It may increase tension in the region further."
"The European Union and the international community are aiding the resolution of the conflicts in Georgia in many ways."
"Through its observer status, the European Commission has an important role to play in the Joint Control Commission, the conflict resolution mechanism for South Ossetia."
"On many occasions Georgia has expressed the wish that the EU's role should be further strengthened."
"It also wants the JCC format to be changed by involving the EU and the United States of America, following the Transnistrian peace process 5+2 model."
"More recently, Georgia has called for the peace negotiations to be continued bilaterally between Georgia and South Ossetia."
"Additionally, Georgia is demanding that the Commonwealth of Independent States peacekeepers, who in practice are all Russians, be replaced with an international operation both in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, with special emphasis on police activity."
"The view of the Georgian Parliament and Government is that these troops are not fulfilling their mandate and that their continued presence is questionable."
"The EU is at present discussing internally the question of strengthening its role, but Georgia may have unrealistic expectations of the Union."
"The EU is encouraging the Georgian leaders to show restraint."
"Hasty decisions on the peace processes in South Ossetia and Abkhazia are best avoided, for they might be a risk to the presence of the United Nations and the OSCE in the region."
"This, in turn, would create a vacuum in the regions."
"Georgia should undertake not to resort to force."
"The EU Member States and the Commission made a significant contribution to the Donor Conference on Economic Rehabilitation for South Ossetia, which was held in Brussels in June."
"The conference was held on the basis of a needs assessment conducted by the OSCE."
"A significant international programme on economic rehabilitation will be started in South Ossetia this autumn, using funds collected at the conference."
"Russia has an important part to play in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"Support from Russia is needed in order to achieve results in the peace processes."
"The latest espionage scandal, however, has acutely exacerbated the already strained relations between Georgia and Russia."
"The EU has on many occasions sent strong messages to the leaders of the two countries, most recently to President Putin at Lahti, on the importance of normalising relations, and it has also offered its services to help reopen their dialogue."
"At the end of October, the EU will discuss internally the progress of its role in the resolution of the conflicts in Georgia."
"Special Representative Semneby will have an important part to play in maintaining political dialogue between the EU and Georgia."
"He may also be able to promote the re-establishment of contact between Georgia and Russia."
"During its visit to Tbilisi on 2 October the EU Troika also stated that the EU is prepared to help Georgia resolve its conflicts by means of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"A joint ENP Action Plan between the EU and Georgia has just been drawn up, which the EU-Georgia Cooperation Council will adopt formally at its meeting in Brussels on 14 November."
"The ENP Action Plan also contains a separate section on the resolution of the conflicts in Georgia."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, since our last debate there have been substantial developments, to which President-in-Office Lehtomäki has just referred."
"I visited South Caucasus in early October as a member of the Troika, when the ENP Action Plans with all three countries were finalised."
"They will now be officially signed and adopted in November."
"I think that this is a basis for strong operational cooperation."
"Before I talk about EU support, I think it is important that we also recall the impact of our relations with Russia."
"During recent months, we have seen gas price increases for Moldova, import bans on Moldovan and Georgian wines and water, the de facto support given to Transnistria in the referendum, and the strong reaction to Georgia's expulsion of Russian military officers."
"These issues were addressed with President Putin in Lahti and I personally raised some of these issues with Foreign Minister Lavrov only a few days ago in Moscow."
"The forthcoming Foreign Ministers' Permanent Partnership Council on 3 November and the EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki on 24 November will enable further discussions to be held on these issues."
"Let me also mention that the OSCE played a very helpful role in refusing to observe and recognise the referendum in Transnistria and also in returning the Russian officers from Georgia to Russia."
"I shall now say a few words specifically about Moldova and Transnistria, and then on Georgia."
"I would also like to highlight the very successful EU Border Assistance Mission, EUBAM, which has played a very important role in introducing a new customs regime between Moldova and Ukraine."
"This programme was allocated EUR 20 million for two years and over 70 customs officials and border guards were seconded from our Member States."
"All major Transnistrian companies have now registered in Chisinau and are working under this new regime."
"Combating customs fraud will thus crucially cut the illicit revenue currently enjoyed by the Transnistrian leadership."
"While we are happy that high-level talks between Russia and Moldova have recently resumed, we have been concerned about Russia's support for the Transnistrian leadership."
"In a recent statement, Minister Lavrov called for 'political recognition of the results' of the referendum in Transnistria, which neither the European Union nor the OSCE recognised."
"I think this could complicate the task of finding a solution to this conflict."
"We are also worried about the insistence by Transnistria and Russia on the need for a so-called transit protocol between Moldova and Transnistria that would recognise the latter as an independent international economic actor."
"This issue is the stumbling block in the settlement talks which resumed after a silence of more than six months, albeit not in the full 5+2 format, but with only mediators, with each of the two sides separately, in other words 5+1."
"This approach is unacceptable, as we have made clear to Russia on several occasions."
"More than that, developments on the ground, with all major Transnistrian companies now working legally with Chisinau, show that such an approach is increasingly out of touch with reality."
"We were also worried that the new Ukrainian Government would change track on this issue."
"I was very pleased when Prime Minister Yanukovich assured me of the ongoing support of the Ukrainian Government."
"We will continue to stress the importance of Ukrainian cooperation at the forthcoming summit in Helsinki in a few days' time."
"Some have pointed to the ongoing discussion on railway issues between Moldova and Ukraine as further proof that Ukraine might abandon its earlier position."
"The facts, however, do not bear this out."
"We therefore strongly encourage both sides to find a mutually advantageous solution to this situation as soon as possible."
"Our presence on the ground through the EU Border Assistance Mission provides us with an excellent instrument for following the situation and giving advice and assistance to both sides."
"Let me add that under the new ENP instrument, Moldova will see a substantial increase in our funding."
"It will also receive a grant under the macro-financial assistance programme to help it address the shocks caused by increased energy prices and the Russian ban on Moldovan wines."
"We are highly concerned about the crisis in relations between Georgia and Russia, especially the continuing tensions between the two countries."
"We are particularly worried by the expulsion of large numbers of Georgians from Russian territory, which appears in direct contradiction to Russia's commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights and to the 1975 Helsinki Final Act."
"I also raised this issue recently with Mr Lavrov."
"Georgia also bears its share of responsibility."
"During our recent visit to Georgia in the Troika mission, I urged President Saakashvili to display moderation and encouraged him to rebuild trust."
"Let me say a final word on South Ossetia."
"I think it is disappointing that the recent meeting of the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia was inconclusive."
"We understand Georgia's wish to renew and review the Joint Control Commission's composition, but existing peace mechanisms should be fully utilised until new ones are in place and the recent Needs Assessment Study and the June 2006 international donors' conference show that there is scope for a constructive dialogue."
"We are pleased that this rehabilitation programme is continuing despite the crisis."
"We have made a significant financial contribution to assist a peaceful settlement, including a EUR 9.5 million economic rehabilitation programme in South Ossetia."
"Funds for rehabilitation have also been earmarked under the new EC financial assistance programme for the period from 2007 to 2010."
"I think the European Union as a whole has a very important role in supporting any peace settlement."
"But the most immediate need is to get relations between Russia and Georgia back on a normal track, on a diplomatic track."
"We will certainly continue our efforts to achieve that objective."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, tomorrow we shall be voting on the resolution on the Moldovan region of Transnistria."
"We know that Moldova is the poorest country in Europe."
"In September a so-called 'referendum' took place in the Moldovan region of Transnistria, aiming at the region's possible unification with the Russian Federation."
"This referendum and its outcome were not accepted by the international community and the conflict between the separatist authority of Transnistria and the central government of Moldova has largely contributed to the instability of the whole country and its economic and social development."
"Earlier this year we also witnessed the failure of negotiations concerning the status of Transnistria in the 5+2 format as the Transnistrian authorities withdrew from these negotiations."
"We are also aware of the fact that the so-called Russian peacekeepers are still in Transnistria."
"In this context, we, the European Parliament, should denounce the so-called referendum in the Transnistrian region, which contradicts the internationally recognised sovereignty and territorial integrity of Moldova and can be seen as provocation, which increases the existing tensions and jeopardises the chances for a peaceful settlement of the problem."
"We should also call on Russia to discontinue its support for the Transnistrian regime, which threatens Moldova's territorial integrity, and to fulfil the OSCE Summit decision of 1999 to withdraw its troops and arms from the territory of Moldova."
"We especially regret the lack of significant progress in the EU talks on visa facilitation and the readmission agreement with Moldova."
"The Council and the Commission should speed up the procedure, leading to the conclusion of a visa facilitation agreement with Moldova and ensure its implementation, as the current situation is unfair and discriminatory when Transnistrian citizens holding Russian passports are benefiting from the possibility to travel to the EU more easily than Moldovans."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, we are faced with a number of ongoing, frozen conflicts in the common neighbourhood which the European Union shares with Russia."
"Unfortunately, it is apparent to us that, years on, we are nowhere nearer resolving them, despite the EU's commitment to a negotiated political solution in a multilateral framework."
"We view recent developments in that region with great concern, since a possible escalation cannot be ruled out."
"On 17 September, there was a referendum in Transnistria on separation from Moldova, while, last week, the tension between Georgia and Russia surrounding the status of South-Ossetia escalated into a diplomatic crisis of the first order."
"Both events are incompatible with the commitment to finding a political solution to these conflicts within the framework of the OSCE."
"I think that the EU should hold firm to a plan of negotiations in a multilateral framework whereby the territorial integrity of Moldova and Georgia should be taken as read."
"We emphatically condemn unilateral steps, such as organising a referendum or so-called referendum, because we have not seen any evidence of a democratic plebiscite in a free and open environment."
"The use of threatening political rhetoric back and forth, or the unilateral announcement of sanctions are just as counterproductive."
"They do not bring us any closer to a solution and counteract the effort which the international community is making to encourage the parties to sing from the same hymn sheet."
"It has to be clear to all players that a sustainable solution can only be based on a political dialogue, with respect for democracy in the countries and regions involved."
"For the European Union, it is a necessary investment to give this process a shot in the arm."
"The European Union cannot solve these conflicts on its own."
"As long as we decide in favour of multilateral strategy, we can reasonably expect the other parties involved to move within these boundaries and to adhere to previous agreements, such as in Istanbul in 1999."
"Moreover, we can expect Russia to exercise a certain degree of caution, since it plays a crucial role in each of these conflicts."
"The active support Russia is giving the regime in Transnistria and the referenda, as well as the support to the separatist movement in South-Ossetia and Abkhazia do not, unfortunately, fall within this category."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SL) As Deputy Head of the Moldova Delegation, I keep a close eye on developments in this part of the world."
"The unconstitutional and internationally unrecognised referendum on Transnistrian independence which was recently held in that province was a serious step backwards for all parties concerned."
"On 10 October, Transnistria rejected a compromise plan put forward by the OSCE, under the leadership of the Belgian Foreign Minister, Karel de Gucht."
"The proposed plan envisaged granting the whole of Transnistria a relatively independent or semi-autonomous status within a Moldovan Federation."
"I personally regret the rejection of this compromise because an opportunity to create peace and stability throughout the whole of this unstable region has been lost."
"Instead, the deadlock between Transnistria and Moldova will continue to threaten both political and economic stability in this part of Europe."
"With the accession of Romania to the European Union in 2007, the borders of the European Union will extend as far as Moldova, so it is in our vital interests to invest the necessary time, energy and commitment in future negotiations."
"Finally, I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to bring their political clout to bear on fresh negotiations."
"Likewise, I call on Tiraspol to sit back down at the negotiating table and put an end to its delaying tactics."
"At the same time, I also call on Moscow to espouse more progressive policies in settling this dispute, because a more constructive approach on its part would demonstrate that Russia is serious about establishing a responsible and reliable partnership with the European Union."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, not long ago we were applauding the peaceful revolution in Georgia and encouraging its young leaders to establish true democracy in their country."
"Today, as we know, Georgia is experiencing difficulties in resolving conflicts with its separatist regions, and the escalating provocations from both sides are certainly not helping to resolve those conflicts peacefully."
"What is worse, armed intervention could embroil the entire Caucasus, which is something of which we are all conscious."
"That is why we must strongly urge the Georgian authorities to take a conciliatory approach and to constructively relaunch the peace process in South Ossetia."
"However, there are extenuating circumstances in Georgia: its neighbour, Russia, is not playing the conciliation game."
"For example, when, in Lahti last week, he compared South Ossetia to Kosovo, Mr Putin was adding fuel to the flames in the Caucasus, at the very time when he was expected to re-establish trust by normalising relations with his neighbours in Georgia."
"Whatever Russia may say, it certainly is involved in this conflict."
"Did it not issue Russian passports to the Georgian population of South Ossetia?"
"How valid can a referendum be if 80% of the participants were Russian citizens?"
"How neutral can we expect the peace-keeping forces in South Ossetia to be when they are predominantly Russian?"
"I will not even mention the unilateral Russian embargo or the ongoing deportations of Georgians in Russia, which are evidence of a desire to destabilise Georgia."
"So, then, the neighbourhood policy and greater cooperation with Russia are, of course, tools for us, but you will forgive me if I cannot share the Council's position on the replacement of the peace-keeping forces."
"I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we really do need to ask ourselves how the neutrality and impartiality of these forces can be guaranteed."
"We should perhaps - or should I say, definitely - be prepared to make a contribution, should it prove necessary, to the replacement of the peace-keeping forces."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, what is required above all else, when the security and stability of a country or region are at issue, is that all the parties concerned, with their various interests, should do nothing that might make the situation worse, and if the Moldovan constitution makes no provision for referendums, it goes without saying that any referendum that actually is carried out cannot be recognised."
"That much is abundantly clear."
"Since Transnistria has always been a part of the Republic of Moldova, it follows that it is absolutely justified to demand of our Russian partners - with whom relations are far from poor - that their troops should be withdrawn from the region."
"If we do not want matters to get worse, it naturally follows that we must promote trade - and with trade, change - rather than imposing bans on exports or imports."
"The Commission and the European Union have taken the line that we insist on the 5+2 negotiations being continued in full, or, indeed, on their resumption, and from this line we must not deviate."
"Fair partnership - and I am talking here about ours with Russia - also involves being able to tell one's partner, to their face, with what one is happy and with what one is not."
"It may well be that, in the past, thinking of certain of the European Union's own interests, we did not always do that with the necessary firmness."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union we believe in, the European Union of our dreams, the European Union the citizens of Europe want must surely be a Union that defends certain specific values, and does so on the international stage."
"As a matter of principle, therefore, we must condemn Russia's behaviour towards Georgia in recent weeks."
"I would like to call on all competent European Union bodies to make statements, take action in this matter and to defend Georgia's independence."
"I also call on these bodies to stand up for the fundamental principles of international law, such as independence and non-interference in each other's affairs."
"We are aware that Russia is inciting separatism in Georgia, but the events of the last two weeks are particularly worrying, as we have noted a tremendous increase in chauvinistic, nationalistic and anti-Georgian statement in Russia."
"In the last few days, we have learnt that works by Georgian artists exhibited in Moscow are being damaged."
"The hysterical tirades directed by the Moscow media against Georgians living in Russia mean that they do not feel safe on the territory of the Russian Federation."
"I call on the European Union, and on this House, to show unequivocal support for an independent, self-governing Georgia, which has every right to feel safe in a united Europe."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"The tensions in the southern Caucasus serve only to strengthen the argument for the urgent opening of multilateral negotiations in order to find a solution to the issue of the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"The conciliatory message that the European Union has recently sent to the Russian Federation regarding stepping up relations on various levels is not, and must not be, separate from an invitation to dialogue and to implementing all possible measures to try to resolve the worst crisis of the post-Soviet era without causing casualties."
"Mr Putin's statements on the alleged preparation of a Georgian military intervention, as well as the embargo on agricultural products from Georgia and Moldova and the interruption of key services, from transport to banking, cannot fail to affect the Georgian people, whether those who have emigrated to Russia, of whom a large proportion has been undeservedly and forcibly repatriated over the last few days, or those who live in Georgian territory and are often economically dependent on family members who have emigrated."
"Europe must not confine itself to playing the role of arbiter in this matter."
"Mr President, in 1996 I was a member of the Lithuanian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe when Russia made a solemn commitment to withdraw its troops from Moldova in 1997."
"Therefore, 2007 offers us an opportunity to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of that unfulfilled European commitment by Russia - one of many, of course."
"That could be a good time to write and publish a big book of Russia's unfulfilled international commitments."
"That is my first proposal to this House as it strives to obtain new commitments."
"Russia's policies in partitioning its smaller neighbours have caused loss and suffering to the people and several nations are still asking us to help."
"Can we continue to utter empty mantras in the style of the United Nations, while washing our hands of the hordes of refugees expelled from Abkhazia by invading Russians?"
"It is worth noting here the small note in Security Council Resolution No 1666 of 31 March 2006, on the eventual changes in the mandate of the CIS peacekeeping force in Georgia."
"In reality, the force is Russian and has little to do with peacekeeping, but is helping in the annexation of a population given en masse the passports of one foreign country before the land is subsequently annexed."
"If you really want peace in that part of Europe, we need real, possibly European, peacekeepers in South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"The alternative should be to rename these current peacekeepers 'criminality keepers'."
"That is my second proposal to Parliament: to make a choice between real peacekeepers and official 'criminality keepers'."
"(DE) Mr President, there are people in Russia - officials in particular - who, if they are listening to us, will get the idea that all we in this House want to do this week is bait the Russian bear."
"That is not what we want to do, but we do want to make it quite clear to Russia that we should try to resolve the problems that present themselves to us, ranging from energy to the neighbourhood we share, that we should do this together, and that Russia should confirm its commitment to multilateralism."
"When criticising America, we are often united when it comes to the unilateralism of that country's actions, but, when a country takes action in its own backyard, it needs to do so multilaterally, and Russia has recently opted for a different approach, and that is absolutely unacceptable."
"Firstly, we do, of course, need help from the countries involved."
"As we said the last time we visited it, we would like to see Georgia sign the commitment to non-violence."
"It is surely not enough to say 'we want to be able to defend ourselves', for that, of course, is something everyone is entitled to do."
"Secondly, we would like to see a definite offer made as regards the reintegration into Georgian society of the people of South Ossetia, and of Abkhazia too, for, while we are committed to the concept of a single, undivided Georgia, we do believe that that has to involve specific things being offered to these sections of its population."
"Even so, the main responsibility lies, just as it did before, with Russia."
"I find it incomprehensible how Russia has still not yet grasped that you do not make friends by supporting small separatist movements, some of which have been infiltrated by criminals, but rather by helping your neighbours to maintain their stability, and that is something that Georgia would surely be equally willing to do."
"What we absolutely must reject, though, is the expulsion of Georgians from Russia;"
"Arguing along the lines of 'yes, but they're illegals' has a cynical ring to it."
"Expelling the Georgians - especially at a time like this, considering the things that have happened - is every bit as inopportune in terms of timing as the energy price rises in Ukraine before the elections and in Belarus after them."
"It is absolutely indefensible and unacceptable."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, South Ossetia is one of those extremely vexing 'frozen' conflicts, and I remember being occupied with it myself when I, Madam President-in-Office, was sitting exactly where you are sitting now, fully five years ago."
"But that frozen conflict is now in danger of becoming a hot conflict."
"There is an urgent need to calm things down, and my group backs the appeal to both Russia and Georgia to soften their language and their actions."
"What has been done to Georgian citizens is wholly unacceptable, as is, of course, Russia's decision to cut all communications with Georgia."
"That President Putin has warned of the danger of bloodshed in the presence of Mr Vanhanen, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, must have been deeply embarrassing and is, in any case, totally unacceptable; so is the fact that Russia continues to issue passports to South Ossetians."
"That Georgia has threatened to resort to violence is also unacceptable."
"If the EU is serious about this matter, then it should be prepared to replace the Russian peacekeepers if that becomes necessary."
"This is no light commitment and it should be weighed up very seriously."
"But first let us use all the multilateral and European peace mechanisms that are in place."
"(DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as a member of this House's EU/Moldova group, I would like to return to that problem and make it very plain that this conflict is not about minorities."
"The social system in the Republic of Moldova is open both politically and socially, and characterised by co-existence and tolerance."
"If conflicts with minorities are advanced as an explanation, then that is done only with the intention of legitimising support for a Stalinist regime, something that is - and I want to impress this on the Russian Government and on President Putin - both politically problematic and highly dubious."
"The conflict over Transnistria is a conflict between Russia and the EU."
"I do not believe that peace will return to the region unless the troops are withdrawn, and so the Commission and the Council must exert much more pressure on the Russian Government to get it to do precisely that."
"The conflict in Moldova must not be sacrificed for the sake of our dealings with Russia over energy."
"(PL) Mr President, the situation in South Ossetia and Transdnistria makes it abundantly clear that Russia has not stopped thinking in terms of spheres of influence."
"Sixteen years have gone by, but Russia still has not become au fait with the need to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of independent countries along its borders."
"It resorts to trickery, spying, energy blackmail and to handing out Russian passports, in order to weaken Georgia and Moldova, its independent neighbours, and deprive them of parts of their territory."
"Contrary to our expectations, Russia is not playing a stabilising role in the region."
"The opposite is actually the case."
"The more political power Russia wields, the more conflicts, tension and even wars there are."
"Does all this amount to a policy that is acceptable to the European Union?"
"Is it possible to develop an unconditional strategic partnership with a country that stoops to these methods?"
"I trust that this is not the case, and therefore urge the House to support the joint resolution, together with the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"(DE) Mr President, the Republic of Moldova would, in nine and a half weeks' time, be becoming a Member State of the European Union, had it not been for the Hitler-Stalin Pact under which it was separated from Romania, and that shows just how close to us this whole business is."
"Georgia - which is a member of the Council of Europe - fell victim to Russian or Soviet colonialism on two occasions, the first time under the Tsars, and the second in the 1920s, when Soviet troops smothered the nations of the Caucasus at birth."
"What we have today is a post-colonial situation in which Russia is unwilling to make restitution for what it did to the region in the days when it was a colonial power or when it was the totalitarian Soviet Union, and is instead engaged in a post-colonial policy of dominating nations and extorting their raw materials from them, which involves it in either exploiting conflicts between nationalities or, to some extent, artificially creating them."
"It is for that reason that there is only one response; as Mr Landsbergis said, we have to be prepared to have a structured, peace-keeping presence - be it international or European - wherever in the world conflict arises, whether in Transnistria or Abkhazia, South Ossetia or Chechnya, so that the situation can be brought under international control once and for all."
"If Russia has an interest in allowing transparency to prevail, then that is the right solution, but that is not what Russia wants."
"What Russia wants, now as in the past, is for its policy of dominance to be carried on in the shadows, and that is why I, too, find it regrettable that this report is being held after the summit rather than having been held before it, as we had wanted."
"What Mr Putin wanted was for the spotlight to be upon him as he nurtured illusions, and, now, in the shadow of the summit, we are sweeping up the pieces."
"All I can do is to appeal to the Council and the Commission to at length get round to talking about Russian policy in an unambiguous, frank, and rational way with explicit reference to human rights."
"Let no bones be made about the fact that that sort of forthright talk is the only language Russia understands."
"We have here not only enough material for a white paper on Russia's broken promises, as Mr Landsbergis said, but also enough for one on the West's self-deception."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, the Transnistria question is largely a question of the European Union's relations with Russia."
"The problem is in stalemate, but it is in Russia's power to solve it, but if it is to do so, it must implement the promise it made at the OSCE Istanbul summit in 1999; that is, to withdraw its troops from Moldovan territory."
"This is something it should have done as long ago as 2002."
"Good friends must be bold and forthright."
"In Russia such friends are valued."
"We here have been fearful and have beaten around the bush."
"Thus, as of 1 January we will acquire a serious source of instability right beside the European Union."
"I would like to reiterate three facts about Transnistria."
"First of all, the Transnistrian regime does not seek independence, but rather union with Russia, which lies 800 km away."
"The region has belonged to Moldova and Ukraine, but never to Russia."
"Secondly, the inhabitants of Transnistria are not a uniform ethnic group."
"Most of them are Moldovans, making up 40 percent of the population, with Ukrainians at nearly 28 percent, and the Russian ethnic group occupying third place."
"Third, the inhabitants of Transnistria would certainly enjoy more democracy and freedom under the government in Chisinau than they do at present."
"Chisinau has never persecuted the non-Moldovan population of Transnistria."
"Russia will take no action without pressure from us."
"We should not be afraid of exerting pressure. And our relations with Russia should be a two-way street that is mutually beneficial for both sides."
"We may need Russian energy, but Russia needs favours from us too, not to mention our European market."
"It is time to remind Russia of what we have given, and to demand favours in return."
"Finally, the 5+2 negotiations must continue at all costs."
"We have a good resolution, so let us adopt it."
"Mr President, in my opinion, among all the reasonable political considerations referred to in the current text, there is one significant omission: the real-life situations of the individuals living in the areas concerned."
"Those condemning the issue of Russian passports for the residents of these regions would do well to remind themselves of the circumstances under which these people found themselves as citizens or non-citizens of newly independent states formed from the former Soviet republics."
"These are republics whose borders, in the case of the Caucasus, were arbitrarily drawn by Stalin, or, in the case of Transnistria, were changed under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact."
"After the dissolution of the federal state, the USSR, no sequential transition period was set out during which people could have resolved issues such as family reunification, citizenship, and so on. These people mostly need Russian passports to travel to Russia, not to the EU, as was claimed."
". - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, Russia's desire to influence the fate of those of its neighbouring states that have turned to the Western model of development, is apparent both in its intervention in Ukraine's internal affairs and in the case of Moldova and Georgia."
"The European Union has an interest in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict between Russia and Georgia."
"To that end, firstly, since CIS peace-keeping forces in South Ossetia are not able to carry out their task, they should be replaced by international peace-keepers."
"Secondly, Russia ought to refrain from military exercises in the close vicinity of Georgia's territory."
"Thirdly, there must be an immediate end to violations of the rights of Georgia's citizens, which are beginning to verge on ethnic cleansing, and also the blockade on Georgian goods."
"Fourthly, respecting the integrity of Georgia's territory, the lawfulness of the issue of Russian passports in Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be reviewed, in order to prevent a repetition of the Transnistria scenario."
"Finally, both states should refrain from activities and statements which might foster any worsening of relations."
"Mr President, as far as the background to this debate is concerned, we need a very strong EU commitment in the form of peacekeeping forces to try to prevent the spread of those dangerous conflicts."
"Let us be clear: these quasi-breakaway regions, or frozen conflicts, are being systematically used as leverage by the Russian Government to retain its influence over the post-Soviet neighbourhood."
"Without the continued presence of Russian troops - as has been stated by my colleague, Mrs Mikko - the conflicts we now have to deal with would probably have disappeared."
"Part of the problem seems to be fear of the possible spreading of 'Rose revolutions' and fear of genuine democratic change in Russia itself, which is long overdue."
"We therefore need to react to acts by the Russian Government which defy all norms of international behaviour, such as cutting off communications, economic blockades and launching waves of xenophobia in Russia itself."
"The EU of 25 should declare such acts absolutely unacceptable, especially by the country currently holding the Presidency of the Council of Europe."
"In the European Parliament's resolution we call on Russia finally to accept the new realities that have emerged after the end of the Cold War and to stop thinking and operating in terms of exclusive zones of influence."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to speak about Moldova."
"Moldova is a country whose problems are due to historical factors, its geopolitical position and its current situation, which has arisen as a result of the balance of power within the country as well as external influences."
"It should be clearly understood that the problems relating to Moldova's security in its broadest sense, and also to its development, cannot be resolved by Moldova's efforts alone."
"A joint effort is needed, involving not only Moldova's neighbours, such as Ukraine and Romania, but also vital aid from the European Union and the United States."
"Of course, Russian goodwill is essential, too."
"Clearly, the imposition of an embargo on the import of agricultural produce and the problems concerning the energy supply are clearly related to Moldova's positive stance with respect to integration with the European Union."
"Therefore, we cannot abandon Moldova."
"Morally, it is entitled to our aid and we can certainly afford to provide it."
"(PL) Mr President, I fully support the draft resolution drawn up by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group concerning Transdnistria, which is part of Moldova."
"I wish to express my admiration for the Georgian nation, which desires to independently decide the direction of its own foreign policy."
"In this matter, it should and must rely on the solidarity of the Member States of the European Union."
"The Georgian authorities are rightly demanding that the rights of their small nation be respected by the large Russian nation."
"However, it would be good, and here I differ somewhat from the previous speakers, if these authorities also turned their attention to upholding the rights of minorities within their own country."
"I have in mind religious minorities, for example."
"Allow me to refer to the recent attacks on Catholics in Tiblisi."
"There is no other way to describe the assault by 60 individuals on a brand new church built to serve the Assyrian, that is to say, the Chaldean Catholic community."
"This assault was the work of members of the Orthodox Church, who mostly identify with Russian culture."
"In another area of Tiblisi, members of the Orthodox Church are putting pressure on the authorities to prevent the opening of a Catholic church."
"Sadly, there have been many instances of religious intolerance in Georgia in recent years."
"The victims have included not only Catholics but also Baptists, Pentecostalists, and Jehovah's Witnesses."
"I trust the Georgian authorities will take strong action against these acts of violence that are damaging Georgia's reputation on the international scene."
"I am sure that most political groups in this House will be of a similar opinion."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, firstly may I say thank you for this wide-ranging debate."
"We have been talking in this Chamber today since the morning on relations between the European Union and Russia."
"The sheer scope of these relations is reflected in the fact that now even at this point in the proceedings it is EU-Russia relations that have figured prominently in Members' speeches."
"Relations between the European Union and Russia have a valuable feature: these days we are able to discuss everything round the table, including the difficult areas and the commitments made by Russia."
"The next excellent opportunity for such discussions is in November, when the Permanent Partnership Council meeting of EU and Russian Foreign Ministers is held, and after that at the end of November at the EU-Russia Summit."
"The summit held between the EU and Ukraine the day after tomorrow in Helsinki will undoubtedly feature talks on these issues."
"As I said in my opening speech, Union action on Moldova and Transnistria is specifically intended to aid and firm up Moldovan unity."
"In this the European Neighbourhood Policy is a crucial instrument."
"As part of this cooperation we in the Council are expecting a Commission proposal to begin talks on visa flexibility before the end of this year."
"Relations between Georgia and Russia were last discussed yesterday on the COPS Committee with reference to the proposals by the Special Representative to find new means of supporting a peaceful solution to this difficult situation in the best possible way."
"Fortunately, there are encouraging signs that dialogue between Georgia and Russia is to get under way, as the countries' Foreign Ministers intend to meet in Moscow at the beginning of November."
"That is a very positive start to what will hopefully be the resumption of talks."
"The basic principle that the European Union will endeavour to promote a peaceful solution to the crisis between Georgia and Russia and can do so in many ways applies to this crisis in just the same way as it does to many other crises around the world."
"Unless the parties themselves actually commit to a peaceful solution, however, they cannot be forced to do so from the outside."
"Mr President, that was a very interesting discussion on both subjects."
"I thank Members for their comments, which we shall, of course, take into account as much as we can."
"I think Parliament could enhance its efforts and thus complete and complement what we are doing concerning Moldova, with its counterparts in the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee."
"We need to continue to encourage Moldova to press on with key reforms on democracy, the rule of law and human rights and to improve the business climate."
"We must help Moldova to become more attractive for the population, even in Transnistria."
"With regard to the question of macro-financial assistance, we have just prepared a package of EUR 45 million that will be allocated to Moldova, because it is highly important that we give them special assistance."
"Let me say that since 1991 the whole assistance programme has amounted to some EUR 230 million."
"Our annual assistance budget has increased over the last few years and will increase further under the ENPI."
"On visa facilitation for Moldova, we are just working towards the proposals for negotiating directives and also for the readmission agreements."
"We have encouraged the Member States to set up a joint visa application centre in Chisinau."
"Once established, this should be an effective facilitation mechanism for Moldovan citizens, who would then no longer need to travel to neighbouring countries to apply for visas."
"Let me also say that if there is a possibility of coming up with a mandate at the end of this year, then the visa fee would stay at EUR 35 and not go up to EUR 60, which would be very important for the very poor people of Moldova."
"On Georgia, we had a lengthy discussion with Foreign Minister Lavrov."
"The most important thing is that both sides tone down their public rhetoric as a first step and then both sides try to come up with diplomatic dialogues -again, back to normal."
"The Georgian leadership must avoid any actions that could heighten tension."
"That is what we told Mr Saakashvili."
"With the help of our special representatives and, of course, all of us, we hope that the situation will return to normal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30."
"Export of toxic waste to Africa - Use of criminal law to protect the environment (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the"
"statement by the Council and the Commission on the export of toxic waste to Africa,"
"oral question to the Council by Mr Florenz on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on environmental protection: combating crime, criminal offences and penalties B6-0438/2006) and"
"oral question to the Commission by Mr Florenz on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on environmental protection: combating crime, criminal offences and penalties B6-0439/2006)"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is very concerned about the environmental disaster that came to light some time ago in the Ivory Coast in connection with the vessel Probo Koala."
"As the country to hold the Presidency of the Council, Finland believes that it is very important that this regrettable event be looked into thoroughly."
"Once again the world is made aware of the serious threats posed by moving waste to the developing countries."
"This is a problem that has to be addressed through decisive action."
"The European Union has stated that it is prepared, in collaboration with the United Nations, to help protect human health and the environment wherever the effects of the incident are particularly serious."
"Recent events in West Africa have also been a reminder to us of how important it is to implement agreements on transboundary movements of waste and the supervision of waste management effectively."
"These are essentially the Basel Convention and the amendment to it tabled in 1995, the Marpol Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, and local maritime conservation agreements."
"The amendment to the Basel Convention banned the export of hazardous wastes from EU and OECD countries, as well as Liechtenstein, to other countries."
"It is obviously just as important to monitor compliance with these agreements."
"The Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes is to be held at the end of November in Nairobi."
"The European Union's position at this conference is at present being drafted by the Council in respect of all the issues on the agenda. These include illegal movements of waste, the unloading of ships, funding the agreement, synergies between the waste and chemicals clusters and monitoring the strategic plan to implement the Convention."
"Part of this preparation work took the form of a wide-ranging debate by the Environment Council on 23 October, that is to say the day before last, at the end of which the Chairman gave his conclusions on the EU's preparations for the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention."
"These take the view that it is important to intervene decisively and effectively in illegal transboundary movements of hazardous wastes."
"It is important that, in addition to the countries that have now ratified the amendment regarding the export ban on hazardous waste, as many other countries as possible do likewise, so that it might enter into force worldwide as soon as possible."
"As you know, the ban is already in force in all the EU Member States, because it was implemented in its entirety with the Regulation on movement of waste."
"Almost all the EU countries have also ratified the amendment."
"The reformed EU Regulation on the movement of waste, which comes into force next July, also contains provisions which may help improve cooperation on the implementation of the Regulation at both Member State and EU level."
"A directive has also been issued on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues, compliance with which may also be relevant to the Probo Koala case."
"In a debate the day before last, Ministers of the Environment also highlighted the fact that effective implementation of existing legislation is a primary aim of the EU."
"Crucial to the prevention of illegal movements of waste is increased harmonisation of laws on the environment and navigation, especially at international level, and enhanced cooperation between authorities."
"What is most important is that all types of waste are treated in a way that is environmentally acceptable, regardless of where this takes place."
"This must be the priority goal too when vessels are scrapped."
"The Chairman's conclusions also stressed that developing countries need external help in their endeavours to implement the Basel Convention and manage waste in a way that is environmentally acceptable."
"Developing countries also need to make waste management part of their strategies for reducing poverty and for sustainable development."
"At the Environment Council meeting the Presidency also met a delegation from the Ivory Coast, which gave an update on the situation."
"The magnitude of the catastrophe is staggering: in addition to the loss of many human lives, there is a huge number of urgent health problems."
"The disaster also has major implications for the ecology, livelihoods, human habitation and community action."
"At present, the key areas of importance are the cleaning up of polluted areas and sewage networks and attending to the damage caused to people and businesses."
"In the Ivory Coast an international and national report are being compiled on what took place, including a criminal investigation."
"Moreover, in certain countries, such as the Netherlands and Estonia, a criminal investigation has been started with a view to taking a thorough look at the circumstances connected with the Probo Koala case."
"I will now move on to deal with the oral question put by Karl-Heinz Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"The Member States of the European Union think it important that laws and cooperation should be developed within the EU framework to prevent and investigate environmental crimes and enforce penal responsibility."
"Environmental crimes are by nature international, because the effects of illegal emissions extend a long way across national frontiers."
"As the honourable Member says in his question, the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 13 September 2005, however, overturned the Council Framework Decision of 27 January 2003 on the protection of the environment through criminal law."
"On 25 November 2005 the Commission submitted a communication to the European Parliament and to the Council on the consequences of the judgment passed by the Court of Justice."
"The Court's judgment and the Commission's communication were discussed at the informal meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs held in Vienna in January 2006 and they were examined by the Council in Brussels on 21 February this year."
"In these discussions the Commission said it wanted to think more about how to proceed with regard to the framework decisions taken earlier by the Council, decisions that might need re-examining in the light of the decision by the Court of Justice."
"This line of reasoning would also apply to the Framework Decision that was overturned by the Court already referred to."
"That being the case, the Council is awaiting a reaction from the Commission."
"It may deliver an amended version of the proposal it put forward in 2001 and of the proposal for a directive it amended in 2002 or it may put forward an entirely new proposal"
"Μember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, the recent incident of the dumping of toxic waste in Côte d'Ivoire has drastic consequences."
"At least 10 people died and thousands were poisoned and needed hospital treatment."
"Although the actual circumstances under which this repulsive environmental crime was committed have not yet been clarified, there is now an even more urgent need for the strict application of the ban on exports of dangerous waste to Africa."
"The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, the United Nations and the authorities in Côte d'Ivoire, is seeking in various ways for the damage caused to be restored and for suitable action to be taken to combat the illegal activities which may have taken place."
"When the incident occurred, representatives of the Commission - and special teams from the Member States - visited the scene in order to assist the victims and help to protect the natural environment."
"The Commission is closely monitoring developments in Côte d'Ivoire and is in constant contact with the country's authorities."
"On Monday I and the Presidency met the delegation from Côte d'Ivoire, which included three ministers."
"The institutions and the Member States of the European Union need to examine every possible means of supporting the victims in Côte d'Ivoire and of doing the best they can to eliminate the pollution."
"Criminal investigations are being carried out at the moment in various Member States, with which we are in contact. I personally, following the return of the Probo Koala to the European Union, went to the port of Paldiski in Estonia on 28 September in order to support these investigations and obtain the latest information."
"If we look beyond the incident in Côte d'Ivoire, we shall see that there is a serious vacuum in compliance by the Member States with the European Union regulation on movements of waste."
"This regulation contains clear rules banning exports of dangerous waste to developing countries."
"These rules are to become even stricter and, as of July next year, the Member States will be obliged to conduct on-site controls and inspections and to cooperate in the event of illegal movements of waste."
"However, the mere fact that rules exist does not mean a thing if they are not also correctly applied in practice."
"The legal loopholes must be plugged with strict complementary measures pertaining to its proper application."
"Environmental crime is one of the most serious problems which the Community is called upon to combat."
"The environmental damage which may be caused is huge."
"It is often part of international organised crime, which makes it difficult but imperative to stamp out."
"Provision for effective sanctions, including criminal sanctions, is necessary for the proper application of Community environmental legislation."
"That is precisely why urgent action is needed at Community level."
"In 2001, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on environmental protection through penal law."
"The objective of this proposal was, on the one hand, the introduction throughout the Community of a minimum number of criminal environmental offences and, on the other hand, the punishment of such infringements with effective criminal sanctions in all the Member States."
"It is a sad fact that the Council did not adopt the Commission proposal. The proposal was based on Article 175 of the Treaty and was to have been approved under the codecision procedure."
"The Council did not agree with the legal basis and decided to issue a framework decision on the basis of the third pillar, rather than the directive we had proposed."
"In the opinion of the European Commission, this choice of means was not legally correct and would have made it impossible to control the transposition into national law of the framework decision and the application of it by the Member States."
"In clear opposition to the Council, the European Parliament fully supported the Commission proposal and also supported the Commission in the matter when it was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"I wish to highlight the particular importance of this good cooperation between our institutions and I trust that we shall continue in this way as the matter develops."
"With the ruling by the Court of Justice, it has now been clarified that measures of a penal nature needed in order to safeguard the effective application of environmental policy may be adopted within the framework of the first pillar."
"The Council's framework decision infringed the Community's powers on the basis of the Treaty and had to be reversed."
"The European Commission is particularly satisfied with this ruling by the Court."
"This is not a ruling regulating a simple technical point; it is of decisive importance in clarifying the rules of the Treaty as far as the dividing line between the first and third pillars is concerned."
"It has major institutional repercussions, because it clarifies that the measures at issue must be taken under the codecision procedure, which means the full participation of the European Parliament."
"Similarly, within the framework of the first pillar, national application measures come under the control of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which does not apply to third pillar measures."
"A directive on environmental protection through penal law - within the framework of the first pillar - will provide better environmental protection and, at the same time, is a more democratic method in the legislative procedure."
"Unfortunately, in the meantime, valuable time has been lost."
"Environmental crimes are still being committed and we must adopt the necessary legal measures to combat them."
"We have analysed and discussed in the Commission the various options for following up the Court ruling."
"We examined two options in particular: for the Commission 2001 proposal to stay as it is and for us to call on the other institutions to continue the codecision procedure or for a new Commission proposal to be submitted."
"We preferred the second option, in order to take account of the Court ruling."
"The initial proposal dates from 2001, since when numerous changes have been made to environmental legislation; consequently, the proposal needs to be adapted accordingly."
"Finally, there have been new developments in the field of European cooperation on penal law matters, which also need to be taken into account in the proposal."
"We must ensure that the proposal is in keeping with other penal acts adopted at European level."
"Today we are at the state of preparing the new proposal for a directive on environmental protection through penal law."
"The first step was, as I said, to examine in detail the Court ruling and its repercussions and for a detailed comparison to be made of the various acts which already apply."
"We then prepared an impact study comparing the pros and cons of the various options."
"Following that, the proposal will be finalised and I hope that it will be approved before the end of 2006."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the dumping of toxic waste on Côte d'Ivoire is not only scandalous, but also a truly revolting act, and we are, of course, at liberty to do no more than commiserate with the victims and lament the serious injuries caused to people, but if we do not, in the same breath, ask questions as to what lies behind this, that is no more than hypocritical, and you can count me out."
"That is why I want there to be no doubt about the fact that this is a humanitarian and environmental disaster and scandal."
"I never cease to be astonished that, while we in this House have introduced the 'name and shame' principle to apply to others, for example to those engaged in the production of meat, so that, if someone misbehaves, his name is made known and appears in the newspapers, the same does not happen with the Member States of the EU, and that is most remarkable."
"The President-in-Office of the Council did, of course, put these things in their proper chronological order, while it was Commissioner Dimas who explained why Europe's legislation does not work, the actual reason being that the Council is too timid, and when I say that I certainly do not mean the President-in-Office or her country, but I do mean to say that, in matters affecting more than one country, one must - as she has rightly recognised - summon up the nerve to take cross-border action with the aim of prosecuting and punishing offences."
"If, then, the Commission makes a proposal to that effect, whilst the Council is graciously pleased to cast doubt on the legal basis for it, and both the Commission and this House are subject to it, since the Council, with its blocking minority, does not allow the law to come into effect, that is something that a representative of the people, that is to say one of those who are meant to keep an eye on what governments are doing, cannot but find extremely vexatious."
"That must not be allowed to happen, and there must be no more timidity from the Council in this matter."
"I really do implore you to tell your colleagues that the chairman of the committee is very angry, for complaints after the event are of no avail if we have not done our homework beforehand - which we have, yet you have, so to speak, drawn a line right through it."
"That is not acceptable."
"I think the Council would do better in future to concern itself once more with the transposition of European regulations."
"I have now been a Member of this House for a very long time, and in that time we have discussed and adopted a very large number of things, but when it comes to actually implementing them, we seem to lose our nerve."
"I live on the border with a neighbouring country, that loveable place called the Netherlands, and it took us an incredibly long time to come to an agreement as to how we might catch criminals."
"We have, fortunately, moved on from that, but, where the prosecution of waste crime is concerned, we have not yet emerged from Noah's Ark, and that, Madam President-in-Office, is something you must not be content with."
"You need to use the last months of your presidency to get seriously stuck in to supporting the Commissioner and motivating him to do something about this."
"There are many areas in which implementation and transposition are lacking."
"I would very much like to know whether the country in which the toxic waste was dumped actually gave its consent to that being done, for if it did not, this poisonous stuff ought not to have been brought there in the first place."
"There are so many rules and regulations applicable to this, and all that is needed is for us to implement them with courage and understanding."
"It is also worthy of note, by the way, that this is a scandal not only as regards health and the environment, but also in terms of competition."
"If we do not close this loophole in our own laws and in the Basle Convention, we will thereby be encouraging people who are less than particular about compliance with the law to make the contamination of the environment an exportable commodity, and to do so is hypocrisy, for while we in Europe talk about our high standards, we also open up any number of loopholes that make it possible for this stuff to be exported, and it is Commissioner Dimas - the poor chap - and, with him, the Commission, who has to carry the can for it, even though I have to tell the President-in-Office that the Commission, in this instance, is quite utterly blameless."
"Our two institutions were on the right track."
"We would ask you to act on the suggestions that the Commission and this House have made in this matter, for they are good ones."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Ivory Coast is an unstable country that has been made more unstable by environmental crime which has flowed from our continent down to Africa; with a Dutch ship and Dutch port authorities, a Greek-owned ship flying the Panamanian flag, then Ivorian companies and trucks dumping petrochemicals, killing - according to the United Nations - 12 people, and resulting in 104 000 people - again according to the United Nations - having medical care needs."
"That ship unloaded 500 tonnes of chemical waste into trucks which dumped it in 15 separate sites around Abidjan, a city of 5 million people."
"The United Nations Environment Programme has said that this is clearly a crime, although they say they do not yet know who was responsible, or the actual nature of that crime."
"What we do know is that the Basel Convention should have stopped this crime and has failed to do so, and we need to know why."
"The Ivory Coast is a long way away; most countries in Africa do not have strong laws to protect human and environmental health from the effects of hazardous waste, but that is no reason for us here in Strasbourg to walk away from this case and its lessons."
"We want safe disposal, not toxic parcel-passing."
"We want - and I say this directly to you, Commissioner - those countries that have not yet ratified that convention, to ratify it; they include Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta and Slovenia."
"I hope you will pursue them and I hope the Council will pursue them, too."
"Crime and responsibility and judgment are matters for the courts, but investigation and the plugging of legal loopholes are our responsibility; so is helping ACP countries to meet high standards in hazardous waste disposal; so is helping the victims of these appalling events - we think particularly of the children in the Ivory Coast who have been made to suffer because of them; so is ensuring that the Commission and the Dutch authorities and the EEA and the Government of the Ivory Coast all do their best to identify and pursue the perpetrators of this crime."
"If the law is defective, then it must be amended."
"If the law is adequate, then it must be enforced."
"We know, though, that the law is flouted in too many cases."
"We know that it is too easy to avoid the cost of responsible safe disposal by dumping, by going outside OECD countries and by using national and international cowboys, and that is what we must ensure is brought to an end."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament warmly endorses the views expressed by the previous two speakers."
"How is it possible that the Proba Koala was not stopped from causing so much pollution?"
"Although this incident should have set all the red lights flashing, the Dutch Government, which should ultimately carry the can, is instead washing its hands in legal innocence."
"It refuses to honestly admit to mistakes, is reluctant to set up a fund for the victims in Ivory Coast, is passing the buck, and is refusing to take moral and financial responsibility."
"This is how the disappointing conduct of the Dutch Government can be summed up."
"That is why I would ask the Commission whether it is prepared to bring pressure to bear on the Netherlands to grant legal support to Ivory Coast and also to ensure that, in consultation with the UN, an emergency fund is set up for the victims of this disaster."
"My African parliamentary counterparts have the feeling that the Netherlands and Europe, despite the Basel Convention, failed to guard them from this criminal behaviour."
"It is apparently acceptable to use Africa as a dumping ground."
"This creates a sense of inferiority which undermines a credible partnership between Africa and Europe, and has dealt our relations a huge blow."
"What steps do the Finnish Presidency and the Commission intend to take in the direction of Ivory Coast and the African Union?"
"Is the Commission prepared to draft proposals for measures to put an end to this dumping if possible, and where rules apply, to get them implemented?"
"Is the Commission prepared to draw up a black list, annually, of countries and transnational companies that are involved in the illegal dumping of chemical waste in developing countries?"
"Are the Commission and Council prepared to make legislative proposals in order to plug the loopholes in the Basel Convention, among other things, with the obligation on ships leaving Europe to leave their bilge water with the responsible authorities in the last EU port at which they call?"
"Finally, is the Commission prepared to take the necessary steps to assist developing countries in the identification of harmful substances and to guarantee that bilge water that is produced at sea is processed safely?"
"I count on the Commission's support and I hope that the Council will call the Netherlands to account about its responsibility; the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was right to do the same with the Council."
"We have had plenty of fine words, now we want to see them translated into practice, and the laws enforced."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) This year, the European Union reviewed the Sustainable Development Strategy, which was adopted in 2001 and enhanced with an external dimension in Barcelona in 2002."
"The European Union's cooperation policy in support of development enables poverty to be fought and developing countries gradually integrated into the global economy."
"How do we pursue these objectives?"
"What we want is the growth of developing countries, environmental protection and reduction of the greenhouse effect, but what do we do to this end?"
"Due to toxic waste pollution in Ivory Coast, 85 000 people suffered ill-health and eight died."
"Toxic substances were shipped from Amsterdam by the Dutch company Trafigura Beheer BV."
"They, in Amsterdam, were aware of the waste's toxic nature; nevertheless, due to high costs, the cheap alternative of disposal in Ivory Coast was chosen."
"Most African countries have no regulations concerning the protection of the environment against hazardous waste."
"Used computers are stored in Nigeria, radioactive waste in Somalia and chlorine in Cameroon, despite the regulations adopted by the EU in 1994 and 1997 to prohibit the export of waste."
"In 2002, this House approved the Directive on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law at its first reading."
"However, the first reading was also the last."
"We must therefore resume debate on the Directive as soon as possible."
"The Commission and the Netherlands must investigate the case of Ivory Coast, find the perpetrators, eliminate the effects and pay compensatory damages to the victims."
"Without serious measures the EU development cooperation policy for the support and sustainable development of developing countries will be hard to implement, and the EU stands to lose face."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) It is a tragedy that has struck Côte d'Ivoire, and we all express our sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the criminal behaviour engaged in by European companies."
"The victims must be given all the support that can be offered to them as events unfold."
"Ever since 1997, we have had a ban on exports of hazardous waste to countries outside the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)."
"It is time to ensure that it is properly implemented."
"It is unacceptable that the Dutch authorities should not have taken responsibility when they had the chance to stop the vessel."
"All credit to Estonia, which did what needed to be done."
"I wish to thank Commissioner Dimas for quickly having realised how serious the situation was."
"A proposal by the Commission is now needed quickly in the interests of more stringent compliance with the rules."
"We need to make sure that every time someone undertakes to transport hazardous material, there is someone to take personal responsibility and to sign an attestation of liability."
"The board of directors and managing director must also be given greater personal responsibility."
"Otherwise, traditions with unclear and complicated conditions of liability will make it difficult to get to grips with irresponsible transporters and shipowners."
"Africa has suffered enough under colonialism and slavery and from the exploitation of its natural resources."
"If we are to call ourselves civilised, we must now put a stop to this latest form of neo-colonialism whereby we dump our waste in poorer countries."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) My group strongly endorses all that has been said so far, as well as the resolution that draws attention to the toxic waste scandal involving the Proba Koala in Ivory Coast, which has, so far, claimed dozens of lives and as a result of which tens of thousands of people were hospitalised; the implications for the environment and public health are as yet incalculable."
"There is still much uncertainty as to what will happen with the poison and the contaminated crew."
"Scandalous practices of this kind that show no respect for the environment or citizens, and whereby governments and parties responsible, consciously or unconsciously, wash their hands of their obligations, must at any rate be addressed at every possible level."
"Member States, in this case the Netherlands, must be called to account."
"My observer, who travelled to Estonia on my behalf, totally agrees with Commissioner Dimas when he says that this is only the tip of the iceberg."
"This type of toxin should never have left the European Union in the first pace, and European and international rules have been flouted."
"Having been denied the opportunity to speak with the crew of the Probo Koala on several occasions, despite prior permission, I can only conclude that various authorities are playing a very underhand game with human lives."
"Transparency is vital to the public."
"Tough tit-for-tat policy is necessary in order to prevent, or discourage, repetition."
"I would argue in favour of drawing up a black list of waste dumpers and publicising agreements concluded with developing countries in the area of waste processing."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I concur with the views of all previous speakers."
"What came to pass in Ivory Coast with the waste from the ship Proba Koala is appalling and should never have happened."
"What is beyond doubt is that this involved the illegal transport of waste."
"The Basel Convention contains an express ban on the transport of harmful waste to non-OECD countries, which has thus been flouted."
"That the adherence to current legislation concerning the transport of waste substances is leaving a great deal to be desired comes as no surprise."
"Random tests in Great Britain and France show that rules are flouted in 75% to 100% of all waste transports."
"For the European Parliament, whilst effective enforcement and stricter controls were a tough bargaining point during the negotiations in the run-up to the new resolution on the transport of waste substances, our wishes have only partly been granted."
"At the moment, we are not so desperate for fresh rules or a European minimum penalty for infringement, as Commissioner Dimas suggests."
"What we need first of all is the enforcement of existing rules."
"The Commission and Member States would do well to do something about this once and for all."
"(DE) Mr President, we will soon be getting back several thousand tonnes of contaminated material along with the 500 tonnes illegally dumped in Africa, so that many times the original amount of toxic waste will be finding its way back to Europe, and this is something for which preparations need to be made."
"Generally speaking, what is known as the Basle Convention appears to be working reasonably well."
"Officially, we are told that there has been a considerable reduction in exports of toxic waste to Africa, but that is contradicted by spot checks carried out in European ports, in which half of all the declarations of the non-toxicity of loads of waste turned out to be false, and so what is called for in this area, if the problem of the black market in toxic waste is to be got under control, is more checks and more cooperation."
"We will also have to grapple with the problems surrounding the burgeoning trade in electrical waste and maritime wrecks, for which as yet no international conventions exist."
"In order to deal the ultimate blow to the waste mafia, we will no doubt have to have a blacklist of the businesses that are involved in schemes of this kind."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this toxic waste affair is certainly criminal - it is as if the South was the North's dustbin."
"And if we call it a crime, there must be guilty parties and punishments, but so far impunity and apathy are winning the day."
"It is true that the EU has legislation on the transport of toxic waste - the export of such waste has been banned since 1997, under the Basel Convention - but up to now this ban has been systematically flouted."
"This laissez-faire attitude is criminal, and the dead of Abidjan are its victims."
"The Union now needs to act, and act fast, to put a stop to the irresponsibility and the impunity."
"It must enforce the existing legislation, in particular the directive of July 2006 that requires the Member States to establish inspection networks."
"It must strengthen this legislation where necessary, to enable fast and effective sanctions, as both the Commission and the European Parliament have been demanding since 2001."
"Finally, it must help countries in Africa to draw up protective legislation."
"Commissioner, we support your proactive statements, but we now have to move on to concrete action."
"That is what we expect from the Council, in particular."
"(FR) Ladies and gentlemen, what a mish-mash!"
"The few citizens who take an interest in our debates will find it very difficult to understand why, this afternoon, we are mixing up a debate on pollution in Ivory Coast with another on a judgment that tramples over the subsidiarity principle."
"The fact that the judgment of 13 September 2005 was issued on the subject of an environmental directive does not change the fact that it is actually worded as a judgment on the principle of the communitisation of criminal law."
"This is tantamount to a constitutional revolution, because, as we know, at least nine other competences are in the process of being absorbed by the European Union, with no treaty, including criminal law on immigration and intellectual property law."
"There certainly is pollution, ladies and gentlemen - the Court of Justice's judicial pollution of the European treaties."
"In this confused and ill-thought-out judgment, there are no textual references and no clear legal principles."
"Far-fetched and poorly explained considerations of questionable relevance lead to a hasty and slipshod conclusion."
"We know how it works: fuzzy conclusions demand the indefinite extension of the European Union's competences, then justify the interpretation of the Commission, which, finally, legitimises the transfer of powers from the States to the Court."
"Those who, like us, were wary of the substantial extension of the EU's objectives in Article I-3 of the draft Constitution were quite right to be concerned."
"The Commissioners and the judges have no intention of bending to the will of the people, and have decided to disregard their refusal to ratify a draft Constitution that transferred criminal matters into the ordinary Community legislative procedure."
"This judgment is a distortion of the will of those who signed and ratified the European treaties."
"It is a judicial coup d'état."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming up to some important deadlines."
"Our people are watching us and will soon be calling us to account."
"Will there be any sincere democrats here to stand up to this shameless tyranny?"
"(NL) Mr President, it is forbidden to export waste to developing countries."
"That is beyond question."
"The ban does not, however, apply to normal ship's waste and bilge water, but it is equally clear that the bilge water on the Proba Koala was not normal."
"The fatalities, thousands of injured and the enormous upheaval in Ivory Coast are testimony to this."
"It was already clear in Amsterdam that its bilge water was not normal, because someone had collapsed and there was an unbearable and unusual stench."
"It is clear that the ship with its contents should never have left Amsterdam without warning the authorities at the next European port, which was in Estonia."
"That is why a judicial inquiry is currently underway in the Netherlands, and rightly too, in order to find out how it was possible for the toxic ship to leave the Netherlands in the first place, and whether the port authorities or inspectorates are in any way to blame."
"What we should now focus on, though, is the question as to how disasters of that kind can be prevented from happening in future."
"I have three questions I would like to put to the Commissioner."
"In Estonia, you stated that the dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast was only the tip of the iceberg."
"What was the basis for this statement?"
"Secondly, would you agree that ships that leave the EU should be obliged to surrender their waste water and waste at their last EU port?"
"Finally, what measures is the Commission able, and willing, to take in order to tighten up checks on the export of harmful waste?"
"(DE) Mr President, Africa has for decades been undergoing a process of transformation into a hazardous waste dump as a result of the export of toxic laboratory chemicals, solvents, superannuated pesticides and sewage sludge."
"There are a few people in Europe and Africa for whom the criminal trade in toxic waste is a very profitable business."
"Knowing though we do, that the actions of this Dutch firm in Abidjan were quite manifestly contrary not only to the Basle Convention but also to EU law, we have to ask ourselves how quickly our European institutions can respond if this is not to happen again in future."
"We take a favourable view of Commissioner Dimas' announcements, and we hope that this time the Member States and the Council will see how serious the situation is and realise the necessity of taking real action on this front instead of always merely regretting these things after they have occurred."
"What is really required of the Member States of the European Union is some evidence of their willingness to do something about them."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to express my congratulations on this initiative."
"We note with concern that the Basel Convention is infringed at least 10 times a year, with toxic waste being sent to Africa."
"The recent incident involving the Probo Koala pricked consciences in the European Union."
"The Union needs to proceed with the criminalisation of illegal practices in connection with movements of toxic waste."
"At the same time, the attention of the European SeaPorts Organisation needs to be drawn to the strict application of rules governing movements of toxic waste by its members."
"In particular, the need should be emphasised for information for the public, internal agreement and information between the departments involved and the operation of the register for recording qualitative and quantitative data and quantities of waste moved and produced."
"All this must be transparent and accessible to whomever it concerns, in order to prevent the tendency for the economies of Africa to develop into various toxic waste industrial management sectors."
"(NL) Mr President, what we are actually talking about today is an example of environmental crime of which we are unsure whether it will be prosecuted or not."
"Moreover, I would say to my fellow MEPs that I would not like to be in a Green-Leftwing alderman's shoes when discussing the Proba Koala file; the question is therefore whether prosecution will follow and if so, whether it will also cover Member States."
"This is the very reason why we have insisted on legislation with regard to criminal law if we want to enforce environmental policy effectively."
"We therefore feel that condemnation is certainly called for but that the Member States should be able to decide for themselves in what way those sanctions should be imposed."
"That is how we would like to go forward."
"A legislative proposal was submitted six years ago."
"At the same time, the Council produced its own framework decision, which the Commission and this House suggested should be thrown out, which is exactly what happened a year ago."
"Last Monday, the Commissioner announced he will produce a fresh proposal, but perhaps the Commissioner could be more specific as to this proposal's exact content, for this was left a little vague last Monday."
"I should also like to know from the Council - as I used to be rapporteur - whether the Council is happy to accept a fresh proposal to address environmental crime, for that is the most important question on the agenda here."
"As there are plenty of examples, a proposal does indeed appear necessary."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, questions of the environment are extremely important and a priority area, and for that reason it is good that we have been able to discuss them here today in Parliament."
"The Council takes a very serious view of illegal movements of waste and the risk which they pose to the immediate environment and people's health."
"The prevention of such illegal movements is a very demanding task, as has been made very evident in this debate."
"It requires very diverse sorts of action and effective cooperation at many levels, the limits of competence exercised by the authorities notwithstanding."
"We must also honestly recognise the fact that there is much room for improvement in the way movements of waste in the European Union and away from it are controlled, according to the surveys that have been conducted."
"We also have to remember that, as regrettable as these individual events that attract so much public attention are, the recent incident involving the Probo Koala in the Ivory Coast being a case in point, we must remember to give attention too to the everyday incidents and situations that cause harm to health and the environment, of which there is still an abundance."
"An example is the scrapping of ships in unsatisfactory conditions in developing countries."
"Work is to continue with regard to these important questions at the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention in Nairobi at the end of November."
"We should also see, recognise and acknowledge that there are considerable differences in national criminal laws on the environment between the Member States."
"In some Member States there are some very up-to-date penal provisions for environmental crimes, while in others there might well be a need to review such provisions to reflect the current risks and counter them."
"Actually, one might say that there is still a lot to do in all the Member States in the area of implementation of these penal provisions and, especially, increasing the likelihood of catching offenders."
"The Council takes a very serious view of environmental criminality and its prevention."
"As for the proposal being drafted, it is obviously difficult for the Council to take a position on something that does not yet exist."
"We first have to look at the proposal and then adopt a position."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Food Safety, Mr Florenz, and all the other speakers for their very positive contributions to today's debate."
"I would like to add to the list of nationalities that Mr Bowis referred to."
"This was a Greek-owned ship, under the flag of Panama, but it was time-chartered to a Dutch company, which operated it from Switzerland, with a Russian crew, financed by British and international banks and with a variety of nationalities on the board of the company and as shareholders."
"Happily, it was blocked by Greenpeace in Estonia and the Estonian authorities thoroughly investigated the case."
"I should like to assure the rapporteur that first proposal, which contains a minimum level of penalties, will be merged with the framework decision of the Council and basically it will be along the lines of what you proposed, with certain amendments at first reading."
"With regard to the question of whether a ship carrying hazardous waste is allowed to leave a European Union port, if the waste is hazardous it is not allowed to go to a destination outside the OECD."
"That also applies to slops - the ship's own waste water - that contain hazardous substances."
"I will continue to follow closely all developments in the criminal investigations and proceedings that are currently being conducted in the Netherlands and Estonia regarding the toxic waste dumping in Côte d'Ivoire."
"The Commission is also in the process of collecting any information available in other Member States concerning the vessel Proba Koala and its journey."
"I hope that we will soon be able to draw conclusions from that and find the best way forward in preventing such incidents in the future."
"We must keep in mind that the tragic incident in Côte d'Ivoire is just the tip of the iceberg."
"We know that is so from inspections carried out in Member States by their network of implementation and enforcement agencies, IMPEL."
"In 2005, 51% of the waste shipments checked were found to be illegal."
"Most of the cases do not make big headlines but they can, nevertheless, pose a serious risk to the environment and human health."
"We must make it very clear that our society does not tolerate environmental crime and that we are determined to take all possible steps to fight it."
"But legislation that we have adopted to better protect our environment and the health of our citizens will not achieve its objectives if we do not take the necessary measures to ensure that it is properly enforced."
"I can assure you that the Commission is determined that environmental legislation should be properly applied throughout the Community."
"We are already taking a number of specific initiatives in order to ensure that the European Union waste shipment regulation is correctly applied and illegal waste shipments are prevented and reduced."
"This includes the preparation of guidelines to be adopted in connection with the application of the new waste shipment regulation next year and the organisation of awareness-raising events in Member States."
"The Commission meets representatives of national authorities responsible for waste shipments on a regular basis."
"This takes place within a well-established framework and includes multilateral meetings in Brussels, as well as bilateral contacts, but these initiatives need to be supplemented by measures to establish effective sanctions."
"One of the many measures taken by the Commission for this purpose was to propose a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law."
"As I have already said, it is regrettable that the Commission's proposal was not taken up by the Council, due to a difference of views on the correct legal basis."
"Now, however, the Court of Justice has confirmed that the Commission's views were correct."
"The Commission is preparing a new proposal for a directive which will give effect to the Court's judgment and should be adopted soon."
"It has taken some time to produce the amended proposal, because the Commission has very carefully analysed the Court's judgment and made a comparison of the original Commission proposal as amended after Parliament's first reading and the Council's framework decision."
"In addition, an impact assessment is being carried out to analyse the various options for action."
"The Commission thinks it is necessary to amend its proposal of 2001 after the Court's ruling, to ensure that all criminal law measures necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the Community's policy for the protection of the environment are included in the proposal."
"The Court has made it clear that the parallel adoption of a directive and a framework decision, as was done in the past, is no longer possible."
"Also, after five years, the Commission's proposal needs to be adapted to legislative developments."
"I would like to clarify that the Commission does not want to harmonise national criminal laws fully."
"The aim is that only those steps which are necessary for the effective implementation of environmental policy should be taken at Community level."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasise again the importance of good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in the forthcoming codecision procedure for the adoption of the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law."
"We have the same goals, namely to protect the environment by establishing minimum standards for the sanctioning of environmental offences and to try to eliminate the possibility of safe havens for environmental offenders in the European Union."
"Acting together, we can take a big step towards achieving these objectives."
"Finally, as regards the ratification of the Basel Convention, I have sent letters to more than 50 countries around the world asking them to ratify the Convention."
"To avoid any wrong conclusions, I should clarify that the Basel ban is mandatory, legally binding, for the European Union Member States, even those that have not ratified the Convention, because we as the European Union have signed and ratified the agreement."
"To wind up the debate, I have received seven motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 103(2) and two motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The dumping of toxic waste by the Dutch firm Trafigura in the city of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast is a disgrace which requires full investigation and tough action."
"There can be little doubt that this dumping was in breach of EU law and the Basel Convention."
"This environmental crime will once again create the view that the rich North regards poor Africa as a suitable dumping ground."
"I welcome the Commissioner's statement which tries to counter this view, but statements are one thing: only action will convince Africans that we are serious about dealing with this."
"Apart from all the other issues that have to be investigated we need to know how it was possible for this ship to leave Amsterdam."
"Are the Dutch authorities reviewing their inspection methods?"
"Will the Commission raise the whole issue of inspection and enforcement at next month's Basel Convention Forum?"
"What has occurred in Côte d'Ivoire brings shame on the European Union."
"In this Parliament we are often at the forefront of the campaigns for better environmental protection."
"We are fond of stating that pollution does not respect borders."
"And yet, in 2006 we are witness to a situation in which 500 tonnes of toxic waste is transported from an EU Member State and dumped upon the long-suffering people of Côte d'Ivoire."
"The immediate impact has been a number of deaths and tens of thousands of people needing medical attention."
"We have all seen the grim estimates of what the longer-term impact could prove to be."
"If our grand statements on environmental protection are to mean anything, then the Commission and the Dutch authorities must make a full investigation in pursuit of the culprits in this crime."
"Clearly current legislation does not offer sufficient protection against unscrupulous people who care nothing for the people of Côte d'Ivoire and other African states."
"In the EU, we must act to ensure that our legislation on toxic waste is such that we can guarantee to people in Africa that their countries will not be dumping grounds for our hazardous waste."
"(NL) Mr President, the disaster in Ivory Coast calls for a rapid response from Europe, with compensation for the victims and for the damage done to the environment, whereby the polluter pays principle must apply."
"If Europe wants to make headway, it will need to explain to its citizens where the added value for them lies."
"The incident in Ivory Coast is a perfect example of where Europe clearly has a responsibility."
"Shipping is known for its complexity in terms of ownership and management, and is almost by definition an international affair."
"After all, over a two-month period, the Proba Koala called at the ports of Gibraltar, Algeciras, Amsterdam, Skagen, Paldiski, Dover and Venkspits."
"Moreover, the ship sails under a Panama flag, is owned by a Greek company, is chartered by Trafigura BV, which has a postbox in the Netherlands, from Great Britain and has a Russian crew."
"Something as complex as this requires clarity and transparency in legislation."
"If the European Union wants to act effectively, it will need to meet these conditions promptly."
"Only by adopting a firm stand can Europe demonstrate why further European integration is important to each and everyone of us."
"EC-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs De Keyser on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs containing the European Parliament's recommendation to the Council on the conclusion of a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Syrian Arab Republic, of the other part."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for her presence here today."
"The EU-Syria Association Agreement is the missing piece in the Barcelona process, but it is also the Godot of the European Parliament: continually heralded, but never concluded."
"The negotiations on this agreement started in 1996, before Syria withdrew from Lebanon."
"They were difficult, but they nevertheless resulted in a much-revised draft that laid down, for example, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the fight against terrorism."
"The agreement was signed in the Council in October 2004, but the ratification process was interrupted by the appalling assassination of the former prime minister Mr Hariri on 14 February 2005."
"We all know what happened next."
"People in Lebanon and all over the world immediately pointed the finger at the government in Damascus."
"An investigation, led initially by Mr Mehlis and now by Mr Brammertz, was carried out in situ, and Resolution 1559 called for the withdrawal of Syrian troops and secret services from Lebanon."
"The presumption of innocence is one of the pillars of our legal systems, but we must also bear in mind the precautionary principle."
"Although Syria made haste to withdraw its troops from Lebanon, it was initially hesitant about cooperating with Mr Mehlis."
"Europe therefore cautiously distanced itself from the Damascus Government."
"Is this caution still acceptable today, when various events both on the international stage and within Syria's internal political system should encourage us to reopen dialogue?"
"The Council will be the judge of that, but I, for my part, am in favour of dialogue and the Committee on Foreign Affairs supported me in this by a large majority."
"This dialogue could ultimately lead to the signing of the agreement, but that question is still premature and is not the purpose of the recommendation."
"So, then, what are these events?"
"First of all, there is the renewal of effective cooperation with Mr Brammertz's investigation, as attested to in his latest report."
"Next, it has become apparent that our isolation of Syria has been counter-productive in terms of democracy within the country, and has failed to weaken a strong government."
"Our empty-chair politics have contributed to destabilising a reforming tendency that was cautiously raising its head."
"What is more, the voice of Europe, which in the past has been raised to defend activists and political prisoners, is now hardly to be heard."
"Finally, and this is my third point, the tragedy in Lebanon has been a terrible lesson."
"The war between Israel and Lebanon was proof, if proof were needed, of the danger and uselessness of force."
"It demonstrated the need to work politically with all those involved in this conflict, and we know that, behind the two protagonists, other influences are at work: the United States without doubt, but also Iran and Syria."
"As Europe closed its doors, Syria found other allies, notably Iran, which provided not only oil but also a war-like ideology that does nothing to promote peace in the Middle East."
"Europe has now made a strong commitment to the Middle East, and there have been successive diplomatic missions on a regular basis."
"Support for the reopening of dialogue with Syria regarding the association agreement forms part of this preventative strategy, because another conflict in this region could be even more devastating."
"Let us be under no illusions."
"Syria will not break off from Iran in terms of trade, but its highest authorities claim to be prepared to distance themselves from Iran in terms of the Middle East peace process."
"This is an important step."
"This is a country with a strong and hardline government, where human rights are not sufficiently respected, and my report discusses these problems quite unambiguously."
"Having said that, Syria is a great and civilised country that must be treated with respect, dignity and honesty."
"It could be a stabilising influence in the Middle East and we need it."
"When Mr Siniora was here, he put forward the scenario of a solution to the problem of the Shebaa farms, and there are other possible points of conciliation."
"I would advocate that we open up all avenues."
"I would like to thank my fellow Members from all parties for their valuable assistance in drawing up this recommendation."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Council I would like to thank Mrs De Keyser for an important report that covers the Syrian situation excellently."
"The Council shares many of the concerns expressed in it with regard to Syria."
"As Mrs De Keyser says in her report, Syria may have an important role to play in the Near and Middle East 'as a link between the parties in the peace process and a facilitator of a resolution of the regional conflict'."
"For this reason, the Council too decided in August to authorise High Representative Javier Solana and the Finnish Presidency to be in contact with all relevant parties that may influence finding a solution to the crisis in Lebanon and the situation in the Middle East more generally."
"Unquestionably, these parties also include Syria."
"Since the dramatic events of the summer, it has been important to stabilise the situation in Lebanon and regions close to it."
"When Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja met with his Syrian counterpart at the end of August the message to Syria was a clear one."
"We expect Syria to work to implement Resolutions 1559, 1680 and 1701."
"Syria should support the national reconstruction process in Lebanon and do its utmost to stabilise the political situation inside Lebanon."
"Equipping armies other than the Lebanese and the question of arms smuggling have a fundamental impact on whether a ceasefire can be built on a sustainable basis."
"There are also questions that remain unanswered with regard to the demarcation of the border between Syria and Lebanon and the establishment of diplomatic relations."
"Solving the complex problem associated with the Shebaa area will likewise require Syria's cooperation."
"Syria must also continue to show a desire to cooperate with the Brammertz commission which is investigating the Hariri assassination."
"A question that is outside the scope of Resolution 1701 but important for stability in the region is the activity of Palestinian organisations with their headquarters in Damascus and Syrian support for them."
"Furthermore, Syria's relations with Iraq and Iran and its activities with regard to these countries have direct implications for the general situation in the Middle East."
"The Council is also closely following progress in human rights in Syria."
"Especially worrying were the arrests in the spring of those who are defenders of human rights and who signed the Beirut-Damascus Declaration."
"The fact that some of them were recently released is obviously welcome news."
"The EU will be closely observing how, for example, freedom of gathering in a public place and freedom of expression are being implemented in the country."
"Obviously, Syria must also act in accordance with the principles of international human rights."
"The reopening of the Civil Society Training Centre, which has EU support, is an important objective."
"The centre was shut in the spring just a week after it had opened."
"Continual links with Syria are being maintained, especially via Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"The meeting of Foreign Ministers in Tampere in November, which Syria has also been invited to attend, will provide an excellent forum for discussions."
"Syria is an important actor in the Middle East."
"It can choose: it can either be a troublemaker or a constructive partner."
"Syria's historically strong ties with Lebanon mean that it has an especially important role to play in implementing the UN Security Council Resolutions with respect to the situation in Lebanon."
"The Union has continually stressed that Lebanon's right to self-determination, territorial inviolability and political independence must be respected."
"In order to bring stability to Lebanon and the entire region it is important that arms smuggling to Lebanon be prevented."
"Syria needs to watch its borders to achieve this aim."
"The Council has said that it is willing to improve relations with Syria, if the country's behaviour seems to favour this."
"The ball is now in their court."
"Given the right circumstances, the Union could, for example, reconsider the possibility of signing the Association Agreement."
"This would of course promote cooperation between the EU and Syria, especially financially, as well as reforms that are essential for Syria's development, which is the assumption also made in the report."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, first of all I think this is a very timely discussion."
"Thank you for putting it on the agenda."
"I have followed closely the discussions in the AFET Committee on Ms De Keyser's substantive and comprehensive report."
"The report is a fair account of the internal and regional challenges facing Syria."
"I welcome this reflection by the European Parliament on the way forward with Syria."
"After the conflict in Lebanon and in the new context of United Nations Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), it is indeed the right moment to reassess where we are with our current policy."
"Syria is a long-standing partner under the Barcelona process and is a potential candidate for the European Neighbourhood Policy in the medium term."
"I share your view that we have a strong interest in bringing that country closer to Europe."
"Syria, as we all know, is an essential player for stability in the Middle East."
"It is a key part of the puzzle when it comes to finding a long-term solution to the conflicts in the region and also in the implementation of resolution 1701 in full."
"In this critical moment for the peace process, Damascus has the power to be part of the solution and not part of the problem."
"This means that we expect Syria, as you have stated in the motion for a resolution, to pass the right messages to Hezbollah and Hamas, to prevent arms shipments into Lebanon, as our colleague from the Council has said, and to help with the settlement on the Shebaa Farms."
"As I have indicated, I believe that re-engaging with Syria should be part of our strategy."
"A different issue is then whether and how far we can re-engage here and now."
"The first thing we need in order to re-engage with Syria is for its leaders to show their commitment and their interest in moving forward and taking positive steps on a number of issues."
"As you well know, lately we have gone through difficult times in our relationship with Syria."
"Ms De Keyser's report addresses a number of the political divergences."
"Overcoming the political deadlock depends on the leadership's ability to translate some of its words of goodwill into deeds of goodwill."
"Syria has a new opportunity at this critical time for the peace process to demonstrate that it is serious about contributing positively to regional stability."
"In the absence of an association agreement, we have limited scope to tackle matters of concern."
"Nevertheless, we have tried where we can, and where we feel it is of interest for the people of Syria."
"We have tried to continue programmes in those areas that directly benefit the citizens of Syria."
"For example, on human rights, the European Union uses diplomatic channels to address the most serious violations, including, for instance, the cases of prisoners of conscience."
"We have also reacted to the limitations on freedom of expression and the wave of arrests that accompanied the publication of the Beirut-Damascus declaration last May."
"But it is not by cutting off contacts that we will achieve much progress."
"With no dialogue, we have no influence."
"We should therefore turn the situation around, give a positive perspective to relations with Syria and set out the areas where we expect progress."
"We do so in part through our cooperation programmes."
"Syria now seems to be well engaged on the road to economic transition and we welcome the approval of Syria's national agenda for reforms sponsored by Deputy Prime Minister Dardari last May."
"Support for the implementation of the reform process, including progressive steps to political opening, could be the focus of our action in the next few years, if things go well."
"Cooperation under the ENPI - the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument - will allow us to give Syria the medium-term prospect of full participation in the Neighbourhood Policy."
"The ENP will then bring additional benefits and, we hope, a more interesting package for them, when the time is ripe."
"As for the association agreement, it is still on the table."
"We have finalised all technical preparations and we have initialled the agreement."
"Now, it is pending a decision on signature from the Council."
"Signature is a process."
"So far, political circumstances have not been right."
"Member States still expect Syria to take more positive and credible steps to make signature possible, including on regional issues such as Lebanon and Palestine."
"Syria's recent statements to facilitate the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 may be encouraging signs in this respect, as are President Assad's calls for resuming peace talks, which have had some positive echoes in Israel."
"Like the European Parliament, the Commission is a strong believer in dialogue."
"Therefore, I very much hope that the positive messages that we have received from Damascus lately will be transformed into deeds and that we will be able to restore a strong relationship with that country."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs De Keyser on the draft recommendation that she has presented and on all of the work that she has been doing on relations with Syria."
"I believe that it is important for us to consider and place this debate within its most appropriate context, Mr President."
"That context, as the Commissioner has said quite rightly, should be an assessment of the situation, on the journey towards an Association Agreement, without forgetting that we must also promote dialogue, parliamentary dialogue in our case, with Syria, given that country's strategic importance within the region's complicated context, as others have emphasised."
"I believe, however, that it is also important to stress - and the text of the resolution makes this very clear - that this is not the time for Parliament to pronounce itself in favour of the Association Agreement."
"The resolution - the draft recommendation - states quite clearly that the conditions have yet to be met: there must be very clear progress in a number of areas."
"Syria's conclusion of a defence agreement with Iran is not good news."
"There must be substantial progress in terms of respecting the European Union's traditional thinking in the field of democracy and human rights."
"The United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the territorial integrity of Lebanon must be respected and Syria must cooperate in clearing up the assassination of ex-Prime Minister Hariri. It must also make progress in relation to the abolition of the death penalty, respect for religious minorities, etc."
"I therefore believe, Mr President, that there is still a long way to go."
"There is some good news, such as Mr Dandari's appointment as Deputy Prime Minister."
"I had the privilege of meeting him following a mission in Lebanon."
"I believe that only on this basis, as the Commissioner said a moment ago, must we turn this list of good intentions into concrete actions, so that the European Union can give the green light to this important Association Agreement between the Union and Syria."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs De Keyser for her outstanding report, and also Mr Salafranca for his good cooperation, which has made it possible for a report such as this one to be adopted by a large majority."
"Syria is not a straightforward country, but a problematic one in a problematic region."
"If, though, we want to establish stability and peace in this problematic part of the world, we need Syria to cooperate with us."
"Where Lebanon is concerned, it really ought to dawn on Syria, once and for all, that a politically stable and economically strong Lebanon is to its own benefit and does not constitute a danger to it."
"Moving on to Iran, we have no objection to make to friendly relations between that country and Syria, for such is only right and proper among neighbours, but this friendship should bear fruit in a constructive contribution, in a peace process, rather than in a blockade."
"I do indeed understand that Syria is demanding that Israel return the Golan Heights, but Syria must acknowledge that Israel has security interests that it cannot renounce, and should help facilitate peaceful developments in Palestine and, in particular, in the Gaza Strip, not only in the shape of peace between one Palestinian and another, but also between the Palestinians and Israel."
"It is vitally important that we engage in this dialogue, and in that connection I should like to remind the House of an expression that the Commissioner used, namely 'leadership ability'."
"I would like to see the President of Syria pay less attention to those whose whisperings in his ear have caused Syria, over recent years, to be led into isolation, but rather to those of his advisers who want to take his country back to a dialogue with the international community, especially with the European Union."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, a crucial obstacle on the road to ratification has arisen, namely the ever-worsening human rights situation in Syria."
"Observers regularly denounce the arbitrary arrests, the acts of torture, the blatant discrimination against minorities, the barriers to freedom of expression and of association, and the harassment and imprisonment of people who work peacefully to enhance freedoms in Syria."
"I refer in particular to Michel Kilo, Anwar al-Bunni and Mahmoud Issa, who are still being detained for having signed in May the Beirut-Damascus Declaration calling for the normalisation of relations between Lebanon and Syria."
"Michel Kilo should have been released on 19 October, but a further charge has resulted in his prison term being extended."
"Mr Issa was released on 25 September but was re-arrested just two days ago."
"These examples, among many others, demonstrate the lack of a genuine desire on the part of the Syrian authorities to undertake the necessary democratic reforms."
"Under these circumstances - as you said, Mrs De Keyser - there is no question of the European Union concluding an association agreement with Syria."
"As the Resolution states, an improvement in the human rights situation and respect for democratic values must be a prerequisite for the conclusion of any agreement."
"Moreover, it is also important to put in place an effective control mechanism as part of the application of the 'human rights' clause."
"This approach should also be applied, inter alia, to Russia and to Turkmenistan, and to a good many other countries too."
"The same goes for the consistency of the positions adopted by Parliament."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Madam President, the purpose of the De Keyser report is dialogue and the future normalisation of our relations with Syria."
"We see the Association Agreement as a part of this political process."
"I stress the word 'political' because, from an economic point of view, the Agreement is much more beneficial for Europe than for Syria."
"The suspension of relations with Damascus was a political mistake."
"Europe should not have blacklists and should not blindly follow North American ideas on the axis of evil."
"Regardless of its regime, Syria is a country that is vital to peace in the region."
"Europe must learn to respect the complexity of Syrian society and the many shades of opinion there."
"The regime is politically authoritarian, yet has a liberal attitude to the economy, religion and customs."
"Pluralism is stifled and constrained, yet it exists in society and in the institutions."
"The less the western powers intervene in the region, the more pluralism will be allowed to flourish."
"It is a pity that the final version of the report suffers from shades of the colonial era on a number of issues."
"For example, it is not up to us to say who is and who is not trustworthy, because we ourselves, rightly, do not accept such opinions from third parties."
"It would also be better if it did not cast far-fetched aspersions over non-existent relations between Damascus and Al Qaeda and Sunni fundamentalism."
"This ignorance does us no favours. We owe it to ourselves to be consistent, as well."
"Diplomatic relations cannot hinge on the outcome of a criminal investigation."
"Evidence pertaining to the crime of the horrific assassination of Rafiq Hariri must be heard in court. Otherwise, our policies run the risk of violating the principle of the presumption of innocence."
"In any event, the report is clear on the important issue; it seeks normal relations and that is a good thing."
"It is good that the issue of human rights should be at the heart of this normalisation process, but Europe needs to apply the same policy to all other countries, including Israel."
"Lastly, it supports the restitution of the Golan Heights to Damascus, an area Syria has never resorted to violent means to recover; this is a proposal supported in UN resolutions."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, like the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I too will be emphatically voting against the De Keyser report during the plenary vote."
"Anyone in this House who advises the Council to conclude an association agreement with Syria is giving support to a ruthless minority regime about which it is sufficient to say that the only entities it regards as strategic partners in its region are the Islamic Republic of Iran and Hezbollah."
"The present resolution misjudges once again the true nature of the Assad regime where literally everything revolves around the preservation of power."
"As a consequence, the rapporteur has succumbed to illusions of possible positive effects of the association agreement on Damascus' internal and external policy."
"If I could catch Mrs De Keyser's eye, I should not like to keep from you the opinion held by a recognised Syria expert from my country who has made many visits to that country over the years; he told me, only the other day, in plain words, that 'democracy is considered to be a deadly threat by those in power', and that this is something that has become obvious to him in recent years in discussion with sources within the regime, including with the oh-so-liberal Mr Dardari."
"What is so absurd about this report is that the document is full of cautionary words against following the diplomatic false scent in the direction of Damascus."
"This is food for satirists rather than for politicians."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (PL) Madam President, we are today discussing an Association Agreement with a country whose significance must be clear to everyone in this House."
"This is a country concerning which we have a great number of objections and reservations."
"There is no mistaking that Syria is directly or indirectly involved in the smuggling of weapons to terrorist organisations."
"There is no mistaking that Syria has close links to Iran."
"It is a fact that we have very serious concerns about the standard of Syria's respect for human rights and civil rights."
"The question arises as to which instruments the European Parliament and the European Union should use."
"Will this agreement promote democracy?"
"Will it make the instruments at our disposal for bringing pressure to bear on this government more efficient, or will it weaken our position?"
"I believe that mutual understanding and the possibility of exerting pressure will strengthen our position and that the agreement in question should be supported."
"I believe this should be based on the premise that our stance and our opinion as the European Parliament requires respect for human rights and civil rights."
"This must be made abundantly clear at every opportunity."
"Ceasing to support terrorist activity has to be a sine qua non."
"It is essential to apply pressure of this kind, otherwise we shall be infringing our fundamental principles."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, we have to be clear in our own minds about the fact that the crisis in the Middle East - not only where Lebanon is concerned, but also the Middle East problem as a whole - is capable of resolution only if Syria is brought on board, for it, at present, maintains links with Iran and Hizbollah, and thought must be given to how, if at all, these links can be dismantled, and in such a manner that it is in Syria's interests."
"Syria is a Sunni and secular state, with relatively little in common, ideologically speaking, with Shiite fundamentalists."
"This is what would make it possible for us to make use of an association agreement, provided that improvements are made in the observance of human rights and a solution found to the question of how we and it can join together in combating terrorism."
"What is certain is that supplies of weapons to the Lebanon cannot be wholly stopped without Syria's consent, and that must be seen to be a factor."
"Such a solution is also conditional upon the problem of the Shebaa farms being resolved."
"That is of the utmost importance if Hizbollah are to be denied the excuse that they need to have weapons in the area, since it is Israeli-occupied territory."
"For all these reasons, both the situation within Syria and that country's relations with the European Union need to be improved."
"The initiative on the part of the Mrs De Keyser and the Committee on Foreign Affairs - of which, it is my impression, both the Council and the Commission take a sympathetic view - makes an important contribution towards Syria being offered the opportunity to secure its own interests and thereby make a constructive contribution to the peace process in the region."
"It is evident that the Syrian regime is no friend of democracy, that it violates human rights, that people - both Syrians and others - must be set at liberty and that a stop must be put to the cooperation with the military arms of Hizbollah and Hamas; even so, I do believe that a dialogue of this kind is possible and that the offer of an association agreement, within this framework, can be an effective means to that end."
"(FR) Mrs Lehtomäki, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs De Keyser for this excellent report."
"The conclusion of an association agreement between the European Community and Syria would constitute a very encouraging political sign in terms of establishing peace in the Middle East, which is something that we all so earnestly desire."
"Association agreements are an excellent way to put pressure on countries."
"Thus, in return for our economic and commercial cooperation, we must ask Syria to become a democratic country that respects fundamental freedoms; to stop interfering in its neighbours' affairs; to strictly delimit its border with Lebanon; and to stop supporting the Hezbollah militias or the Hamas fundamentalists that it is sheltering."
"Syria must release the intellectuals, human rights defenders and political prisoners that it is holding in its prisons."
"It must also respect the right of the minorities living on its territory, especially the Kurds, to whom it must offer citizenship, since they do not have it."
"If Syria renounced its Greater Syria project and if it turned to allies other than Iran, the entire region would benefit."
"Syria, more than any other country in the region, is able to play the role of governor and peacemaker, particularly in relation to the Iraqi and Palestinian issues."
"Europe must make every effort to include Syria among its strategic allies in the Middle East."
"If the wind of change rose in Syria and if the country practised a policy of openness, then all of the populations in the Middle East could finally start to free themselves from the yoke of dictatorship and theocratic populism."
"Madam President, this report asserts that an EU-Mediterranean agreement would give decisive impetus to the political, economic and social reforms needed in Syria, yet the report also deplores the signing of a military agreement between Syria and Iran, which the Syrians say will increase cooperation against what they call the common threat presented by Israel and the USA."
"Since 1995 the European Union has given Syria EUR 259 million."
"The EU pays millions of euros to support the tyrannical Syrian regime in the hope that somehow it will make them believers in democracy, civil liberties, human rights, etc. The Syrians, on the other hand, now find that they have enough spare cash to be able to afford a military alliance with Iran that will inevitably make the world a more dangerous place."
"EU taxpayers' money should not be spent in supporting tyrannical and murderous regimes which are the enemies of democracy, freedom and peace."
"Madam President, the EU's strategic interest with Syria is maintaining peace in the wider Middle East so that oil flows, and to steer the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians towards a durable two-state solution settlement, as detailed in Mrs De Keyser's report."
"Isolated Syria has for some time been helping Iran launch a combined pan-Islamic offensive on Israel, and Syria seeks to keep the Lebanese Government weak by strongly backing Iran's proxy Hezbollah, which Syria believes will also help re-establish its influence in Lebanon."
"Nevertheless, Syria has one redeeming feature: it is a secular country that recoils from Islamic fundamentalism, and parts of the ruling Ba'ath elite worry about Syria's deepening defence alliance with theocratic Iran and Islamist Hezbollah."
"Syria no longer needs to cosy up to Iran in its old alliance against their common enemy, Saddam Hussein's Iraq."
"Regrettably, hopes are now fading that the EU can deal directly with the Palestinians under an intransigent Hamas, which refuses to recognise Israel or forswear violence."
"The time is therefore now ripe to offer assurances to Syria that blocking Hezbollah's re-armament, stopping jihadi fighters' passage into Iraq and improving Syria's appalling human rights record would bring valuable benefits, including the eventual ratification of the strengthened association agreement with the EU."
"The EU, as a member of the Quartet, can also help broker an acceptable peace agreement between Israel and Syria over the Golan Heights and the Shebaa Farms where the US may be unwilling."
"Israel would gain much by talking to its enemy, Syria."
"Conscious of its vulnerability to rocket attacks, Israel knows that it needs a defensible state, safe from external aggression."
"Removing Syria as a threat is a key element in achieving this strategic objective."
"But I endorse the findings of the report and I am hopeful now that the European Union will look to using its considerable leverage over Syria to achieve these objectives."
"(EL) Madam President, I too should like in turn to congratulate my honourable friend Véronique De Keyser on the very important report which she has presented to us."
"I believe that on the basis of the new geopolitical situation which has arisen in the Middle East, the European Union should formulate its own independent strategy."
"Syria is a fact and its role continues to be instrumental to regional stability and security."
"Europe must talk to Syria and must proceed with a coordinated institutional and political dialogue with the regime in Damascus."
"I absolutely agree with everything contained in the report and with what my honourable friends have said."
"However, no one has answered the question of how we shall get Syria to change its conduct and how we shall contribute to the democratisation process."
"No one has answered that question."
"I believe that, without the mechanisms of the association agreement and political dialogue, the potential for the European Union to contribute to the democratisation of Syria is non-existent."
"That is why I believe that the European Union should not delay in signing the agreement."
"For advocates of the isolation of Syria, of sanctions or even of the overthrow of the regime, the civil war in Iraq is the answer to their delusions."
"(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, the decision to renew the ratification of the Association Agreement with Syria is a strategic one."
"The situation in the Middle East is more a case of the glass being half-empty than half-full."
"The lack of democratisation in Egypt has encouraged the growth of radical forces;"
"Lebanon is sliding into disarray; and the chances of creating a State in Palestine have, for domestic reasons, disappeared."
"Relations between the EU and Israel have unravelled since the summer attacks on Lebanon."
"There is neither a European nor an Israeli policy, with Israel increasingly sinking back into regionalism, no longer capable of solving problems from a broader perspective."
"Furthermore, as the latest decision on Iraq has shown, the USA does not have a serious policy in the region, either."
"The end of the policy of playing off one side against the other has undoubtedly served to strengthen Iran."
"Iran is the only player with a relevant, active policy."
"Iran's intermediary is Syria."
"Parliament cannot take any relevant steps in relation to Iran."
"That would require a joint approach from the EU, the USA and the Russian Federation."
"What we in this Chamber can do is to try to draw Syria out of its submissive role as an intermediary."
"That is the strategy."
"The tactic is to offer incentives of an economic or international nature, and to do this as a matter of clear, common and uncompromising European policy."
"We must make demands from Syria in a similarly clear and uncompromising way."
"This is not a matter of appeasement."
"The key issue is for Syria to sign up to a gradual lifting of martial law, to the creation of a civil society with full freedom of expression and to respect for minority rights and a transition to a democratic political system based on an open market economy."
"Syria must of course cooperate on the investigation into the assassination of Hariri."
"It must engage in constructive moves towards solving the peace process."
"It must stop arming Hezbollah and supporting armed Palestinian groups, it must comply with Resolutions 1559 and 1701 and it must also complete the withdrawal of all armed forces from Lebanon and establish diplomatic relations."
"We do not own the Association Agreement."
"What is needed is for Syria to take ownership of it."
"Our task is to establish, through the Agreement, a Syrian road map towards transition."
"I should like to call on the Commission and chiefly the Council to give active support both to our strategy and to our tactics."
"(PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Barcelona Declaration enshrines the objectives of establishing a common area of peace, stability and prosperity through the reinforcement of political dialogue and security, economic and financial partnership, and a social, cultural and human partnership."
"This objective has been implemented successfully in recent years, and there are already Association Agreements in place with almost all of the countries of the Mediterranean basin, except, of course, for Syria, for various, understandable reasons. The EU has always been mindful of the events of recent months."
"It must make a genuine commitment to proper negotiations with Syria, with a view to securing the country's firm desire to conclude the Agreement. Accordingly, Syria will hopefully develop into a democracy that respects human rights and religious freedom, that helps in the fight against terrorism, and that promotes dialogue and lasting peace in the region."
"To this end, the Syrian Government must take action to end the state of emergency at the earliest opportunity, with the EU lending all possible assistance."
"Syria is in a geostrategically vital location and has a crucial role to play in the Middle East peace process."
"The EU must, once and for all, make clear its belief that strengthening democracy cannot be achieved by means of a policy of bombing or isolation."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Syria is a country that cannot be ignored in the context of the Middle East crisis."
"Breaking off all dialogue means isolating the country and carries the risk of the regime becoming more radical."
"It means pushing Syria even further into the arms of Iran, whose only aspiration is to destroy Israel and to destabilise the region."
"If we are to resume talks with Syria now, though, we must be very cautious and lay down firm conditions in advance."
"We must demand that Syria respect Lebanon's sovereignty and that it comply with the Security Council resolutions calling on it to step up controls at the Lebanese-Syrian border and to stop supplying weapons to Hezbollah."
"We must make respect for human rights and civil liberties a prerequisite for the signing of any agreement."
"We must demand that it take concrete action in following up the conclusions of the investigation into the assassination of the former prime minister, Rafik Hariri."
"I would point out that this is also a prerequisite for the continuation of the negotiations."
"Finally, it must clearly outline to the international community the measures that it is taking to effectively and practically combat the proliferation of weapons and terrorism in the region."
"By that, I mean that it must also stop all support to the Hezbollah and Hamas militias."
"If the European Union plans to re-open negotiations with Syria, it must do so only if the latter accepts and respects these conditions."
"Today, conditions for the signing of any association agreement have not been met, which is something that I deplore."
"We must call on Syria to abandon its closed-shop mentality and confront this country with its responsibilities in a region in which all of the actors must work on establishing peace and stability."
"Madam President, I should like to endorse the recommendations of Mr De Keyser's report, in particular that it is time to review engagement with Syria by Europe and the world, not to compromise our principles but to advance them."
"A strong message needs to be sent to Syria with regard to human rights and improving its record on freedom of expression, torture and abolition of the death penalty."
"The human rights lawyer Anwar al-Buni, who, amongst hundreds of others, signed the petition calling for respect for Lebanese sovereignty, should be released from custody forthwith, along with hundreds of prisoners of conscience."
"Labelling Syria part of an axis of evil has achieved nothing."
"I welcome the fact that in the last month the Commissioner has authorised her representatives to hold discussions with Syria's ministries for Foreign Affairs and Economic Affairs and that this week the European Parliament will offer the prospect of signing the association agreement if Syria genuinely chooses to work with Europe to achieve peace in the Middle East."
"(NL) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs De Keyser, for her hard work, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my concern in this area, for let us be honest."
"We can hardly imagine the European Union, being a Union of values and standards, concluding a cooperation agreement with a rogue state such as Syria."
"That, though, is the reality, when one considers the links with Hezbollah and Iran."
"The only option is to use a cooperation agreement, and the associated negotiations, as an opportunity to prescribe a number of minimum conditions in the area of human rights, because there is increasing oppression against trade unions, journalists and religious minorities in Europe."
"Syrian citizens belonging to religious minorities, as well as Assyrian Christians returning to Syria, are put behind bars almost without exception."
"There is therefore every reason finally to bring the EU's immigration policy and return policy to Syria into line with each other at European level, and to suspend return policy to Syria for the time being."
"That appears to me to be a first step."
"Secondly, we must demand firm guarantees for religious freedom; the Syrian Government must stop interfering with religious minorities in Syria itself, for the various religious communities and ethnic groups are having a particularly hard time at the moment because of the way Syria is managing their interests."
"Europe has, in this respect, a reputation to lose, because the European churches are based on the earliest churches that have spread their faith from Syria also in the direction of Europe."
"This means that the European Union has the onerous task of ensuring, should a cooperation agreement prove to be the solution at this point, that firm guarantees are demanded for improvement in all these areas."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all thank you for this very valuable debate."
"During it, it became clear that the same phenomenon is evident in this Chamber as in the international community and among the moderate Arab countries too, that there are slightly different views about what kind of policy on Syria is the best and most effective to make the country once again a constructive member of the international community."
"The European Union has come to the conclusion that isolation will drive Syria in the wrong direction, and the Council specifically discussed this and laid down new policy on the matter at the start of August, so that we would be in contact with all the relevant players to resolve the Middle East question."
"Syria is one of the relevant players."
"Consequently, I can say, for example in reply to the hope expressed by Mr Swoboda that the Presidency must listen in particular to those that aim to build robust dialogue with Syria, that that is what we have also done."
"One example of that is the approaching Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Ministers in Tampere, to which Syria has also been invited."
"It is also certainly valuable to build and activate dialogue between parliaments, as Mr Salafranca mentioned in his speech."
"The right circumstances and also the right timing are very important in the rewarming of these relations."
"Obviously, in the measures that we ourselves are taking we will aim specifically to give Syria the opportunity to play a positive role."
"It is very apparent from this discussion that in the search for a solution to the situation in the Middle East everything affects everything else."
"Accordingly, over recent months we have actively tried to find a comprehensive, long-term and lasting solution to the Middle East question."
"The search has been a very active one."
"High Representative Javier Solana is in the region today in fact, and he intends to visit not only Israel and the Palestinian territories, but also Beirut, Jordan and possibly other places too."
"In other words, contact with the various parties is very important."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for pushing forward this process of reflection on this strategically vitally important country in the Middle East."
"I think this was a very important debate."
"Allow me to answer a few very specific questions."
"One was on human rights."
"In the absence of an association agreement in force, the European Union has no platform for an in-depth dialogue on human rights with Syria where it could also discuss critical issues - and there are many to be discussed - such as the abrogation of emergency rule, the amendments to the laws on politically partisan NGOs, the granting of citizenship to stateless Kurds or the setting-up of a national council on human rights."
"I do not think we should make total progress on human rights a precondition for signature."
"However, we - meaning the representatives of the Commission and the Member States in Damascus especially - use our political instruments such as démarches and political declarations to denounce the most severe abuses of human rights."
"For instance, we raise with the Syrian authorities the situation of prisoners of conscience, detainees, on a very regular basis; and we also systematically observe the trials at the state security court."
"In addition, through our cooperation programmes we are supporting the emergence of an open civil society in Syria."
"The Commission therefore launched six micro-projects in January under the European initiative for democracy and human rights."
"These target Arab lawyers, women's organisations, refugee organisations, the Kurdish minority and the media, and also promote women's and children's rights."
"However, in the present situation of tightening control by the security services, those projects and most training activities have had some difficulty in getting off the ground."
"The authorities challenge the legality of these projects in Syria, political NGOs are sometimes tolerated but not always authorised, and we are therefore investigating solutions to these problems."
"Of course, we have also raised individual cases directly with the Syrian Government."
"With regard to questions of assistance, EU financial assistance has not gone to supporting the regime, as was mentioned earlier by some colleagues here."
"It has gone, for example, to supporting the private sector and also the small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We have helped the people directly, for instance through health programmes, and we have targeted help at getting reforms to open up the economy and trade, competition and investment - things that will be very important for the future development of the country."
"Finally, I would like to reiterate a point I made earlier."
"We are in favour of a dialogue with Syria with a political and economic perspective."
"We are trying to maintain a positive perspective, building on progress that has already been made, for example in supporting the reforms the government is undertaking to open up the economy that I have just mentioned to and decentralise power."
"But at the same time, as I said before, we will be looking at practical action on regional issues such as the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701, and playing a positive role, for instance in Palestine."
"This will determine how fast we can proceed with our future engagement, and I see that a great majority in this debate also seems to lean in that direction."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Council Question Time"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0437/2006)."
"We will be taking the following questions to the Council."
"Subject: Provision of services and freedom of movement for families with children"
"European families are protesting in increasing numbers against the discrimination to which they are subjected in connection with the provision of services and exercising their right to freedom of movement within the EU because they are accompanied by children under the age of 15."
"Recent articles in the Greek press have taken a positive view of the exclusion of children from commercial public premises such as hotels, restaurants, etc."
"What measures will the Council take to eliminate discrimination and age 'racism' against children, adolescents and their families?"
"Are there plans to harmonise the requirements in regard to the provision of services and guaranteeing freedom of movement within the EU to prevent the infringement of the rights of young Europeans and their families?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, in reply to the question the Council would first like to remind everyone that Article 18(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community states: 'every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect'."
"As the honourable Member certainly knows, the Commission, as the body that monitors the Treaty, must ensure that the provisions of the Treaty and the rules and regulations made by the institutions pursuant to it are complied with."
"That being the case, the question by the honourable Member should really be put to the Commission."
"In July this year the Commission published a communication aiming at an EU strategy on children's rights with the purpose of promoting and protecting children's rights effectively in internal and external policies of the European Union and supporting measures taken in this area by the Member States."
"Decisions on child and family policy proper are taken at national level."
"(EL) Madam President, I too wish to take my turn in reminding the Council representative that the Commission may design the strategy, but the application of it is undertaken by the Member States."
"In the Council, all the Member States must establish what the situation is and what the problems are of families moving with children; that is why I put this question to the Council, in knowledge of the Treaties and the new Commission communication."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, we all have laws to prevent discrimination against all population groups and ages, such as the Racial Equality Directive and the Directive on discrimination in employment and occupation."
"They incorporate rules on such areas as the prohibition of discrimination in many everyday situations."
"As for the examples given of, for example, restaurant culture by the honourable Member, we do have to remember that citizens of the Member States, in addition to the Council, have, as consumers and, when it comes down to it, those who are paying for these services, also have considerable powers of influence on what sort of culture should evolve from the perspective of families with children."
"(DE) Madam President, I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that this is a problem not only in Greece, but also in Austria, where it is positively prevalent, and where hotels count it as one of their main selling points that they allow no children, or will not accommodate families with them."
"What I would like to know is whether something can be done about this, at any rate as regards advertising."
"There are, after all, other areas in which advertising can be restricted, and that might be one possibility."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, it is Council Regulation of 26 October 2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union that provides for the establishment of Frontex and its tasks, structure and the requirements pertaining to its financial administration."
"Under the Regulation, the Council is given information concerning the Agency's action programme, the general and special risk analyses that it prepares, an annual general report and the Agency's budget."
"Measures to amend the Regulation's provisions may only be proposed by the Commission."
"It is primarily the task of Frontex's Management Board to approve measures relating to its organisational structure, staffing policy and action programme, and the Council takes no part in it."
"It is still the responsibility of the institutions of the EU to evolve Community policy on the control of external borders and relevant legislation."
"Close coordination between the agency and the institutions must therefore be assured, and there are arrangements in existence for this purpose under the Frontex Regulation."
"Regarding this, I would refer you to the relevant Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams."
"Its purpose is to enhance operative activities undertaken by the Agency and promote solidarity between Member States and the Community during a crisis."
"The European Council proposed last December that the Member States, the Council and the Commission should take certain measures before the end of the year to improve practical cooperation among the Member States."
"These included strengthened control and monitoring of the EU's southern maritime border and the Medsea study on the Mediterranean Coastal Patrols Network, which Frontex has now completed."
"In recent months the Council, for example in its session on 24 July and at the informal ministerial meeting in September, has been paying particular attention to improving operative cooperation between the Member States and Frontex, and, in particular, the situation in the Mediterranean region and Africa."
"On these occasions such themes as Frontex's role and its participation in operative activities, especially in the Mediterranean and with regard to the African situation, were discussed."
"The Council was satisfied with the measures implemented by Frontex and the Commission and stressed that operative cooperation should continue to be developed further."
"At the end of October the Council also adopted its conclusions on strengthening the external maritime border in the south."
"In its conclusions it urged Frontex to promote a feasibility study on the establishment of a European Surveillance System which, in its initial phase, would cover the whole of the southern maritime border of the Community and the Mediterranean Sea."
"The Council also asked Frontex to consider setting up regional centres with links to one another, which would be at Frontex's disposal in operational matters in different maritime areas or sections thereof."
"The Council, however, does not have to propose that appropriations should be granted for Frontex's budget for additional action."
"According to Article 33 of Council Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the Hague Programme, the work of Frontex will be assessed with reference to a Commission evaluation before the end of next year."
"(ES) Madam President, the Council's reply has reassured me, and I am going to say something surprising: Frontex has worked."
"Despite being at an experimental stage, its work in the Canary Islands, in the large area of sea surrounding the Canary Islands, has been effective."
"The concern is the precariousness of the institutions and the lack of economic and financial resources."
"The Presidency has referred to that, but the specific question I would like to ask is whether you believe that it will be possible to continue the Frontex operation in the Atlantic after 1 January, and whether the Council believes it is worth spending money on resources, on maintaining this Agency, which, I would repeat, has worked, is still working, and is proving to be effective."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, first it is obviously encouraging to hear that Frontex has been successful."
"While we admit that it has also had some problems, or at least challenges, we have to remember that the Agency is still very young and, at the same time, it has its administrative structure and tasks to attend to."
"Moreover, it has already been involved in very many operations both in the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere."
"Obviously, whether the scope and effectiveness of this operation can continue also depends on additional financing."
"(DE) Madam President, the President-in-Office of the Council spoke about how difficult it is to get funding for Frontex."
"Frontex is being supported."
"Is the Council also considering doing something to relieve the burden, for example mounting information campaigns in the countries of origin, in order to make potential migrants aware of the possible consequences of illegal immigration or of the other options available for legal immigration?"
"Is it also considering reducing the load by taking action that would make it impossible, in future, to legalise illegal immigrants in the way in which they have been?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, one very crucial question, which relates generally to illegal immigration or immigration as a whole, is obviously the extent to which we cooperate with countries of origin and transit."
"Recently in the Union the aim has been to focus special attention on points of contact between immigration itself and development, working on the notion that we should be able to enhance cooperation with countries of departure so that the pressures on people migrating are also lessened in those places."
"Of course, one area of this cooperation with countries of origin is to provide information on what is actually possible and what is not."
"In November the next high level conference between the EU and African countries will be held in Tripoli and the main theme there will be immigration."
"I have two points."
"First of all, a few months ago we were hearing about problems around the hosting of the agency in Poland: inadequate provision of accommodation and so on."
"Have those problems been resolved?"
"Secondly, will the Finnish Presidency pledge to support and to persuade other Member States to accept the amendments that the European Parliament is about to vote to the budget of FrontEx?"
"This is Amendment 836, to restore the sum as proposed by the Commission, i.e., not to follow the Council cuts and to put even more resources in reserve."
"Will the Finnish Presidency support that increase in resources?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children of November 2004 is at present being debated by working groups in the Council."
"Most recently it was discussed by the criminal case cooperation team in October, just a week ago."
"An examination of the initiative also forms part of the discussions which the Council working groups are holding on other proposals, such as that for a Framework Decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings and that for a Council Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States."
"There are thus two other proposals for framework decisions on the table."
"The aim which these instruments have in common is to create structures to ensure that details on someone's criminal background are available generally and readily."
"When all the Member States have eventually implemented these acts in their national legislation, it should be easier to prevent a convicted individual from working with children or committing crimes against children once again."
"The Council is therefore continuing to debate these proposals for framework decisions."
"It seems to me that the Council is going nowhere fast on these proposals."
"Nearly two years ago we had an ambitious programme from the Commission in response to strong public interest in ensuring that criminals, like sex offenders, are not the ones who exploit borders and profit from them."
"It seems to me that Member States are not getting their act together on this."
"I do not understand how we can tell our public that the EU is effective in combating crime if the Council is so slow in deciding on these top-priority measures to make sure that criminals are truly tracked, wherever they go."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, the protection of children, especially from the possibility of new assaults by those convicted of sex crimes, is obviously vitally important."
"There are, however, many very practical problems, as well as problems relating to principles, attached to these proposals for framework decisions, for example, the fact that this ban on occupation principle does not even exist in all the Member States."
"We therefore need to look for a way of dealing with the problem which can be applied in all the Member States of the Union."
"(PT) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for the information."
"My question is very precise and direct, so that we can judge your position."
"Does the Council, that is to say, the Finnish Presidency, not believe that citizens having access to personal data on those convicted of paedophilia or sexual violence against young people is an excellent tool in the fight against crime of this nature?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, this is an aim we all share: children can be protected from convicted individuals and there are different ways of doing that in the Member States."
"For example, in my country there is a system in place where an employer has the right to obtain the criminal records of those seeking or applying for certain kinds of job and to use them to consider whether the person is suitable for the job."
"Such jobs, however, are very precisely defined."
"There are different ways of doing this in the Member States, and that is one reason why progress in this matter has been slow in the opinion of many Members of Parliament."
"I should like to refer to a specific case as a means of illustrating that the sharing of information is not enough."
"Paul Hunter Redpath is a convicted paedophile who served the custodial part of his sentence in my constituency of Northern Ireland and then recently took refuge in the Republic of Ireland, in breach of the probation part of his sentence."
"He can now live there freely, and is unable to be arrested, whereas in Northern Ireland the penalty for breaching his probation order would be an immediate return to prison."
"Is this case not a clear indication that full extradition arrangements are needed, otherwise justice will be evaded and full protection not afforded to the vulnerable?"
"Can the President-in-Office accept that proper extradition is the optimum requirement?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, this Question Time slot is obviously not about what I can personally endorse, but what sort of discussions and decisions the Council should aspire to."
"The Council, however, now intends to proceed in accordance with the assimilation principle, which means that a Member State would be obliged to attach to convictions in a foreign court legal effects that are equivalent to those which they attach to national convictions, although this is ultimately very much to do with wider cooperation on justice and home affairs and how we can otherwise make progress in the area of mutual recognition of convictions and judgments and the matter of extradition."
"Since its author is not present, Question No 4 lapses."
"Subject: Aviation sector"
"Can the European Council outline what new measures it intends to pursue to improve passenger safety on European airlines in light of the ongoing threat of international terrorism?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security represents the Community's current legal framework in the area of civil aviation security."
"The Regulation, which was made as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, has been in force since January 2003."
"To correct the problems which emerged in the implementation of this Regulation, the Commission put forward a proposal in September 2005 to replace the Regulation with a new one."
"In March of this year the Council adopted a general approach on the Commission proposal."
"In June the European Parliament adopted its position at first reading, which contained 85 amendments."
"On the basis of this, the Council achieved political consensus on the proposal on 12 October."
"The adopted text is to be formally reinforced as a common position in a future Council session and submitted to the European Parliament, so that consensus can be swiftly reached at second reading."
"In consideration of the security problems experienced by the United Kingdom in August this year, the Council hopes that the institutions will reach consensus on the new Regulation as quickly as possible."
"The impact of the new security measures recently introduced by the Commission and its committee for civil aviation security should, in addition, be monitored continually."
"Is the Council satisfied that there is enough cooperation between EU Member States in the fight against international terrorism?"
"Do you agree that Europol and the EU Anti-Terror Office are being adequately funded?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, naturally we can always improve our efforts in the fight against terrorism."
"A lot of measures have of course been taken, especially in recent years, but there is always definitely room for improvement."
"(LT) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, most of us arrive here by air."
"I cannot remember even one case over recent years when aircraft were not delayed by a half-hour or an hour."
"Usually, the reason given is security issues."
"Could the reason be - and perhaps this really is the case - poorly organised and performed work?"
"Will we still be able to verify whether security requirements are truly being applied after adoption of this document?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, as well as decision-making it is obviously very important that we monitor implementation and also continuously monitor changes in the operational environment."
"It is also vital, of course, that we are able to establish identical rules for different airports and different Member States."
"Obviously, good predictability will definitely enable us in everyday practical circumstances to tell beforehand how much time security checks, for example, will take up and thereby reduce the amount of inconvenience caused to passengers."
"I nevertheless think that we who travel very regularly also need to get used to the fact that air travel has become a more challenging occupation than before."
"(DE) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like - in my capacity as rapporteur on the extension of the powers of the European Air Safety Agency - to report to you that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has, with reference to this subject, also discussed the possibility of entrusting the EASA with security functions."
"I would be interested to know what the Presidency of the Council thinks about that idea."
"Now for my second question. Something that has struck me personally is that the privatisation of security checks at airports has had the consequence that these are less able to deal with extreme situations than, for example, the police."
"Would it not make sense to reverse this privatisation and have security checks carried out once more by state agencies?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, at the request of the Irish Government, the Council altered the rules on language in June 2005 and added the Irish language to the list of official and working languages of the European Union institutions."
"The Council decided that the institutions would not have to draft all legal provisions in Irish or publish them in this language in the Official Journal of the European Union."
"This decision is therefore a departure from the rules."
"It will remain in force for five years and that period may be renewed."
"It was also decided that the derogation would not apply to the regulations made in the codecision procedure."
"In accordance with the decision to add Irish to the list of working languages, the Council has taken all the necessary practical steps to ensure that there is due implementation of the decisions as from 1 January 2007, when the Regulation comes into force."
"I thank the President-in-Office for her reply."
"Can I take it that, apart from the derogation mentioned, the Irish language will be given equal treatment with all other languages of this Parliament?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, as I said, the Irish language has been added to the list of the official and working languages of the European Union on the strength of the derogation which I have just referred to."
"Parliament will itself also have the right to decide how it will in practice implement this."
"When I said, however, that the Council has taken all the necessary steps to implement the decision, that refers to many sorts of practical issues and in my first answer I did not want to describe in detail everything that will be taking place there, but everything that this decision requires."
"- (LT) I have a question for Mrs Lehtomäki concerning the future; while having 21 official languages in the European Union does, of course, reflect our precious national diversity, it is, on the other hand, becoming costly and increasingly complex."
"What do the Council and the country holding the Presidency think about the future?"
"Will this circle continue to expand or will some measures perhaps be applied to simplify language-related procedures?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, like the honourable Member, the Council is worried about tighter press censorship in China."
"At all the rounds of the EU-China human rights dialogue held twice a year, the European Union has systematically and repeatedly urged China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which contains rules on freedom of expression."
"It has also encouraged China to lift travel restrictions on foreign journalists and made other demands that relate to interviewing Chinese citizens."
"This issue was raised at the round of talks on 19 October in Beijing as part of the EU-China human rights dialogue."
"(NL) Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, when the freedom of the press is curbed in some poor African country, then the Council is the first to denounce this in the sharpest terms and to threaten sanctions."
"When it happens in China, people simply express their concern."
"This has all the hallmarks of double standards."
"My question is specifically: will the violation of the freedom of press in China once again feature on the agenda at the next EU-China summit?"
"Secondly, what specific measures will you be taking in order to actually demand that China's freedom of press and human rights in general be upheld?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, at its meeting in June 2006 the European Council welcomed the progress that had been made in talks relating to the proposal put forward by the Commission in July last year for a Regulation establishing a European Agency for Fundamental Rights and a proposal for a Council decision empowering the European Agency for Fundamental Rights to pursue its activities in areas referred to under the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union, which is to say cooperation on justice and home affairs."
"The European Council asked for the necessary measures to be implemented as soon as possible, so that the Agency could be set up and so that it could start operations on 1 January 2007."
"In accordance with the European Council conclusions, the Finnish Presidency held a number of bilateral meetings in July, August, September and October with the aim of resolving the main question still unanswered, namely extending the work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union."
"At a Council session in early October the Presidency presented a review of the talks that had been held and asked for support for the idea of extending the work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union, but in a more restricted format than in the Commission's original proposal."
"The majority of the delegations that presented their view supported this approach by the Presidency, although some wondered whether a proper legal basis for the move would be found."
"The Presidency is continuing to look at the options and will put forward an interim proposal to the delegations in the near future."
"As regards the Agency's competence, the aim of the Agency is to provide advice and expertise on fundamental rights to Community institutions, bodies and agencies when they are applying Community law, and in this way help them guarantee a respect for fundamental rights when they implement measures or determine policy within the context of their competences."
"There is general consensus that establishing such an agency would create added value for EU policy on human rights and increase its coherence."
"The Agency will also be the main point of contact in the European Union for matters relating to fundamental rights."
"It will discharge its duties, complementing the work of the Council of Europe and in synergy with it, if the decisions on establishing it are taken."
"The points you have raised reflect the concern that many of us in Parliament have that, once we propose this agency, the initial role we had envisaged for it will be diluted until it ends up as a think-tank or a contact point that would merely be distributing information from one Member State to another, rather than taking a leading role in defending fundamental rights."
"Maybe you could enlighten us as to whether that is a true interpretation of what you have been outlining concerning the bilateral meetings."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, first it has to be said that it is intended that this Agency should be an advisory, expert body."
"We also of course believe, however, that it would be difficult to justify to our citizens the establishment of a Fundamental Rights Agency which would be denied the right to exercise the key competences necessary to do its job and undertake action under the third pillar."
"Accordingly, the work on this issue continues."
"It seems to me that the Member States are muddling their way through to creating an agency that will not have within its responsibilities the very subject area where EU action is most likely to cause problems with regard to human rights."
"I have a further question: does the Council not agree that we seem to be creating more and more agencies, like confetti sprinkled around the Member States, so that everybody has one, rather than when there is a real need - not so much this one, perhaps, but many of the others that have been created?"
"All of them have a top-heavy structure with a management board with representation from every Member State and an administration that is sometimes smaller than the management board."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, the Council is committed to doing more to build long-term relations with Iran based on trust and cooperation."
"Improved relations will mean progress in all the problematic issues, among which are human rights, terrorism, Iran's attitude to the peace process in the Middle East and local matters there, and Iran's nuclear programme."
"In the matter of Iran's nuclear industry, the Council has many a time said it was committed to a diplomatic solution, which would take account of the international concern about Iran's nuclear programme, but at the same time confirms Iran's right to the peaceful utilisation of nuclear power in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"Regarding this, the Council stated on 17 October that it greatly valued the perseverance with which High Representative Javier Solana has since June encouraged Iran to respond to the demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency's governing board and the UN Security Council and continued talks on long-term arrangements."
"The EU views seriously the IAEA's evaluation that it has not been able to make any progress in almost four years of continued close monitoring in its efforts to confirm the accuracy and scope of Iran's announcements regarding the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme."
"The EU is also very worried that Iran has not ended all its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, as the IAEA's governing board and the UN Security Council have asked."
"The Security Council stated in its Resolution 1696 that it intended to implement relevant measures under Article 41 unless Iran complied with the demand."
"The Council accordingly is of the opinion that, if Iran continues its uranium enrichment activities, the Union will have no other alternative but to back talks on these sanctions."
"The Council this month stated that the door to the negotiating chamber was still open for Iran, and urged the country strongly to opt for the positive approach that had been proposed for it."
"The EU's High Representative put forward to Iran on 6 June proposals drawn up by six countries."
"These far-reaching proposals would form a basis for a long-term agreement and would give Iran everything it needs to develop its current civil nuclear energy sector, and they also take account of international concerns."
"Opting for this positive approach would prepare the way for new relations with Iran, which could be based on mutual respect and extended cooperation in politics and economic matters."
"The Council hopes that progress can be made along this enlightened path."
"I can see that you are trying to have confidence-building measures between Europe and Iran, to try to better relations between the two of them and act as honest broker in this serious situation; but the idea of sanctions does not really work."
"It did not work in Iraq and it is not going to work in Iran."
"It is quite a wealthy, oil-rich country and they will just carry on."
"It may affect them somewhat, but it is not going to affect them that much in the long run."
"There are certain issues that you touched on yourself."
"One of these is the shipment of heroin out of Afghanistan through Iran, and considering that there are about three million heroin addicts in Iran and they have lost about 3000 troops on the border trying to stop this going on ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, the Council agrees that trade could have major significance in bringing India and Pakistan closer together."
"In its conclusions in February 2004 the Council repeated that it supported efforts to promote regional cooperation within the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and especially the agreement on establishing a free trade zone in South Asia by the year 2006."
"The EU is pleased with the recently signed South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), but understands that some Member States of SAARC still have unresolved bilateral issues."
"Resolving these would give the Member States of the Association the opportunity to derive full benefit from the agreements they are signatories to."
"Generally speaking, the EU still supports all the efforts being made to facilitate trade in multilateral contexts as they are an important way to strengthen trade and investment links between the different countries."
"The decision by the SAARC ministerial council to confer on the EU the role of observer is a splendid opportunity to develop cooperation between SAARC and the EU."
"Cooperation between the two was discussed at the Seventh EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October."
"The EU wants to improve the practical support it gives to SAARC."
"The Commission has already drafted a programme on economic cooperation with SAARC."
"The programme covers facilitation of trade, standards and cooperation between new businesses."
"The aim is to promote trade within the region by aiding the implementation of SAFTA, and this, it is hoped, will provide the impetus for improved political relations in the region."
"The SAARC Secretariat and the Member States of the EU intend to adopt this programme in the near future."
"The Union is encouraging broad dialogue between India and Pakistan and hopes that trading and other relations will develop favourably, because that would promote stability in the whole region."
"We welcome the fact that there have been moves to increase trust between India and Pakistan recently, as a result of which freer contacts between people, direct bus and train connections and visits by members of parliament and sports teams have become possible."
"The Indian and Pakistani presidents met in Havana this September."
"Relations between the two countries were discussed at general level at a summit meeting held on 13 October."
"First of all I would like to thank the Council Presidency for the very detailed response to the question I tabled."
"I would, however, like one further specific piece of information."
"This goes back to my original question as to whether the particular issue in relation to Pakistan/India and Kashmir was actually specifically discussed at the EU Summit with India in Helsinki."
"The reason I ask that is because both those nations are having detailed discussions at Foreign Secretary level on 14 and 15 November."
"Is there a specific message to them from the Council?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, I was indeed present most of the time at this summit, but I do not remember how the Kashmir question arose."
"I have had it confirmed to me, however, that this question was touched upon as part of the issue of regional stability and the situation in the region."
"(LT) Madam President-in-Office, I have a question in relation to next week's visit of the delegation of the European Parliament to Kashmir by invitation of the Indian government."
"What do you think the major states, primarily the United States and Russia, contribute to solving the problem of Kashmir and what else could the European Union do in this context?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, the honourable Member raises an important issue in this question."
"The Council, and the Council since the amendments made to the Treaty, together with the European Parliament have delivered an extensive Community code in the area of safety and security at work."
"The Member States are responsible for implementing this code."
"The Council welcomes the fact that in the case referred to in the honourable Member's question, the Italian and Polish law enforcement agencies cooperated to close down the work camps referred to."
"Although we, like the honourable Member, are concerned about this, it has to be said that responsibility for overseeing implementation of Community legislation in the Member States lies with the Commission, not the Council."
"(PL) Madam President, I have a question for the Presidency."
"Would it not be possible to activate mechanisms, perhaps through EUROJUST, that would facilitate the creation of a special monitoring unit, particularly in cases of suspected cooperation between local authorities, and even local police, and the organisers of criminal activities, such as the labour camps for citizens of Central and Eastern Europe?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, the Community code that exists for this sector and the secondary legislation that has been added to it demands a guarantee of equal treatment of nationals of other Member States with regard to working conditions."
"It is a question of monitoring it, which is the task of the Member States' own authorities."
"In accordance with the principles of the rule of law and good governance, in the Union we have to expect these supervisory bodies also to act in accordance with the regulations, and insist on it."
"- (LT) Mrs Lehtomäki, I would like to ask whether such camps in fact create a source of restriction for the free movement of persons."
"This is the situation the old Member States were in after the introduction of a transitional period for the new ones."
"By applying such a transitional period in Romania and Bulgaria, is it not encouraging illegal work?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Madam President, the Member States take decisions on whether to apply transition periods for new Member States regarding the free movement of the workforce."
"There were also Member States which applied a period of transition in the previous round of enlargement, but no longer do so in this new round."
"The reason is the perception that it is still better for a workforce to move within the framework of common European rules than create arrangements for derogations."
"As I said in my answer to a previous question, equal treatment of the workforce is very well regulated, but of course we have to pay more and more attention to implementation and supervision."
"(DE) Madam President, my criticism is not directed at you, for I hold the way you run Question Time in high regard, but I really would like you to cast your mind back to Monday, when we determined the order in which business was to be conducted this week."
"The Conference of Presidents envisaged that Question Time would last one and a half hours; then the President reduced it to an hour."
"Several Members protested at this, and there was no vote on it, and so I have worked on the assumption that we have available to us for Question Time the hour and a half that we are rightly due."
"I would like to ask whether the Council might remain for another quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, or is there a trade union for Council presidencies that forbids them from answering questions after seven in the evening?"
"Questions to the Council used to begin after 9 p.m, and that worked like a dream, with the Council staying until the following day."
"To sum up, I think there is something wrong with this way of going about things."
"Mr Posselt, much as I am delighted by your compliment, you are wrong about our debate on Monday, since it concerned the agenda rather than the Rules of Procedure, and it was the agenda that was the subject of a vote."
"You can check that again in the Minutes."
"We should all take Question Time seriously - or more seriously than we do - as an important prerogative of Members, and we should all work together to ensure that it is not dropped from the agenda too frequently."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Nairobi Conference on Climate Change (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Nairobi Conference on Climate Change B6-0440/2006)."
"Μember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, the twelfth conference of the contracting parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Nairobi is the first such conference to be held in sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest area on the planet with which the European Union maintains particular political relations."
"It is therefore only natural that the conference should focus on the needs of developing countries."
"The European Union will stress in particular that combating climate change may be combined with fast economic development and, furthermore, that policies to reduce emissions must be incorporated into decision-making procedures in crucial sectors."
"The development of the economies of the countries of Asia, Africa and South America, a secure energy supply and improved air quality are, for example, important - parallel - benefits of actions to combat climate change."
"I believe that improving the understanding, at international level, of the dangerous repercussions of climate change and the show of interest in addressing the needs of developing countries will increase the potential for us to reach an agreement on the period after 2012."
"The European Union has four specific priorities in Nairobi."
"Firstly, to achieve agreement on the institutional framework for the Adaptation Fund."
"The fund will be financed from levies on the clean development mechanism and is expected to disburse more than EUR 350 million between 2008 and 2012."
"Secondly, to achieve agreement on the list of activities within the framework of the five-year programme of work on adaptation."
"The programme contains a series of activities aimed to improve our adaptability, such as further improvement of our knowledge about the negative repercussions of climate change, its socio-economic repercussions and the weak points of our economies and societies to climate change."
"Thirdly, to facilitate greater access to the clean development mechanism by the poor countries of Africa and other areas of the planet."
"We need to address the question of the fair distribution of projects under the clean development mechanism, because only a small percentage of all the projects are destined for Africa."
"Fourthly, the debate on the period after 2012, which will continue, without being completed in Nairobi."
"I truly believe that we still have a great deal of work in store."
"There are various opinions as to what should be done."
"The developing countries do not feel comfortable with the prospect of having to step up their efforts to combat climate change."
"At the same time, numerous developing countries continue to hesitate to take the necessary measures to reduce emissions which are required in order to help limit the average rise in temperature on the planet by two degrees Celsius."
"In Nairobi, the European Union will justifiably continue to maintain that the fight against climate change and the millennium development goals, are not only mutually compatible but also mutually dependent."
"In Nairobi we hope to secure, on the one hand, a clear, specific and balanced approach and stable progress in the ad hoc working party on Article 3, paragraph 9, on the dialogue being held within the framework of the convention and, on the other hand, agreement on how the Kyoto Protocol will be revised on the basis of Article 9."
"However, we need to look beyond Nairobi, given that Europe needs to step up its efforts in order to persuade its partners throughout the world to continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after 2012."
"It is very positive that 10 members of Parliament will be joining the delegation and I personally look forward - as over the last two years - to close cooperation with them."
"I shall ensure that they are fully informed and shall pass all the available information on to them immediately."
"We shall address the media together and I hope that the Members of Parliament will have contacts and dialogues with delegates from other countries during the conference."
"In this way we shall be able to transfer to a global audience our ambition and joint vision for a sustainable future for mankind."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his well-chosen words here this evening."
"I am delighted to be one of the ten MEPs in the European Parliament group in the EU delegation."
"We are all members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and we will be led by our colleague, Mr Blokland, as our vice-chairman."
"I had expected my colleague, Mr Florenz, to be leading on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but I do not see him."
"Part of his question was to put down yet again a marker in the sand about the fact that the members of the European Parliament's delegation, as part of the EU delegation, will be treated as second-class citizens."
"I know the Commissioner will tell us the tale about interinstitutional agreements, the Council, the Commission, precedence and practice."
"Frankly, we are all sick of hearing that and we do not want to hear it any more."
"The Commissioner is always excellent on these occasions and gives very generously of his time, as do his officials."
"They brief us extremely well after the event, outside the door, but we are never let in, not even as observers at the high-level meetings."
"I should like, on behalf of my PPE-DE Group colleagues and, I suspect, all colleagues, to be treated on a par with both the European Commission and the Council delegates who will be there."
"If the Commission calls it an EU delegation, then the three EU parties who are present should be treated equally."
"The Commissioner told us at a recent briefing that he does not expect spectacular breakthroughs."
"This will be another interim COP, COP 12-MOP 2 if you like, but it is very important, as this is the first meeting on sub-Saharan Africa."
"The Commissioner mentioned the need to extend CDMs."
"At the moment only 2.5% is spent in Africa in this area and that is mainly in Morocco and South Africa, and none in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa as such."
"A lot of work needs to be done there."
"I am very interested in looking into the creation of a carbon fund for Africa, as the Commissioner has suggested, and where that will take us."
"Who will finance the Adaptation Fund?"
"The argument is about whether GEF will be the main source of funding and where that is going to be."
"In Montreal it was agreed that there would be two tracks in the negotiations: one for the UNFCC framework and the other for the Kyoto Protocol."
"I believe this clarifies where different countries stand."
"Together we can make progress, bring in more of the developing countries and persuade more of our friends in the United States in particular to join us in the very important task of reducing carbon emissions."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Al Gore has been travelling the world, spreading his message, for some time."
"The climate is changing quickly, more quickly than expected."
"Ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising and we will soon reach the point of no return."
"That is when a political answer is expected."
"We should not simply cry in Al Gore's arms, but also start looking for a solution."
"Nairobi presents us with an opportunity for meeting this challenge head-on."
"When we discuss the energy crisis and climate problems, we should not be overcome by pessimism, because solutions are possible."
"Where can we find these solutions?"
"First of all by trusting our own measures."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express once again my support in favour of the emissions trading system, even if it is far from perfect."
"I am, above all, talking to the Commission, who should ensure that the national allocation plans are credible and that over-allocation is a thing of the past."
"In the longer term, we must consider auctioning emission rights as an option, because this is how we can prevent the windfall profits in electricity companies and the all too generous allocation of free emission rights."
"Secondly, I would argue in favour of a large-scale investment in the development of new, clean energy."
"Apart from existing initiatives, there is much scope for innovation."
"There is the blue energy, harnessed by mixing salt and fresh water, that can produce energy."
"Or the ladder mills with high-level kites that work as windmills and generate energy."
"Other alternatives include energy-producing greenhouses and houses, geothermal energy and solar mirrors; so much can be done."
"We must capitalise on these possibilities by means of technological innovation."
"This must be funded by governments but, in time, also by auctioning emission rights."
"Thirdly, we must be pro-active in cooperating with countries such as China, which opens a new power station every month and needs clean coal technology, which we must supply."
"Thanks to the transfer of technology, China may well take on board obligations after 2012."
"If China joins in, participation from the US will also be more likely."
"Fourthly, we must invest generously in the adjustment fund."
"Europe has the historical responsibility of climate change, and it is up to us to help the developing countries to adjust to its implications."
"Climate change is not always a popular subject in developing countries."
"A leader of a developing country - Mr President, I had been given an extra minute, because Mrs Ferreira had generously given me her speaking time, which gives me a total of three minutes - once said to a Dutch environment minister: 'First, we will become as rich as you, and only then will we worry about climate change as much as you do.'"
"I think that things could be done differently. They could become rich without CO2 emissions."
"Europe has the duty to help them achieve this, and we must, in Nairobi, show them that we really mean it."
"Commissioner, I am looking forward to an excellent group effort during the Nairobi conference."
"Needless to say, I wholeheartedly support Mrs Doyle's appeal."
"I think that we must be involved in all negotiations as much as possible and have maximum access to the meetings, and I know that you will do your level best in this respect."
"I should like to close by repeating that I hope for good cooperation."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for coming to speak to such a packed house about the most important subject facing the planet!"
"You suggested before that this conference of the parties in Nairobi is a bit of a marking-time sort of meeting, that the lateral events might be as important as the main ones."
"But we have often heard that, with every month that passes, the problems become greater and more difficult to resolve."
"So perhaps we cannot afford to have any more intermediate events: the stakes have to be raised and you have to try and extract everything you can from every possible meeting."
"I would like to raise three particular issues."
"First of all, transport emissions within the European Union."
"According to current figures, five of the major car manufacturers are going to reach the voluntary agreement target of 140g of CO2 by 2008, but 75% are not on target to reach that."
"Just remember what that means."
"They signed a voluntary agreement with the Commission, with the European Union."
"In their own private boardrooms they have looked at the figures and recognised that they could make more profits out of SUVs and four-wheel drives, and they have deliberately decided that they are not going to fulfil that commitment."
"They have torn it up, they have not shown good faith and it is now time for the Commission to clamp down really hard."
"We know from the five who are meeting the target that there is nothing special about 140g."
"You need tough action, and I hope that will be forthcoming in the next few months."
"Secondly, the national allocation plans."
"I know that you are sending the national allocation plans back to the Member States and saying that a 15% margin between allocations and real CO2 emissions is far from good enough."
"This is an impossible situation."
"You know that this is the most important instrument."
"You need to be tough and to use every resource the Commission has at its disposal to emphasise that national governments have to act on the fine speeches they make in Council."
"Finally, looking ahead to the post 2012 emissions trading scheme, how are you going to make it work in future?"
"Free allocations were a good start, but proved pretty weak in practice."
"Auctioning will still give windfall profits to some of the major power generators."
"You think you have to start looking at benchmarking, which is very difficult."
"But you need to tell industry now across the whole of Europe that we are going to reward best practice and it should start investing now in making a difference to our planet."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the message that we are receiving from the world of science is becoming ever more serious: the more recent the study, the more serious the message from science is on accelerated climate change."
"We are approaching a threshold, past which major disasters are unavoidable."
"That is what British Foreign Minister Margaret Beckett said and she went on to say we are heading for climate chaos."
"At the same time the economic analyses show that very ambitious emission reductions are very reasonable in terms of cost and they will of course be a lot cheaper than letting climate change run riot."
"Public awareness of this is growing, reflected, for example, in the opinion expressed by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) that Europe must reduce its emissions by 75% by the middle of the century and it cannot wait about for the others to follow."
"Even in the United States of America public opinion is changing."
"That is evident from the huge success of Al Gore's film, long articles in the big newspapers on climate change and its possible solution, and, most recently, the latest issue of Scientific American on energy without coal."
"In this situation what we really need is leadership on the part of the EU."
"In the United States too, those who desire responsible climate protection look to Europe, and what Europe does encourages them."
"We must be worthy of this trust."
"Neither can we be content in the context of international talks with waiting and wasting time."
"We have to draft our own constructive proposals on what the world should do after 2012."
"Within Europe too, we have to make our own emission reduction commitments and take action in line with the aim to prevent the world from heating up by more than two degrees."
"We also need to implement our own commitments under Kyoto, and, with regard to that, the emissions trading system is very important."
"I urge the Commission to be strict."
"It is not enough that emissions are traded; emissions trading must also result in a reduction in emissions in the way described in the Kyoto Protocol."
"Business also needs European leadership."
"So that it can invest wisely it needs long-term emission reduction targets."
"The wrong investments will become very expensive."
"The lifetime of a power plant is 40 years."
"Power plants that are hostile to the climate should no longer be built at all."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that climate change is for real."
"The average temperature is rising every year, and this year, unfortunately, was no exception."
"That is why last week, Prime Ministers Balkenende and Blair wrote a letter to the Council Presidency requesting for practical action."
"I quote from their letter: 'We only have ten to fifteen years to take the steps that are needed to prevent us from going beyond the point of no return'."
"I should like to find out what steps we can expect very shortly, as time is pressing."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for the energy efficiency action plan that was published last week, although I should like to add in this connection that the target percentage of 20% is, first of all, too low and secondly, will never be met if it is not combined with reduction targets for the Member States."
"As Mrs Doyle and Mrs Corbey have already said, the delegation from this House insists on the climate conference pledging that we finally be admitted to all the meetings that are organised by the EU delegation."
"Commissioner Dimas knows this and we count on his support in order to achieve this."
"We are an official EU institution and are therefore just as much entitled to attend those meetings as are the others."
"Mr President, as we prepare for the next conference on climate change in Nairobi, what is most urgently needed is honesty."
"It is true that we are proud of the progress we have made so far, but what is the outcome in terms of overall emission reductions?"
"The world needs efficient climate policies that deliver and not unfounded complacency."
"We all know and agree that we need to move from one-sided EU climate politics to a global front, as only truly global action will lead to efficient emission reductions."
"Therefore, for the sake of the climate and to really win the battle, let us be honest when analysing the problems arising from the Kyoto Protocol, as well as from the EU ETS preparing for Kyoto."
"I am afraid that the headlines have already been written: 'Nairobi was a success and the EU leads the way'."
"But is this the right way?"
"Understandably for the EU, it is politically important to stand in the front line and to show a good example, encouraging others to follow sooner or later."
"However, unless the front cannot be widened, the EU efforts will be like taking a few drops out of the ocean or having a haircut to lose weight."
"What makes this especially challenging is the effect that one-sided efforts have on the markets."
"In the global markets, this means giving the competitive advantage to the polluter, as the cost of environmental investments and emission rights cannot be included in the prices."
"The temptation is for the international capital of the global markets to be invested where there are neither emission restrictions nor environmental norms."
"A pollution shift is not a pollution cut."
"Interestingly, the last conference on climate change in Montreal was publicly described as a victory."
"Looking at the results, however, there is not much reason to celebrate."
"In terms of emission reductions, not a single step forward was taken in Montreal."
"There is no implication that the mitigation front would be widened."
"With the Kyoto Protocol, only a quarter of global emissions are controlled."
"That is not enough."
"Mr President, Commissioner, climate change is no longer speculation, it is a fact."
"As is the prospect of a countdown to unprecedented catastrophe for further generations if the present unacceptable situation continues."
"The time has come for brave and bold decisions that will bring about drastic measures which can secure significant results."
"The EU has in the past taken a leading role in this field, and the UN Nairobi Conference presents our opportunity and our duty to press for concrete and effective action."
"We no longer have the luxury of waiting for those who still need convincing, or continuing to tolerate those who simply do not care."
"In my view at least, the following two points must be included in our Nairobi strategy: firstly, strict emission reduction targets must be set and severe penalties must be envisaged and implemented for those who fail to meet them; secondly, the international community must isolate those countries that have not signed the relevant conventions and are not willing to cooperate in the joint fight against climate change."
"Here I am referring particularly, of course, to the United States, which alone is responsible for one third of global carbon dioxide emissions."
"The stance of the USA is represented by the extraordinarily selfish and inconceivably arrogant way the US State Department's spokesman, Adam Ereli, commented on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Russia in 2004."
"He said, 'We do not believe that the Kyoto Protocol is something that is realistic for the United States and we have no intention of signing or ratifying it'."
"It is about time we stood up to the US and told it straight that if it does not sign and ratify the Kyoto Protocol forthwith, our transatlantic relations will suffer a very heavy blow indeed."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to express my appreciation for the opportunity to respond to some of the questions raised in this debate and to express my thanks for all the positive contributions."
"If Nairobi is a success, it will mean that we have made the right decisions and the right agreements."
"The Commission recognises the need for the European Union to maintain its leading role in not only international but also domestic efforts to fight climate change."
"I agree that it is important to assist developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and to help them in deploying sustainable technologies."
"A few days ago, the Commission proposed the new Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund."
"The anticipated total initial funding from public and commercial sources is EUR 100 million."
"This new initiative aims to boost climate-friendly technologies in Africa in particular."
"In addition, we have the Adaptation Fund."
"We hope it will be agreed in Nairobi to make this operational."
"The fund will be financed by 2% on the proceeds of the clean development mechanism."
"We expect about EUR 350 million to be available for investments in developing countries and in Africa for the period 2008 to 2012."
"The European Union can only be credible in its leadership role when it achieves meaningful reductions in domestic emissions and complies with international commitments under the Kyoto Protocol."
"The second national allocation plans of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme will be a decisive test."
"If Member States put more allowances into the European market than companies are likely to emit collectively, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme would fail."
"Mr Davies said that collectively the first 17 plans notified propose a total allocation that exceeds 2005 emissions of these Member States by about 15%, which is really a lot."
"I am determined that we shall not permit the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme to fail and the Commission will assess all the National Allocation Plans in a consistent and fair manner."
"All the Member States will have to contribute to the success of the Emissions Trading Scheme in the period 2008 to 2012."
"I agree that we should try very hard with our public relations and the possibilities for influencing our governments, but also your involvement and action is important in this crucial phase of the Emissions Trading Scheme."
"I would ask you that together we ensure that, in all the capitals of the Member States and in Brussels, this debate on the allocation is about how much more we should reduce, rather than how much more we can emit."
"In the next few days, a communication on the Emissions Trading Scheme should be adopted by the Commission, launching a review of this important scheme."
"This will address its scope, how to make it simpler and more predictable, strengthening compliance and linking up with Emissions Trading Schemes elsewhere."
"As regards tackling transport emissions, which contribute to about 22% of the emissions in the European Union, this year the Commission will put forward a legislative proposal to include the aviation sector in European Union emissions trading."
"Also this year, the Commission will review the possibilities for further reductions of carbon dioxide emissions from cars after 2008-2009, with a view to meeting the Community target of 120g of carbon dioxide per kilometre by 2012."
"That will, of course, require legislation."
"The Commission is also exploring options for a legal framework in the European Union to allow the safe capture and underground storage of carbon dioxide from industrial installations, provided that that is considered appropriate."
"The Commission also intends to promote adaptation measures, helping the regional and national decision-makers to deal with increasingly evident impacts of climate change."
"On the basis of a Green Paper on adaptation to climate change, to be launched at a conference in Brussels on 1 December, the Commission will begin a public debate on the need to adapt to unavoidable climate change."
"Most importantly, we will have to further frame the international debate after 2012."
"Next January, the Commission is planning to release its energy package."
"A core part of the package will be the strategic European Union energy review."
"This will put forward an alternative energy scenario for the European Union that is in line with the European Union's long-term climate change objective."
"Close to the adaptation of the energy package, the Commission will also be releasing a Green Paper on the European Union's views on further action to tackle climate change."
"This Green Paper will respond to the European Council's request to develop a European Union strategy to limit global warming to 2°C, compared to pre-industrial levels."
"It will identify concrete proposals, both within the European Union and internationally, for achieving that objective."
"One of our main objectives will be to bring on board the United States and other fast-developing countries like China and India in a common but differentiated way, as provided for by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change."
"The Commission will ensure that the energy package and the Green Paper put forward a climate and energy strategy for the European Union that is coherent, coordinated and sustainable."
"I believe that since last year in Montreal there is a certain new momentum in the international debate on climate change."
"While we need to keep up the pace in domestic efforts, in the international process we will have to remain patient and continue to build trust."
"Finally, I would like to say that Al Gore has really helped a lot in raising awareness in the European Union and I had the honour to introduce him to a packed theatre in Brussels about a month ago."
"I have received one motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Inland waterway transport (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the promotion of inland waterway transport: NAIADES, an integrated European Action Programme for inland waterway transport."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to convey my heartfelt thanks to the Vice-President of the Commission for 'NAIADES', the Action Programme for inland waterway transport."
"Parliament is your ally, because inland waterway transport must be given a prominent place on the European agenda."
"Our report has received unanimous support from the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I should like to extend warm thanks to my fellow MEPs, the shadow rapporteurs, as well as the staff for their efforts."
"Mr Vice-President, although Parliament backs your goals, we do think that more ambition is called for if they are to be capable of being achieved."
"In the report, Parliament underlines, above all, the importance of reliable inland waterways."
"This is, after all, the key to their success and to their expansion."
"Reliable inland waterway transport hinges on sound infrastructure and transhipment facilities, and the current maintenance backlog of the inland waterways infrastructure in Europe is one of the most urgent problems to be resolved."
"In this respect, the new Member States, with their specific problems, must receive special attention."
"Prime responsibility lies, of course, with national or regional authorities, which give too little priority in this area."
"This House also wants to see more funding within the framework of the TENs, especially where priority projects are concerned, and we are still waiting for the appointment of a TEN coordinator."
"Could you promise that you will come up with a proposal shortly?"
"Parliament would also like greater priority and a higher preferential rate of 20% for all inland waterway projects of common interest, which will make it possible to back many small infrastructure projects, for the bulk of the funds have, so far, in fact been diverted to rail and road, which has to change if we take the NAIADES Programme seriously."
"River information services projects must also be considered for a contribution from the multi-annual programme."
"This is something Parliament will be voting in favour of tomorrow, and is also what the Finnish Presidency has proposed in the Council."
"If you can give it your backing therefore, things are bound to fall into place."
"Parliament is also ambitious where the environment is concerned."
"We hope that the Commission will present regulations for cleaner fuel as quickly as possible."
"Last Friday, we received additional information from your offices, for which we are indebted."
"Clearly, much research has been done, also into the technical and economic impact."
"The results appear promising, and that is why I should like to ask you to table a sound proposal when the directive is reviewed."
"It is important not to lose track of the prospect that IWT will be just as clean as road transport."
"This is also something the sector itself is in favour of."
"I have read in the paper that the sector believes it could achieve more via the Central Consultancy Register, since the Commission is said not to want to rush things."
"I hope you will be able to put my mind at rest about this."
"Much has been said about the innovation fund, which, in my view, is a wonderful instrument to flesh out this fine Action Programme."
"The sector has good ideas of its own, and EUR 40 million have been set aside in Brussels."
"This House is of the opinion that the Commission and Council should also show commitment and should match the same amount, so that EUR 120 million would become available."
"The Council has produced little in the way of concrete commitment, but would you be in a position to convince them?"
"Even more importantly, would you be prepared to make these EUR 40 million available over the next few years?"
"I consider this to be a test case to demonstrate whether you really want to implement the Action Programme."
"The Action Programme contains various other points we are very happy to endorse: a funding manual, guidelines for state support and the announced screening of existing legislation, which is desperately needed in order to trim down the administrative burden."
"I should, in this connection, like to draw your attention to problematic environmental legislation."
"It is not for no reason that I have left the institutional issue to last, something for which I have set out a clear course in my report."
"We must focus on cooperation, take into consideration the current competences of all participating parties and capitalise on the expertise of international organisations."
"A battle over powers will only have a delaying effect."
"We must start implementing the Action Programme as a matter of urgency."
"Finally, the Commission will also need to show a real commitment to action."
"By rolling up their sleeves, the Commission will prove that it is really taking inland waterways to heart and only then will the time be right to consider, if necessary - and I am not convinced of this yet - the institutional relations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Wortmann-Kool on this excellent report."
"The Resolution shows that there is broad agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the promotion of inland waterway transport."
"Inland waterway transport is safe, low-polluting and energy efficient, and offers great reserve capacities."
"Despite the advantages it offers, inland waterway transport is under-used: it represents scarcely 6% of the total overland goods transport in the Union, even though, in a few Member States, its modal share stands at 40%."
"Today, Europe has 36 000 km of inland waterways."
"We are talking here about a genuine trans-European network."
"We need a European approach in order to promote this mode of transport."
"It can achieve a far greater modal share if, as you just pointed out, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, our approach is accompanied by concrete action."
"I am grateful to Parliament for the support that it has given me via this report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool."
"I am going to confine myself, Mr President, to a few remarks about the main points, starting with the improvement of market conditions."
"We must develop new multi-modal, innovative services, so as to enable inland waterway transport to play its role among the large seaports and the big cities in the Hinterland."
"More than 70% of the inland navigation sector is made up of small businesses, often owner-boatmen."
"We need to create conditions that will help strengthen their position in the market: for example, improved access to funds through the removal of any regulatory and administrative barriers and clear indications as to what State aid is available."
"The Commission is going to start work on State aid for this sector."
"These guidelines will be published in 2008-2009."
"That is all I have to say on market conditions."
"As regards the modernisation of the fleet, inland waterway transport must improve its logistical efficiency and its performance in relation to the environment and safety."
"Innovations must be focused on the construction of boats - for example, the engine and the propulsion system - and on information and communication technologies for what are known as river information services."
"A regulatory framework already exists, but we must ensure that the system is actually implemented."
"That also applies to the standards applicable to fuel intended for inland navigation."
"Stricter standards, which we should propose by the end of the year, will enable us to further improve the environmental quality of inland waterway transport."
"I now come to the promotion of employment and skills."
"Inland waterway transport suffers from a dearth of crews and a worsening shortage of candidates to take over businesses."
"The strategy must be focused on an improvement to onboard working and living conditions and on professional training."
"I plan to propose harmonising the requirements relating to crew members and to boatmasters' certificates in 2008 via the mutual recognition procedure."
"With regard to the image of waterway transport, we must correct the one that inland navigation currently suffers from."
"We must make people aware of the real potential of inland navigation by implementing a network to promote inland waterway transport, as exists in certain regions."
"With regard to waterway infrastructure, there are, within the network, bottlenecks that curb the competitiveness of inland waterway transport."
"We must therefore remove the existing obstacles."
"That is primarily a responsibility of the Member States, but the Community can help thanks to the trans-European networks."
"In this context, the Commission prioritises the development of the two major waterway routes: the Rhine-Meuse-Danube route and the Seine-Scheldt link."
"In the new financial regulation submitted for Parliament's approval, we have proposed a 30% rate of support for the waterway projects and the inclusion of these projects in the multi-annual programme."
"I hope that the Council, like Parliament, will support our proposals."
"The contribution of intelligent transport systems is vital."
"We are preparing to implement river information services, by which, in practical terms, we mean a system for managing information concerning inland waterway transport, which will enable boatmen to plan their journeys better, to reduce the time they wait at locks and to constantly monitor transport."
"Mrs Wortmann-Kool, you mentioned the appointment of a TEN coordinator."
"I must say that we welcomed the positive results obtained by the six coordinators who have already been appointed."
"Mr Costa, for his part, has also called for the appointment of a coordinator for both inland waterway transport and maritime transport."
"I can tell you that my intention is indeed to select two coordinators over the next few weeks."
"The NAIADES programme provides for a range of very different actions: harmonised legislation, strategic promotion and coordination measures."
"All of these actions will only be effective, however, if the institutional framework is suitable."
"The fact is that, today, we are faced with fragmented resources and efforts spread over different levels."
"We therefore need to adapt the framework to the demands of an enlarged European market."
"We are in the process of analysing different options."
"The results of this analysis will be discussed with all of the parties concerned, with the Member States and with the international river commissions."
"To conclude, we need this NAIADES programme to be a success and, to that end, we need to be able to rely on the support of decision-makers at every level: national and regional authorities, river commissions and businesses."
"I am grateful to Parliament and to you, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for sending out, with this report, a strong signal in favour of the promotion of inland navigation, which Europe needs now more than ever."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Vice-President Barrot has sketched a wide-ranging programme concerning inland waterway transport, on which we can only congratulate him."
"Speaking from the perspective of Parliament, we consider this parliamentary report, prepared by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, to be a worthy statement and report on this wide-ranging programme."
"On this matter our intentions perfectly match those of the Commission."
"From among the various strategic ramifications, I would like to underline a single issue, that of infrastructure."
"Recent floods have demonstrated that in terms of infrastructure, and within that, specifically with regard to trying to improve navigability, we have to proceed cautiously in order to guarantee navigation on a permanent basis."
"Floods render navigation unreliable and unpredictable; therefore, the most important goal of the NAIADES programme is paying close attention to flood control."
"I would like to stress the programme's environmental considerations - which require special emphasis - such as the creation and conservation of floodplains."
"I believe that we have to act with care and in harmony with respect to environmental and navigational requirements."
"Just a brief comment on another point."
"For the navigability of the Danube, it is important to be able to count on high quality shipping conditions along its entire length."
"Among the third countries concerned, I would like to highlight Serbia."
"For Serbia, the value of the Danube as a waterway has increased considerably, and therefore, I suggest close cooperation on this matter among the future Member States of Romania and Bulgaria as well as the Black Sea region."
"All these proposals are put forward in the report, for which I express my thanks to my fellow Member, Mrs Wortmann-Kool."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, a moment ago I was saying to the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that, so far tonight, all of the speakers in this debate have been women."
"Then they will say that transport is only of interest to men."
"Perhaps NAIADES inspires us, and perhaps the Commissioner should take note and appoint two women coordinators for NAIADES."
"Let us return to serious issues though, and the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool."
"In principle, we formally support the Integrated European Action Programme for Inland Waterways, known as 'NAIADES', and the idea of giving it a greater political profile."
"It is true, and we have noted this, that the use of inland waterways varies a lot throughout Europe, from 0.1%, in countries like the United Kingdom, Italy, and even a little less in my country, to 40% in the Netherlands, which has a greater number of these waterways."
"Unfortunately, in some cases canals and rivers have been abandoned."
"Admirable attempts at recovery are being made, however."
"In my country, due to its mountainous nature, canals and rivers are used more for carrying irrigation and drinking water than for transport, but we nevertheless are aware of and support the initiatives relating to the navigable stretch of the Guadalquivir from Seville to the sea, which is also hoping to be included in the trans-European network."
"Furthermore, I am also delighted by the current efforts of my city, Zaragoza, which will host Expo 2008 and which, within that context, wishes - and this has been proposed within the context of the objective of promoting water and sustainable development - to restore the navigability of the River Ebro."
"We are therefore pleased to be able to include ourselves in this European project."
"We are talking about sustainable development when we refer to inland waterways' potential to help reduce the impact of CO2 emissions by up to 75% compared to roads and also - and this is why it is so important - to promote this inland waterways network at European level and to support new formulae so that this sector can be more competitive and efficient."
"Mrs Wortmann-Kool has done an excellent job as rapporteur, and we are eagerly awaiting the Commission's coming proposals to enhance the economic and competitive impact of this new sector."
"We particularly support the strengthening of infrastructures. That is to say, for thousands of kilometres of inland waterways and hundreds of inland ports, with lock infrastructures, etc., which have already been named, to finally become a connection network that strengthens regional and territorial cohesion."
"To this end, some of the amendments that we presented in committee and which have been included propose greater inclusion of this sector in the trans-European network programmes."
"We have also proposed supporting river information services, which we believe will very much increase the efficiency and safety of the sector."
"Furthermore, we believe that it is an excellent idea to obtain greater economic support for the sector's potential for container traffic, although there are still great deficiencies here."
"In the report on logistics, which I hope to be able to present to this House, I will clearly also include Mrs Wortmann-Kool's proposals on improving logistical aspects and innovation and technological progress for reducing operational costs."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has emphasised - and I am obliged to him for doing so - 6% of all goods and persons transported are carried on waterways, and so an ambitious programme is required if these unused capacities are to be put to work and the existing infrastructure improved."
"It has to be said that the greatest deficiency in this area is the lack of intermodal nodes; if transport links - including these means of transport - are to be developed, the first thing to be done is to establish ports and terminals."
"In other transport sectors, innovation has made great strides; here, though, it is limping along behind."
"There is still a lot of lost ground to be made up where fuels and materials are concerned, and this programme should provide an opportunity for that to be done, but we must also - as my colleague has already mentioned - give very serious attention to the environment, and I attach particular importance to this."
"I would also ask you to support an amendment that we have tabled, which has to do with the transport of hazardous goods on waterways, which must be subject to regulations every bit as stringent as those applicable to road and rail, for an accident with hazardous goods on a waterway can do enormous and irreparable damage."
"Another issue is the threat of flagging-out - the re-registration of vessels under flags of convenience - which poses a risk to social standards, among other things, and that is a danger we absolutely must take into account from the very outset."
"I want to thank the rapporteur for her superb report and the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation."
"Thank you all very much, and I hope that it will, tomorrow, be adopted as it now stands."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, for years, old canals were neglected or closed, inland waterway transport appeared to be a thing of the past and there was a massive growth in the transport of goods by road."
"Nowadays, everyone across the party-political boundaries welcomes the fact that the water-borne transport of goods is coming back into fashion."
"This consensus conceals different opinions, as was evident in this House during the debate in February 2003 on the subject of the White Paper on transport 2010."
"To my group, as to some others, water-borne transport is an alternative to ever more and widening motorways."
"It is a way of being economical with space and the environment."
"This is in contrast to another view, which wants more of everything, including, therefore, even more motorways."
"By creating overcapacity, entrepreneurs are given more freedom to make fresh choices within this overcapacity to decide which mode of transport is most advantageous to them at that particular moment in time."
"An example of overcapacity is the expensive Betuwe line that has been built as a TEN project for transport of freight by rail in the Netherlands alongside the rivers Waal and Lek, that are perfectly navigable, at the lower reaches of the Rhine."
"More pressing projects than these projects that are probably underutilised include the widening of the narrow canals that connect Northern France with Belgium and the Netherlands, or returning the ever dwindling transport across the Danube between Hungary and the Black Sea ever since the bombardments of 1999 back to its original level."
"My group is opposed to overcapacity. Even in the case of waterways, this is at the expense of space, nature and the environment."
"The adjustment of rivers impacts on flood plains, biodiversity, the supply of drinking water and flooding surrounding low lands."
"In addition, water-borne transport is not a panacea that magics away all the risks of polluting and harmful substances."
"Their transport entails risks not only for the rivers themselves, but also for the residential areas and areas of outstanding beauty that are located downstream."
"We need more than just cleaner engines and sulphur-free fuel."
"Together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we would propose infrastructural levies in order to promote fair competition between different modes of transport, a better environmental impact assessment of European development plans, a tightening of legislation for the transport of dangerous substances and preventing inland waterway ships from being put under flags of convenience, because this adversely affects social, security and environmental standards."
"Only when our water-borne transport meets quality requirements of this kind, is its growth a step in the right direction."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her extremely comprehensive report and thank her for the good cooperation."
"Like the other speakers, I should like to express wholehearted support for the NAIADES Programme."
"Inland waterway transport can, provided it is correctly backed by flanking policy, substantially contribute towards solving the problem of transport."
"I am pleased that this message is also being sent to the national, regional and local governments."
"Both old and new Member States are urged, in their economic and planning policy, to give due consideration to the scope that inland waterways offer in order to meet the transport needs of enterprises, not only for bulkier, but also for slimmer, flows of goods."
"In addition, the recommendation for active improvements in the fleet's environmental performance also receives my unqualified support."
"As in road transport, incentive schemes for the introduction of the reduction of emission and energy-saving measures in inland waterway transport also help make the fleet more environmentally-friendly."
"Finally, I hope that the Member States will approach this Action Programme with the same positive attitude and commitment as the Members of this House have done in the recent weeks."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to draw particular attention to the title of Mrs Wortmann-Kool's report."
"It is a report on the promotion of inland waterway transport."
"Inland waterway transport most certainly needs aid."
"This might not be the case in the Netherlands, where the report's author hails from, but it is certainly true of many other European Union countries, including Poland, my home country."
"The Oder Programme was adopted a few years ago in Poland, and was initially called the Oder 2006 Programme, but was later extended to last until 2015."
"However, all these schemes amount to empty words, because nothing is actually being done."
"The virtue of the report we are currently debating is that it sets out to deal with European inland waterways as an autonomous field, and here I emphasise the word 'autonomous' which means not treating inland waterways as a complement to road and rail transport, as an unimportant addition to them."
"Instead, inland waterways are perceived as an independent, autonomous whole."
"This is very significant, because the forthcoming accession of Bulgaria and Romania will provide a unique opportunity to create a European network of inland waterways."
"I would like to tell the House about one of my dreams."
"It is a dream I think many members of my committee share, and it involves a journey along the old and new inland waterways in Europe."
"It may be an old-fashioned journey, but it is a very beautiful one."
"In order to be able to undertake it, however, further significant investment is needed."
"I think it is worthwhile recalling a couple of significant ideas that have formed part of the aspirations of far-sighted politicians over the centuries."
"One of these is the plan for a canal between the Oder and the Danube, which would create a link between two important bodies of water."
"I urge the European Commission not to end the studies, but to continue working on a European network of inland waterways."
"Studies in this field should be continued, and I wish the venture every success."
"(DE) Mr President, as is well known, Austria is a land of mountains, but it is also - and Austria's national day being tomorrow, perhaps I might be permitted this allusion - described in its own national anthem as a land on a river, the river in question being the Danube."
"This makes inland waterways an important subject for us Austrians, as we are connected by water to the West, to the Rhine-Main-Meuse system that is to be found there, but also, and above all, to the south and east."
"We in Austria know how important it is - not only for our own country, but also for Europe as a whole - to have a better, by which I mean above all better-functioning system of waterways."
"Although reference has been made to the environment and technological dimensions, and to much else besides, we also know that it is above all for the sake of the new and future Member States of the EU that alternatives to roads are needed, for without them, we really are going to end up as roadkill, and what better alternative could there be than a well-developed and therefore well-used infrastructure in Corridor 7 of the Trans-European Network?"
"I am glad that the Commission is willing to attach greater importance to this mode of transport, and I can do no other than agree with much of what Vice-President Barrot has said today."
"While, though, we do need plans and programmes to be set out, they also need to be implemented, and as soon as possible."
"I hope that the contributions made at the Vienna conference on inland waterways staged by the Austrian Presidency of the Council were useful in terms of our subject overall and will therefore be relevant to our future opportunities."
"I particularly want to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool for the very good work she has done on this document and for her good cooperation, and, in particular, for her willingness to be talked into contending not only for the priorities of 'old Europe' but also for the openings and opportunities afforded by the new."
"Let me repeat what I said earlier: now is the time for us to make use of these opportunities!"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the neglect of internal waterways in the EU has been going on for many years to a positively criminal degree."
"NAIADES is a means whereby we want to change that."
"We want internal waterways to make headway in terms of job creation, on the markets, in terms of infrastructure and the fleet as a whole."
"These depend, above all else, on the reliability of internal waterways and on the availability of multi-functional inland ports, not least with regard to multimodal transport links, and I would, in this regard, like to do as Commissioner Barrot has already done and highlight the importance of RIS as an important contribution to the use of inland waterways, and would argue that its potential ought to be used to the full by its being incorporated into the TEN programme."
"Back to NAIADES, though."
"The report on the subject highlights the need for tighter emission limit values to be laid down across the Community, particularly by promoting the use of low-sulphur fuels."
"So far, so good, but I see it as counterproductive if more stringent emission limit values were to oblige the internal waterways sector, most of the operators in which are, of course, small and medium-sized enterprises, to pay out a great deal of money that they cannot afford for refits, and so we have to work towards incentives, provided not only by the Commission but also by the Member States, for a more rapid introduction of environmentally-friendly engines on ships."
"It strikes me as important that the planned European Waterway Transport Innovation Fund be established subject to conditions agreed on with the inland waterways businesses themselves, and that the Fund should be able to help with the funding of communications offices."
"Further to the Commission's initiative for the production of information source on financial issues, in the shape, for example, of a funding handbook, what is also needed is a European development plan containing an up-to-date inventory and more detailed information on European waterways, which must draw on existing expert studies and reports, as well as on the experiences gained by the coordinators."
"It would, after all, be wrong to keep on reinventing the wheel, and, since, additional bureaucracy is undesirable in the implementation of the action plans, we have to take particular care that it is avoided."
"I will conclude by thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for her dedication and for her cooperation, which really has been good and constructive."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by echoing what was said in this excellent debate and by thanking all of the speakers."
"Inland navigation is not, as you said, an added extra."
"It is a genuine option, and we need modes of transport other than roads in today's Europe."
"I am therefore fully determined, just as determined as your rapporteur and yourselves."
"Nevertheless, you are right: we cannot just make declarations; we need to act."
"I am therefore going to provide you with a few answers."
"Let us begin by focusing on the innovation fund: the Commission services, together with representatives of the profession and the Member States, are currently looking into the possibility of creating a fund for innovation in the field of inland waterway transport."
"This fund would be an important instrument for implementing the NAIADES programme."
"We are examining different options, such as how this fund can be sustained by the inland navigation sector, the Union and the Member States."
"The Commission will draft a report on the state of play and on the results of the assessments in 2007."
"You did in fact place great emphasis on this innovation fund, Mrs Wortmann-Kool."
"On the issue of pollution from ships, it is true, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that we must think about reducing the level of sulphur in the fuel used for inland navigation purposes, but we must not go too far."
"The idea is to bring this level of sulphur down to the level of the diesel fuel used in road transport."
"This reduction in the sulphur level is key to reducing air pollution."
"We are carrying out a review of the directives on air pollution with the aim of substantially reducing this sulphur level."
"However, I have taken full note of what you said about the investments required to that end."
"Mrs Lichtenberger, you asked me about the monitoring of dangerous transport."
"On this point, I should like to make it clear to you that a proposal is currently the subject of an interservice consultation and is due to be adopted before the end of the year."
"As a general rule, the improvement of infrastructure, Mr Meijer, will be accompanied by impact studies, in order to reduce as far as possible any harmful effects of infrastructure works."
"Generally speaking, I would say to all of the speakers that infrastructure obviously requires investment."
"This investment is the responsibility of the Member States."
"Nevertheless, it is true - and I am addressing you, in particular, Mrs Ayala - that we have proposed in the financial regulation to prioritise inland waterway transport by providing for a 30% cap."
"May I call for Parliament's help, Mr President, in adopting this financial regulation?"
"I am well aware that there is some reluctance on the part of the Member States, but I am sure that Parliament will give priority to the inland waterways."
"There are undoubtedly other solutions to propose, but my aim with these few answers was to tell you that my intention was obviously to act."
"As you pointed out, we, in Europe, have several magnificent waterways, such as the Danube, and I have taken note of your comments about the need to involve all those who live along the Danube."
"I must say that we are aware, Mr Rack, of the importance of these waterways and of the major role that they can play in the future."
"That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say to you, in the hope that we can carry out this crucial work together and accord Europe's waterways the full importance they deserve."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Public-private partnerships (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Weiler, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on public-private partnerships and Community law on public procurement and concessions."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the representatives of the other groups - Mrs Cederschiöld, Mr Lambsdorff, Mrs Rühle - and also to the representatives of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had a hand in the production of this report, for we were able to exchange views in a constructive and fair way, and managed, in any case, to achieve agreement on over 140 amendments in committee, so that there remain only 23 to be considered today or tomorrow, although it has to be said that compromises had to be reached in respect of them too."
"We have tried to strike a balance between two powerful opposing parties - the business associations and the local government associations - which put forward their no doubt legitimate interests in a forceful manner."
"What I have to say at the beginning of my speech I wish to address to them."
"What I want to say to the businessmen is that, despite all that we have heard, I want to make it clear that we in this House take it as self-evident that local authorities should engage in economic activity, and, indeed, that returning certain activities to them is reasonable and legitimate."
"What I would like to say to the local authorities is that invitations to tender, whether at the national or European level, do not absolutely have to be arbitrary, but offer the transparency that is needed to benefit the public and prevent corruption."
"I get the impression from the debate that their respective associations did not always see it that way."
"I have attempted, by means of my report, to strike a balance that would secure more guaranteed competition for the private sector and would give the public sector, in the shape of the local authorities, more scope for inter-municipal cooperation."
"Tomorrow, then, we will be deciding where this House stands as regards future mandates for action by the Commission, which - or so my group believes - should, wherever possible, be in the form of legislation."
"What this is about is the legal and political aspects of the way in which our municipalities organise services of general public interest."
"That they do, of course, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which we here in this House also take very seriously; after all, many Members of this House have strong links with local authorities, having been active in municipal politics before they came here."
"We are also, though, asked how we, as the convinced Europeans that we are, would shape the internal market, and there is a plethora of rulings from the European Court of Justice and from other courts at the national level."
"Complaints and Commission proceedings make municipalities and investors nervous about making investments at home and initiating projects, and so it is necessary for the European Union to take action."
"What, for example, is the substance of European procurement law?"
"What clarifications or additions need to be made to the institutionalised PPPs and in-house transactions?"
"We see ourselves as having the vitally important function of considering how to proceed."
"My group takes the view that legislation is needed, that it is not enough for the Commission, attempting as it does so to bypass this House, to act by handing down interpretive communications or other instruments of that kind."
"I therefore once more appeal today to the Members of this House, when they vote by roll-call tomorrow, to cast a vote for this House's right to govern its own affairs."
"We want neither a great laborious enterprise, nor an opening-up of the last procurement directive, which was not transposed in all the Member States - it was not, for example, in Germany - but what we want to see is clarifications and additions, and they must not be made without reference to Parliament."
"I will be quite frank in saying that we have no solution to the problem of inter-communal cooperation, which was - as you will see from the amendments - the most controversial area."
"The line we take is that it cannot, as a general rule, be excluded from the scope of procurement law, but nor should it be subject to general tender."
"What that means is that we need an intelligent solution to this bone of contention, for intercommunal cooperation makes sense for the communities from which we come, and will certainly be useful to them in the future."
"That this House is supportive of this instrument is shown not least by our willingness to use money from the Structural Funds for it;"
"I am sure that it is not common knowledge just how much effort we have put into getting that."
"Given our sympathy for European local authorities and the expertise of my fellow-Members on the Committees for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am convinced that we will end up with a law that everyone can support and accept, and one that will be proof against rulings from the European Court of Justice."
"Mr President, Mrs Weiler, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been put in place in several areas of the public sector and these partnerships are gradually developing within the European Union."
"At a time when public budgets are limited, there can be no doubt as to their importance for the European economy."
"This is particularly true in the area of infrastructure, and especially in that of transport infrastructure, with which I am very familiar."
"In order to guarantee that these partnerships are totally effective and that public money is spent better, it is important to choose private partners on the basis of fair competition."
"Thus, the choice of private partner must be the result of a competitive and non-discriminatory procedure and must enable the partners to get all of the added value out of such a partnership in the long term."
"However, many interested parties believe that the regulatory framework that governs which private partners are selected to create these partnerships at Community level is incomplete or unclear."
"Mrs Weiler's report presents a balanced assessment of the main challenges that we must take up."
"You have provided some good answers to the problems presented, Mrs Weiler, and I should like to thank you for your work as rapporteur."
"Allow me to mention what are, in our opinion, two crucial aspects, which I should like to cover before tomorrow's vote."
"I shall begin by talking about concessions and then about mixed public-private companies, which are referred to as 'institutionalised PPPs'."
"Firstly, concessions: a concession gives a company the right to use facilities that have been built or services that have been provided in return for building infrastructure or providing a service."
"The construction and maintenance of roads and airports and waste management are two such examples."
"In November 2005 - a year ago - the Commission outlined in its communication the reasons why it thinks it useful to legislate on concessions, particularly on service concessions."
"The aim of this initiative is to guarantee equal treatment and legal certainty in relation to the granting of service concessions - as is the case for public contracts - while making a clear distinction between public contracts and concessions."
"In this regard, I am sure that Parliament will confirm the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"It remains very clear, however, that the choice of the legislative path should not deprive the public authorities of the room for manoeuvre that they need in order to choose the best private partner and, if necessary, to adjust the concession over time, in line with the objectives targeted by the partnership for the long-term future of the PPP."
"Having said that, a step by step approach is called for."
"To begin with, the Commission will look more closely at the costs and benefits of a binding initiative on the granting of concessions and will examine other measures that will enable us to deal with the problems at stake."
"On the basis of the results of this impact study, the Commission will then - most probably next year - decide whether the cost-benefit ratio warrants such a legislative initiative."
"If it does, then we will prepare a legislative proposal."
"That is what I wanted to say about concessions."
"We now come to mixed capital companies, namely institutionalised PPPs."
"Public bodies are increasingly choosing private partners for public service companies set up in conjunction with the public sector."
"This is what we call institutionalised public-private partnerships."
"This type of partnership raises some specific questions: should the Community non-discrimination principles be applied to the choice of private partner, as the service provider's fellow shareholder, to the choice of service provider, or indeed to both these levels?"
"This question has given rise to some lively debates in Parliament."
"The main issue is actually whether we should create a new set of rules or whether we should simply make the existing legislation clearer so that we can deal with the problems that arise."
"The Commission has expressed a preference: for the time being, it does not want to draft new legislation on the matter, and this is for two reasons."
"Firstly, in most of the Member States, the creation of public-private entities for the purposes of providing services of general economic interest is an altogether new and very innovative opportunity."
"Non-binding clarifications in this area would enable us to provide the necessary guidelines, without stifling innovation."
"Secondly, in 2004, after several years of intense debates, Parliament, the 15 Member States at that time and the Commission reached a compromise and adopted the current directives on public contracts."
"Many Member States only implemented these directives this year, and some are working towards implementing them."
"In order to legislate on mixed public-private partnerships, we need to review the 2004 compromise, renegotiate a new text with 27 - and no longer 15 - Member States and, in the event that a new compromise is reached, once again force the Member States to amend their national laws and their practices in relation to public contracts, even though the current rules are not yet well established."
"That is why we think that it is better, at this stage, to choose a non-legislative path, just as most of the interested parties are requesting."
"That is the point that I wanted to make on behalf of my colleague, Mr McCreevy, but you would be right in thinking that the Commissioner for Transport is also very much affected by these provisions."
"I am now going to listen carefully to the various speeches made by the MEPs."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, much as I would like one quarter of the Commissioner's speaking time to explain the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the unfortunate fact is that I am not going to get it, but I am very grateful for the clear explanations that have been given today, particularly to the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, who has done something that is not customary in this House by accepting essential points from the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in the course of the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"We all agree on the line we take, although we do have our differences about such things as paragraph 5, which Mrs Weiler has reinserted by way of Amendment 20."
"In the event of a legislative declaration, we will handle it by way of the codecision procedure, as provided for by Article 251."
"This was a typical case for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in which we found the exact wording only after a vote during which we had sought out a compromise."
"We should do things the other way round, and then there will be no differences after the vote either."
"In accordance with the position that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted, I would opt for Mrs Weiler's Amendment 21, and my personal view is that we should incorporate this amendment, which envisages the possibility of these criteria being incorporated into Community law, and is therefore preferable to Amendment 20."
"I believe that we would be doing the right thing by sticking to our line according to which there would be no new areas excluded from the tendering procedure, with the alternative route of supra-regional communal undertakings being cut off, and no extension being permitted to in-house businesses."
"We would, however, like the Commission to clarify the issues thrown up by the ruling in the case of the City of Halle, among other rulings from the ECJ."
"What we want, then, Commissioner, is not only a proposal for concessions, but also clarification of the outstanding legal issues relating to institutionalised public-private partnerships."
"You, Commissioner, have told us where you stand."
"That was clear - laudably so by the standards of a Commission that has again and again avoided taking a decision in recent years - and so we will find an agreed solution that will enable us to move on."
"As I finish, I would like once more to thank Mrs Weiler for having done everything she could to achieve an across-the-board position, one that will enable us not only to withstand the rulings of the ECJ, but also to stand firm in the vigorous debates with the associations representing various interests."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the majority of the experiences of public-private partnerships in Europe concerns the construction and management of infrastructure and transport and logistics services."
"In addition, public-private partnerships are perhaps the only way that private investment can be involved in creating this infrastructure."
"For this reason I would like to raise just two points."
"Firstly, as stated in the report, we need a legislative initiative on concessions, including concessions for construction and management."
"There is a real need for legal certainty and for defining relations between public concessionary authorities and private concessionaires."
"On the one hand, private concessionaires need to have the guarantee that contracts will be respected for as long as they are in force, and, on the other hand, the concessionary authorities must be able to rely on having fixed- or limited-term contracts, which can then be adapted to production conditions over time and put to the test of competition."
"These are the two pivotal points on which I hope that the proposed legislation in question will be based."
"Secondly, there is a need to encourage new forms of innovative financial engineering, such as the guarantee funds already provided for by the regulation on the funding of trans-European transport networks, so that they can be used as leverage and ensure that many more public-private partnerships also prove to be efficient and effective funding instruments for infrastructure which we all need and with which I am sure you are very familiar, Commissioner."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PL) Mr President, we are always complaining about the Member States' refusal to countenance even the slightest increase in their contribution to the Community's budget, and we are always saying that there is not enough money available to even out the regional differences in development and that Europe is developing too slowly."
"We ought, therefore, to support the use of private money and know-how to promote development, instead of creating obstacles and difficulties."
"The European Union should give absolute priority to the widespread dissemination of good practice in the area of public-private partnerships."
"That is the bare minimum."
"At the very least, the Union should invest in an Internet site, in the 20 official Community languages, which would be accessible to the general public."
"Such a site would contain a description of the PPP system and its effects."
"It would also provide examples of model PPP projects, enabling every municipality in Europe to have easy access to accounts of successful experiences."
"This would allow municipalities to learn from the past and to make use of that knowledge as they plan their own way forward."
"I call on the European Commission to request such publicly accessible information from the European Investment Bank."
"The EIB is currently preparing a purely internal, intergovernmental information system on PPPs that would not be accessible to the public in the Member States."
"This is unacceptable."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, we are concerned here with a response to the Commission Green Paper on public-private partnerships, designed to investigate points that remain unclear, especially in what is known as the in-house area."
"We are, however, all agreed that, as the Commissioner so wisely said, there is no need to tear up existing legislation on public procurement."
"Public-private cooperation must favour competition and, above all, contribute to new thinking and increased efficiency within the public sector."
"The Commission must now solve the problem - that being the aim - without legislating more than is necessary."
"We do not, however, have closed minds on this point and, just as Mr Langen said, we thus support Amendment 21 by Mrs Weiler."
"We have made a request for legislation on concessions, and the Commission has responded positively and quickly to this."
"We are agreed about respecting the threshold values and about the need for normal legal principles to apply beneath those values where public procurement is not a requirement."
"We do not wish to reduce the scope for public procurement. Moreover, we unambiguously call on the Commission to propose solutions to the problems that exist in Germany, France and other countries when it comes to cooperation between local authorities, but not to forget less wealthy local authorities that wish to cooperate in sparsely populated areas in Member States such as Finland and Sweden."
"If the Commission were not to carry out this task, it could no doubt expect heavy pressure to be placed on it by Parliament."
"I am convinced that the Commission will do an excellent job of fulfilling this task, and we wish to give it time to consider our views on the Green Paper and to come up with proposals."
"All the parties concerned should be involved in the continued process."
"The committee can certainly be of help in increasing the level of knowledge in this difficult area."
"Paragraphs 45 to 47 already guarantee more legal certainty and show that local authorities can cooperate."
"In the future, we shall also have a clearer and more detailed view of how things are to work."
"In conclusion, I wish sincerely to say a big thank you to Mrs Weiler for the splendid work she has done, as well as to the great many other people who have been involved."
"Thank you very much."
"We are obtaining a more competitive Europe with greater legal certainty."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, allow me first of all to thank all of my fellow Members, and in particular Mrs Weiler and Mr Langen, with whom we have done an outstanding piece of work."
"Let us hope that the text will be adopted tomorrow."
"It is quite simply a question of protecting the exercise of subsidiarity for PPPs, instruments that are very familiar to our local authorities, and have been for a great many years."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission plans to legislate on concessions, which have been mixed up for too long with public contracts."
"However, I shall state in this Chamber that I believe that legislation is also required for institutional public-private partnerships."
"It is wrong to say that these are recent entities: semi-public companies have been around since 1955 in France and the Stadtwerke have been around for a very long time in Germany."
"The fact is that subjecting them to two forms of competition today means putting an end to them."
"What private partner would agree to work with a local authority that makes it compete twice over?"
"Furthermore, I would draw the Commissioner's attention to the risk run by inter-communal structures, which are in danger of being mixed up with private structures even though they are an entirely public means of organisation for local authorities that aspire to be large enough to be able to fulfil increasingly demanding obligations and public-service missions."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is of crucial importance in terms of budget and competition policy - on that we all agree."
"Competitive tendering is a fit and proper way of determining the most economic way of providing public services, and, over and above that, mandatory Europe-wide tendering does something essential in terms of opening up the internal market to competition."
"As rapporteur, Mrs Weiler has done a fine job of steering us, together, through the public procurement dossier - which is a difficult one - in an exemplary way."
"It is thanks to her that we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have already managed to come up with plenty of workable compromises, so it is only right that we should take this opportunity to express our gratitude and particular appreciation to her, and both I and the other Members involved are certainly willing to do that."
"I have advised my group to hold fast to what has emerged from this vote, and wish only to say something about the few contentious points."
"In so doing, let me start with institutionalised public/private partnerships, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, the development of which should not be unduly restricted by legal regulation, and it became clear from the public consultation that people do not want it to be."
"I therefore recommend that we go no further than an interpretative communication and guidelines that are comprehensible not only by lawyers but also by those who take decisions at the municipal level, which will not only afford greater flexibility than does legislation, but also - and above all - hold out the prospect of a rapid resolution to the legal uncertainties that are very definitely still there."
"This is where the Commission needs to act as promptly as possible."
"Moving on to inter-municipal cooperation, the second contentious point, I believe it to be self-evident that the municipalities should not in any way be hampered in their management of their own affairs, but equally self-evident, too, that this cannot mean that public/private partnerships should be generally exempted from the obligation to put work out to tender."
"Although public authorities are not obliged to hand over to third parties the performance of functions for which a market exists, should they decide to entrust third parties with the performance of a service, they must be bound by a public tendering process, as is indeed clear from Article 295 of the European Communities Treaty, which requires neutrality in the application of internal market rules to public and private undertakings."
"That, by the same token, makes cooperation between municipalities possible in principle, albeit subject to the restrictions that are so well stated in what is now paragraph 45 of the Weiler report, namely when cooperation between municipalities is for the purpose of administrative restructuring or where real in-house monitoring is provided for."
"Perhaps I might be permitted to add something as I close, namely that people in Europe have had very varying experiences of public/private partnerships, and so I am certainly very glad to see that a start is to be made on an exchange of good practice, which will bring in its train more good examples of working PPPs."
"I might also add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur for her efforts, even though our group is rather less than satisfied with the final result that emerged from the committee, as a result of which I would like, this evening, to appeal to you all to rethink your position, even if only in part."
"It is intercommunal cooperation, in the shape of intercommunal undertakings, that we see as the most important point, and I would like once more to make it clear - not least in response to those who have already spoken - that they have nothing whatever to do with the devolution of functions to third parties, but have to do rather with the municipalities deciding to perform services for the community."
"It is lack of funds in public coffers and an ageing and numerically declining population - particularly in rural boroughs - not to mention greater critical awareness of the issues and the costs involved on the part of the public, that makes this form of cooperation the best for many local authorities in Europe, and often the only way available to them of modernising the services they provide."
"So it is, then, that administrative services, water supply and drainage, playschools, schools and many cultural amenities are operated jointly, sometimes, indeed, across borders, examples of which can be found in the pre-school projects run together by French and German communities."
"Europe should not be putting this sort of thing at risk, but rather enhancing it, so let me therefore commend to the House's support our Amendment 45, which is a compromise put together by Members from various groups, and which I hope will gain majority support tomorrow."
"My second point has to do with concessions."
"I dare say that I am more sceptical about public-private partnerships than are most of you, but I do, all the same, think it wrong to send out the message that public-private partnerships are being promoted and then demand that concessions be put out to tender in the same way as contracts, the performance of which was, of course, the basic rationale for the PPPs being set up in the first place."
"I do not believe it is merely fortuitous that Parliament and the Council did not explicitly include concessions for services in the directive on the award of contracts, and I hope we will come to agree that what we do not want here is a requirement that they be put out to tender in the same way as contracts."
"Services concessions are something different and need to be regulated in a different way."
"As for 'in-house', what the European legislator really should have done about this was to clarify the conditions."
"I do not regard a figure of 100% as sustainable."
"What is needed, I think, is threshold values, and high ones at that, which must then actually be complied with."
"It is, though, the legislators that should define them and not the ECJ."
"(SK) Even though there is no uniform definition of public-private partnership (PPP) that would apply throughout the Community, a large number of projects have been successfully implemented in the European Union's freight and passenger railway transport sectors, as well as in the area of public health and education."
"These successful projects provide sufficient justification for Parliament to take up the topic as well, and I welcome the Commission's communication on PPPs, which includes specific proposals drawn up on the basis of public consultation."
"At the same time I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on her well balanced report highlighting the need for legal certainty in this area."
"Under PPP arrangements, private enterprises transfer their know-how to the public sector."
"In my amendments, which have been incorporated into the report, I have therefore emphasised the need for establishing transparent mechanisms for private investors."
"Investors should be given guarantees that their legal and financial interests will be safeguarded for the life of a contract and also that the terms and conditions of public tenders will remain unchanged during their period of applicability."
"Due to lack of experience, the new Member States in particular are apprehensive of using PPPs."
"Information gathered from the implementation of successful projects will help them to avoid repeating errors and procedures that have in practice ended in failure."
"I am convinced that PPP projects will be able to attract the desired capital only if the interested parties within EU Member States are well informed and conform to the quality regulations and transparent rules of the Community."
"These regulations and rules will help them build up infrastructure, the development of which has lagged behind due to underfunding."
"This form of cooperation may also prove instrumental in helping bridge regional disparities and ensuring the sustainable development of Europe's poorer regions."
"(DE) Mr President, I regard institutionalised public/private partnerships as a very important tool."
"The legal uncertainty resulting from the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the case of the city of Halle shows just how necessary it is that legislators should do something about them, and it is surely not acceptable that the Commission should act without reference to anyone else in giving guidance as to the manner in which this problem should be addressed."
"On the contrary, it is for the co-legislators, namely the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission together, to reach a joint decision as to how we in Europe are to deal with these issues."
"The second point I would like to address briefly is inter-municipal cooperation, and this is where I have to disagree with Mr Lambsdorff, for it has been going on for a very long time; there is a very long tradition of it, not least in the Federal Republic of Germany, and it is something we should maintain."
"Cross-border inter-municipal cooperation is at present a delicate shoot, and one that we must not destroy by declaring that these things should be left to the free market."
"If they are, we can pack it all in on the spot, for we will have no further need of municipalities, and that is surely not the sort of Europe that we want to see."
"(NL) Mr President, I was particularly involved in this report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where Mr Langen was rapporteur, and I would congratulate both rapporteurs on the final result, although it is true that a certain amount is left to be desired."
"There is, as I see it, a clear correlation with the discussion we had about the services of general economic interest, on which we took a decision in the previous plenary part-session."
"In both cases, it was about the way in which decentralised authorities, service providers and citizens can be given more legal certainty, which can sometimes create conflict between the internal market rules, on the one hand, and the general interest which authorities need to serve on behalf of their citizens, on the other."
"It is often the case that the Court of Justice has to be called upon or that the Commission gives interpretations of its own."
"The important message in both those files has been that we, via the codecision procedure, really want to take political decisions in this area, and that it is also important that we ask the Commission, and really insist on this, to present legislative initiatives on which we can decide in codecision with this House and with the Member States and their parliaments."
"That is the principal message I should once again like to take to the Commission in connection with this report."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of public-private partnerships has for some time been part of the new boundaries of welfare state systems within the European Union."
"Its significance should be seen from a new perspective, through the interconnections with all the initiatives on which our services rely."
"The common objective, which has been reaffirmed many times, including today, is to create a complete and clear legal framework within which local public authorities can make their own choices, aware of opportunities and constraints, principles to be respected and possible areas of freedom and innovation."
"In the text on which we are voting, overlapping is apparent with the current regulations in the field of contracts, concessions and joint enterprises, and with the European Court of Justice guidelines."
"However, the added value lies in the cross-cutting focus on the various ways in which alliances between the public and private sectors are built in the extremely sensitive field of services involving citizenship rights."
"Two firm principles are needed."
"Cut-backs on spending cannot come before or relax the requirements of service quality and safeguards for the rights of service providers."
"The search for efficiency and innovation must be tied to guarantees of accessibility, transparency and non-discrimination."
"This year has seen many initiatives in the field of services."
"The hope is that, working on elements of various scales, we will be able to build a coherent scheme."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Weiler's report provides the clarity and transparency that we needed in relation to public-private partnerships, and thus allows us to change the wayward paths taken by the European courts and to improve the legal clarification for all of the actors concerned."
"Concessions are all too often mixed up with public contracts: the latter concern the purchase of goods consumed by local authorities, while concessions offer public authorities the opportunity to delegate the completion of part of their tasks to a third party."
"Therefore, we should have a law on these concessions and not a mere interpretative communication."
"The same is true of institutionalised PPPs."
"Their creation is currently being threatened by the rigours of case-law, which tends towards having two calls for competition when allocating work, something that is likely to seal the fate of semi-public companies."
"I am therefore grateful to our rapporteur for having requested a legislative initiative on this subject."
"Finally, in the Commission versus Spain judgment, the inter-communal structure has become a private partner for the Court of Justice."
"Authorities should therefore make inter-communal structures to which they delegate the provision of services compete with each other."
"Mrs Weiler is re-establishing the law and offering us the best parliamentary contribution on this subject, and for that I thank her."
"Mr President, I should like once again to thank Mrs Weiler, as well as the draftsmen of the opinion of various committees: Mr Langen, Mr Costa and Mrs Staniszewska."
"I am going to try to respond to some of the questions asked, without claiming to respond to them all."
"I shall first respond to Mrs Cederschiöld, to Mr Lambsdorff and to Mrs Rühle."
"When a local authority grants certain services to another public body in return for payment, these are in principle services that have been the subject of a public contract."
"The public body benefiting from the contract is competing with private companies and possibly with other public bodies offering the same service."
"A general exclusion of all forms of public-public cooperation from the scope of the Community rules on public contracts and of the rules on concessions would therefore be unacceptable."
"The Court of Justice case-law is very clear in this regard."
"Conversely, not all forms of public-public cooperation are covered by Community law."
"The Commission recognises that clarification is required in order to determine the extent to which Community law applies to the delegation of tasks to public bodies and which forms of cooperation remain outside the scope of the provisions on the internal market."
"We are working closely with all the parties concerned in order to provide this clarification."
"Next, I shall respond to Mrs Rühle and to Mrs Gebhardt on the issue of public-private partnerships and on the 'in-house' concept. The 'in-house' concept excludes the application of the rules governing public contracts when a public body grants a contract or a concession to a third party over which it exercises some control."
"The Court has outlined the circumstances in which this derogation may be applied."
"You will understand that the Commission wants this exception to the rules on granting contracts to continue being monitored."
"In particular, it seems extremely doubtful that a public contract or a concession would be granted in a discriminatory way to a company that represents certain private interests, while other private companies concerned are pushed aside."
"That is why we think it necessary at this stage to keep to the current definition of the conditions for application of the 'in-house' system: where authorities exercise the same control over the service provider as they do over their own services, and where service providers carry out the bulk of their activities with the authority concerned."
"For these reasons and also so as not to have to start from scratch with the new public contract rules, which are scarcely at the transposition stage in the Member States, we think it appropriate to legislate on mixed public-private companies and on the 'in-house' concept."
"An interpretative communication is the most suitable means of explaining the way in which the rules regulating public contracts apply to the selection of private partners for these partnerships."
"In response to Mr Savary, who raised the question about the two calls for competition, I would say that we are aware of this problem and, as you pointed out, I referred to this in my speech."
"I should like to make myself very clear: we do not require two calls for competition simply because we believe that that is unnecessary."
"We explained this in the 2004 Green Paper on PPPs and we plan to clarify our position in the texts that we are due to present in 2007."
"Mr President, I am well aware that I have not responded to all of the questions asked, but I should like now to conclude."
"On the subject of concessions and of a possible legislative initiative, it is important not to rush things."
"To begin with, the Commission must look more closely at the costs and benefits of a binding initiative on the granting of concessions, and at other measures suitable for dealing with the problems at stake."
"On the basis of the results of this impact study, the Commission will then - most probably next year - decide whether the cost-benefit ratio warrants such a legislative initiative and will, if necessary, prepare a legislative proposal."
"Furthermore, the message from all those who work in the area of PPP start-ups is clear: they are calling for practical guidelines on the way in which to apply the rules on public contracts to the creation of these partnerships."
"The Commission intends to provide these guidelines in non-legislative form for the reasons that I indicated in my introduction."
"There can be no doubt as to the importance of PPPs for the European economy."
"I hope that Parliament's report will help clarify the Community rules on public contracts and concessions so as to offer partners transparent and fair conditions of competition."
"It has become quite clear to us, in this debate, that Parliament's emphasis was on legal certainty, but you, for your part, will have also understood the Commission's preoccupation, in an area as vital as this for European investment, with retaining some room for manoeuvre, such as to enable it, while guaranteeing legal certainty, to invest more money where it is really needed."
"Moreover, several of you rightly stressed that these are absolutely vital tools."
"Mr President, those are the answers that I wanted to give, and I thank Parliament once again for the quality of this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"Posting of workers (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Elisabeth Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the application of Directive 96/71/EC on the posting of workers."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Services Directive is one of the most important directives in terms of the freedom to provide services, making possible, on the one hand, fair competition among service-providing enterprises right across Europe, while also, on the other, containing unambiguous rules for the protection of the posted workers, and also setting down minimum standards applicable to all, while nevertheless providing sufficient flexibility to enable these standards to be enforced by the various national systems."
"At its heart is the principle of the same minimum wage or the same minimum conditions for the same work in the same place, which enables it to establish fair competition conditions for businesses on the ground."
"If, though, the Posting of Workers Directive is to be successfully transposed, it demands committed effort by all - on every side and at every level."
"I would like, at this juncture, to thank those Members who worked with me on this report for their dedication, and, above all, for their inexhaustible patience with the negotiating process, as well as the staff of the committee's secretariat, in the Tabling Office, of the groups and Members' private offices, for their dedication and the innumerable extra hours they were required to work."
"This report is a joint effort."
"It enjoys support right across the groups, and the reason why that is so is that all concerned have met others halfway and arrived at compromises for the sake of the matter in hand."
"It is out of its commitment to the Posting of Workers Directive that this House repudiates the Commission's attempts at guidelines limiting the Member States' opportunities to exercise control, for the Member States have the particular function of ensuring, by means of their control measures, that the minimum working conditions for the posted workers are actually complied with, and they must be able to continue to do so in future, and without exceptions being made."
"Our criticisms of the guidelines will come as no surprise to the Commission, for it is using them for no other purpose than to reintroduce through the back door the substance of Articles 24 and 25 of its original draft of the services directive, which this House had, by a large majority, deleted, and to that deletion the Council consented, for neither employers' nor employees' associations, neither governments nor members of parliament, want the freedom to provide services at the price of workers' fundamental rights."
"The reverse is true: there is a broad alliance of people who are convinced that this European Union of ours can succeed in combining the two, and that doing so will bring into being what we call the social Europe."
"Our expectation of the Commission is that it should take seriously February's unambiguous vote on this report as a guide to how it should proceed."
"That also means that we expect it to take into account this House's views when evaluating the questionnaires that it sent yesterday to the Member States."
"It is unacceptable that the Commission should make demands of the Member States with the ultimate object of jeopardising compliance with minimum labour standards."
"I might also add that the ECJ has made it clear that requirements needed in order to secure minimum labour conditions do not run counter to the freedom to provide services, and that, precisely, is what is made clear in this report."
"So it is, for example, that it has been demonstrated in practice that, contrary to the Commission's interpretation, wages documents can also be needed in addition to certificates of time worked in order to secure workers' right to their minimum wage, and the consequence of that is that, in future, legal counsel will be indispensable as parties in the wages negotiations described in Article 3(8) of the Posting of Workers Directive, or as representatives to make such negotiations possible by being available for the effective delivery of official documents."
"If the directive is to be implemented, then action will need to be taken to clarify matters in advance and to provide information on compliance with minimum employment standards."
"It is with that in mind that I hope that the commitment of so many to this report will pay off and that the Commission will now, without any reservations, allow 'the same pay for the same work in the same place' to be established securely throughout the European Union."
"Member of the Commission."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the Posted Workers Directive is to reconcile the right of firms to provide cross-border services with the rights of workers who are on temporary postings."
"The objective is to ensure that basic freedom of movement is upheld for both workers and services, and that the social legislation aimed at protecting employees is complied with."
"Ten years on from the adoption of this directive difficulties remain in applying it."
"First and foremost, workers and employees are insufficiently informed about their rights and obligations."
"A further problem is the lack of administrative cooperation between countries of origin and host countries, which in turn could be viewed as something of a lack of mutual trust."
"Lastly, the inspection measures imposed by some Member States have led to fears of protectionism."
"The authorities in the host countries have been granted some right of inspection, although this too has its limits."
"These inspections must be carried out appropriately, without discrimination, and without obstructing the freedom to provide services within the framework of the internal market."
"In clarifying this point, the Commission deemed it appropriate to adopt the main principles on 4 April."
"National bodies must provide posted workers and service providers with effective ways of obtaining information on the work conditions applying in the host country."
"They must also work together in a fair way."
"In this regard, the Commission feels it must remind the Member States of their obligations, and calls on them to implement more effective resources."
"I am aware that the debate in Parliament on the posting of workers has been a complex one, and that a wide range of opinions has been expressed."
"This demonstrates the difficulty of striking a balance between safeguarding the protection of workers on the one hand and the freedom to provide services on the other."
"I am pleased that in the report on which Parliament has voted, I found many points of convergence with the position expressed by the Commission in its 4 April communication."
"There are a number of points, however, to which I should like to pay special attention and on which a clear position should be adopted."
"I cannot agree with the view that the Commission will try to include deleted Articles 24 and 25 of the original services directive by means of its communication."
"That is not the case here."
"In its communication, the Commission interprets the law in question, but does not introduce new laws, because communications from the Commission cannot do such a thing, not even formally, as this is a matter of legislative process."
"This assertion does not correspond to the reality of the Commission's interpretation."
"I wish to stress again that in its communication the Commission is not establishing a new law on which to base these articles, but is interpreting current law, which includes significant rulings of the Court in Luxembourg."
"The rulings of the court referred to in the Commission communication prohibit the national bodies from requiring that service providers posted in other Member States have an office or a representative in their country."
"According to case law, a Member State that is hosting foreign service providers may, in order to comply with the principle of solidarity, stipulate that there must be documentation available at the workplace relating directly to the work concerned, and especially work reports or documents relating to health, safety and work protection in the workplace."
"In its interpretation, the Commission in no way restricts the Member States' capacity to carry out effective inspections, and none of the aforementioned articles have that intention."
"It is my view that the Commission tried very hard in its interpretation to find and understand the true substance and spirit of individual court rulings."
"The Commission attaches great importance to the proper implementation of the directive and has broadened its scope beyond this implementation."
"It has already started work on a report assessing the situation a year after publishing its guidelines."
"To this end the Commission has sent a questionnaire out to the national bodies and the social partners."
"It has also created a website dealing with legal and practical issues relating to the posting of workers, on which it recently created a forum where every European citizen can offer suggestions and comments."
"Moreover, under the aegis of the Commission, a group of national experts has developed principles of best practice, establishing a number of rules in the area of administrative cooperation and a single form enabling us to simplify the exchange of information between contact points."
"The Commission takes account, of course, of all of Parliament's opinions and the report before us is an important document for the Commission."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for her report."
"I am sorry to have to say, however, that unfortunately the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs did not take account of what I believe were the main findings which were voted through in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"In addition to this, in Group B, we had no opportunity to exchange information on important issues or to discuss them."
"In her report, the rapporteur included many worrying and often contradictory elements."
"Today, I shall focus on the most significant problems."
"They are not new problems, and had already been widely discussed during work on the Services Directive."
"Regrettably, it was decided that the solutions to these problems would not be contained in the Directive, only in the Commission's Guidance on the Posting of Workers."
"I believe these guidelines are useful, because they deal with the problems thousands of entrepreneurs encounter daily as they post their workers."
"One of these problems is the requirement imposed by the host country to set up legal representation, instead of simply posting a worker who could act as the employer's representative."
"This requirement has far-reaching implications, because setting up legal representation falls under the principle of freedom to establish an enterprise, and not that of freedom to provide services."
"In addition, it represents a considerable financial outlay for employers."
"The fact that the host country requires the provision of various quantities of documents is also a problem."
"In practice, entrepreneurs complain that the host country's authorities abuse this requirement, insisting on documents that are not relevant to the work undertaken."
"The requirement pertaining to the supply of information declarations on the posting of workers represents yet another problem."
"Some countries insist on receiving this information many months before the start of the posting period, and it is often the case that these declarations are treated as authorisations."
"Such practices are very burdensome for the service providers."
"The final important issue I should like to draw attention to, and which is often highlighted by entrepreneurs, is the very strict control of Polish enterprises ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, allow me first of all to thank Mrs Schroedter for the extensive and excellent work she has done in drafting this report, and especially for her efforts to secure the broadest possible consensus on a text that is important for a variety of reasons."
"She has also pointed out the useful work done by a large majority of Members of this Parliament during the debate and the vote on the Draft Services Directive."
"It was useful because, in voting in favour of crucial amendments guaranteeing absolute respect for the competences and subjects covered by the Posted Workers Directive, Parliament safeguarded the vital role that this directive must play at a time when we, in the Union of 25, are witnessing and are going to witness a large increase in the provision of services, as well as a rise in worker mobility."
"The text also safeguarded - and I believe that this was the unanimous opinion of the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - our powers over the subjects that are rightfully ours."
"A directive that has been understood properly, applied properly and that has properly controlled effects should ensure that the right balance is struck between fair competition and guaranteed respect for workers' rights."
"The ground rules must be strict and fair regarding this issue."
"They must also guarantee transparency and security for workers, in terms of both service provision and freedom of movement."
"For a directive to be understood properly there needs to be a major effort in terms of providing explanations and information and of simplifying administrative matters."
"A directive that has been applied properly must clearly ensure that the right to free movement and the principles of equal treatment are respected and must pursue objectives relating to the harmonisation of working conditions and of social systems."
"A directive with properly controlled effects is a major tool in the fight against the anti-European feelings that may be stirred up by the presence in the population of workers who are treated as mere commodities moved about at will and exploited under the most abject conditions."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank our rapporteur for all the work she has done and for her willingness to listen."
"I can tell you at this stage that my group considers this to be a balanced report."
"Commissioner, with this report, my group would, above all, like to encourage you to take action to get the Posting of Workers Directive complied with on the ground."
"We do not ask you to review the directive, because the legislation itself is fairly sound, but we all know that in practice, employees who temporarily work in other countries are often brutally exploited, and we think that this exploitation should stop."
"That is why the different Member States' inspectorates should collaborate more."
"We would, accordingly, ask the Commission to form them into a well-organised network."
"The passing on of information about rights and duties to employees and to companies, Commissioner, should also improve, and our group is delighted with your pledge to develop a well-documented website, launch uniform forms and exchange good working practices."
"I should also like to raise the subject of the guidelines that the Commission has launched in response to this House successfully preventing the Services Directive from eroding the Posting of Workers Directive."
"I should like to urge the Commissioner not to create any confusion between, on the one hand, attempts to simplify administration, which receives our wholehearted support, and, on the other hand, question demands that are necessary for monitoring and control; that is why we maintain, Commissioner, that Member States must retain the right to demand that representatives be appointed by the firms in question, but also to place demands in connection with documents and registration systems."
"We must join forces in order to call a halt to bureaucracy and exploitation."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) A spirit of protectionism and economic nationalism is becoming entrenched in certain countries of the Community."
"This hinders international trade and the free movement of capital and labour."
"Protectionists have a negative attitude not only towards competition from Asia but also towards any source of foreign competition."
"This is a short-sighted attitude."
"We all know that competition is an engine of economic progress, whereas exclusion leads to economic and social decline."
"Putting artificial bureaucratic obstacles in the way of implementation and application of the Posting of Workers Directive is one of the manifestations of protectionism."
"This situation harms not only our own interests, but also those of the entire Community and infringes its citizens' fundamental rights; first and foremost, the freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment."
"These rights are embodied in the EC Treaty and in the Posting of Workers Directive, but are being ignored by the Member States."
"Such behaviour undermines our Community."
"I will be voting for the elimination of bureaucratic obstacles so that national borders do not hinder business development in the Community and people are free to choose where they wish to work."
"They must also be sure of not being exploited or discriminated against when working abroad."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) It is well known that many workers from EU Member States, such as Portugal, continue to suffer discrimination when they go to work in other countries that are also EU Member States, but where people earn higher salaries."
"According to the directive on the posting of workers, the host country is solely responsible for ensuring the protection and the rights of posted workers."
"To this end, the country concerned is required to adopt measures to prevent minimum standards from being circumvented."
"This gives rise to genuine discrimination affecting all workers, both the posted workers and those from the host country."
"Reality has shown us that this directive is ignored on many sides, despite countless complaints, either by Parliament, or in reports of specific cases, such as we have issued on a number of occasions."
"There are still examples of non-compliance that need to be resolved, and we accordingly do not accept the Commission's proposal to restrict in certain important areas the minimum requirements imposed by the Member States on businesses, which followed on from the proposed directive on the creation of an internal market for services."
"Consequently, whilst we support the report, we must express our disappointment at the pressure exerted, and the proposals put forward, by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, following their attempts to block clarification of important aspects of the implementation of the directive."
"They tabled various amendments, for example, aimed at removing points in the report before us, with the attempts at removing Amendment 13 and parts of Amendments 26 and 29 from the report being of particular concern."
"As far as we are concerned, we want the rapporteur's work to stand and would urge the Chamber to adopt a number of other proposals aimed at enforcing the directive."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, when the feeble compromise on the Services Directive was reached, it was obvious that it had been achieved at the expense of the new Member States of the European Union, whose main competitive advantage on the Union market is precisely in the services sector."
"This compromise sounded the death-knell for all hope of equal opportunities on the common market as outlined in the initial draft of the Directive."
"The European Commission's Guidance on the Posting of Workers was one element of the deal that might have inspired some hope in the new countries."
"In presenting today's report to us, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is aiming to completely do away with even that small and non-binding opportunity."
"With this report, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is aiming to preserve the complete status quo concerning the services market, even though protectionism and plain chauvinism are rampant throughout that market."
"According to the European Trade Union Confederation, for example, the benefit of this chauvinism, is that it is worker-related and has been established under the aegis of the unions."
"Personally, I doubt it has anything at all to do with the genuine good of working people."
"Essentially, strict administrative and social requirements only serve to deprive people of jobs."
"That was what happened in the Vaxholm case and also in the case of the Polish company Zojax."
"Both companies were forced to withdraw from the implementation of projects, and this resulted in losses and redundancies."
"Swedish trade unionists were very complacent, however, because those made redundant were foreign workers, namely Latvians and Poles."
"I would remind Swedish trade unionists, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, that the said foreigners are citizens and companies entitled to their full rights, who had been promised equal rights within the common market when accession took place."
"It is true that the requirements laid down in Article 3 of the Directive are minimal, but does the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs not feel that it is high time to set upper limits for such requirements, both for cases of requirements based on law and for those based on collective agreements?"
"Does the committee not feel that these requirements are usually mere smokescreens for plain and simple protectionism?"
"The requirement to register, to set up legal representation in the host country and to make social documentation available in situ are all used by the authorities as a pretext for making things difficult."
"They all serve one single purpose, namely to protect the national market against bricklayers, bakers, wood polishers, and many other kinds of workers who are now, quite rightly, feeling let down."
"Their expectations concerning equal rights within the Union's market are being shattered by harsh reality."
"Adopting the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as it stands will send out a clear signal to the Member States, namely that they take whatever action they like on the common services market."
"It will also amount to going back on the delicate compromise reached on the Services Directive."
"That is why I am appealing for support for the amendments tabled by a group of Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, because the report does not deserve our support without these amendments."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, when people work on short-term contracts in countries other than their own, there are obvious advantages for all sides."
"So I am all in favour of posted workers - but not this way."
"The report says in paragraph 19 that this will not be achieved by huge bureaucracy, but some 35 out of 49 paragraphs include references to laws, rules, infringement procedures, ECJ cases, enforcement by penalties."
"If this proposal is anything to go by, I am not surprised that the Enterprise Commissioner is behind schedule in his drive to simplify EU laws!"
"For yet again we have a proposal carrying a raft of rules and regulations, backed up with so many references to penalties and infringement procedures that the rapporteur must be at her wits' end trying to make a proposal which is easy to operate, fair to all, but effective."
"When this was debated a while ago in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Members were horrified to hear cases of blatant exploitation of posted workers."
"This must be stopped, but what were the Member States doing?"
"What were the trade unions doing?"
"After all, it is highly likely that local workers were also being abused."
"Were posted workers employed because local workers refused to accept the conditions on offer?"
"The key lies in recital L on page 5 of the report, which talks about preventing the circumvention of national standards."
"Since national standards are emphasised this way, why do we need an EU directive at all?"
"Why is it not left to Member States, if it is their rules that control the situation?"
"An EU directive will be a burden on all sides and produce delays, when all we want is people in work."
"After all, this is not a new situation."
"Posted workers did not come about because of the EU."
"They existed before there was an EU."
"My own brother, English like myself, was an engineering draughtsman."
"He became self-employed, took up a contract with Volkswagen and worked in Germany for several years."
"He had no problems at all, but that was before the UK joined the then EC."
"So I repeat, we do not need this directive."
"Member States are perfectly capable of managing their affairs within the existing regulations of the European Union - in short, subsidiarity."
"Do you remember that?"
"(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who contributed to this report."
"The posting of workers is one of the important issues that the EU must resolve if it is to meet its target of completing the internal market with the free movement of persons and the freedom to provide services on a cross-border basis."
"I feel honoured to take the floor in front of hundreds of my fellow MEPs at this significant time."
"The Commission communication is aimed at liberalising the provision of services and the posting of workers, and removing the unnecessary restrictions and protectionism prevalent in some Member States."
"Mrs Schroedter's report, however, takes the opposite approach."
"The rapporteur places undue emphasis on protecting workers and in turn establishes protectionist measures that work against the freedom to post workers."
"The current practice places workers from the new Member States at a distinct disadvantage."
"Businesses from the old Member States are permitted to provide services anywhere in the EU market, as well as in their country of origin."
"Businesses from the new Member States, on the other hand, are not allowed such access or are subject to time restrictions and a series of administrative barriers and protectionist measures that in reality prevent their posted workers from being competitive and from providing services freely on the market under the same conditions as workers from the host country."
"In this Chamber we still hear fears expressed about the Polish plumber and all he symbolises."
"Mrs Schroedter's report rides roughshod over the fundamental values on which the EU was founded, and in no way leads to the achievement of our shared aim, which is to complete the single internal market."
"I should therefore like to call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote against this report."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her very constructive work."
"As many others have said, this is an important directive not only for freedom of movement but also for the protection of workers."
"There are quite a number of deficiencies - we know this from the surveys - when it comes to information, cooperation between Member States and the ability to carry out checks."
"Allow me to state that we are in favour not of protectionism but of open borders."
"We are in favour of competition on equal terms between companies, but we are also in favour of the equal treatment of workers."
"That is what we are concerned with here - equal treatment."
"Some of the Members who referred to the Vaxholm case have left now."
"That precise case was about the need for Latvian workers not to be treated worse than Swedish workers."
"They were to enjoy precisely the same treatment - not worse, but precisely the same, treatment."
"One issue on which there has been disagreement between ourselves and the Commission is that of the importance of having a representative."
"You propose that it would be enough to have a link with someone in the other country with whom to negotiate."
"That would be incredibly bureaucratic and enormously difficult."
"A representative must be able to act as a channel of communication in those countries that take care of the negotiations, so it would be necessary to have someone with a negotiating mandate."
"He or she would also have to be able to communicate with, for example, authorities responsible for occupational health and safety."
"Anything else would be quite impossible."
"There is no case law that contradicts what I am saying."
"The Arblade case was about something else."
"It was about documents that had to be kept for five years under Belgian law and is therefore irrelevant to what the Commission is saying."
"I nonetheless hope that we shall get this Posting of Workers Directive operating successfully in society. In that case, it will, however, have to include the parts to which I have referred."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"Because of time constraints, I shall concentrate on the Irish experience only, but it is certainly relevant to this debate."
"The Commissioner stated that Ireland has not adopted specific transposition measures and was not conforming to the criteria established by the case law of the Court of Justice."
"So, apart from all the other difficulties highlighted by the rapporteur - and I do not have time to list them - it seems that we in Ireland do not have the legal certainty to comprehensively enforce this directive."
"Recent events in Ireland have shown how much we need full implementation of this directive: with GAMA, a Turkish construction company, ripping off some of its foreign workers; the Irish ferry scandal, where existing workers were simply replaced by mainly foreign workers on half the wages and with inferior working conditions - I might add that this is one of the reasons I support a directive on ferries; and today in Ireland the mushroom industry admitting that some of its members are paying half the minimum wage to their foreign workers."
"My final point is that it is not just posted workers who suffer: it is all workers, including Irish workers, who will pay a price down the line, as minimum wages will be undercut and suspicion and distrust will replace solidarity between workers."
"The Commissioner said earlier that it is difficult to protect workers while ensuring free movement of services; but, regardless of how difficult it is, we must do so."
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, will begin by expressing my appreciation for the work the rapporteur has done."
"The Posting of Workers Directive was a cause of constant controversy in the past, and has remained one to this day."
"The country from which I come was not the only one to be unwilling to extend the directive's scope to cover the economy as a whole, and, in Germany, it still applies only in the building industry and to occupations associated with it."
"I would like to steer the debate on this report towards three aspects of it. One is the emphasis that the rapporteur puts on the need for the social partners to be strengthened if the standards laid down in wage agreements are not to be undermined."
"That should not, however, be taken to mean that these agreements, reached between the Member States and the two sides of industry, actually do guarantee living wages."
"There needs to be examination of the degree to which minimum standards actually do meet the need for 'decent work' in the individual Member States."
"Mrs Schroedter, with some justification, also points out that it is difficult to distinguish between the employed and the self-employed, but, necessary though it is to define them and clarify the status of those who are termed the 'putative self-employed', we should not forget that we are talking here about the people who are most on the margins and earn less than anyone else, that they must be accorded a status that secures them rights, including the right to a fair and living wage."
"The use of the relevant directives to enforce the freedom to provide services is always justified by reference to - among others - the argument that, at the end of the day, there has to be something in it for the consumer."
"At first sight, the Posting of Workers Directive would appear to have little to do with the protection of consumers, but I am sure that just how much the two are connected will become clear when we gain a sense of perspective, for the consumer's interest is no longer only in the quality of the goods themselves, and that is why, today, consumers are protected against imported goods produced using child labour."
"The exchange of goods and services is meant to have a social dimension to it, and those who participate in it must be entitled to minimum standards that guarantee them a living, appropriate working conditions and the protection of their livelihood."
"(DE) Mr President, in February, this House, together with the Council and the Commission, arrived at a compromise on the Services Directive, Articles 24 and 25 of which were thereby deleted on the grounds that they provided for only superficial scrutiny of the delegating firms and their workers."
"We were thereby able to ensure the more effective combating not only of illicit labour but also of wage dumping."
"Over the past few months, the Commission has sustained losses, and now it is trying to use the Posting of Workers Directive as a back door through which to resubmit the rejected positions, in certain cases - by way of guidelines on which we are allowed to do no more than state an opinion - going beyond what the ECJ has stipulated, and it is doing so by means of guidelines on which we can do no more than give an opinion."
"That is deceitful and amounts to robbing the people's representatives of their powers."
"Guidelines will no doubt be drawn on by the ECJ when arriving at judgments, and they will thereby be made binding in law."
"The German Federal Government, our political parties, social partners, employers' and workers' associations, will not tolerate the planned restrictions on our posting of workers legislation, and other European countries have similar misgivings."
"In Poland, for example, there are hardly any Poles to be found on building sites, but instead loads of manpower from non-EU states."
"Necessary though it is that mobility within the European internal market should be permitted, it is above all necessary that justice and fairness should prevail, and that is what effective controls make possible."
"Every host country must be entitled to demand documents and check employment conditions - such things as income, working time, rest periods, safety and health protection."
"Those who claim that fewer forms and documents are needed, and that bureaucracy is to be avoided, do not in fact want there to be any controls and are making illegality possible; it must also be possible to serve notices on those who have broken the law, and so the posting enterprises must be represented by persons who are fully authorised under the law of the host country."
"I welcome Mrs Schroedter's report; she has included my proposed amendments in compromises."
"On one point, though, I do not agree with her, and that is with regard to the definition of 'workers' which is adapted in such a way that the economically dependent self-employed are categorised as fictitiously self-employed."
"I hope this position will gain majority support tomorrow."
"(NL) Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I have discussed this dossier with Mrs Handzlik in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - she, unfortunately, is no longer taking an active part in the debate."
"What I should like to underline is that we very much considered the problems mentioned by her and by many group colleagues which the new Member States are facing and that we obviously recognise that unnecessary bureaucratic barriers to the free movement of services and the free movement of employees should be removed."
"I also have sufficient experience, however, of what is happening within the labour market legally, illegally or partly-legally to know that people are indeed exploited and that it is the scope for posting workers across the border that is used to circumvent the rules."
"That is why I should like to spell out once again that we must not throw out the baby with the bathwater, but that we must strike a good balance instead;"
"I should once again like to impress on Mr Clark, who is apparently oblivious to how these rules work, that there is such a thing as the principle of subsidiarity, that it is the rules of the working country that apply in labour law, that Member States have complete autonomy in this and that this Posting of Workers Directive is only intended as an exception to this rule in order to cover the situations where employees are posted across the border and are allowed to work under their own conditions temporarily, provided there are a number of minimum protective provisions in place."
"It is precisely because of the control procedures in this respect, and because they are so complex, that rules are needed in order to create scope for monitoring, better scope for labour inspectorates to collaborate, which means that this balance is needed."
"Also in the framework of the Services Directive, I should like to underline once again that there is no hierarchy of rules for this labour legislation, that Member States are autonomous in this respect and that this is not overruled by the rules for the free movement of services."
"(PL) Mr President, the possibility of posting workers is intrinsically linked to the fundamental freedoms of the European Union."
"The most important of these are the free movement of people, services and capital."
"The Posting of Workers Directive is therefore a logical consequence of the functioning of the European Union's internal market."
"There is no doubt that the state of the Union's economy is measured in terms of the state of its enterprises, particularly its small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The 1996 Directive was mainly intended for SMEs, and aimed to simplify the principles allowing them to compete and carry out their economic activity outside their country of origin."
"Internal competition is essential if the Union is to cope successfully with competition at global level, where it faces competition from the economies of the United States, China and Japan."
"I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for venturing to tackle an issue of such importance for the future of Europe."
"I have studied her report carefully."
"Unfortunately, I am bound to say that I fear the document is not quite in line with my vision of freedom to provide services on the internal market, which is so dear to my heart."
"Having read Mrs Schroedter's draft report, I have come to suspect that its de facto aim is to make it difficult for companies to post workers in order to undertake a specific task and, accordingly, it sets out to sanction the protectionist practices Member State governments put in place to protect themselves from the effects of competition."
"I should like to state clearly that I am referring to the positive effects of competition."
"At the same time, I support the efforts by the European Commission, and the Commissioner's own personal efforts, aimed at ensuring better implementation of the Directive in practice."
"I hope that there is no reason to change it, or replace it with a new legal act."
"I trust Commissioner Špidla is of the same opinion."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for a very good report."
"We need an effective directive to protect workers posted temporarily to an EU state."
"This is essential to prevent a race to the bottom."
"However, we have a directive that is full of legal black holes and is not applied at all in some states."
"Despite the best efforts of Commissioner Špidla, I do not believe that guidelines will solve these failings."
"Many of our states are resisting the necessary legislative changes."
"The consequences are scandals of the kind already mentioned, such as the Irish ferries debacle."
"While ships' crews are excluded from the posting of workers directive, the Irish Government also resists the implementation of a ferries directive, which would protect those workers."
"We urgently need a legal framework to effectively prevent a race to the bottom, unfair competition and, indeed, the ugly emergence of xenophobia."
"We need clarity and certainty on definitions of workers and an end to false self-employment."
"We need the right to apply clearly established higher minimum standards, sufficient inspectors to ensure compliance and enforceable penalties for failure to comply with EU legislation."
"I believe, also, that we need protection for whistle-blowers, for those who reveal the abuses that take place under the existing regime."
"I should like to remind those who would criticise the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and myself over this issue that I represent a state that opened its borders to all ten new Member States, fully and freely."
"We have now been forced to close our borders to Bulgaria and Romania because of the abuse of migrant workers and the consequent effect upon Irish-based workers."
"This is not an easy question to resolve and it is certainly not an attempt to create protectionism in the 15 'old' Member States."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, the dynamic nature of the internal market has offered increased mobility for workers and has helped European businesses to develop their activities beyond national borders."
"The ability of businesses to post some of their workers to other EU Member States for the purpose of temporary work has made a further contribution to this increased mobility."
"The experience until now, however, has left much to be desired."
"In the case of Portugal, the posting of workers has not gone well, especially in the building industry."
"A number of cases have come to light of Portuguese workers being exploited in Spain, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands."
"This has happened because there is a yawning chasm between the 1999 directive, which strikes a balance between the freedom to provide services and the guarantee of the labour rights of posted workers, and the implementation of that directive on the ground."
"In addition to the fact that Member States have differed in their interpretations of the directive, there have also been differences in its practical implementation, and this has led to more barriers and more bureaucracy, and has slowed down the process."
"It is abundantly clear that there is no monitoring of the implementation of this directive."
"Subcontracting is a terrible example of situations that are very common but are not covered by the directive."
"This has led to an unacceptable watering down of responsibilities, which always - I repeat, always - works to the detriment of the posted workers."
"I support Mrs Schroedter's report because I believe it is up to the host Member State, in close cooperation with the authorities of the country of origin, to ensure that the employment conditions laid down in the directive are rigorously complied with, for the purposes of increasing the effectiveness of monitoring and of combating illegal practices."
"What is needed, therefore is greater transparency and more information on the rights and obligations to be complied with when businesses become involved in the posting of workers."
"I also endorse Mrs Schroedter's report because it has become necessary to adopt corrections in order to ensure that this directive is supported, monitored and carried out better and more systematically."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must acknowledge the fact that a European labour market does genuinely exist, especially in the field of services which, more than any other field, involves the posting of workers."
"We are in favour of this, but not under just any circumstances and not at the risk of social dumping."
"Human labour is not a commodity and cannot be subjected to the rules of free competition."
"We voiced this concern during the debate on the 'Services' Directive, and - as you pointed out - Parliament rejected Articles 24 and 25 of this directive, which deal precisely with the easing of the conditions on the posting of workers."
"The fact is that it is unacceptable for the Commission to undermine this position and to ignore the criticisms voiced by Parliament."
"The Directive on the posting of workers has been poorly applied in the Member States and is not meeting its objectives."
"That may be the case, but should the legislation be relaxed as a consequence or, on the contrary, should more be done to encourage the Member States to apply it?"
"I do not believe that the obligations for declarations and effective controls and the retention of documents lead to pointless red tape when what is at stake is the protection of the social rights of posted or local workers."
"A lax attitude on the matter only benefits fraudsters."
"Furthermore, enhanced restrictions and the very threat of financial penalties should act as a deterrent."
"That is why I endorse this report and urgently call on the Commission and the Member States to overcome the difficulties in applying the directive, which we do not want to have amended at this stage."
"(HU) Several people have pointed out that the Posting of Workers Directive and the Services Directive are closely interconnected."
"Therefore, I regret that we will not deal with both together in November, although that would have been logical and sensible."
"As for our standpoint, there is an important philosophical difference between the approach expressed by socialist and Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fellow Members."
"We put the focus on strengthening and speeding up the economy, because without accelerating development we cannot create new jobs and we cannot secure long-term financing for the major social welfare systems or safeguard European social values."
"It will be impossible to make progress towards trying to balance work and family life or towards improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Consequently, we will not have adequate resources to deal on a European level with the massive downsizing caused by company relocations."
"The question, then, is whether we want to hamper or strengthen the performance of the economy."
"In the course of the debate on the Posting of Workers Directive, it seemed to me that we want to hamper it, which is not a good sign for the future."
"To mention only the most striking problem, the requirement concerning company representatives runs completely counter to the free provision of services."
"In practice, this represents a serious competitive disadvantage."
"It would require setting up a local framework, which is an expensive, pointless and impractical exercise."
"This is why I would like to bring to your attention the fact that we consider Amendment 7 to be crucial."
"Should it not be accepted, we will not support adoption of the directive."
"Please, take that into consideration when voting."
"(DE) Mr President, I wish the Posting of Workers Directive were no longer needed, and I am sure that the Commissioner is thinking along similar lines."
"Nor am I sure that this law actually can adequately protect workers from exploitation, but there is no other means available to us - or none that is adequate - to prevent problems on the European labour market."
"What is clear is that the most important features of the Posting of Workers Directive function only to a limited extent - I am talking here not only about the imposition of administrative penalties across borders, but also about the cooperation between authorities."
"Moreover, the failure to take account of bonuses as an often essential component of wages leads to more wage dumping."
"No doubt the minimum requirement for the Posting of Workers Directive to function will be the availability of a person who can act as the representative of the delegating enterprise and ensure that the directive is applied."
"Member of the Commission."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief indeed, because it is already five past midnight and I feel we must adhere very strictly to regulations such as the working time directive, and others in force in the EU."
"Very briefly, then."
"One key question, raised twice in this debate, is that in its communication the Commission tried to reintroduce Articles 24 and 25, which had been removed from the services directive."
"I wish to point out that this is a mistaken view, because Articles 24 and 25 are based on the country of origin principle, which is the principle that the country of origin is responsible for inspections."
"This is not in the communication because the communication is duly based on the current legal situation, according to which the responsibility for inspection lies with the countries to which workers are posted, that is to say, the countries hosting the workers."
"I should also like to say that I have noticed in the debate that we agree on the idea that the directive is capable of working at any given time, but it is vital that we step up efforts to ensure its consistent application."
"The main problem at present is that it is being applied inconsistently, especially in cross-border cooperation between individual Member States."
"The Commission has taken steps in its communication to address this issue - and I feel that it is our duty to do this as thoroughly and as quickly as possible."
"I do not wish to issue an opinion on individual cases that have been cited by way of criticism of the directive or the Commission, not because this is impossible but rather because I respect the working time of the interpreters."
"I should like to make a final general remark."
"In its communication, the Commission firstly interpreted the court ruling in Luxembourg, and it did so correctly."
"Then on the basis of its obligations as Guardian of the Treaties it formulated a position on a series of issues."
"Thirdly it proposed, and continues to propose, steps that must be taken to improve the implementation of this directive."
"I should now like to make one last remark."
"It is a basic principle of due process under the rule of law that any law - in this case the directive - can be used only for the purpose for which it was drawn up."
"The purpose of this directive is to protect posted workers, not to restrict the freedom to provide services."
"Consequently, in terms of this general structure and from the standpoint of proportionality, the communication does not restrict the Member States' ability to carry out their own inspections; nor does it restrict their ability to perform their duties."
"The fundamental rule of proportionality naturally applies, whereby the obligations laid down must be appropriate to the objective, and cases must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, as in fact the communication indicates."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the attention given to this issue by Parliament."
"I am convinced that this is one of the most important directives concerning the EU labour market."
"It is our duty to interpret it correctly and accurately and to put it into practice as quickly and effectively as possible."
"I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for her report, because it undoubtedly marks a step forward in the process I mentioned earlier, namely the full implementation of the directive in such a way that it can meet its objective."
"Honourable Members, thank you very much."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"Tonight we are debating the report on the application of a directive relating to posting of workers, as we are aware the posting of workers directive refers firstly to the guarantee of the free movement of persons and services, secondly, that posted employees enjoy terms and conditions related to minimum rates of pay, working conditions, health and safety of the host Member states."
"The main problem of the directive is its enforcement."
"One of the main obstacles is the need to adjust the definition of 'employees' so that a clear distinction is made with the status of 'self employed persons' for the purpose of national employment law."
"Another difficulty is that this directive has not been transposed by all the Member States, nor is it enforced in practice in a number of Member States."
"Also it is apparent that such workers do not even know their rights and therefore the aim of the directive is not being achieved."
"I have come across numerous Maltese who were working in other Member States and who have no idea of their rights under this directive."
"So as to make the directive meaningful, we must not be ambiguous."

"European Central Bank Annual Report (2005) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Berès on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the 2005 Annual Report of the European Bank."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen, the annual report of the European Central Bank always offers an opportunity for the European Parliament to review monetary policy and to supplement the work carried out by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs through the monetary dialogue conducted four times a year with the President of the European Central Bank."
"You will all remember that last year we rejected the report, as it did not correspond to the guidelines advocated by this Parliament."
"The year 2005 was an unusual year, in which the Central Bank initiated a movement raising interest rates five times, the first of which was on 1 December."
"These successive rises took place in an unusual economic context, determined by both the rise in oil prices and a disadvantageous exchange rate for euro zone exports, and in the context of an upturn in economic growth considered by more acute observers as fragile."
"In these circumstances, this report specifically invites the Central Bank to analyse carefully the conditions in which it conducts its monetary policy."
"I am pleased that this report also emphasises that euro-dollar parity is important to growth in the European Union and that it draws from this a number of conclusions, which have been drafted in a spirit of compromise, bearing in mind the need for each monetary authority to exercise in full its responsibilities in terms of exchange rates."
"I hope that this compromise will still be present at the time of the vote."
"I should like to express my regret, nonetheless, that it was not possible in this report to include both the subject of household debt and the improvement needed in the coordination of economic policies."
"Allow me, Mr President, to mention a number of points on which I believe this report provides original and valuable insights."
"Consider, for example, the invitation made to the Central Bank to examine closely the use of EUR 500 notes and the possibility of freezing the issue of these notes."
"Let us come now to the key issue for this Parliament, namely the conditions in which democratic control is exercised and the way in which the Central Bank operates as an institution."
"From this point of view, we wanted to make our contribution, before the next renewal of a member of the Executive Board, to the necessary debate that must take place among the institutions in order that the members of the Executive Board may represent the interests of the euro zone in the best way possible."
"We believe that, to this end, the best approach would be to apply to the ECB the arrangement seen on the executive boards of all other central banks, namely a variety of backgrounds and a balance of portfolios."
"We are in agreement within this Parliament on requesting that the balance between nations should not be enshrined as an eternal status quo, and we believe, moreover, that a variety of backgrounds should enable the contributions and plurality within the Executive Board to be enhanced."
"I also hope that this Parliament will advocate that the Council, when giving its opinion on approving a nomination to the Board, should exercise its decision-making power in full by making its choice on the basis of a number of different candidates."
"I am familiar with the argument used frequently by yourself, Mr President of the European Central Bank, and also used by Jean-Claude Trichet from time to time: having several candidates would damage the careers of those not accepted for the position."
"Allow me to say that, as observers of international nomination procedures, our assessment is entirely different."
"At international level, the only post that is filled without competition or without a variety of candidates - and I come from a party that, as you know, is currently experiencing this process and all its virtues - is the Presidency of the World Bank."
"This process does not apply in the case of the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or the World Trade Organisation."
"That is why we believe that, from this point of view, the euro zone as an integrated area should allow a number of different candidates."
"Obviously, we also request that the European Parliament should finally be given the power to approve the appointment of the members of the Executive Board, which, in my opinion, would only strengthen the Board's authority and legitimacy and ability to embody a strong voice for the euro zone, on the international stage also."
"This is the primary objective of this Parliament, namely that, on the international stage, the Central Bank, alongside the Council and the Eurogroup, should be the key legitimate spokesman that we need for Europe's voice to carry loud and clear on such important subjects as you have wanted to raise, Mr President, and on which this Parliament would like to make a contribution."
"I am of course thinking of the question of the alternative funds, on which, I hope, the compromise drawn up by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be supported by all the groups at the time of the vote."
"European Central Bank."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and a great pleasure to speak to you today."
"I am here to present to the European Parliament the 2005 annual report of the European Central Bank."
"However, as you know, relations between Parliament and the European Central Bank go beyond the specific obligations imposed by the Treaty."
"In fact, as Mrs Berès has just said, we have over the years established a very close dialogue, which, I should like to emphasise, has been enhanced once again this year."
"Honourable Members, it is therefore the third time that I have spoken before you this month."
"Furthermore, my colleagues on the board of the ECB have been in close contact with the European Parliament regarding various issues such as reform of the International Monetary Fund, payment systems and clearing and settlement systems."
"For our part, we attach great importance to the contacts on these issues."
"(DE) I would like to start by giving you a brief overview of the economic and monetary policy developments of 2005 and by outlining the European Central Bank's monetary policy measures."
"I would then like to make some comments with regard to points and proposals that you have raised in your draft resolution on the ECB's annual report for 2005."
"Mr President, Let me first of all welcome the assessment of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee as regards the ECB's monetary policy in 2005 and beyond."
"As recognised in the draft report, the ECB's monetary policy - which is designed to fulfil our primary objective of maintaining price stability - has continued to be successful in anchoring inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability, despite a number of challenges mentioned by Mrs Berès, relating in particular to the continued strong surge in oil prices until the most recent period."
"As already emphasised on several occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area, fully in line with Article 105 of the EC Treaty."
"In this respect, let me emphasise that the ECB's open and transparent communication is a key element in guiding market expectations."
"In particular, my introductory statement at the press conference after the first Governing Council meeting each month provides a clear view, on the part of the Governing Council, on the current monetary policy stance in real time."
"Hence, we make the outcome of our deliberations public."
"As such, the introductory statement is comparable with what other central banks call 'summary minutes'."
"In 2005, the ECB's monetary policy operated in an environment of increasingly improving economic conditions."
"While real GDP growth remained moderate in the first half of the year, in an environment of heightened uncertainties surrounding domestic demand, the pace of economic activity gradually strengthened during the second half of the year, from around 1.2% year-on-year on average in the first half of 2005 to around 1.7% year-on-year on average in the second half."
"Overall, real GDP in the euro area grew by 1.4%."
"As regards price developments, annual HICP inflation averaged 2.2% in 2005, compared to 2.1% in each of the two preceding years."
"While annual HICP inflation eased to 2.0% in the first half of 2005, mainly reflecting base effects, HICP inflation rates accelerated to levels significantly above 2% in the second half, reaching a peak of 2.6% in September, mainly on the back of substantial increases in energy prices."
"Thus, reviewing the ECB's monetary policy decisions in 2005 and early 2006, it is useful to split this period into two parts."
"In the first half of 2005, against the background of subdued inflation developments and with inflation expectations for the euro area solidly anchored at levels in line with price stability, the Governing Council concluded that it remained appropriate to keep interest rates at their historically low levels."
"At the same time, the Governing Council was constantly alert with regard to the materialisation of upside risks to price stability, as signalled by both the ECB's economic and monetary analyses."
"In the second half of 2005 and early 2006, the likelihood that average annual HICP inflation could remain above 2% over the medium term increased and a spill-over to inflation expectations had to be avoided."
"This scenario of elevated inflation rates remained subject to previously identified upside risks, notably further increases in oil prices and indirect taxes and, more particularly, potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting."
"It was also confirmed by the monetary analysis, given strong monetary growth, robust credit expansion and ample liquidity."
"As a consequence, by the end of 2005, the regular cross-checking of the ECB's economic and monetary analyses indicated that an adjustment of the very accommodative stance of the ECB's monetary policy was clearly warranted in order to contain upside risks to price stability and preserve the firm anchoring of long-term inflation expectations in the euro area."
"The Governing Council of the ECB therefore decided in December to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after two and a half years of maintaining these rates at historically low levels."
"Since then the Governing Council has continued to withdraw monetary accommodation, thereby establishing the minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem at 3.25% by now."
"Turning to recent developments, all the main indicators of economic activity in the euro area that have become available in the course of 2006 confirm the Governing Council's assessment that economic growth has gained momentum and, in addition, become more broadly-based and sustained, mainly supported by domestic demand."
"With regard to consumer prices, annual HICP inflation rates, notwithstanding their decline in most recent months, will remain elevated, at levels above 2% on average in 2006."
"As regards 2007, inflation risks remain on the upside."
"These risks include, in particular, a stronger than expected rise in wages on the back of improving labour markets and a stronger than expected pass-through of past oil price rises."
"The assessment of upside risks prevailing is confirmed when cross-checked with the monetary analysis, given the ongoing dynamism of monetary and credit growth, ample liquidity and, from a medium-term perspective, a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion."
"This has been noted in the Commission report."
"Monetary developments therefore require enhanced monitoring, in particular against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area."
"As I said publicly on behalf of the Governing Council after our last decision, if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will remain warranted."
"The Governing Council will therefore continue to monitor all developments very closely, so as to ensure price stability over the medium to longer term."
"As regards fiscal policy, budgetary developments in 2005 and 2006 and plans for 2007 point to further, albeit slow, improvements in budget balances."
"However, this should not give rise to complacency."
"It remains of the essence that budgetary consolidation is strengthened in the current upswing and that pro-cyclical policies are avoided, which would boost the confidence of both the markets and the public."
"As regards structural reforms, I welcome the view of the European Parliament that comprehensive structural reforms are needed to raise the potential growth rate of the euro area and underpin the momentum of the ongoing economic recovery."
"In this respect, the reform measures initiated in the context of the renewed Lisbon Strategy were a welcome additional step in the right direction."
"The successful implementation of national reforms aimed at removing rigidities and inefficiencies in euro area countries would improve the smooth functioning of EMU and facilitate the conduct of the ECB's single monetary policy."
"In your motion for a resolution you raise a large number of issues of relevance to the ECB and I would like to assure you that we will consider them with great care."
"I should like to share our assessment on two issues straight away, in view of their topical nature and the exchanges of views I and my fellow members of the Executive Board had with you on those points."
"In the motion for a resolution, the ECB is called upon to carry out further analysis in the area of hedge funds - a point you have underlined."
"Amid the increasing attention being paid to the activities of hedge funds, I think that it would be unfair not to mention their role as regards enhancing market liquidity, providing significant diversification opportunities for investors and fostering financial innovation."
"That being said, it is clear that there are potential risks for financial stability from their very rapidly growing presence in the financial system and it has yet to be tested whether they would amplify market volatility or pose greater counterparty risks in a less benign financial market environment."
"Against that background, the ECB will definitely follow up on your request for further analysis."
"It is possible that we will conclude that there is a real case for enhancing the current framework, which relies essentially on the vigilance of the financial institutions that are themselves under supervision as regards their counterparty risks on the hedge funds."
"But I also note that any such enhancement should be agreed upon at the level of the international community and, in particular, on the basis of an appropriate transatlantic discussion."
"As regards payment and settlement issues, let me first thank the European Parliament for the support expressed for the implementation by November 2007 of the TARGET2 system."
"Being an integrated large-value payment system, TARGET2 will provide for efficiency gains and improved liquidity management by banks."
"In this regard, I should like to refer to the increased pressure also to have an integrated platform for the settlement of securities transactions in euro."
"The Eurosystem is therefore currently examining, in coordination with the European Commission and in close cooperation with the market, the feasibility of setting up a Eurosystem infrastructure for the provision of securities settlement services in central bank money."
"A decision on whether to offer such a service, referred to as 'TARGET2-Securities', is expected early in 2007."
"In the field of retail payments, we strongly support the efforts to establish a Single Euro Payment Area - SEPA."
"We welcome the European Commission's initiative for a directive on payment services and I warmly welcome the European Parliament's contribution to a swift adoption of this directive to assist the banking industry in its implementation of SEPA payment instruments as from 1 January 2008."
"I thank you very much for your attention. I am now available to answer your questions."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, allow me to begin by saying that - as can be seen from the report - we generally endorse what the European Central Bank has done over the past year."
"It is particularly important that the independence of the ECB has been, and remains, secure."
"It has proven to be the case that the Bank's moderate interest rates policy has contributed to the invigoration of the economy, even though that same policy has very often been criticised in recent years."
"That being the case, we believe that it would be absolutely right to raise the current level of interest rates, which is very low in historical terms, a little, if the situation so requires it, in order to control inflationary trends."
"We also welcome the ECB's comments with regard to the necessary structural reforms in the Member States that it is constantly calling for."
"It is quite right to do this, as inflation would hit those on middle and lower incomes particularly hard."
"Higher inflation would make these people poorer. We are opposed to that."
"We also welcome the clear statement by the President of the ECB in relation to the development of European stock exchanges."
"It is imperative that we ensure that European stock exchanges are consolidated within Europe and are not simply taken over from abroad - from the US, for example."
"That is the only way that we can prevent the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act being implemented in Europe via the back door."
"We have sound and transparent market regulations in Europe that are suited to our European situation, and they should not be undermined."
"As regards the report, we have resolutely advocated that the ECB does not become politicised."
"We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are thus very clear in our rejection of the publication of ECB voting results."
"Doing so would lead to politicisation, because voting results would then be discussed."
"We are also opposed to a publicly debated nomination process, as qualified candidates would be discussed to death."
"We thus do not feel that we can support these two elements, as they would mean politicisation of the ECB."
"We would, on the other hand, like to point out that, if the ECB becomes a market operator in the areas of settlement and the clearing of payments and instalments within the framework of TARGET 2, it must also subject itself to appropriate corporate governance."
"Corporate governance of this nature still has to be developed."
"The independence of the ECB will then be ensured and that will result in a stable economic policy that will call for structural reforms in Europe."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I shall refrain from dwelling, on behalf of my group, on the first part of Mr Trichet's account or on what Mr Lauk stated a moment ago."
"Suffice for me to say that I welcome such a political dialogue - as Mr Lauk's viewpoint is also a political viewpoint obviously - with you on a regular basis."
"We have ourselves conducted such a dialogue only recently, and I think we should persevere with it."
"The report that is now before us reflects, in my view, just how mature this dialogue has become, touching, as it does, upon very serious subjects, including the link between monetary policy and macro-economic policy, which is of huge importance to our group."
"Allow me to single out two or three items which have been subject of discussion."
"First of all, I am delighted with what Mr Trichet had to say about hedge funds, his commitment to better analysis of them and to the adoption of a much more serious stance with respect to them."
"Whilst we stated this in very specific terms a few weeks ago during the dialogue, he was a little more hesitant back then."
"I am therefore pleased that this has now been spelled out much more clearly - I have referred to this in a different connection as the black hole of the financial markets - because that black hole is widening all the time and must be plugged very deliberately by monitoring financial markets, not least with stability in mind."
"The second point is the appointment of the members of the ECB's Executive Board."
"In the spring, we debated this very subject further to Mr Stark's appointment."
"We then said quite clearly, because we did not have anything against Mr Stark himself, who was well-qualified, but wanted to talk about the procedure, that we would not dwell on the appointment procedure and would come back to it in this report, which is what we are doing now."
"I regret that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats refuses to help improve - by making it more fully-developed - this appointment procedure, and also the role we in this House can play in this."
"I am pleased, though, that at least the Liberals and other groups are prepared to lend their support."
"I hope that we can make the necessary progress in time for the next appointment, which, as it happens, will not be until 2009/2010."
"This is very important, because it should not be the case that large countries have a qualified seat and that it is, in this case, only in the Federal Chancellery in Berlin that it is decided who is a good candidate."
"Finally, I should like to turn to the subject of Target II."
"We have clearly decided not to speak out on this, or on the code of conduct that is being prepared by the Commission for that matter, but to closely monitor your next move instead."
"What we would say at this stage is that if, and only if, the ECB and the euro system are to have an active decision-making role in this, this should involve sound monitoring and democratic decision-making; that much we agree on."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, this report does, in any event - and indeed, as has already been indicated - represent an opportunity to take another good look at not only the ECB's annual report but also at where we as Parliament stand in the debate on monetary policy."
"I have to say that this time round, as indeed in recent years, my group has taken a traditional line."
"First of all, our viewpoint on monetary policy is clear."
"The ECB's independence may not be affected, there should be no political pressure and we must prevent monetary policy in the euro zone from being politicised."
"We believe that there is a need for confidence in the European Central Bank to be restored."
"In September 2005, when the rate of inflation rose by 2.6%, the European Central Bank responded well by increasing the historically very low interest rate."
"Price stability is the ECB's Number One priority and that is how it should stay, as described in the Treaty."
"Having said this, we also take the view, and will do in future, that more transparency is possible."
"This is, in fact, what Mr Huhne said as long as six years ago, when he produced a report on this."
"I also value the ECB's efforts on this score, and the President's being present in this plenary is a very different matter - although the same people are involved - from his visits to us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs; this is also very much appreciated; and I also think that this has not been done before."
"Despite this, much of the ECB's decision-making is done in what appears to us to be dark backrooms."
"It is, of course, not the case that we want the whole of the European Parliament and the BBC to attend the meetings of the ECB's Executive Board, but we would like to know the arguments in favour or against any decisions taken and whether these were taken unanimously or not, so that the market can gain a better insight into monetary policy."
"Finally, we would ask that the procedure for appointing members of the ECB's Executive Board be reviewed."
"We think the current de facto division of ECB seats according to the size of Member States should be abandoned."
"This should not involve a major public debate, but choosing from various candidates really strikes us as being a better system."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since we are discussing the European Central Bank's report, allow me to address these few words to its president."
"Mr Trichet, you really are the reviver of a very poor system for all the peoples of Europe."
"As such, you have probably been - inadvertently, otherwise it would have been common knowledge - the best campaigner for the 'no' vote of the French and Dutch people on the European Constitutional Treaty, and we thank you for it."
"The principles on which the European Central Bank is founded are already in themselves an obstacle to growth in the euro zone, but when there is growth, in spite of your actions, it creates few or no jobs and only benefits the richest in society."
"The European Central Bank claims to have stopped inflation."
"In reality, the working and middle classes have seen their purchasing power plummet, while the rich have never been so rich."
"You champion the worst kind of capitalism, that of shareholders and the pauperisation of the middle and working classes."
"Day after day, your inertia faced with the weak dollar policy pursued by the United States destroys thousands of qualified industrial jobs creating added value in the euro zone."
"You represent the bank of discontent and mass unemployment."
"For all these reasons, we must break with a European Central Bank controlled by the financial markets and with no link to the will of the peoples of the Union."
"We urgently need a new treaty entrusting the European Central Bank with responsibilities in the field of employment, training and research, all under the strict control of our Parliament and the national parliaments."
"This new treaty must, imperatively, replace the financial stability pact with a social progress pact for employment and growth, reviving public spending throughout the Union on health, training, education, social housing, culture, transport and infrastructure."
"Through these decisions we will be able to restore the confidence of the European people."
"If this were not the case, the gap would continue to widen between our institutions and the various peoples."
"The differences in wealth between the peoples of the Union and between citizens of a single country would continue to increase. This would therefore encourage the rise of extremism and anti-European nationalism."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, here we are again telling the European Central Bank how to do its job!"
"Not only is this against the spirit of the Treaty, which states that the ECB is independent, it is also largely a waste of time, because, as always, the ECB will listen politely but, quite rightly, take little notice."
"Indeed, the ECB has enough trouble of its own, without listening to this Parliament, in finding an interest rate that suits 12 different economies, soon to be more."
"The one-size-fits-all problem does not go away."
"At the moment, the larger euro zone economies are enjoying slightly higher growth but, as Mr Trichet accepts, this is fragile."
"When it falters, his problem of choosing the right interest rate will become more critical."
"Effectively, the ECB will be forced into a choice between inflation in Germany or recession in southern Europe, with all the dire implications for government debts that this will entail."
"I wonder what advice this Parliament will be giving then."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, in this Chamber yesterday we were debating breast cancer, and no one appeared worried about the fight against inflation."
"That is to say that in situations of life and death our priorities change: we discover what is truly important."
"However, is the fight against inflation really the most important thing in economic life?"
"Beginning our resolution with a reference to the Father-like status of the independence of the Central Bank, followed by the Son-like status of price stability, in the hope that the Holy Spirit of prosperity will descend from the United States may be good for the independence of the Central Bank, but it is bad for the people."
"Personally, Mr Trichet, I fully appreciate that you are bound by monetary aggregates one, two and three and by the need for fine-tuning and for steering interest rates."
"Yet even in the country of Milton Friedman, Chile is left to practise a budgetary surplus of 1%, while the United States itself takes a budgetary overdose."
"I must therefore conclude by asking the real question: just because our German grandmother had inflationist diabetes in the 1920s, should that mean that, 80 years on, the whole of Europe should go on a sugar-free budgetary and monetary diet?"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the European Central Bank's position on currency stability."
"We should not succumb to the temptation to add to the ECB's responsibilities areas in which the nation states refuse to act, in other words the areas of economic and social reforms."
"The ECB cannot pay for such reforms alone, nor can it afford to."
"In this case it is essential that the nation states finally fulfil their obligations."
"We also support the independence of the European Central Bank, its political independence and the independence of its monetary policy, and all of this right from the selection procedure for its members."
"I do not know what the results of today's votes will be. I can only tell you that the European People's Party supports the idea of non-politicisation, starting with the selection procedure, and believes that the form of transparency proposed is not helpful."
"The European Central Bank has numerous other tools in its dialogue and does make use of them, just as other central banks around the world do."
"There is broad support for this in this House."
"On the subject of independence, I would like to add that we are fighting for the independence of monetary policy. I also hope, however, that the European Central Bank realises that it should not overplay the subject of independence."
"We have had an on-going discussing with the European Central Bank for years now on the subject of 'clearing and settlement', in particular with Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, and I would just like to remind the House that the European Central Bank has begun a dialogue with the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) on this subject and is now entering into a dialogue with those involved in the market."
"I would like to state clearly that we are not opposed to dialogue."
"Perhaps the route that the European Central Bank is proposing, and that it is taking, will be the right one in the end."
"For us, this is not about a material assessment, but the route by which the European Central Bank becomes a part of the market cannot be chosen unsupervised and in a vacuum cut off from politics."
"That is why we have been calling so urgently for this - and we hope that the vote today will proceed as we had all envisaged - we need governance, we need a regulatory framework for this area."
"We cannot have a situation where Parliament and the Commission are deliberating about whether to create a directive, whether to produce with a suitable framework, and the European Central Bank then comes out and claims that none of that affects it and that it will take the route it thinks is right."
"Do not overdo it here; where monetary policy is concerned, we are on your side."
"(FR) Mr President, since its creation, the European Central Bank has fulfilled its primary mission, namely the fight against inflation."
"Rates of inflation in the euro zone have thus remained below those in the United States and Great Britain."
"The public is mistaken in believing that the euro has made prices soar."
"Admittedly, there was an inflationist surge during the transition to the euro, mainly in the catering and retail sectors, where prices were rounded up a little too high."
"That said, since this surge of initial excitement, underlying inflation has in general remained under control."
"The price boom on the oil and gas markets represents an external shock over which the Union has very little control. However, because the euro has risen against the dollar, which remains the currency in which raw materials are listed, the shock has been less severe for the euro zone than for the Americans."
"The euro is in fact a shield that has protected the whole of Europe during events such as the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan or even 11 September 2001."
"Without the euro, many European currencies would have been under pressure and would have threatened the internal market with collapse."
"As Mr Zapatero pointed out, Spain would never have been able to withdraw its troops from Iraq if its currency had been the peseta instead of the euro."
"Although the euro has served Europe well, and although I congratulate the ECB on the work accomplished, I remain convinced that the ECB could do better."
"President Trichet and his colleagues attach too much importance to the fight against inflation, while inflationist risks remain very limited."
"On the other hand, the ECB refuses to lend its support to the Union's general economic policies and justifies its position by arguing that the Constitutional Treaty stipulates that maintaining price stability represents the only possible support for Europe's general economic policy."
"The ECB is independent and will remain so, even without Mr Radwan's support."
"This is another reason to be open to dialogue."
"Those who are independent, Mr President, can allow themselves to maintain a more active cooperation with the Eurogroup, for example with a view to achieving more sustained economic development for Europe."
"Growth and stability are the two feet moving Europe forward."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Trichet and his colleagues for their solid cooperation thus far."
"The ECB annual report is a very important document for this House. It forms the basis of the debate on fundamental monetary policy issues."
"Not for nothing has the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs taken personal responsibility as rapporteur for this issue."
"There is, however, always controversy when we debate appointments to the ECB and the primary task of the Bank. We have just experienced this once again."
"It is therefore no surprise that it was only through innumerable compromise proposals that it was possible to achieve something like a common view in the committee."
"Personally speaking, I find it regrettable that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament abstained from the final vote in committee, despite all these compromises."
"Their decision shows the difficulties the Socialist Group still has with a handful of points in the report."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supported the independence of the ECB without ifs and buts."
"The primary function of the Bank is, and remains, to ensure the stability of the euro."
"Thus far, it has performed this job admirably. We cannot go soft on independence or on price stability under any circumstances."
"There must thus continue to be an absence of political pressure in future, and the members of the Executive Board must be chosen purely on the basis of their expertise and not according to nationality."
"Mr President, yet again it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that the ECB continues to print large numbers of 500-euro notes, which are only useful to those who are hoarding ill-gotten gains or laundering money."
"Indeed, the volume of printing has recently even gone up."
"Yet the Sunday Times in London recently published an extensive article detailing much evidence about the use of these notes in Spain, Italy and Greece, directly for money-laundering purposes."
"The only possible conclusion we can reach is that the ECB is actively involved in aiding and abetting money laundering."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to express a favourable opinion of the activities of the European Central Bank in 2005."
"I would also like to categorically state that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament fully supports and respects the independence of the Central Bank."
"We believe that this independence is a sine qua non for conducting an appropriate monetary policy within the economic and monetary union."
"It also guarantees the value of our common currency."
"I would now like to highlight three issues that have long been debated in this House."
"Firstly, the relative importance of the two pillars of monetary policy adopted by the ECB remains unclear."
"I refer here to monetary supply as opposed to other information on future inflation."
"As a result, we do not know whether, or to what extent, developments in monetary supply constitute a decisive factor for the ECB when setting interest rates."
"Laying down clear rules in this matter would improve the transparency and effectiveness of monetary policy."
"Secondly, a clear interpretation of the ECB's mandate, as laid down in Article 105(1) of the Treaty, is urgently required."
"In particular, the ECB needs to state how it intends to fulfil its Treaty obligations to support the European Union's economic policy while simultaneously maintaining price stability, and what resources it intends to draw upon to do so."
"I would point out that the Treaty draws a clear distinction between these two aims, and that they cannot therefore be deemed to be interchangeable."
"If the ECB adopted a clear stance on this question, it would be possible to avoid misunderstandings as to whether or not the ECB is responsible for attaining aims other than price stability."
"Thirdly, the ECB is mistaken in its interpretation of the inflation criterion applied in assessing how prepared new Member States are for entry into the euro zone."
"The Treaty clearly states that the point of reference should be the average inflation rate of, and I quote: 'the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability'."
"The Treaty makes no mention of the lowest prices."
"The ECB defined price stability as a rate of inflation under 2% but close to 2%."
"However, when assessing the degree of preparedness of the candidate countries, the ECB applies another definition, namely the average of the three countries with the lowest inflation."
"There cannot be two different definitions of the same Treaty provision, and I therefore call on the ECB to clarify the situation."
"(ES) Mr President, President Trichet, ladies and gentlemen, the presentation and debate in Parliament of the European Central Bank Annual Report 2005 is the annual account that makes the independence of the Central Bank compatible with its democratic control."
"I would like to make three brief comments on the impact of the monetary policy, the need for financial integration and the future composition of the Management Board."
"The objectives of the monetary policy are to control inflation and to contribute to economic objectives of a general nature."
"At the end of 2005, and following two and a half years without taking any action, the European Central Bank increased interest rates, inflation stood at 2 tenths above the 2%, and there was a modest growth in the euro zone of 1.4%."
"Those are the macroeconomic data, but the results of the monetary policy require that a more precise approach be taken, which I believe requires, on the one hand, an examination of internal divergences, which are considerable in terms of inflation and growth, amongst the Member States of the euro zone."
"This is important in order to ascertain the impact of the monetary policy, and, in particular, to ensure that there are no persistent imbalances."
"Secondly, we also need to know how these monetary policy conditions translate to the market and, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses."
"During 2005, the European Central Bank published its first report on financial integration in the euro zone, and I congratulate it on that. It makes a very significant contribution."
"Accelerated globalisation is creating changes in financial products and markets that bring new challenges."
"When the single currency was drawn up, the risks of the system could be dealt with by means of monetary policy instruments."
"Now we need new initiatives."
"This is why it is important to carry on making progress on the Economic and Monetary Union, in order to achieve new goals, but also in order to maintain the efficiency of the monetary policy in the face of new challenges."
"Finally, on the composition of the Management Board, I am in favour of greater parliamentary control, in order to achieve more professionalism and competence, and also a gender perspective, Mr President."
"The group photo of its governing body contains just one woman."
"European Central Bank (FR) Mr President, might I perhaps say a word or two, since a number of issues have been broached?"
"I should like first of all to thank the honourable Members."
"I have indeed been very alert to the precise nature of the remarks, observations and recommendations made to us."
"On the subject of independence, I should like to say, on behalf of all the members of the Executive Board and the Governing Council, how important it is to hear so very many MEPs state how crucial it is for the European Central Bank to be independent."
"I must confess that we should certainly not have been able to give the European economy its particular monetary and financial environment without the credibility conferred on us by this principle of independence recognised by your Parliament, by the whole world and by all market participants, wherever in the world they might be."
"The Bank's independence is stated in the Treaty, it is a recognised fact and it is one of Europe's basic assets."
"I should like once again to thank all the MEPs who expressed themselves so clearly on this point."
"Let me now deal with some of the other points raised, which are certainly important in the eyes of a number of Members of Parliament."
"I have to say that the question of the appointment of the members of the Executive Board is one that should be addressed to the executive branches, particularly the Council, because they are responsible for such matters."
"We are appointed according to the Treaty provisions and, as you know, not only does Parliament give its assessment of the quality of the various persons concerned, but so do we in the Governing Council."
"I know that Parliament would like to have not only an advisory role but also responsibility for the decision itself."
"I respect that sentiment."
"I realise that the ECB has to let Parliament and the Council discuss the matter, provided full independence and absence of politicisation are totally assured, for, clearly, if the institution were to suffer from politicisation, it would not be able to deliver what it has to deliver, namely, price stability, something which also depends on it enjoying sound credibility, so that inflation expectations can be firmly anchored."
"As regards the various remarks on the dialogue between Parliament and the ECB, in my opinion this dialogue has improved in terms of both frequency and interaction and I will take good note of all the remarks made here, including those concerning the governance of our possible Target2 Securities system."
"On that issue, which is dear to your heart, Mr Radwan, and to that of other Members of Parliament, I would say that our aspiration - and it is really a work in progress - was to maximise the benefits of European integration following the successful introduction of the euro, since it is clear that the availability of a single settlement engine for securities denominated in euros would undoubtedly represent progress."
"The second objective would be to maximise settlement efficiency and that would probably require cash and securities to be settled on the same IT platform, according to what is known technically as an 'integrated model'."
"The third issue, which is important from our own perspective, is how to maximise the Central Bank's control over the bank accounts opened in our own book."
"We take a very strong line on this, believing that solutions which avoid forcing central banks to outsource the management of their accounts would not be good ones."
"These are the three main reasons why we are working on this matter, through a dialogue with the market, which is very important, and, of course, with Parliament."
"A number of other points have been mentioned."
"I will not return to the matter of hedge funds raised by Mrs van den Burg, in particular."
"As to the question of whether or not we are sufficiently transparent and open as regards communication, I reiterate that we do not take decisions alone behind closed doors."
"The Commissioner and the President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker, are invited to all meetings of the Governing Council."
"They are also invited every fortnight to our discussions and deliberations, so that they can be as close as possible to the decisions taken."
"I myself have the privilege of appearing before the Eurogroup every month."
"So there are three opportunities each month to exchange views and gain as full as possible an understanding of how the decision-making process really works."
"It seems to me that, from that standpoint, we have the most highly-organised system of contacts anywhere in the world."
"It is not new; it was the tradition of the Bundesbank, the Banque de France and a number of central banks."
"Let us not underestimate its significance."
"Some of the remarks made fail to take this into account."
"As regards the transparency of our concept of monetary policy, we are in a position where we say that our primary goal is price stability, because that is what the Treaty stipulates."
"We give an arithmetical definition of price stability as inflation rates of below and close to 2%. Everyone is aware of this."
"We have a two-pillar strategy that is very clear."
"In that respect, we are much more transparent and precise."
"We provide a greater yardstick with which to measure our performance than other sister central banks do."
"I do not want to address myself to any of them in particular, but across the Atlantic there is a sister central bank which, for very good reasons of its own, has a different approach to the definition of price stability, with regard to the clarity of that goal."
"From that standpoint we are very transparent."
"The entire world knows that we are transparent and it is one of the reasons why inflation expectations are anchored in line with our definition of price stability, which is a fundamental result."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to reply briefly to a number of MEPs."
"The fact that we are credible and that our predictions concerning inflation correspond to our definition of price stability offer the European economy a particularly favourable financial environment."
"I would ask those Members who have criticised our monetary policy, accusing it of being too orthodox, simply to remember what the rates of interest for the medium- and long-term markets in their countries were before the introduction of the euro."
"In reality, inflation predictions assumed a rate of inflation much higher than that which we ourselves are now able to guarantee to Europeans."
"It should be noted that low inflation represents, above all, a crucial factor for the poorest sections of our societies, preserving as it does their purchasing power."
"I noted, moreover, that many Members were asking us to remain very vigilant in this respect."
"I am, therefore, deeply convinced that there exists a very simple relationship between our primary objective, as assigned by the Treaty, and Article 105."
"Meeting our primary objective is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of our being able to move in the direction desired by everyone in this Chamber, that being, of course, the direction of growth and employment."
"Price stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and for the creation of lasting employment."
"If I have time I shall make two or three other remarks."
"Regarding the 500-euro note, I do not agree at all with the remark that was made suggesting that we would actively assist money-laundering."
"As you know, large denomination notes were a strong tradition in many of the countries forming part of the euro area and we decided not to change the various traditions drastically."
"So the note is used in some countries, but not in others."
"It remains an option and we decided not to eliminate that option for those countries and economies that were used to it."
"I believe I have covered all the other questions that were raised."
"However, Mr Whittaker mentioned the 'one-size-fits-all' angle."
"Europe is a vast continental economy and, from 1 January next year when Slovenia joins, the euro zone will have 315 million citizens."
"This compares with 300 million in the United States and thus represents an economy of the same order of magnitude."
"When you measure the dispersion, the standard deviation of growth and of inflation at the level of various states of various different sizes, you will see that it is roughly the same for both economies."
"This is not widely known, but is worth pointing out, since it appears to be a characteristic of a vast continental economy."
"This does not mean that we have to cater for persistent differences, and it is one of the things that we have discussed, particularly in the Eurogroup."
"We need to reflect on this question, but again, it would probably be wrong to forget that an element of dispersion is always associated with the size of the economy concerned."
"(FR) Mr President, I think I have covered most of the questions put, but it goes without saying that I remain at Parliament's disposal."
"Thank you, Mr Trichet."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(FR) Mrs Berès's report on the Annual Report (for 2005) of the European Central Bank is disappointing as it does not sufficiently underline the need for political reflection on the use of the euro to support growth and employment."
"In an ever more complex world, characterised by an extremely violent economic and social war, not to have an extensive and high-quality political debate on this subject is, at present, an error but may, in future, prove to have been an act of negligence."
"The European Central Bank and its President, Mr Trichet, must not lose sight of the fact that Article 105 of the Treaty establishing the European Community clearly indicates that, without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the European System of Central Banks shall support the EU's economic policies."
"At a time when increases in the prices of raw materials and of energy are giving rise to natural inflationary tensions in the world, we need to reflect on the impact of this situation on our internal market and our common currency, while seriously asking ourselves whether the time might not have come to develop the euro so that, as well as being a truly remarkable technical success, it is also a political currency."
"Support for rural development by the EAFRD - Voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) C6-0237/2006;"
"the report by Mr Goepel, on behalf of the Committee of Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, and amending Regulation (EC) 1290/2005 C6-0235/2006."
"Mr President, according to the agenda, we were supposed to be able to have, and conclude, a debate about both Mr Mulder's report and my own this morning, before having the opportunity to vote on them."
"We now have exactly 18 minutes until voting time."
"It is completely unfair to our farmers and agriculturalists to begin a debate of this nature and then perhaps conclude such an important subject as the 20% voluntary modulation - in other words, a policy whereby one-fifth of the existing direct payments to farmers are to be transferred or reduced - with some form of contingency vote this afternoon."
"I request that this debate be postponed until November."
"(Applause)"
"Are you asking for the debate or the vote to be postponed?"
"Mr President, when are we to have this debate?"
"Surely not now, in the 15 minutes that remain?"
"On behalf of my group and of my fellow MEPs, I would like to bring forward a motion for the postponement of the debate."
"I do realise that under the rules of procedure such a motion must be brought forward at least 24 hours before the debate, but 24 hours before the debate I was unaware that Parliament would not be keeping to its agenda."
"(Applause)"
"(EL) Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we absolutely support the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Goepel, for the debate and vote to be postponed until plenary in November."
"(DA) Mr President, I am deputising today for Mr Mulder, who is unable to be with us for personal reasons, and I would very much like, on behalf of my group too, to support Mr Goepel's proposal."
"At the same time, I would like to direct some criticism at the Presidency."
"It is absolutely outrageous that this extremely important issue - which we needed to be able to deal with this week, partly from the point of view of timing considerations - should now be mishandled in this way and dealt with like this."
"I therefore support Mr Goepel's proposal to postpone both the debate and the vote."
"Mr President, I support Mrs Batzeli, Mr Goepel and Mr Busk."
"This is a very important debate: it is about the whole future of the common agricultural policy."
"It concerns all the countries in the European Union, but none more than the United Kingdom."
"As we have to catch planes this afternoon, it is simply impossible to debate it now."
"We really need to postpone the debate and the vote until November."
"I hope you will accept that situation."
"(DE) Mr President, on behalf of my group, too, I would like to support the rapporteur's motion."
"Looking at the report, even the uninitiated would be able to tell that what we are dealing with here is rather a formal matter."
"Behind this facade, however, as Mr Parish has already pointed out, lies the fundamental consideration of the funding of agricultural policy in the coming years and the position of Parliament on this issue."
"For this reason, we must debate this issue at a proper time when there is sufficient time available so to do."
"We cannot dismember this issue in this way."
"I therefore support this motion and ask that you agree to it and that you inform the Bureau of the significance of this dispute."
"Perhaps the Bureau was not already aware of it."
"(PT) Mr President, I should just like to say that I agree with the proposal to postpone this debate and the vote until November, for the reasons mentioned, that is to say, because it is too important an issue to be dealt with in a hurry in 15 minutes or a little more."
"(DE) Mr President, firstly, I would ask that we simply vote on this motion so that you then also have the recommendation of this House."
"Furthermore, we could vote solely about postponement."
"The decision as to when this subject is put on the agenda again is of course a matter for the Conference of Presidents and ultimately for the entire House."
"Personally speaking, however, I would be in favour of postponing both."
"Perhaps we could vote, and then you would see the clear will of the House."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to endorse the rapporteur's motion as well as what Mr Swoboda has said."
"As rapporteur on financial planning, I would also point out that this ill-starred proposal is based on the conclusions of the European Council and that the Commission was obliged to come up with a proposal for this so-called voluntary modulation."
"In the course of the financial planning negotiations we explicitly reserved our position for the legislative process. That is exactly what the rapporteur is now observing."
"Given the significance of this matter, I find it reasonable to ask the Council to be represented at the next debate after any postponement and to confirm to us that this will be the case."
"(PL) On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I simply wanted to say that I also fully endorse Mr Goepel's suggestion."
"These are important reports and they deserve to be debated in a serious setting, not under the present circumstances."
"I fully support Mr Goepel."
"I am convinced by the arguments."
"I propose, as President of this sitting, that we change the agenda by withdrawing the joint debate on the reports by Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel."
"(Parliament agreed to withdraw the two reports from that day's agenda)"
"Mr President, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all the political parties and groups."
"(Applause and laughter)"
"We have reached a reasonable solution."
"The debate will take place at a more convenient time, under more favourable conditions."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 a.m. and resumed at 11.40 a.m.)"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, before proceeding to the vote on the budget, I would like to inform you that the President of the Chilean House of Deputies, Mr Antonio Leal Labrín, is here with us in the official gallery."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Leal Labrín is accompanied by Chilean MPs Mr Gonzalo Duarte Leiva and Mr Germán Becker Alvear."
"We welcome them and thank them for visiting us."
"(FR) Mr President, this is indeed a point of order and also a reminder of Rule 188 of the Rules of Procedure."
"We have just learned, following the meeting of the Bureau, that the Israeli Government would like to exclude Mrs Le Pen from the political discussions of the Israeli delegation."
"She is a member of that delegation in a spirit of debate, dialogue and openness."
"I should like to express our thanks to Mr Brok for his perfectly correct attitude and to say very clearly that, when Mr Krivine was similarly excluded by a decision of the United States Government, we agreed entirely, whatever the difference of opinion between us, that it was not for the host government to determine how the European Parliament's delegation should be composed."
"I therefore dare to hope that, in your capacity as guarantor of the rights of all Members of the European Parliament, you will be anxious to make this point to the Israeli authorities."
"(DE) Mr President, you should give the floor to Mr Brok first, as he has something he wants to say on the subject;"
"I am quite happy to state my position afterwards, and so I ask to be given the floor after Mr Brok has spoken."
"The Conference of Presidents has decided to postpone the visit of the ad hoc delegation to Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, and I hope that this is a satisfactory response to the concern expressed."
"Thank you for drawing Parliament's attention to this issue."
"(ES) Mr President, as you know, I try to be serious when I speak and, since the Rules of Procedure state that all documents handled officially in this House must be available in all of the official languages, I would draw your attention to the fact that I am going to vote for amendments that only appear in three: English, French and German; these are three highly respectable languages, as are all the others."
"Since this may create problems in the future, therefore, I would draw attention to the fact that this text is not available in all of the official languages; it is not available in mine."
"The Secretariat's services inform me that they are sure that they appear in all languages, including yours and mine."
"If I have understood correctly, you are not referring to the texts on which we are going to vote, but to the voting list."
"This list is available in three languages, as usual, but the texts on which we are going to vote are in all languages. Our Rules of Procedure have not therefore been violated."
"Nevertheless, we shall look into the issue for later plenary sittings."
"(DE) Mr President, since I wish to repudiate the utterances made by the group back there, perhaps I might be permitted to make a comment."
"The rights of all Members of this House are being safeguarded, all in the same way."
"If we are to undertake a journey to a region like this one, balance is essential, and every aspect of the trip must be organised professionally."
"That it was not possible, on this occasion, to go at the time planned, was attributable to technical considerations."
"We should, however, be making the journey at a later date."
"We should not allow the Le Pen group to read something secret and mysterious into this that is not there, and I would like to repudiate what they say in the strongest possible terms."
"The procedure has been as follows: the Conference of Presidents, having listened to you, has decided to postpone the visit of this ad hoc delegation."
"That is the fundamental procedure we have followed; anything else is a matter of opinion or interpretation and everyone is entitled to their own."
"1."
"Draft general budget for the European Union - Financial year 2007 (vote)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would point out that, according to the Treaties, in order to be approved, draft amendments relating to what we call non-obligatory spending must be voted for by a majority of the members of the European Parliament, that is to say, 367 votes."
"In the case of proposed amendments relating to obligatory spending, a majority of the votes cast is sufficient."
"Before the vote, Mr Elles wishes to propose certain technical amendments."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, it is good to get the vote on the 2007 budget under way."
"Before we start on the vote on Parliament's first reading, I should like to announce that a small number of technical adjustments need to be made."
"Rather than read out a very long list of numbers, the list of technical adjustments has been annexed to our voting lists."
"Following the vote those adjustments will be made by the relevant departments and included in the Minutes of the sitting."
"(Parliament accepted the technical amendments proposed by Mr Elles)"
"(Before the vote on Section I)"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to inform you that the resolution will be adapted according to the result of the vote on the budgetary amendments."
"Therefore, any technical corrections needed will be made by the session services."
"(Parliament agreed)"
"2."
"Draft general budget for 2007 (Section III) (vote)"
"3."
"Draft general budget for 2007 (sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII) (vote)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 31:"
"(FR) Mr President, because it has never been proved that, employee for employee and hour of work for hour of work, the Manpower solution to providing session auxiliaries was any cheaper, and because Parliament is constantly trying to make savings, we propose to help it by adding, at the end of paragraph 31, the following sentence: 'reject as too expensive the solution of using a temping agency to replace session auxiliaries'."
"(Applause)"
"(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 7:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to propose that the text of paragraph 58 of the report be replaced by the following text: 'Notes the improvement in monitoring of the implementation of the EU budget in its budgetary vote; asks the relevant committees to examine the setting-up of a structure and a procedure to carry out the implementation assessment exercise for 2007 with the specialised committees; in this way it will also help to prepare for the budget review in 2008-2009; asks the Secretary-General to facilitate the logistics to organise regular monitoring meetings according to the priorities that will be defined by the committees concerned'."
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"4."
"Fishing fleets registered in the outermost regions (vote)"
"5."
"Commemoration of 1956 Hungarian Uprising (vote)"
"- Before the vote on Recital J:"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this resolution makes a connection between the Hungarian revolution and the other efforts at resistance in Eastern Europe, it makes no reference to the uprising on 17 June 1953 in the GDR, when, in over seven hundred cities and municipalities, people went on strike and mounted demonstrations, events that were put down by Soviet tanks."
"I would therefore like to insert the following in Recital J:"
"'recognising the historical and political link between the Hungarian Revolution in October 1956 and various other forms of resistance and resistance movements, such as the mass demonstrations in East Germany in June 1953, the Poznań demonstrations in Poland in June 1956, the Prague Spring of 1968, the birth of the Solidarity Movement in Poland in 1980 and democracy movements in the former USSR, notably those of the Baltic peoples;'"
"(Applause)"
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"6."
"Moldova (Transnistria) (vote)"
"7."
"Georgia (South Ossetia) (vote)"
"8."
"Export of toxic waste to Africa (vote)"
"9."
"Use of criminal law to protect the environment (vote)"

"EC-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement (vote)"
"11."
"Nairobi Conference on Climate Change (vote)"
"12."
"Inland waterway transport (vote)"
"13."
"Public-private partnerships (vote)"
"- On paragraph 45:"
"(FR) Excuse me, but you have unfortunately forgotten the original wording of paragraph 45."
"Thank you very much for your constructive observation, but we have voted on the corresponding amendment, and we did not therefore have to vote on the text to which you refer."
"14."
"Posting of workers (vote)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 7:"
"(NL) Mr President, it has been agreed between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs that the text should read as follows: 'considers that for ensuring', etcetera."
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"15."
"European Central Bank Annual Report (2005) (vote)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 7:"
"(DE) Mr President, may I make just a very brief interjection, since this report is not exactly an unimportant one, and ask just how legitimate a vote is when fewer than half the Members are present for it?"
"I have no desire to waste the House's time, since the previous President wasted quite enough of it already."
"Yes, Mr Alvaro, I note your concern, but we have checked that there is a quorum in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and the votes are valid."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 11:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, with regard to Amendment 12 on the subject of the post market and tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we wish to table an oral amendment."
"I will say it in English."
"Rather than 'its own settlement infrastructure', we should say, 'a settlement infrastructure'."
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, I should just like to thank you very much for the fast and efficient way in which you have organised business since you took the Chair."
"Those are the kinds of speeches we like to hear when we are in the Chair!"
"(Laughter)"
"Mr President, this is just to say that I was mistaken on my last vote."
"I thought we were voting on the amendment instead of the final vote on the Berès report."
"I voted against when I should have voted in favour."
"This is just for the record."
"Thank you for your efficiency."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. UKIP voted for every reduction or cancellation of payments, especially the ones concerning subsidies and propaganda, on the principle that these funds should not have been used for these purposes."
"Concerning Euronews, this is blatant propaganda and the media should stay independent."
"in writing. Smoking kills half a million EU citizens every year."
"Smoking is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the EU."
"It is disappointing that Amendments 376, 489 and 529 were rejected (232 votes for, 333 votes against)."
"Subsidies for tobacco-growing in the EU need to end."
"I abstained on Amendment 3 because I was not quite sure of the intent of the study that was proposed in paragraph 23, but I fully support paragraph 23 itself."
"in writing. (SV) We want the budget to contribute to sustainable social, economic and environmental development for the EU in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy."
"We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of those amendments that give priority to research, development and education and training."
"We do not, however, wish to support those amendments that give more money to direct agricultural aid and export subsidies for agricultural products, as such aid is already excessive and also results in inefficient agriculture that damages the environment and that, through the dumping of surpluses, helps increase the gap between rich and poor in the world."
"Nor do we want to give money to subsidise tobacco cultivation, as this contributes directly to public health problems."
"We believe that such aid should quickly be cut back on and completely abolished before long."
"The money thereby saved could be used, for example, to fund measures designed to reduce the use of tobacco and dependency on it."
"in writing. - (FR) On Thursday 26 October, the European Parliament adopted the first reading of the European Union's budget for 2007."
"Amounting to EUR 120 billion, it reflects the first time that use has been made of the new financial perspective for 2007-2013, which was adopted in May 2006 and which the French Socialists did not approve, believing that it did not make it possible to respond to the great challenges of the future."
"In this context, the 2007 budget has turned out to be very modest, corresponding to 1.04% of the European Union's GNI."
"The many constraints, both internal and international, on the European Union have led Parliament to single out priorities that should enable Europeans better to perceive the added value supplied by the EU."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has therefore decided to vote in favour of this 2007 budget, having received assurances concerning their priorities in relation to the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies."
"These priorities include, in particular, education, training, research and sustainable development."
"The revival of the communication policy and the emergence of new pilot projects are also encouraging in terms of the future of the European Union."
"I voted against Amendment 811, which refers to the Committee on Budgets' rural development programmes, and against Amendment 3 to paragraph 23, because they restrict funding for rural development and block 'voluntary modulation' under the terms in which it is proposed by the Commission."
"in writing. This budget again fails to find the money to meet our commitments, particularly in relation to our emerging common foreign and security policy and our development policy."
"The EU's ability to play a global role is being hampered by 'bean-counters' back in our national capital."
"For this they bear a heavy responsibility."
"On two details I will be voting against the amendment from our ultra-nationalistic and Catholic fundamentalists from Poland urging opposition to forced or 'coercive' abortions."
"Of course I am opposed to such an idea, but the EU is not supporting such a programme."
"Rather it is an attempt to introduce US evangelical Christian bigotry into EU development policy and must be opposed for that very reason."
"Second, I want proper control of spending and value for money."
"Yet some pursue these demands as a way of tying Commission staff into overly-bureaucratic regulations that hamper and hinder work, rather than assist."
"in writing. (SV) The June List believes that the EU's budget should be limited to 1% of the Member States' average GNI."
"I have therefore chosen to vote against all the increases proposed by the European Parliament, at the same time as the June List has welcomed the few savings proposed in the form of amendments by either the Committee on Budgets or individual Members."
"There are quite a few unfortunate budget headings, but the June List particularly regrets the large amount of aid for the EU's agricultural policy, Cohesion Fund and fishing industry, as well as the budget headings under which various forms of information campaign are to be subsidised."
"The June List also believes that something must be done about the European Parliament's constant commuting between Strasbourg and Brussels and that the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should be closed down."
"This week (beginning 23 October 2006), the EU's Court of Auditors observed for the thirteenth time in a row that it could not guarantee that more than a small part of the EU's budget was being used correctly or for the purposes intended."
"How can this madness continue whereby, year after year, financial resources are appropriated, only a small portion of which can be guaranteed to be used for the purposes for which they were intended?"
"Whilst we wish to restate our opposition to key aspects of the negotiating strategy and of the priorities established by Parliament on the Community's 2007 Budget, we also feel we must advocate the adoption of some of our proposals, which are aimed at:"
"increasing the appropriation earmarked for the European Social Fund convergence."
"promoting cooperation and the establishment of associations between micro, small and medium-sized enterprises;"
"protecting and preserving the forests, with measures and actions to monitor and prevent forest fires;"
"promoting, preserving and protecting cultural heritage, such as the Cistercian Route and UNESCO world heritage sites."
"promoting cooperation between farming organisations and other stakeholders in rural areas, with a view to revitalising those areas; and promoting family, small-scale and medium-sized farming, and farming among young people."
"carrying out studies or reports into child labour in the EU, relocations and employment, the single currency, the price of essential goods and bank charges and commissions, and the impact of new technologies on the work place and on work-related illnesses;"
"providing information on, and clarification of, the rights of people employed in seasonal work outside their country of origin."
"in writing. We are opposing a continued expansion of the EU-budget, which today is already too extensive with a large part of the funds going to the wrong ends."
"Today there seem to be a reciprocal action between new objectives for the Union and demands on financing via EU."
"These mean new demands on payments from the Member States, but also that new funds are being transferred to a system which is bureaucratic, inefficient and complex."
"However, there are many desirable initiatives being financed via the budget, and we support reasonable changes of existing means."
"But our opposition to a constantly increasing budget is firm, and therefore we have chosen to vote against the report in the final vote."
"in writing. - (FR) This vote is in response to an unacceptable multiannual budgetary framework."
"Detailed examination of the budget headings shows the blatant inadequacy of appropriations to many areas such as research, innovation, the big technological projects such as Galileo and the great trans-European networks."
"This budget will not encourage the stimulation of growth in Europe."
"European aid to the countries of the South, Africa and the Maghreb is light years away from a development policy such as needs to be implemented as a matter of urgency in order to tackle extreme poverty and unbalanced migration."
"It is urgently necessary to devise a European tax guaranteeing a high level of own resources for a European budget that is finally a match for what is at stake."
"in writing. Once again we are adopting a budget which does not meet the commitments entered into by the EU institutions."
"This is particularly true in relation to foreign and security policy and development policy."
"It is bound to increase the impression in the world that the EU is very poor when it comes to putting its money where its mouth is."
"That said, I welcome the emphasis in this budget on proper control and getting value for money."
"(FR) Mr President, I regret that paragraphs 18 and 44 of the Grech report were not subject to a split vote, as I would have voted against them."
"A number of members of the Commission on Budgets continually mount rearguard actions against the decisions of Heads of State or Government regarding our Parliament's three places of work."
"It is true that having three sites gives rise to costs."
"To call such expenditure 'superfluous' is, however, inappropriate, to say the least."
"Decentralisation also has some very positive repercussions for MEPs and for Parliament."
"Moreover, to bring into question the need for our officials to be present in Strasbourg during plenary part-sessions is a veritable affront to the administration which, I know, is very careful in choosing the officials it sends out."
"I would also have voted against paragraph 44, which takes a dim view of the 'Strasbourg experience'."
"I protest against the implications of this paragraph."
"By purchasing the three buildings in Strasbourg that it did not own, Parliament has, indeed, obtained real bargains."
"This is an extremely judicious piece of expenditure which, unlike expenditure on rent, will enable large public savings to be made."
"I should have liked a number of members of the Committee on Budgets to have made a more objective judgment, especially since they are required to respect decisions concerning Parliament's seat, whether they like them or not."
"Mr Grech and Mr Elles, the rapporteurs, are right to opt in favour of increased efficiency when discussing the 2007 budget."
"Setting priorities is also a necessary and sensible component in Mr Elles strategy."
"This does not automatically mean, however, that more funds should be made available for priority budget lines."
"Instead, non-priority budget lines should be given a more critical evaluation."
"In the majority of the amendments, however, a decision has, unfortunately, been made to increase the budgeted means after all."
"With regard to multilingualism, I welcome the fact that efforts are made to enhance efficiency in that area too."
"Cost-reducing measures should not lead, though, to multilingualism being under threat."
"All in all, it is positive that, following the Council's position, there is now more attention for efficient and more economical budgeting."
"It is for this reason that Mr Grech's resolution receives my support."
"in writing. (SV) We have today voted in favour of the reports on the EU's budget for 2007."
"We welcome efforts to ensure that taxpayers obtain more value for money."
"We also support the investments in research and development and the ambition to strengthen the EU as a global actor."
"We reject, however, the proposals to increase the appropriations for agricultural aid and regional aid."
"As always, we are sceptical about centrally devised campaigns and opinion-forming."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report on appropriations to the European Parliament."
"I regret, however, that paragraphs 18 and 44 were not subject to split votes, as I would have voted against them."
"A number of members of the Committee on Budgets continually mount rearguard actions against the decisions of the Heads of State or Government regarding our Parliament's three places of work, namely Strasbourg, Luxembourg and Brussels."
"It is true that this arrangement gives rise to costs, but to call such expenditure superfluous is rash, to say the least."
"For MEPs, as well as for Parliament, decentralisation - which a majority of the Committee on Budgets unfairly refers to as geographical dispersion - has some very positive repercussions."
"To bring into question the need for our officials to be present in Strasbourg for the plenary part-sessions is a veritable affront to the Bureau and, especially, the administration which, I know, is very careful in choosing the officials it sends to Strasbourg."
"I would also have voted against paragraph 44 which asks the administration, after what it pejoratively calls the 'Strasbourg experience', 'to apply more stringent, water-tight and transparent procedures when purchasing buildings'..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"In view of the structural, economic and social situation in the fishing sector in the outermost regions, and the adoption of the new European Fisheries Fund, it is crucial to extend the derogations laid down in Regulation (EC) 639/2004 on the criteria and conditions governing structural actions relating to the preservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy."
"The proposal for a Council regulation providing for an extension of these derogations for the outermost regions until 31 December 2006 and the practical implementation of measures adopted in the interim by 2008, must of course be adopted at the earliest opportunity, so that it can actually have the desired effect on the ground."
"Although I agree with the thrust of the proposal and the content of this document, I am very disappointed that the implementation plan for renewing and modernising the fleets in the outermost regions cannot be put in place until the period of the next financial perspective, rather than the timeframe established for 2008."
"In spite of this, and because this derogation represents positive discrimination in favour of the outermost regions, I shall be voting in favour of this proposed regulation."
"The purpose of this proposal is to extend the derogations granted to fishing fleets in the outermost regions until 31 December 2006, and subsequently until 31 December 2007. These derogations relate to the entry/exit schemes of the fleet capacity and the provision of aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet."
"It was a matter of great urgency that this proposal be adopted, in view of the specific structural, social and economic realities of the fishing industry in the outermost regions, for example the Azores and Madeira, coupled with the permanent difficulties and constraints faced by these regions, such as their limited markets and their remoteness."
"The crux of the matter is that the existing economic activities - in this case fisheries - of many of these regions are of major socio-economic importance, for example in ensuring that people have fresh fish to eat."
"Given the need for these derogations, and in view of the fact that the situation facing the fleets is down to structural rather than economic factors, as the Commission and the Council have acknowledged, the derogations should be made permanent and be included in the European Fisheries Fund for 2007-2013."
"in writing. - (FR) Today, the European Parliament is voting under urgent procedure on a Council Regulation on the management of fishing fleets registered in the outermost regions, which extends the regulation currently in force by one year."
"The main derogations authorised relate to the addition of fishing vessels to the fleet, public aid for the renewal of vessels and aid for modernisation."
"This regulation takes account of circumstances in the fishing sector in the outermost regions, where there are still abundant fishery resources and significant potential for development."
"It would therefore be inconceivable and counter-productive to prevent the fishing fleets in these regions from benefiting from such facilities!"
"I hope that those involved in fishing in the outermost regions will be able to take advantage of this new extension to develop and modernise the fleet."
"Nevertheless, I find it regrettable that the European Commission has still not put forward any longer-term guidelines."
"I have already asked on numerous occasions for these derogations to be extended beyond 2006."
"It would have been more sensible to accept this proposal right from the start, instead of coming to Parliament each year asking for the derogations, which are absolutely vital for fisheries in our regions, to be extended for another year."
"in writing. I will be supporting this resolution."
"The tragedy of this failed revolution, brutally put down by Soviet imperial troops with the death of thousands, is that it closed down an evolutionary path out of Soviet oppression to engagement with the rest of the world, a slow but sure path to pluralism and democracy."
"Instead, tens of thousands fled as refugees."
"I remember as a six-year-old schoolchild being sent to collect a Hungarian refugee child who was to join my class at my school in Gloucestershire, on his first day."
"Seeing the misery and distress of him and his family was probably my first experience of the consequences of oppression for the lives and future of ordinary people."
"I have never forgotten it."
"in writing. - (EL) We MEPs of the Greek Communist Party refused to take part in the vote on the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian uprising which developed into anti-communist hysteria."
"The final resolution jointly signed and supported by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and by the neo-liberals and other groups with the exception of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left adopts the anti-communist memorandum taken from the Council of Europe and reintroduced into the European Parliament."
"They are calling events supported and organised by imperialism to overturn socialist regimes popular uprisings and democratic movements."
"They collectively consider everyone who furiously fought socialism to be resistance fighters and democrats."
"It is now clear that the political forces that support the ΕU are the same forces that morally and politically advocate the revival of fascism in the Baltic and other states and are urging and leading the ban on communist action, as in the Czech Republic and other countries previously."
"The call by the servants of capitalist barbarism in paragraph 3 of the resolution on the 'democratic community' '... to unequivocally reject the repressive and undemocratic Communist ideology...' expresses their fear of it."
"We want to remind all those dreaming of the ultimate prevalence of the barbaric, exploitative capitalist system that the communist ideology gave birth to the biggest social uprisings and will give birth to even bigger ones, precisely because it is fighting for a society free from the exploitation of man by man."
"One of the most positive aspects of the recent EU enlargement is that it has also led to an enlargement of our memory."
"For most of us, the 1956 Hungarian uprising is a distant memory in terms of time, geography and even in politics."
"The accession of countries like Poland, the Baltic States, Slovenia and Hungary itself has brought with it another memory that we have incorporated, and this memory has been a full part of our consciousness for a year and a half."
"This has led to a fresh geo-strategic perception of our place in the world, which we need to incorporate and to keep up to date, and has shed new light on the democratic struggles of the 20th century."
"On the other hand, this moment should naturally serve to remind us that Communism was neither romantic nor utopian."
"The history of Communism is one of repression, violence and inhumanity, and we should not forget this."
"The European Parliament resolution on the situation in South Ossetia is an expression of the EU's imperialist plans in the region."
"We know that Georgia is already one step away from joining ΝΑΤΟ, while the imperialist lackey Saakashvili government has already agreed to the installation of American basis on its territory."
"The EU's ambitions to encircle and exert pressure on Russia, with one eye firmly on the Russian market, especially the energy market, within the framework of the vying and infighting between the imperialists are hiding behind self-righteous pronouncements about respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and condemnation of the independence movements in Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"With the same ease with which the EU is allegedly defending the territorial integrity of Georgia today, it can undermine it tomorrow by supporting the secessionist movements which it condemns today, if the strategic interests of the monopolies in the area so require."
"The peoples in the area have a great deal of experience of Community interventionist policy, with incitement and support for all manner of 'domestic uprisings' and the 'carrot and stick' policy."
"That is why they need to draw their own conclusions and to stand up and resist and overturn the policy of the ΕU and the other imperialist forces and governments which serve it."
"in writing. I welcome this vote on the export of toxic waste to Africa."
"The recent incident involving a Dutch company dumping waste in the Ivory Coast demonstrates that many in Europe still see Africa as a dumping ground."
"I hope the Dutch authorities leave no stone unturned in bringing those responsible to justice."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Hieronymi report stems from a worthy aim, namely that of supporting European audiovisual production against the crushing competition exerted by US productions, as well as others."
"In order to reach that goal, it seeks to encourage coproduction, support coordinated marketing strategies and promote the distribution of the Union's products on the internal and international market."
"However, the budget allocation appears fairly limited."
"Moreover, precisely because of the fact that resources are limited, it by no means seems a good idea to open the programme to participation by non-European countries as well."
"I believe that public support for this sector, at both national and European level, should be directed towards audiovisual productions intended to inform and to instruct, to educate in the strictest sense, and towards projects making a real difference in breaking down the present situation in which Europe is made a cultural colony of the United States."
"I do not feel that the report goes far enough in this respect."
"in writing. I voted in favour of this report."
"It is clear that many companies and individuals routinely abuse laws designed to protect the environment."
"They often find it cheaper to pay fines than to comply with laws on dumping or transporting toxic waste."
"If we want to protect the environment we must consider criminal as well as civil action against the abusers."
"in writing. (SV) The June List believes that the EU should not interfere in other countries' internal affairs."
"It is important for reasons of principle to pursue the policy we went to the polls on."
"There is no doubt that Syria should improve its relations with Israel."
"The June List is an uncompromising opponent of all totalitarian regimes, and we condemn all countries that choose to support terrorism in all its forms."
"It is obvious that the EU's foreign policy is governed by various special interests possessed by certain Member States in regions around the world."
"I find this policy to be very disingenuous and destructive, and to be so in a way exemplified clearly by the current report."
"The EU is trying to influence Syria's relations with its neighbours, and that cannot be regarded as acceptable."
"I am choosing to abstain in the vote for reasons of principle."
"Naturally we have no quarrel with the conclusion of an association agreement with Syria, which, as we know, is the only country in the region with which the EC does not have an association agreement. We are vehemently opposed, however, to some of the key points in the report."
"The report is marked by an approach based on interventionism and meddling on a broad range of issues over which sovereignty should rest with the Syrian people."
"What is more, Parliament holds Syria responsible for the situation in the Middle East and makes accusations against the country, something it has failed to do in relation to Israel and the USA, which are primarily responsible for the dangerous, tragic situation in the region."
"Among other points, the report's objectives include the transition of the political system in Syria and the creation of 'an open and market-based economy'."
"It seeks to force Syria to comply with UN Security Council resolutions on Lebanon, yet fails to mention the fact that Israel continues to occupy part of Syrian territory, attacks Lebanon and continues to pursue its policy of State terrorism against Palestine."
"It criticises Syrian politics and calls on the country to review 'its current foreign policy and regional alignment'."
"We find this unacceptable."
"in writing. I welcome this Agreement."
"Syria has much to do in terms of improving human rights, its relationship with its neighbours and its treatment of its minorities."
"However, I believe constructive agreement is the way forward."
"Europe must keep Syria at arm's length, not because that country forms part of the axis of evil, as America's President Bush claims it does, but because it oppresses its own people and represents an unnecessary burden on others."
"Syria has, for many years, been a dictatorship that was run by the El-Assads, both father and son."
"Many Syrian residents were forced to flee abroad, because they otherwise faced being locked up or disappearing utterly, and no organised opposition is permitted."
"Not only political opponents, but also Kurds and Christians feel themselves under threat."
"In neighbouring Lebanon, Syria was responsible for years of military occupation, for political assassinations and for arming Hezbollah."
"In another of its neighbours, Israel, it is considered to be a most unreasonable neighbour, one that never wants peace or reconciliation, and Syria's actions can be used as one of the arguments not to actively broker a peace agreement with a Palestinian neighbour."
"Syria has recently secretly extradited a Dutchman of Iranian descent to Iran."
"The EU's position on Syria is still too much focused on good relations with the Mediterranean Sea countries and too little on democracy and human rights."
"The statements by the Council and the Commission and the European Parliament resolution are a blatant and unprovoked attack on Syria, from which they want a statement of apology for its policy and its subjugation to imperialism."
"Taking advantage of the debate on a Euro-Mediterranean association agreement, threats are being launched about its stand against the war in Iraq, solidarity with the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and refusal to bow down to imperialist plans."
"The escalating aggressive policy of the EU reveals the nature of UN Resolution 1701 by announcing in advance the role which the military occupying forces of the Member States of the European Union will play in the area."
"The report constitutes the European version of the American propaganda which is targeting Syria and calling it an axis of evil country."
"We voted against the report in an expression of solidarity with the peoples of Syria and the Middle East which the American and European imperialists have in their sights."
"The EU, USA and ΝΑΤΟ are jointly promoting the application of the NATO 'Middle East' plan in a bid to subjugate countries and peoples."
"We consider it politically unacceptable for this specific report to be passed by political forces which call themselves leftist, because they are joining sides with the imperialist policy of the ΕU and the USA, thereby providing an alibi for unleashing new wars."
"Although this is, broadly speaking, a balanced report in the version negotiated by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I still have one or two reservations about its adoption."
"As a result of both its status and logistical difficulties, the EU has neither the power nor the ability to act as a world power."
"It also has neither the military nor the financial resources to do so, and most importantly, it does not have such a mandate."
"This does not mean, however, that the EU should be a passive member of the international community."
"The dimensions of Europe as a market, as a provider of financial aid, as a place of refuge for immigrants, and as a neighbour make, or ought to make, the EU a partner in external policy."
"I am not talking about the traditional reference to the virtues of soft power or the debate on the need for alternative axes."
"What I am referring to is the ability that the EU should have, on account of these dimensions, to influence and change policy in the Mediterranean, one of the most important regions in the world."
"In the medium term, the EU should be capable of having the same effect on its neighbours as it has had on the countries that have joined it in successive rounds of enlargement."
"What we should be doing is reproducing in our Mediterranean neighbours the effects of pre-accession expectations."
"Unfortunately, this agreement does not convey that ambition."
"in writing. - (FR) The Conference of the Parties in Montreal last year concluded with the minimal decision to continue discussions on the Kyoto Protocol and its objectives after 2012."
"On the eve of the next annual conference, the situation is still just as uncertain, and it therefore presents a serious threat to the future of the Kyoto Protocol, particularly in the wake of the statements by the new Canadian Government."
"This situation is incomprehensible and unacceptable given that the warning signs are continuing to multiply and that forecasts are certain of a 50% increase in CO2 emissions by 2030, which runs counter to the objectives in this matter, to which our institution refers on a regular basis."
"There is a very broad consensus within the European Union, as the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) has lent its support to some very ambitious objectives to combat climate change."
"We must act as a matter of urgency, and take decisions and measures that match the challenges facing Europe and the whole world."
"Our response to those challenges represents a powerful driving force for research and technological innovation, and for the modernisation of our production facilities."
"in writing. One of the most important issues facing the world today is the issue of climate change and how to tackle it."
"This is no longer an issue for tomorrow, but now."
"The time for action is upon us."
"All the evidence from the world's scientists tells us exactly that, even if the Bush Administration is lying to gag its own experts' contributions to the debate."
"It is the American Administration that is the problem."
"Everyone is horrified by the consequences of the second Gulf War for the ordinary people of Iraq, with the recent estimate that there have been more than 650,000 deaths amongst the civilian population."
"Yet the failure to sign the Kyoto Agreement threatens billions around the world, and the very existence of nations like Bangladesh and the Maldives."
"This will be the legacy of this United States Administration unless they are prepared to look again."
"But I am afraid there are none so blind as those that cannot see!"
"(FR) Mr President, the Naiades programme for the development of inland waterways and Mrs Wortmann-Kool's report contain some excellent things."
"I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the need to complete the Rhine-Rhone link."
"This link is an extremely important route that will enable us to connect the South of France and the Western Mediterranean with the Rhine-Main-Danube basin, and hence with the new and emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe all the way to the Black Sea."
"In my opinion, this programme is a top priority, and I hope that it is to the completion of this link - the technical and environmental difficulties of which I am well aware of but do not consider to be insurmountable - that the resources mobilised under this programme will be allocated as the first priority."
"The Wortmann-Kool report calls for the active promotion of inland waterway transport, which is currently underdeveloped."
"This safe, environmentally-friendly mode of transport with a lot of free capacity on its infrastructure, can contribute to modal shift and ease the congestion problems affecting other transport modes."
"It also strikes me that the increase in trade since the enlargement will help develop new markets, such as this form of transport."
"The adoption of measures aimed at redressing the balance between different forms of transport is hugely important for the future of a sustainable transport policy. As such, I am strongly in favour of developing the inland waterways transport network, which, from the developmental stage, can encompass all of the strategic areas that are important in optimising the development of this market."
"Consequently, and bearing in mind the diverse characteristics of European territory, it is vital to establish an appropriate legal framework that will allow for the development of markets, which may, in turn, help move traffic over to alternative forms of transport."
"As a Portuguese MEP, I therefore support this programme, which does not foster national self-interest, and which I believe will have a positive impact on the transport market in Portugal."
"Public-private partnerships are very popular in EU Member States, and, somewhat inevitably, the United Kingdom is the European champion."
"Unfortunately, though, they are a euphemism for the privatisation, or preparation for the privatisation, of public assets and services, which will be put up for sale, over the longer term, for private investors to make profit from them."
"This, say the proponents, will lead to better risk management."
"What they overlook, however, is that private firms keep the profits and the State always ends up carrying the can when the partnership turns sour or fails to deliver the profits that the private businesses were looking for."
"This applies right across the board, in areas as diverse as the outsourcing of motorways, the management of hospitals and schools, and the incorporation of investment projects within the scope of the Structural Funds."
"They are a means of outsourcing the State's responsibilities, and this is something we find unacceptable."
"What is more, this initiative is seeking Community-level legal arrangements."
"We therefore have no choice but to vote against the report."
"The Weiler report that is being put to the vote today includes a number of positive points on the future of public-private partnerships, particularly as regards the Green Paper and Commission communication."
"In this regard, I am delighted at the clear distinction made between public procurement and concessions, and at the call for a legislative initiative on the latter."
"Although I bitterly regret the fact that the European Parliament chose not to extend this approach with regard to institutional public-private partnerships, the amendments adopted in plenary represent an acknowledged step forward towards a future definition for 'in house' services, in other words towards a more secure situation for European local authorities."
"Although this interim text is not perfect, in my view it presents a set of advances that explain why I finally voted in favour, advances which the Commission now has responsibility for integrating fully into its future proposals on the subject."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community legal framework for public-private partnerships (PPPs) does indeed need to be clarified."
"However, this clarification needs to comply with a number of principles: in particular, it must indeed relate only to partnerships between the public and private sectors; it must be based on a distinction between partnerships/contracts on the one hand and partnerships/concessions on the other, respecting the characteristic features of each and therefore avoiding new specific regulations for PPPs; it must not call into question the rules of the negotiated procedure applicable to concessions; it must give the national public authorities the freedom to choose the structure (creation of mixed economy companies or other legal forms, a public structure taking control of a private business, outsourcing, etc.); and, finally, it must ensure that any Community initiative is consistent with the needs of the public services and national choices in that regard."
"None of this is likely to require the adoption of new binding legal documents, but, since it seems inevitable that the European Union will intervene in such matters, let us at least ensure that it does not lead to the creation of one of the bureaucratic machines for which the Europe of Brussels seems to have the secret recipe."
"Public private partnerships are the back door by which the public service sector can penetrate and be handed over to private capital."
"They are the basic route by which European capital can appropriate public infrastructures and services and circumvent the obstacles and problems which it encounters."
"They are also the mechanism for buying off consciences, disorientating the grassroots movement and limiting support for the public sector, by gradually privatising and commercialising services of general interest, especially at local government level."
"The objective is to increase the profits of big business and intensify exploitation."
"Any efforts made in the report for conditional use of PPPs and democratic control of them are simply an alibi and wish list which ultimately facilitate the general and exponential transfer of services to the control of private capital, with damaging consequences for the workers, consequences that appear to be concealed in the report itself."
"The basic point is not how public procurement rules will apply and how franchise contracts will be configured."
"What is important is that the management and transfer of public wealth are accompanied by an attack on workers' rights in order to profit capital."
"We voted against the report and call on the peoples to fight against the full frontal attack by capital and the policy of the ΕU."
"Mr President, I should like to give my explanation of vote on paragraph 4 of the Schroedter report on the posting of workers."
"I support the proposal for a directive on the conditions required for the cruiser vessels providing regular passenger and freight ferry services between Member States."
"I was particularly pleased to see Parliament do so too."
"I do so because of our experience in Ireland with what has happened to the ferry workers and the workers - most of them foreign - who replaced them at Irish Ferries."
"We had a documented situation - and this is quite recent, Mr President - where one particular worker was paid approximately EUR 1 an hour."
"It is worth noting that the Irish minimum wage is in excess of EUR 8 per hour."
"Redundancies were forced, not voluntary, because the redundancy offer on the table involved substantial wage cuts and significant disimprovement in working conditions."
"The vacancies arising from forced redundancies were mostly filled by foreign workers, many of them earning half the minimum wage in Ireland."
"That situation simply exploits all workers, offers no protection, promotes xenophobia and certainly fits the description of the 'race to the bottom'."
"(SK) The basic EU principles on the free movement of persons and services within the European Union forbid any discrimination on grounds of nationality against workers from other Member States in matters of employment, remuneration or any other work-related matters."
"What is the reality of the situation, however?"
"Some Member States are still clinging to the transition periods that apply to the creation of labour markets."
"The Posted Workers Directive is closely related to the Services Directive and, despite an intense and justifiable struggle by MEPs from the new Member States, the European Parliament in the first reading omitted Articles 24 and 25 from the draft Directive on services in the internal market."
"We consider these articles to be crucial, as the basic ideas of the Posted Workers Directive are interpreted differently in different Member States, and workers are generally unaware of their rights as guaranteed by the Directive."
"Regrettably, I have to note that a Commission Guideline cannot remove obstacles to the free movement of labour and services and therefore cannot solve the problems that enterprises and workers in the Member States are experiencing as a result of the inadequate implementation of the Posted Workers Directive."
"I have voted against the Schroedter report because it did not include key amendments aimed at ensuring greater mobility within the EU labour market."
"I am concerned that the position taken by the rapporteur would place unnecessary obstacles in the way of job creation and lead to the failure of our bid to make the internal market in services fully functional."
"Mr President, I thought you might like to know that I voted in favour of the resolution that we adopted on the basis of the Schroedter report from the Employment Committee, because I think its general thrust, which is that we need better application of the existing legislation, rather than new legislation, is the right one at this time."
"However, I think that in due course, once we have evaluated whether we have managed to get this legislation better applied in the near future, we shall need to return to the question of whether the original directive needs amending, updating or improving in other ways."
"in writing. Where companies in one country wish legally to post workers to work in another EU country, such a procedure should be made straightforward rather than burdened by yet more bureaucracy."
"Parliament should not give its approval to practices deemed illegal by the European Court of Justice and disporportionate by the Commission. The Schroedter report on the posting of workers calls for extra bureaucracy such as prior declarations from companies intending to post workers and the requirement to keep detailed time sheet records, etc."
"Such practices are disproportionate, promote protectionism and undermine the services directive. Sending out this message undermines the EU commitment to the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs."
"The Commission text is sensible and practical."
"This socialist report attempts to move the text in the wrong direction."
"In this context UK Conservatives have been unable to support this report."
"in writing. (SV) The report points out that the Posting of Workers Directive is not being applied in full by all the Member States."
"It is thus necessary to adopt a number of measures to enable the Member States genuinely to guarantee minimum standards of protection and conditions of employment for workers temporarily employed in another EU country."
"The June List is in favour of the host country's legislation applying to employees working in other Member States."
"That is one of the things that we have stated clearly in the debates on the Services Directive."
"On the basis of the aforesaid reasoning, I have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole."
"in writing. I wish to give a brief explanation on paragraph 4 in the original text of the Schroedter report on the application of directive 96/71 on the posting of workers."
"I support the proposal for a directive on the conditions required for the crews of vessels providing regular passenger and freight ferry services between Member States."
"I do so because of our experience in Ireland and what happened to Irish workers and the mostly foreign workers who replaced them in Irish ferries."
"We had a documented situation where one particular worker was paid approximately 1 euro per hour as a hairdresser, and it is worth noting that the Irish minimum wage is in excess of 8 euro per hour."
"After the redundancies - and these were forced, not voluntary, because the redundancy offer on the table involved substantial wage cuts and significant disimprovement of workers' conditions - the vacancies arising from the forced redundancies were filled by mostly foreign workers, many on half the minimum wage for Ireland."
"This situation simply exploits workers, offers no protection, promotes xenophobia, and certainly fits the description of the 'race to the bottom'."
"The rapporteur quite legitimately wants to counteract the European Commission's unfortunately chronic liberal excesses."
"It is unacceptable that the Commission has tried, in its communication, to reintroduce the country of origin principle even though it was rejected by Parliament during the vote on the Services Directive."
"I would join with the rapporteur in calling for this directive to be implemented and enforced strictly as soon as possible, and for fines to be introduced."
"The Commission must accept Court of Justice case-law, which establishes that there is a difference between self-employed workers and posted workers, and provides more favourable social standards for the latter."
"Everything that was excluded from the first resolution on the Bolkestein directive is being restored with the European Commission guidelines on the application of Directive 96/71 on the posting of workers, in order to complete the crime against the working class."
"Using the case law of the Court, the Commission is proceeding to overturn even these defective and limited rules of protection acquired by the workers and to abolish all controls on posted workers by the host state, thereby undermining the Collective Work Agreements and the social rights of workers in general."
"The political mouthpieces of European capital (the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and social democrats and liberals) who voted for the Bolkestein directive in the European Parliament in February 2006, with a new unacceptable compromise in the report on the Commission communication, are stuttering out lukewarm recommendations, thereby facilitating the EU's attempts to direct the workers' movement."
"They are yet again serving the ambitions of monopoly groups to increase their profits by overexploiting the working class."
"The escalation of the fight by the working class and of workers in general against the entire anti-grassroots policy of the ΕU is an urgent necessity and the only way to satisfy the contemporary needs of the working-class, grassroots family."
"in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) voted to support the Schroedter report on the Posted Workers Directive as there is a need to improve the implementation of this important legislation to aid the free movement of workers."
"However, the EPLP recognises that Member States have different enforcement mechanisms and there may be differences in, for example, information requirements between Member States."
"Any requirements must be proportionate and justified."
"It is important that this legislation does not add unnecessary burdens to business and interfere with the right of foreign services providers to post workers."
"The Posting of Workers Directive 96/71/EC is an important milestone in European labour legislation."
"The Schroedter report highlights problems with the directive's application, thus responding to a Commission communication - promised back in 2004 but not appearing until April 2006 - in which the Commission has tried, by referring to Court of Justice rulings, to restrict the control measures available to the Member States."
"The Schroedter report redraws the balance between economic liberalisation and social protection."
"Accordingly, certain administrative measures (for example, social inspection of bogus self-employment, collective labour agreements) can no longer be seen as restricting the free movement of employees within the EU's labour markets, an opinion also shared by the Court of Justice."
"The conditions for minimum pay, working conditions and health and safety at work, as well as the principle of the receiving country, are important instruments in preventing social dumping and unfair competition."
"At the same time, they ensure that employees and service providers are treated fairly."
"Thanks to this report, the neo-liberal course which Europe has been steering for years is given a more social dimension."
"The European Parliament must bear its responsibility with regard to the social protection of workers, and that is why I support the Schroedter report."
"in writing. (PL) The Schroedter report on the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive undermines all the valuable provisions enshrined in the European Commission's Guidance on the Posting of Workers, following the compromise reached on the Services Directive."
"From a political point of view, this amounts to backtracking from that hard won compromise."
"The European Commission set out to indicate (in a non-binding document) that there are upper limits to social protection and administrative regulation of the market, and that these cannot be exceeded in the Member States in order to avoid impinging on the principle of freedom to provide services (until the entry into force of the Services Directive, the Posting of Workers Directive remains the main legal basis for the market in services)."
"The report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs undermines all the key provisions of the aforementioned Guidance on the Posting of Workers."
"It defends the outrageous status quo on the services market, where companies from the new Member States are systematically harassed by the administration in order to restrict competition."
"This is a clear and simple case of protectionism, except that it is being implemented in the name of the workers and social protection."
"in writing. - (FR) It is a fact: the directive on the posting of workers has not been properly implemented in some Member States and is not fulfilling its objectives."
"This is due to variations in the interpretation of certain key concepts (worker, minimum wage and subcontracting), the difficulty of monitoring compliance with the directive, and the difficulty of obtaining information, both for workers and for SMEs."
"If we are to have an effective system of cooperation between the Member States, we need to increase the participation of the social partners, provide posted workers with more information on their rights, and provide businesses, particularly SMEs and craft enterprises, with contact partners."
"Finally, it is now vital for the European Commission to look into constructive solutions to prevent and eliminate unfair competition, as illustrated by 'PO box companies' or double posting from one country to another, and the social dumping resulting from the improper posting of workers, in particular by means of 'sham self-employment'."
"This is not about changing the acquis of the directive, but about improving it."
"That is why I voted in favour of Mrs Schroedter's own-initiative report."
"Parliament has observed its annual ritual of ratifying the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy."
"Although the report calls for prudence with regard to raising interest rates and for investment, its key priorities are price stability and budgetary consolidation, which will undermine economic growth, employment and people's buying power on what they earn."
"When what is needed, in contrast with the ECB's fundamental objective, are economic and social concerns, the recipe is more of the same, that is to say, structural reforms in the labour market and in social security, and this comes as no surprise."
"By saying that the system of appointments to the Executive Board worked well and that its members should not be chosen on the basis of nationality, the report overlooks the fact that this system always operates on the basis of rotation between the nationalities of the major EU powers."
"The net effect of which, in a rotating system on the Board of Governors adopted in 2003, is to exclude the small countries from the vote on monetary decisions."
"Parliament has said it is opposed to such a situation, on the grounds of complexity and unfairness, instead proposing a Board of Governors comprising just nine members."
"No prizes for guessing who will be in and who will be out."
"For all these reasons, we are compelled to vote against."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I see it, Mrs Bérès' report is a demonstration that the monetary policy pursued by the ECB is a failure."
"To be honest, the only truly positive points it contains are the profit earned by the Bank and the fact that it has at least succeeded in creating jobs within its own four walls, because its workforce (though God only knows what they do) has increased by 86% in seven years."
"We have now reached the point when, in order to make the euro more popular with the people of Europe, the rapporteur is calling for the banknotes to be changed to replace these images of non-existent bridges with real living beings, landscapes or monuments rooted in the culture of our continent."
"I and my colleagues in the Front National have taken many, many opportunities here to say exactly what we think of this policy, of its disastrous effect on employment and the purchasing power of the European people, of its focus on financial rather than economic objectives, of the harmful absence of an exchange policy, and now of the policy of increasing interest rates, which will further hinder growth."
"Our opinion has not changed."
"in writing. (SV) In a referendum, the Swedish people rejected the introduction of the euro by a broad majority."
"I support that position wholeheartedly."
"The report is redolent of propaganda, to which I cannot give my backing, in favour of the euro."
"Paragraph 26 proposes measures that should be taken to ensure that Europeans do not distance themselves from the euro."
"Paragraph 27 contains propaganda in favour of the Constitution."
"I am opposed to wordings of this type and have voted against the report as a whole."
"in writing. The policy of the Conservative Party in relation to the euro is clear: we are firmly committed to keeping the pound."
"Nevertheless, as the European Union in general and the euro zone in particular are our largest trading partners, we are ever vigilant of the need for the euro's stability, since this directly affects Britain's prosperity."
"We therefore reserve the right to make ourselves heard when we believe that unwarranted political pressure is being directed against the independence of the European Central Bank."
"In the last year, as interest rates have been raised from their historic low, the ECB has been under political attack, and an attempt was made to use this report to interfere in its management."
"Fortunately, the report in its final form respected the ECB's independence, and we have therefore taken the exceptional step of endorsing it to make known our commitment to a sound monetary policy."
"in writing. - (FR) Since the euro was introduced seven years ago, the purchasing power of the people of Europe has fallen considerably."
"In the 'Euro zone', we have seen a real increase in prices for household goods and leisure, and an even clearer trend in housing due to a lack of monitoring of speculative funds."
"It is therefore the working and middle classes who are hardest hit, even without adding excess debt to the mix."
"Economic growth in the 'Euro zone' has even fallen: the GDP volume has gone from an increase of 1.8% in 2004 to an increase of 1.4% in 2005."
"The prospects for 2007-2013 are even more worrying, because the Euro will present a greater risk to European growth once the exchange rate with the dollar becomes too favourable."
"Not only does this bank, with its ultra-European foundations and philosophy, demonstrate a democratic deficit and a certain lack of transparency, but it will not even achieve any of the European Union's economic and social objectives."
"These indicators should make it clear that we should get out of the Euro zone and that the individual nations should regain their competence for economic, social and monetary decision-making in a free Europe where protection and national and Community preference take first place."
"in writing. Although I could agree with the broad thrust of this report, particularly in the area of transparency and scrutiny, there is one issue I believe needs a sensitive touch - hedge funds."
"It is appropriate for all central monetary authorities to maintain a vigilant approach to hedge funds."
"However, the call for research to promote regulation is premature."
"The need to regulate could be disproportionate to any potential threat such funds are perceived to have."
"Time and time again, the ECB argues that price stability is its contribution to job creation and growth."
"In the euro zone, price stability is a reality; in quite a few sectors, indeed, aggregate rates of price increase below two per cent are opening the door to deflation, but as soon as there is the slightest indication of economic recovery in the euro zone, the only way the ECB, with its blind fixation on price stability, knows how to respond is by raising interest rates."
"It does that despite the absence of even the least sign of inflationary tendencies, even though there is no change in the prevalent mass unemployment and wages are rising more slowly than productivity, which, in the long term, cannot do other than lead to serious imbalances in the national economies."
"It does it even though even the capital markets, with their extremely low long-term interest rates, are indicating that they expect the future to bring neither a substantial increase in prices, nor sustainable economic recovery, and a look across the Atlantic reveals that they have little reason to do so."
"As originally drafted, this report was courageous enough to take critical lines. Lamentably, though, little remains of them following the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, although words of criticism would seem necessary to say the least."
"What we really need in Europe is a different monetary policy, one that is guided, not by monetarist dogma, but by social responsibility; one that represents the interests of the vast majority of Europeans rather than only those of the financial sharks and of the European financial elite."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."

"Tibet"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Tibet."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, Tibet has been under Chinese occupation for over 50 years."
"The Chinese authorities have been pursuing a policy of discrimination and persecution, aimed at marginalising Tibetans in their own homeland."
"The Chinese army has recently carried out yet another barbaric killing."
"On this occasion a defenceless Tibetan nun was murdered crossing the border into Nepal."
"China denies that shots were fired at Tibetan refugees attempting to enter Nepal, but the entire incident was caught on film."
"The House cannot remain silent and indifferent to these latest events."
"The policy of force and repression imposed on the people of Tibet by the Chinese authorities can no longer be tolerated."
"I hereby call on the Government of the People's Republic of China to stop violating the human rights of the Tibetan nation and of other minorities."
"I also appeal to the Chinese Government to guarantee that it will respect international law, international human rights standards and freedom of religion."
"Tibet must be granted genuine autonomy and the Tibetan people must be allowed freedom of religion and education."
"I also call on the Government of the People's Republic of China to accelerate the dialogue begun with representatives of the Dalai Lama, and to seek to arrive, without further delay, at a solution to the issue of Tibet that is acceptable to both parties."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, China's representatives described the events of 30 September on that country's border in terms suggesting that they had been attacked by a band of Tibetans and had had - and with difficulty - to defend themselves."
"On this occasion - unlike in many other instances - a video is in existence to clearly demonstrate that the opposite is the case."
"This video shows that the Tibetan refugees did not attack; that, on the contrary, the group of people trying to cross the border was composed of young people, children, nuns and monks."
"The European Union must firmly repudiate the Chinese account of what happened, and demand clarification of the matter."
"It must also demand clarification as to what has become of the children that the Chinese troops took into custody, the present whereabouts and state of these children and refugees and the manner in which such situations on the border are, as a rule, handled."
"We in the European Union must make it abundantly plain that Tibet must be accorded autonomy within China's borders, but real autonomy nonetheless, in line with the 'Middle Way' proposed by the Dalai Lama."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, there has been another incident with fatal consequences at the border between China and Nepal."
"When, on 30 September, a group of Tibetans - all of them unarmed civilians - attempted to flee over the Nangpa Pass to Nepal, Chinese border guards opened fire on them."
"Kelsang Namtso, a seventeen-year-old nun, was killed; many people were wounded, and thirty arrested, among them women and nine children."
"I wish to echo what was said by the previous speakers."
"This tragedy would never have come to light had it not been for a Romanian camera crew that was on the scene by chance and filmed what happened."
"The pictures they took appeared on Dutch television at peak viewing time."
"Despite this documentation, Peking maintains that there were injuries but no deaths and that, moreover, it had been the Tibetans who had opened fire and the Chinese had been obliged to defend themselves."
"We condemn this brutal action on the part of the Chinese security forces and call on the authorities to treat their captives in a humane manner and in compliance with international agreements, for China is a signatory to the UN Charter on the Rights of the Child, which protects minors from arrest and from arbitrary treatment on the part of the state."
"What happened at the Nangpa Pass must be investigated with the minimum possible delay, and those responsible must be called to account for their actions."
"These attacks on defenceless civilians must be put on the agenda for the next EU/China dialogue on human rights."
"I urge those representing the Commission to get an idea for themselves of what is going on, to go to the Tibetan Welfare Centre in Katmandu, as our ad hoc delegation from this House did in July when we went to Nepal, to ask the refugees arriving there about the things they have had to endure, and to do something about it!"
"(Applause)"
"author. - (NL) Mr President, this Parliament is right in once more expressing its indignation, and the unfortunate fact is that I expect it will have to do so many times more."
"The situation in Tibet is getting worse rather than better, and we may actually be to blame for this."
"Even before 1951, the European countries accepted that Tibet should be part of China, even though it was not described as such on maps."
"That is how it stayed when in the 50s, the People's Republic of China actually brought this inhospitable region under its control with military means, and the Dalai Lama fled to India."
"Tibet has now become more easily accessible from China via the world's highest railway line."
"Foreign mountaineers witnessed recently how inhabitants who tried to flee the country were simply gunned down."
"The government, and probably the majority of public opinion in China, consider Tibet, above all, as a region that is still virtually empty and that needs to be colonised by Chinese people from the most densely populated areas."
"Since the Chinese economy is more than ever intertwined with the European economy, Europe has a powerful lever."
"The question is whether we are prepared to use this lever."
"Oppression will persist if we do not bring any pressure to bear."
"author. - Mr President, China's Communist occupation of Tibet is a long-standing scourge on democracy and an open wound on the principles of justice and freedom."
"Time and again, we have strongly condemned the thoroughly indefensible and brutal way the Chinese regime has been treating a small peace-loving nation, isolated at the roof of the world."
"In the latest incident, China's occupation forces opened fire on a group of unarmed, defenceless civilians who were attempting in desperation to flee their country through the glacial pass at Nangpa, situated at a height of almost 19 000 feet."
"The group included many women and children."
"A 17-year old nun was killed; a 20-year old was seriously injured; some individuals are missing and 29 people, including 14 children, were arrested."
"Some succeeded in escaping to neighbouring Nepal."
"Luckily and thankfully, the incident was witnessed by a number of foreign mountaineers, whose independent and trustworthy accounts, including a video, utterly contradicted the ridiculous lies about what happened put forward in an official statement by the Chinese authorities."
"We in Europe have a lot to say when it comes to condemning actions of totalitarian and oppressive regimes, but in practice the severity of our words is not matched by our deeds."
"Apart from being regrettable, this is also highly hypocritical, in my view."
"The colonial-style occupation of Tibet by China, as, indeed, any colonial occupation of one country by another, has to end forthwith."
"To demonstrate that we mean what we say, we must take tangible measures against China."
"Yes, we have an arms embargo against that country, but it has little effect."
"What would really be effective is if we had a trade import ban on China; that would really cause headaches to the Communist leaders in Beijing and would lead to some sensible responses to our demands for freedom for Tibet."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it is clear that bold action is needed to improve the human rights situation in China."
"This recent incident gives us a clear reason why that should be a priority for the European Union."
"I find it absolutely appalling that the Chinese state media Xinhua reported the shooting as self-defence, while video footage clearly shows the Tibetan refugees were shot from a distance and in the back."
"No force, threat or resistance was offered to the Chinese border guards."
"None of the refugees had a weapon of any kind, not even a knife."
"I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency and draw attention to its work in the human rights dialogue."
"Last week, on 20 October, the Finnish Presidency issued an official statement condemning the incident."
"I would like to thank the Presidency for that."
"Finally, as indicated in the joint resolution on Tibet, we must continue to encourage high-level talks between the Dalai Lama and the Government of China."
"I would like to reiterate that this is the only way to find a peaceful and sustainable solution for real autonomy for the Tibetan nation."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, despite the fact that official relations between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama were restored in 2002, human rights continue to be infringed in Tibet on a regular basis."
"It is estimated that every year 2 500 people decide to escape from repression and undertake the dangerous journey to Nepal, lasting several days."
"The acts of violence perpetrated against unarmed civilians have given rise to particular concern."
"These acts include the shots fired at refugees by Chinese border guards in the Nangpa La pass in September of this year."
"The group of fugitives concerned was attempting to cross the Tibetan border and included women, children and monks."
"To date, the Chinese authorities have not accepted responsibility for this incident, in which one person was killed."
"The fate of several children detained by the military is still unknown."
"It is incumbent upon international institutions to take decisive and effective action to compel the Government of the People's Republic of China to put an end to its repression of the people of Tibet, its inhumane treatment of prisoners, its use of torture and its extra-judicial executions."
"We appeal once again, from the floor of this House, for fundamental human rights to be respected in Tibet."
"These rights include freedom of expression and association."
"We also call for a genuine dialogue between both parties, aimed at achieving understanding and respect for the religious, political and cultural rights of the Tibetan people."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, in the two and a half years that I have been an MEP, this must the third time, or perhaps there have been more, that we have had to discuss human rights violations in Tibet, and I fear that it will not be the last."
"The difference this time compared to previous occasions, however, is that we have filmed evidence demonstrating that the Chinese authorities' attempts to deny these events are deceitful and that, at the same time, the Xinhua news agency's attempts to show that this action was in self-defence is entirely without foundation."
"We are therefore dealing with an event that clearly requires investigation, as other speakers have said."
"I agree with that and I support it, but, furthermore, it also deserves to be treated as a fundamental issue within the framework of European Union-China dialogue."
"I would insist that this is not the first time, but it is really becoming rather sad that, since we have the opportunity to hold this dialogue with China, and on the eve of the 2008 Olympic Games, we do not stress over and over again that the Tibet situation could be resolved if there were truly a little political will on the part of the Chinese authorities. So far we have not seen any such will."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are today debating human rights in China."
"We are doing so in the wake of a tragic and terrifying border incident."
"On this occasion, people throughout the world were able to see for themselves how China deals with defenceless individuals who do not present any kind of threat to the Communist authorities."
"These poor people are simply shot at without compunction."
"The incident we are currently debating, and which has rightly triggered discussion of this subject in the European Parliament, reminds us of a bitter truth."
"Human rights are being systematically violated in China in almost every aspect of life."
"The human, economic and religious rights of the citizens of the People's Republic of China are being infringed."
"Unfortunately, we have to admit the sad and unpalatable truth that, all too often, the governments of individual European Union Member States remain hypocritically silent about what is happening in China."
"The same applies to the European Union institutions."
"If the common values that unite us in this House and across Europe really are common, it is incumbent on us to call, loudly and clearly, for human rights to be respected in the People's Republic of China."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I am very glad that Parliament is showing such concern for the people of Tibet."
"I do not question the genuineness of it, but I do question the genuineness of the way in which this Parliament acts on such concerns."
"Today in the budget vote we rejected three amendments that would have removed EU development funding from government and organisational programmes that included coercive abortion, involuntary sterilisation and infanticide."
"Why do Tibetans try to escape from China?"
"It is because of these very barbaric practices, in addition to religious persecution and political persecution."
"This is what blights the life of all minorities and conquered peoples within the territory that China now claims to rule."
"I ask you, Commissioner - and I would like an answer - what part does our development aid play in this kind of suffering?"
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying to Mrs Sinnott that it is clouding the issue to raise points like that, which are entirely separate from what we are discussing here today."
"Approximately 2500 Tibetans - possibly more - annually flee across the border from the Himalayas into exile."
"They are certainly escaping from the brutality of China's occupation, but it is not necessarily as Mrs Sinnott suggests."
"It is difficult to know how many are caught or shot by the Chinese border authorities, because the allegations have generally remained uninvestigated."
"This particularly horrendous shooting incident on 30 September is in violation of the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law-enforcement officials."
"It is interesting that there are guidelines as to when law-enforcement officials can shoot, but these require that they should not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury."
"Those of us who have seen the video clips of this incident know that the situation was not one involving grave threats to life."
"It appeared to be an unprovoked attack."
"That is why the motion for a resolution before us is very important, in particular paragraph 8, which urges the Council and the Commission to reiterate their position regarding dialogue between the appropriate authorities."
"That is a position we must echo this afternoon: dialogue to resolve this situation."
"(PL) Mr President, the resolution we are to vote on today concerns the events of 30 September, when Chinese policemen shot at a group of Tibetan refugees seeking freedom beyond the People's Republic of China."
"It was certainly not the first incident of its kind."
"It was unusual, however, in that this barbaric behaviour was caught on film."
"Television and the Internet enabled us all, along with millions of others around the world, to see for ourselves what the Chinese policy on Tibet actually amounts to."
"The fate of the Tibetan people is particularly unfortunate because they are one of the most peace-loving nations in the world."
"The Dalai Lama is not demanding independence for Tibet."
"The Tibetans are prepared to exist within the framework laid down in the Chinese constitution."
"How can it be possible to shoot at such people?"
"How can they be persecuted and killed, simply because of their desire for a small measure of freedom and for the protection of their cultural heritage?"
"Can this tragic course of events be halted?"
"It can be, if orders are issued to ban the shooting of people fleeing from a country they do not wish to live in."
"This happened in the past, rather closer to home, on the border between East and West Germany."
"Great nations cannot and must not base their authority on the massacre of defenceless refugees."
"(PL) Mr President, much has been said in the House today about the situation in Tibet."
"The Chinese authorities claim to respect Tibet's autonomy, but their actions tell quite a different story."
"I would like to take this opportunity to draw Parliament's attention to the report by Human Rights Watch published on 9 October 2006."
"This report mentions how an Internet blog created by Woeser, a leading Tibetan intellectual, was shut down."
"The blog was one of the most interesting political and cultural developments in contemporary China."
"It told the truth about the situation in Tibet, describing the damage to the environment and to Tibetan culture."
"Woeser is one of the most distinguished female intellectuals in contemporary China, and her blog gave a true account of current events in Tibet."
"We simply cannot tolerate a situation in which the Chinese authorities claim to have granted autonomy to a particular province, whereas in practice they are closing down leading intellectual online blogs."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Members of Parliament regarding the recent shooting by China's People's Liberation Army of Tibetan refugees at the border between the People's Republic of China and Nepal, the subsequent death of one of them and the imprisonment of some of those refugees."
"The matter has been formally taken up by the European Union in the framework of the last session of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Beijing on 19 October, as rightly mentioned by the honourable Member from Finland."
"On that occasion, the European Union refuted the claim by China that the shooting had been in self-defence, urged the Chinese Government to undertake a thorough investigation of the incident and insisted that the imprisoned refugees be treated in compliance with international humanitarian standards."
"More generally, the Commission is very concerned about the human rights situation in Tibet, and in particular the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people."
"This issue has been regularly addressed during the bilateral dialogue on human rights as well as at the highest level, during bilateral summits."
"The European Union is particularly concerned about the number of Tibetans from religious backgrounds who are in prison for political reasons, and has repeatedly asked for their immediate release."
"Several of these people are on the list of individual cases regularly submitted to the Chinese authorities on the margins of these dialogues."
"The Commission believes that China's policy in Tibet is not consistent with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"The early ratification by China of this covenant ranks among the top priorities of the European Union in the field of human rights and we have left China in no doubt as to the need to fully respect the spirit of that covenant, once it has been signed and even before it is ratified."
"As part of its overall policy vis-à-vis Tibet, the European Union has consistently taken the view that establishing a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question of Tibet."
"We have therefore welcomed and closely monitored the five rounds of talks so far held between the special envoys of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government."
"The Commission urges both sides to continue this dialogue and use these talks to try to make substantive progress."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at the end of the debates."
"2."
"Case against Rios Montt"
"The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on the case against Rios Montt."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, unlike Tibet, we have not often talked about Guatemala in this House, at least since I have been here."
"Nevertheless, it is a small Central America country that has suffered very harsh repression for many years, a brutal dictatorship, and the people responsible for it have so far escaped any form of punishment."
"The Spanish High Court has issued an international arrest warrant and what we are doing here is supporting the extradition of General Ríos Montt, the person bearing the greatest responsibility, and of five other generals, some of whom were de facto Presidents, that is, dictators, during that thirty-year period in which 200 000 people were murdered, 45 000 disappeared and a tenth of the population was displaced; the enormous majority of the displaced population - 83% - belonged to the Mayan community."
"There have also been European victims, however, Belgian and Spanish, particularly priests."
"I believe, Mr President, that just as we in this House supported the extradition of Pinochet and of Fujimori, it is right for us now to support the extradition of General Ríos Montt and his accomplices, and unanimously if possible."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, I naturally agree with what my colleague, Mr Yáñez-Barnuevo, has just said, because ten years after the peace agreements in Guatemala were signed, a country that has aspirations to be a member of the Security Council and with which an association agreement is being negotiated, has yet to implement the global agreement on human rights."
"That is truly worrying in a country which, as has been pointed out, has been the victim of dictatorships, genocides, crimes against humanity, and - most seriously - the people responsible for them are still lording it around the country and around the world unpunished."
"We must therefore welcome, as we do in this Resolution, the fact that on 7 July the Spanish High Court issued this international arrest warrant."
"This will to a certain extent make it possible to begin to put an end to this impunity and genuinely make the people responsible pay for what they did."
"We should do more than that, however."
"We must also call for effective cooperation from the Guatemalan authorities in this field."
"We must naturally ask them, within this context of increasing cooperation, to be as cooperative as possible, so that, on the basis of this international ruling, they can contribute to the arrest, return and trial of these people."
"We must also ask for the cooperation of the banking authorities, which have been holding the profits and wealth that those people have been enjoying, in order to ensure that the latter assume their civil and financial responsibilities."
"I would like finally to say that it would be very useful for Europol and Interpol to be able to cooperate in this work as much as they can."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Guatemala has a long and bloody history of violence behind it, and one certainly must not be partial in one's judgment when considering it, for, while there were terrible dictatorships and repressions, there was also an equally cruel and bloodthirsty revolutionary movement in the shape of the Tupamaros."
"Over three decades have passed since the eyes of all Germany were fixed on this part of Central America, when the German ambassador Karl Graf Spreti - whose son is a member of my staff - was abducted and murdered."
"Karl Graf Spreti was one of the great men who prepared the way for Europe; he was also a member of the German Bundestag for my party, but it was as a diplomat and an innocent man that he was taken away and put to a cruel death in the primeval forest. Since then, the country has gone through a period of terrible crises."
"It is for that reason that we must be very careful, but also very firm, in supporting the peace process there by unambiguously denouncing those who, while in positions of power, had recourse to violence, as well as those who misused the word 'freedom' as a justification for doing the same thing."
"Guatemala has also, repeatedly, been the scene of gruesome acts of genocide, and it is cause for gratitude that the resolution does not mince its words about the expulsion of some 10% of the Maya, a people with an ancient culture, and the murder of tens of thousands of them."
"We also need to seize this opportunity to tighten up our definition of genocide."
"It is said repeatedly that the term 'genocide' may be used only when a group is systematically exterminated."
"That is not so: it is also genocide to deprive an ethnic grouping of its basis for existence by robbing it of its homeland by means of expulsion and murderous violence."
"That has happened to many ethnic groups, not only to the Maya but also to smaller groupings in Guatemala."
"There is no statute of limitations applicable to such crimes, and that is why we must leave no stone unturned in bringing those responsible for them to account rather than turning a blind eye and moving on to the next item on the agenda."
"author. -"
"(The speaker spoke Irish)"
"During the 1980s and 1990s, Guatemala was constantly in the international news."
"Three decades of conflict and a decade-long peace process ensured that people all over the world, including those here in the European Parliament, remained informed."
"Colleagues have mentioned some of the stark figures from that period: 200 000 people killed, thousands more displaced, entire villages and communities destroyed forever."
"The Government's own investigation confirmed that 93% of all killings were the responsibility of the Government's own armed forces."
"The military dictatorship of Rios Montt in the early 1980s was singled out as one of the conflict's most brutal periods."
"There was great optimism after the signing of the peace agreements but, ten years later, the reality has changed very little for people in that country, where 80% of the population live in poverty."
"Ten years on, not only have the perpetrators of the policy of genocide carried out in the 1980s not been prosecuted, they continue to play prominent roles in public life."
"The victims and survivors of the conflict have received neither adequate financial support nor recognition of their suffering."
"Indeed, the vast majority of the disappeared have not been found."
"Many of those displaced have yet to be returned to their original homes."
"I welcome the demand in the resolution, which seeks the support of the Government of Guatemala, the other Central American governments, the Spanish Government and the Government of the United States, for the European order of detention to be facilitated, with reference to the international order of detention, so that those mentioned in the warrant issued on 7 July 2005 - all of whom are charged with crimes of genocide, including Rios Montt - can be brought to justice."
"I would also urge Members to be cognisant of the fact that very little has changed for people."
"For the majority of Guatemalans, conditions today differ little from those of 1996."
"The peace dispensation promised a demilitarisation of society and much-needed land and tax reform, the aim of which was to build a more just and equal society."
"Surely today we should remember that, even if Guatemala is not so often in the news, and we should continue to demand and press for an equal and just society."
"I therefore welcome and stress the resolution's commitment to the principle of universal justice and the protection of human rights."
"Our experience in Ireland has taught us that peace can only be built on justice and respect for the rights of all."
"I would explain to our friends in the visitors' gallery, who may have been surprised for a short while at the lack of interpretation, that it was because Mrs de Brún was speaking in Irish, which is not yet an official working language of Parliament, but which will be as from 1 January."
"author. - Mr President, Commissioner, it is very sad and shameful to contemplate the fact that, in the vast majority of cases, those who commit despicable and atrocious crimes against humanity, including genocide, remain unpunished."
"In fact, most of these callous murderers of largely innocent, defenceless civilians never face justice."
"It is even more shameful that in reality many such vicious sub-human criminals not only escape the arm of the law, but enjoy a high standard of living and important political status."
"Numerous examples of this disgraceful state of affairs can be found all over the world, throughout history and across most political systems and ideologies, which only goes to prove that, in reality, true administration of justice is a summer night's dream and a fallacy."
"We all know it applies to our world, but most of us are too afraid to admit it publicly."
"The situation in Guatemala's recent history fully bears out what I have just said."
"In the period from 1960 to 1996, more than 200 000 people were murdered in state-sponsored violence orchestrated by a notorious army general turned dictator, Efraín Rios Montt, and assisted by a string of infamous top officials and high-ranking military officers."
"None of these characters was ever punished."
"Rios Montt remains in politics today as the leader of the Guatemalan Republican Front, one of the nation's most powerful political parties."
"He served as President of the National Congress as recently as two years ago."
"We should of course note that Rios Montt was trained by the United States, and his rise to power was accomplished through CIA involvement and with the full political backing and financial assistance of successive US governments."
"Honestly, how pathetic can US foreign policy be?"
"Sometimes one wonders."
"Has the US State Department not had any straight-thinking, sensible people with average IQ working in it over the last few decades?"
"I urge you to support this resolution, which aims at supporting the present attempts by the Guatemalan authorities to bring to justice Rios Montt, as well as a number of other despicable criminals."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the armed conflict in Guatemala lasted for decades, and that period saw terrible crimes committed against humanity, with 200 000 people being murdered, 45 000 taken away from their homes, and some indigenous communities wiped out altogether."
"The peace agreement will be ten years old in December this year."
"The Global Agreement on Human Rights has still not yet been put into effect in Guatemala, and the victims of the genocide have received no compensation, whether material or symbolic."
"The warrant issued by the Spanish Supreme Court in July 2006 for the arrest of Efrain Rios Montt is a sign of hope that the culprits will no longer be allowed to get away unpunished."
"We call on the Guatemalan authorities to cooperate unconditionally; they must do everything in their power to investigate crimes against humanity, and the country's ex-dictator and the other seven accused must be arrested and handed over."
"Mr President, as Guatemala is preparing to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signature of the peace accords that put an end to 36 years of civil war, the Commission shares the opinion that everything possible should be done to bring justice to those having suffered human rights violations during the darkest hours of the conflict."
"In that respect, the Commission takes note of the legal proceedings instituted against former military and political officials for their alleged role at that time."
"The Commission once again calls upon all parties to wholeheartedly support the quest for truth and justice and to fight impunity where it prevails."
"The Commission welcomes the willingness of the present government, albeit timid, to recognise the state's responsibility for past violations of human rights and to secure compensation for victims."
"It furthermore acknowledges the country's commitment to consolidate the implementation of the peace accords, as confirmed by the Congress in August 2005 with a vote on a framework law establishing procedures and mechanisms to secure the effective attainment of the objectives set ten years ago."
"Finally, the Commission praises the work of the Human Rights Ombudsman and welcomes the establishment in July 2005 of an Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"Sadly, however, the country continues to be marred by the impunity characterising not just past but also present crimes."
"This affects all citizens, including human rights defenders who are notably involved in assisting civil war victims."
"The government agrees that this situation is not acceptable, but still has to take decisive action to reinforce the rule of law."
"A European programme is currently offering support to the judiciary, but more public funds and structural reforms will be required if lasting improvements are to be made."
"The Commission is also eagerly awaiting the establishment of a 'Commission of Investigation into Armed Groups and Clandestine Security Apparatus'."
"We hope the Guatemalan Congress will provide the necessary support for this, as well as for the pending ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."
"The Commission believes the European Union should pursue dialogue with Guatemala on key issues relating to the implementation of the peace accords, particularly as the country gears up for the general elections scheduled for the end of 2007."
"The Constitutional Court has, by the way, recently declared General Rios Montt ineligible for those elections following the coup he led in 1982."
"The issue of impunity for past and present crimes should be central in this context."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at the end of the debates."
"3."
"Uzbekistan"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Uzbekistan."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, much has been said in this House concerning the situation in Uzbekistan."
"The situation is not improving at all."
"In fact, we are witnessing increasing repression."
"The latest Human Right Watch report, published on 3 October 2006, describes the situation in detail."
"Nobody has yet been called to account for the massacre in Andijan, criticism is still being silenced, and freedom of religion infringed."
"There is still no cooperation with international institutions with respect to human rights and fundamental rights."
"Two journalists, Djamshid Karimov and Ulugbek Khaidarov, disappeared in Uzbekistan in September."
"Both men were well known for their independence and for their criticism of the regime."
"Eventually, Mr Karimov was found in a psychiatric hospital, and Mr Khaidarov in a prison."
"At the same time, the European Parliament's strategy should be directed towards assisting Uzbekistan's return to the community of democratic countries intent on reforming themselves."
"We must not take any action that could interfere with that course of events."
"author. - Mr President, unusually for us, sanctions are currently in place against Uzbekistan."
"Sanctions should be used sparingly and only as a last resort, but we in this House should not be afraid to call for them and indeed to see them implemented, as they are the only real weapon for encouraging internal change within that country."
"It is important for the EU to speak with one voice and this motion for a resolution seeks to do just that."
"First, we need to agree on a reality check."
"In recital C we note the fact that: 'the Government of Uzbekistan has not addressed the conditions the Council set out when sanctions were applied'."
"So any moves to lift the sanctions currently in place would be counter-intuitive and bizarre."
"It would be a bizarre incentive or reward for, in effect, ignoring us."
"And yet, as we say in recital B, the General Affairs and External Relations Council is expected to consider on 13 November whether it will extend the sanctions adopted last year."
"We understand there are genuine moves afoot to lift the sanctions."
"My group disagrees with that and we hope the House will follow us."
"We believe that the sanctions should be extended and widened, particularly in the light of Uzbekistan's continued refusal to allow an independent inquiry into the events in Andijan."
"We would like to see provision in paragraph 2 for the sanctions to be extended, with a targeted visa ban on specific key individuals."
"That will underline our growing frustration at the lack of progress without any detriment to the Uzbek people themselves."
"It is important that we keep up the pressure."
"We hope that the House will not lose its nerve."
"While I have no doubt that the Commissioner shares our concerns, we hope that she will match our commitment."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important that this House, rather than averting its eyes from violations of human rights anywhere in the world, should take action in response to them, and the dreadful things that happened in Andijan in Uzbekistan in May 2005 were another case in point; we are a democratic institution and, as such, must not allow human rights to be trampled underfoot anywhere in the world."
"Nor, too, however, must we allow cooperation between this House and other parliaments to put diplomatic relations at risk."
"When considering the present state of affairs in Uzbekistan, what has gone on there in the past must also be taken into account, and it is on that alone that this resolution must be founded."
"Last month, the delegation for relations with the countries of Central Asia - of which I am a member - planned to travel to Uzbekistan. That nothing came of this plan was not down to any lack of cooperation on the part of the Uzbek authorities, but rather to the lack of interest in any such trip on the part of sufficient Members of this House."
"One consequence of this is that we have not been able to form our own impressions of the current state of play in Uzbekistan as regards human rights, democratisation and the establishment of an independent judiciary, and we have been obliged, instead, to rely on information from third parties."
"Do not misunderstand me: I, too, take the view that human rights and attempts at democratisation often suffer repression in Uzbekistan, and that serious thought must therefore be given to keeping sanctions in place, particularly the embargo on weaponry, but I do not think that extending the sanctions to include such things as the denial of an EU visa to the President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, would do anything to get us closer to what we want."
"To do such things would amount to breaking off diplomatic relations, and that cannot be what we have in mind."
"Nothing happening at the present time would justify such a forceful political response, and so I must ask you, as a matter of the greatest urgency, to endorse the amendment I have tabled and vote for its adoption."
"Should I fail in this attempt at a compromise, I will end up having to vote against the resolution."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, 'Reporters without borders', in their report, now rank Uzbekistan at number 158 - interestingly enough, below such countries as Belarus and Russia."
"The state of human rights in Uzbekistan has been a frequent topic of debate in this House, particularly after what happened in Andijan."
"The really hot question now is 'what will the European Union's response be?'"
"We have said that, if there are to be sanctions, they have to apply especially to the movement of weapons and troops."
"It is vitally important that the German military base, at Termes in Uzbekistan, should be closed down, for, if sanctions are not actually to be complied with, a major exception must be made, and so it is for that reason that we see this as the litmus test for our human rights policy, not least here in this House."
"It is for that reason that we have tabled this amendment to the effect that the German military base in Termes must be closed down."
"The base is used by all NATO Member States, not least by those that are also Member States of the EU, and must therefore be closed down."
"author. - Mr President, Uzbekistan is an authoritarian republic, previously part of the Soviet Union, which, while struggling for economic and political stability, has been fiercely violating the human rights of its citizens."
"The memory of the Andijan massacre in May 2005 is very much alive in our minds today, especially since the numerous requests by the UN, the EU and others for an independent investigation appear to have fallen on deaf ears."
"Furthermore, despite some recent attempts to improve the human rights situation in the country, the situation relating to civil liberties is still profoundly anachronistic."
"According to credible NGO human rights watchdogs, such as Amnesty International, the most disturbing human rights violations concern torture, arbitrary arrests and restriction of religious freedom and freedom of speech, with members of religious organisations, journalists, human rights activities and political activists, including members of the banned opposition parties, being the main targets."
"Despite existing sanctions, the rate and extent of democratic reforms in the country is exceedingly low and distressingly limited."
"Therefore, in this motion for a resolution we call on the Council not only to renew existing sanctions for a further year but also to expand the sanctions to include EU visa bans and the freezing of assets held in the EU by a number of top officials in the Uzbekistani Government."
"We do this with regret, but we feel that we have been left with no other option than to be tough in order to be kind."
"We very much hope and wish that the Uzbekistani Government will understand our resolve when it comes to issues of human rights and will quickly rectify the large democratic deficits still existing in its country."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, little has changed in Uzbekistan since the last European Parliament resolution on the situation in that country and the republics of Central Asia."
"The Government of Uzbekistan has still not agreed to an independent inquiry into the events that took place on 13 May 2005 in Andijan, where troops sent in by President Karimov crushed a popular uprising."
"Several hundred people died in that bloodbath, which the government referred to as a terrorist rebellion."
"Most independent journalists and human rights defenders are being intimidated by the security services and some have been exiled from the country."
"The recent disappearance of Djamshid Karimov and Ulugbek Khaidarov has caused great concern about the future development of Uzbekistan."
"Mr Karimov and Mr Khaidarov are said to be the last remaining journalists in the country who have dared to write critically about the government and its leader for the last 17 years."
"When these two men were located a few days later, one had received a prison sentence for blackmail, and the other had been committed to a psychiatric hospital."
"Civil society in Uzbekistan is demanding a more open society, where personal freedoms and human rights are respected."
"The people of Uzbekistan would also like to see real progress along the road to democracy."
"The war on terror must be fought without infringing international conventions."
"It must never serve as a pretext for annihilating the political opposition, riding roughshod over human rights or restricting civil liberties."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, 15 years after the fall of the empire of evil, which is what the Soviet Union most definitely was, the situation has become fairly clear."
"Only those former Soviet republics which decided to build a future according to the democratic Western model can guarantee that they will create a civil society on their territory and respect human rights."
"By contrast, those countries that sought shelter under Moscow's protective wings and where governments headed by former Communist leaders remain in power, are giving us cause for alarm and great concern."
"However, I would like to draw attention to the fact that we tend to discuss individual cases."
"Today, we are specifically discussing one of the many tragedies that have taken place in Uzbekistan."
"It is surely time, indeed high time, to draw attention to the fact that the only reason why such events are taking place is because these regimes can count on Moscow's assent."
"They are protected by the Russian leadership and are therefore able to act in this way rather than any other."
"It really is high time we said no to all of this."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Even in a region trampled on by autocratic dictatorships, the Andijan massacre has managed to put Karimov's Uzbekistan out on its own."
"The government says that 169 people died, whereas the opposition puts the figure at 745."
"Regardless of the numbers involved, those responsible needed to be identified and brought to justice. The EU has done this, albeit only partially and half a year late."
"In November, the Council adopted an arms embargo and other restrictive sanctions."
"A year on, and how have matters developed?"
"The repression has worsened, with the work of the NGOs and the journalists having been stifled."
"In March, the High Commissioner for Refugees was expelled from the country and, worse still, between November and July, in an act of rare hypocrisy, over 250 people were summarily convicted for causing the May massacre, in a series of grotesque, media-circus trials."
"All of this demonstrates that it is not only vital that we extend the existing sanctions for a further 12 months, but also that we deepen them by freezing financial transactions and European visas for the main Tashkent torturers, and broaden them to include the ringleader, President Karimov."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly right and necessary to monitor the implementation of human rights, whether one is talking about Tibet, Guatemala or Uzbekistan, because these are inalienable rights in the era of globalisation."
"In view of the discussions and initiatives promoted and taken forward by the European Parliament, however, I believe that this body would prefer to deal with human rights violations and related problems anywhere in the world except in the territory of the EU itself."
"This leaves us completely indifferent, for example, to the appalling situation of the so-called Russian non-citizens in Latvia, child labour and child prostitution in some Member States, the terrible state of the media and the criminalisation and persecution of the Left in the Czech Republic, and the unparalleled growth of poverty and far-right extremism in Germany."
"All the more reason, perhaps, to tackle Uzbekistan and Tibet, or perhaps Belarus and China and the like."
"I would venture to say, however, that the conservative majority is deliberately and cleverly turning Parliament into a kind of tame guard dog that is happy to remain on its own side of the fence and bark at the neighbours."
"We should always focus primarily on the problems affecting the EU Member States."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, firstly, I have to say that I was completely appalled by the statement the representative of the far Left in the European Parliament has just made."
"The situation in Uzbekistan simply cannot be compared to the situation in any European country."
"A great many countries certainly do experience problems, but to draw a comparison with the situation in Uzbekistan, where people are dying and being persecuted for their political views, is quite outrageous."
"I am saddened to discover that, when it comes to discussing issues such as the defence of human rights, there are individuals in this House who break the consensus on the defence and promotion of fundamental European values such as human rights, democracy and freedom of expression."
"The consensus ought to prevail from the Left to the Right of the House."
"I shall support the resolution in which we call for an extension of the sanctions against the regime in Uzbekistan, as the European Union is more than a political body bound together by common economic interests."
"I firmly believe in the European Union as a community of values and, as such, the Union must set an unequivocal example by condemning all infringements of human rights, regardless of where they take place."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, exactly a year ago we were also debating the situation in Uzbekistan, in the wake of the bloody suppression of a demonstration against President Karimov's totalitarian regime and its infringement of human rights."
"Uzbekistan's independence is also constantly compromised by the bitter struggle for influence between the great powers."
"In spite of the sanctions imposed, and despite successive Parliament resolutions, human rights defenders continue to be imprisoned and tortured in Uzbekistan."
"So too are witnesses to the truth, and we all know that truth cannot be suppressed by decisions, laws or prison sentences of any sort."
"The heavy hand of the regime is felt not only by representatives of the opposition but also by the whole nation, as it struggles for independence and democratic change."
"Women are particularly affected."
"Although they have been granted the right to divorce within the framework of equal opportunities, they very often have to deal with everyday problems on their own, having to provide for their children and families single-handedly."
"We obviously call for respect for human rights and support for the resolution."
"(PL) Mr President, a single minute is simply not enough time to discuss infringements of human rights in Uzbekistan."
"We can only draw attention to the fact that an independent inquiry into the events in Andijan 18 months ago has yet to take place."
"These events led the authorities in Tashkent to declare war on independent reporters and defenders of human rights."
"According to the UN, torture is still being used in Uzbekistan."
"It is true that Islamic extremism is gathering strength in Uzbekistan, but this cannot be used as an excuse for violating human rights."
"Uzbekistan plays a leading role in Central Asia, which is all the more reason for demanding that it respects the rules for democracy, the rule of law, and human rights."
"Several thousand kilometres away from Uzbekistan lies a similar country, which is also unceremoniously violating human rights."
"This country is Belarus."
"Visa sanctions have been imposed on both Uzbekistan and Belarus."
"Extending these sanctions seems to be a sensible decision and deserves our support."
"Perhaps this so-called visa blackmail will enable Uzbekistan to understand what European standards are all about."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, my being here at all is something I owe to the Uzbek people, for my grandfather - an Austrian soldier in the First World War - was captured by the Russians and it was only thanks to Uzbek hospitality that he survived the cold winter around Tashkent."
"While we all, I believe, have deep sympathy for the Uzbek people, it is for precisely that reason that we condemn the suppression of human rights there and lament the fact that a regime is in power there that does not in the least meet our standards where human rights are concerned."
"I would like to see a quite forthright denunciation of these violations of human rights, and I also want to see the sanctions extended."
"However, I regard additional bans on entry of the kind called for in paragraph 2 as worthless."
"I do not believe we can sort out problems by grovelling to Mr Putin at one summit and perhaps inviting the Chinese President to the next one, while taking it out on the mini-Putins and tinpot tyrants, and so I recommend that we adopt reasonable standards. Extend the sanctions?"
"I say 'yes' to that. Denounce human rights violations?"
"'Yes' to that too. But as for spending part of Thursday afternoon imposing travel bans on every Head of State you can think of, well, that, I have to say, I regard as demagogy rather than credible policy-making."
"(DE) Mr President, it is a matter of common knowledge that, on Thursday afternoons, we impose absolutely nothing."
"All this House does in response to the various human rights issues around the world is to make demands of one sort or another."
"By means of this resolution today, we are demanding of the Council that it extend the policy of sanctions and broaden it to include certain areas that have already been discussed."
"The Government of Uzbekistan still refuses to allow an independent investigation of the deaths in Andijan of the kind repeatedly demanded in the past by several international institutions and still called for by them now."
"What Uzbekistan should be doing is working towards that sort of independent investigation, together with the OSCE and the UN."
"The EU's relations with Uzbekistan are a matter of great importance to us, but they must be founded on respect for democracy, for the rule of law and for human rights."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, although one and a half years have passed, the mass killings at Andijan on 13 May 2005 remain fresh in all our memories."
"The Uzbek authorities have rejected international demands for an independent enquiry and no credible investigation of the killings has taken place."
"The trials of those persons who took part in the demonstrations that led to the killings have been condemned by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights as patently unfair."
"Subsequent developments also give little ground for optimism."
"Torture is reported to remain widespread."
"No international body has been able to obtain access to refugees returned to Uzbekistan."
"Uzbekistan refuses to cooperate with United Nations Special Procedures."
"Civil society and human rights defenders are subject to constant harassment."
"Indeed, many human rights defenders have been imprisoned."
"The Commission has noted with particular concern that several prominent human rights activists have been sentenced to several years' imprisonment, while Mukhtabar Todjibaeva remains in detention."
"We are aware of many similar cases."
"Despite this bleak picture, nothing is to be gained by cutting off all channels of communication with Uzbekistan."
"As Honourable Members are aware, in response to the Andijan killings, the European Union adopted sanctions against Uzbekistan, namely as mentioned here earlier, an arms embargo, a travel ban for those individuals responsible for the Andijan killings and the suspension of technical meetings with Uzbekistan."
"A decision whether to prolong or extend the scope of these sanctions must be taken by 14 November."
"In order to enable Member States to obtain a full and comprehensive picture of the situation in Uzbekistan, a Cooperation Council will be held with Uzbekistan at the beginning of November."
"Moreover, this Cooperation Council will provide an opportunity for the European Union to raise directly with the Uzbek authorities, at ministerial level, our many concerns on Andijan and its aftermath."
"In the light of this Cooperation Council, the Member States will take their decision on the possible prolongation or extension of the sanctions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at the end of the debates, that is to say in a moment."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law"

"- Before the vote on paragraph 2"
"Mr President, in my oral amendment, I suggest deleting the first part of paragraph 2 of the joint resolution on Uzbekistan."
"Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?"
"(DE) Mr President, I beg your leave to point out that we have, in fact, tabled an amendment to paragraph 2, so it needs to be voted on before the original is, even though the original has been the subject of an oral amendment."
"We first need to vote on the amendment that would replace the former wording."
"Mr Posselt, I think you are right."
"We will ask Mr Pinior to make the necessary clarifications."
"Mr President, I suggest we delete the first part of the second point."
"As I understand it, it was proposed by members of the PPE-DE Group."
"This, then, is an oral amendment to paragraph 2, aiming to shorten the text."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 1"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to replace 'sound and future-oriented decision' by 'considered decision with a view to improved future relations'."
"That is a more specific way of putting it."
"Mr President, I object to that oral amendment because it takes away the sting in our resolution."
"We have tangible evidence that the sanctions are slowly working, so we need to expand them further and not weaken them further, as Mrs Jeggle's amendment seeks to achieve."
"We are grateful for your comments, Mr Matsakis, but you will have to find 36 other Members to join you to make a total of 37 to oppose this amendment."
"However strong your arguments are, I cannot reject the oral amendment if plenary does not oppose it, and I cannot see any other Members standing up."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"That concludes voting time."
"(ES) Mr President, I was in my office when I was made to leave by officials of this Parliament who told me that there was a fire drill."
"When I came in, I found that the vote had already been taken on the Resolution on Tibet and on another one, and I would now like to inform the Secretariat of the way I would have voted in the votes I was unable to participate in because the services made me leave my office and I was unable to come down to the Chamber."
"Do not worry, the services will take all of that into account."

"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to make an observation to be included in the Minutes."
"Since the decisions of the Italian authorities in relation to changing the representatives of Members elected in Italy refer to the 2004 elections, I do not believe it is appropriate for it all to take effect from 8 November."
"It is likely that the change should be backdated and I believe that this should be examined by the competent committee of this House."
"We take note of your observation."
"I do not know what its legal implications are, but the Secretariat will look into it and, if necessary, pass it on to the most appropriate committee to examine how well-founded your observation is."

"Order of business"
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 9 November 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed."
"Monday:"
"I have received a request from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to postpone the debate on the report by Mrs Bachelot-Narquin on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"Who would like to move this request on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament?"
"(FR) Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament requests that the debate and the vote on Mrs Bachelot's report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund be postponed."
"In fact, because COREPER and the Finnish Presidency only finalised their version of the regulation on Friday 10 November, the document did not reach us until the end of the afternoon."
"As a result, although we worked with the rapporteur all last week in informal meetings with the Council and the Commission, we were not able to have an initial discussion amongst ourselves between Friday evening and today."
"We therefore ask that both the debate and the votes be postponed to the second November session in order to enable us to carry out our examination of the proposals made to us by the Council."
"Mr President, I also take the floor with the agreement of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to support the position of my fellow Member, Mr Cottigny, and to request that the vote and the debate be postponed."
"In fact, as my fellow Member has just said, the latest information concerning the Council's positions reached us only a few hours ago."
"Our discussions thus far indicate that the positions of the Council and Parliament, expressed by the two competent committees, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, have come much closer together."
"It is not guaranteed, but on this basis we could perhaps reach an agreement at first reading, which would enable us to make this fund operational from the beginning of next year, as hoped for, I believe, by almost all the Members of this House."
"That is why I support Mr Cottigny's position."
"(Parliament accepted the proposal)"
"(The order of business was adopted)"
"Mr President, the proposed Constitution was approved by 500 votes to 137, and confirmed by 382 to 125 votes; so the opponents now have one in four votes in this House, but when we are represented at meetings abroad with the national parliaments, it is only 1 to 14."
"The 'no' side was not allowed to be present at Berlin, London or Paris."
"Parliament has now sent a total of 58 representatives, 54 from the 'yes' side, only 4 from the 'no' side."
"In 7 of the 11 meetings the 'no' side was not present."
"Last Thursday the Conference of Presidents approved this discrimination against those of us who oppose the Constitution."
"That is a very good example of how badly our D'Hondt system works in relation to minorities in the big groups."
"Some of us have established a Fair Chair reform programme."
"We call for a Fair Chair instead of a coronation, and fair representation instead of discrimination against small groups and minorities."
"We will present our platform at a press conference tomorrow at 2 p.m. in the press room."
"Mr President, you are welcome to come."
"Mr Bonde, as you are aware, the Conference of Presidents has already taken your position into consideration and has confirmed that the composition of each committee's delegations is the responsibility of the committee members, and therefore it is the committee that must decide on what representation is appropriate."
"You made your speech today - and all Members need to be aware of this - after the Conference of Presidents had already examined your concern and reached a decision on it."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(HU) Mr President, while we were gathered here on Monday for our last plenary session, events were taking place in Budapest that merit the attention of all Europe."
"That is, the 50th anniversary of the 1956 uprising was being celebrated in Hungary. That celebration, however, took quite an odd turn because the people were not allowed to participate."
"One of the high-ranking guests present, an Italian deputy prime minister, said that these celebrations left the people out."
"Meanwhile the people on the street who wanted to celebrate peacefully were brutally attacked and beaten up."
"The police caused serious injuries by shooting rubber bullets at head level, and they pushed people off the streets."
"Peaceable passers-by, who wanted to celebrate 1956 peacefully, were not allowed to do so."
"What a shame, what a shame this was in the middle of Europe."
"I call upon everyone who strives for human and civic liberties not to support this policy."
"(FR) Mr President, I would take the liberty of speaking once again on the subject of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor."
"They are still in Tripoli, in the prisons of the Libyan State."
"You know, as I do, that they are imprisoned under false accusations."
"The review of their trial was supposed to conclude at the end of October."
"However, in October, the court again postponed its decision, this time until 19 December."
"The court says that it is beginning to take into consideration the opinion of international experts, who tirelessly bring evidence of the innocence of the accused."
"Mr President, could we not demonstrate again the great interest that we take in the fate of these prisoners who have been tortured and have been absent from their homes for eight years for having treated young Libyans?"
"This situation cannot be tolerated, as, month after month, they are promised a trial."
"This new trial, the third, is inequitable and unjust and leaves them in the throes of a death sentence."
"(HU) Mr President, it is sad enough that the countries of Europe are witnessing ever more frequent acts of violence and destruction, events that signal turmoil and inner tensions."
"Stones being hurled, cars set on fire elicit a forceful response from the police forces, and these events show up on the newspaper headlines and television screens."
"All this causes damage to Europe, to the protesters, to the forces of law and order, in a word: to democracy."
"It is even more detrimental, however, when certain politicians, certain political parties feel justified in pronouncing judgment prior to the inquiry undertaken by the appointed independent judicial body."
"The Hungarian socialist delegation read with profound shock the statement by the President of the European People's Party about the events surrounding the 50th anniversary."
"What József Szájer said does not surprise us."
"The grave allegations by the European People's Party made prior to the conclusion of the inquiry are to be qualified as prejudicial, and as such, on behalf of the Hungarian socialist delegation, we reject them most emphatically."
"- (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been sixteen years since Lithuania regained its independence from the Soviet Union."
"The same time has passed since Lithuania failed to get back its embassy building in Rome, known as Villa Lituania, which was owned by Lithuania until 1937."
"Today, the Russian flag continues to fly on this building."
"After Russia occupied and annexed Lithuania in 1940, the then Lithuanian ambassador Stasys Lozoraitis presented a note to the Italian Government emphasising the illegitimate nature of the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union and the fact that Lithuanian diplomatic missions in foreign countries should not change their status."
"Despite this, Soviet officials occupied Villa Lituania in the presence of the representatives of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the police."
"After the restoration of Lithuania's independence, Italy avoided any responsibility and suggested negotiating with Russia concerning the building."
"Even though the Italian Government appears to have changed its position now, this matter remains unresolved."
"Why would the Italian Government make no attempt to reconsider its past history?"
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the reassuring messages and replies from the Central European Bank and the Commission on the cases of forgery of the euro, this phenomenon continues to preoccupy the administrative authorities and Europol."
"Just last week we had two particularly worrying cases."
"The first concerns the gang of Colombian counterfeiters brought down."
"A total of EUR 6 million was seized in forged 50 and 100 euro notes destined for Spain and other countries of the European Union."
"The same week in Germany, hundreds of thousands of 5 and 20 euro notes were dissolved in water, with the result that the German authorities were questioned as to the causes, while the citizens of this country hanker after the strong and independent Deutschmark."
"What is going on with the euro?"
"How secure are citizens when they themselves are at risk - even though victims - of being referred for investigation, as we have seen in several countries, on suspicion of counterfeiting or moving forged notes?"
"How long will the Central European Bank turn a blind eye?"
"Or is it only interested in when interest rates will rise again and start throttling consumers?"
"Mr President, I rise to ask you and others in this House to use their best offices to intervene in the case of ten Iranian Ahwazi Arab rights activists who, according to the Iranian media, face the death penalty this week."
"The men stand accused of bombing oil installations, but the evidence is unconvincing."
"All ten men made confessions under torture."
"According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch none of them had a fair trial."
"Their lawyers were not allowed to see them before their trial and were only briefed on the prosecution case a few hours before the start of court proceedings, which were held in secret."
"The lawyers for the condemned men have themselves been arrested for complaining about the illegal and unjust nature of these trials, and have been charged with threatening national security."
"I therefore hope that many Members will make contact with the Iranian authorities to make clear their views on these tragic cases."
"(PL) Mr President, one week has passed since the introduction of new baggage restrictions on airline passengers."
"However, I am still constantly asked what the matter is, if just days after Great Britain has eased these restrictions they have been implemented Europe-wide?"
"I still have not received an explanation for this situation even though I am a representative of the Committee for Transport and Tourism."
"Another issue is the lack of clarity over the new regulations, which are totally confusing to passengers."
"It appears that they have a different interpretation in just about every airport."
"At Wrocław Airport, for example, which is the one I use, I was told to throw away a stick deodorant, even though it was not in liquid form, as a penalty for not having declared it."
"In such a simple matter, would it not be possible to harmonise these rules so that they are interpreted in a uniform way, and that it is not up to the goodwill or otherwise of individual officials?"
"I hope to receive a reply to these questions."
"(HU) Mr President, in 1989-90 Hungary created the foundations for democracy and the rule of law without any violence."
"Now, 16 years later, the spirit of coercion has nevertheless been unleashed, because the current government unfortunately saw fit to use intimidation in order to attain its goals, thereby suppressing democratic opposition."
"The use of force is to be condemned, let there be no mistake."
"Rioting by violent groups is unacceptable, but even in problematic situations respect for the tools of the rule of law is indispensable."
"Defenders of Hungarian democracy must seize every legal means to ensure that the violent events of 23 October will never be repeated, when the police violently broke up the crowds and failed to observe the most basic demands of human rights, precisely when people were commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Revolution."
"We Hungarians believe in democratic freedom, which we have struggled so hard to achieve, and wish to make use of our human rights."
"Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of incitement to racial and religious hatred in Europe."
"Over the past two weeks in the United Kingdom we have had two trials."
"One concerned a young Muslim who, during a demonstration regarding, I believe, the infamous Danish cartoons, called for the beheading of those who insult Islam."
"He was rightly convicted and imprisoned."
"Yet, in contrast, Nick Griffin, the leader of Britain's neo-fascist British National Party, who was caught by the BBC declaring Islam a vile and wicked religion, was found not guilty of the same."
"I would ask that the relevant Commissioner considers whether or not at European level we need new and stronger legislation in this area."
"This is not an issue of freedom of speech, but freedom from fear."
"Comments like those of the BNP leader put the Muslim and minority communities at risk."
"The evidence is that, when BNP councillors are elected, racist violence in the relevant area doubles or triples, leading to problems for the whole area."
"Mr President, I rise to ask for your support for efforts at EU level to counter discrimination in the workplace, and in particular for the EU-funded 'Work It Out' Programme, which is a project that produces tools to help people with intellectual disabilities, those who support them and European legal experts in this area."
"This programme provides information on the framework Employment Directive, which seeks to combat discrimination and unequal treatment at work."
"That directive has recently been transposed by Member States and provides vital protection to people with intellectual disabilities who face discrimination at work."
"Mr President, I would ask you to ensure that the definition of 'worker' in this directive includes people in sheltered employment."
"We must be watchful and ensure that the directive is being implemented correctly in each Member State."
"Intellectual disability covers a large range of people with very different capabilities: some people with intellectual disabilities work and live independently in the community, while others have complex or profound needs and require constant support."
"However, it is important not to make assumptions about what intellectual disability means, since with appropriate support and preparation many people with intellectual disabilities can be a valuable part of the workforce."
"Mr President, I would ask that you devote personal attention to this matter."
"(ES) Mr President, to begin with, I should like to thank you in your own language for what you said to President Putin, that we will not trade human rights for energy."
"(PL) I would also like to see the ban imposed by Russia on the import of meat from Poland discussed at this meeting."
"Russia's accusations are groundless, and the matter has become too long and drawn-out."
"I believe that it is not just a matter between Poland and Russia, but between Russia and the entire European Union."
"I would like this house to put some pressure on the European Commission to take steps to resolve this abnormal situation."
"(FR) Mr President, an unprecedented power cut hit Western Europe on the night of 4/5 November."
"It revealed the fragility of the European energy system and the inadequate capacity for producing and transporting electricity, the result of a poor investment policy."
"Despite the risk of blackouts, for the last six years European operators have been reducing the level of their investments, which has fallen from 16% to 10% of their turnover."
"At the same time, electricity consumption has continued to rise by 1.8% per year."
"This fall in investments is the direct consequence of liberalising the energy market."
"Rather than investing in the development of new production capacity, operators are concentrating their efforts on profits and on buying out their competitors."
"On the one hand, the public has seen electricity prices soar while, on the other hand, security has decreased."
"Only a European energy policy could guarantee successful cooperation between Member States and the implementation of necessary investments to the tune of EUR 700 billion between now and 2030."
"Electricity is a public good: this should be reflected in the European Union's political initiatives."
"(PL) Mr President, despite numerous interventions, discussions and measures by Poland to comply with Russia's conditions, Russia continues to maintain its embargo on Polish foodstuffs, including meat."
"Poland has not, and will not be able to resolve this situation until the European Union applies equal market protection rules for all Member States."
"It is intolerable that Poland should be facing problems selling its products both on the external market and on the internal European market due to the impact of goods from third countries being dumped on its market."
"Poland, like the other Member States, cannot deal with Russia on her own."
"The partner that Russia should be dealing with is the European Union as a whole."
"For this reason I am raising the fundamental question of whether at the European Union-Russia summit planned for 24 November this year, Poland's problems will be treated as problems which affect the European Union as a whole."
"This is certainly an important issue."
"I cannot give you an answer because, as you know, we have not been invited to take part in this summit, but I am sure that both the Commission and the Council will bear Poland's problems in mind when dealing with EU-Russian relations."
"(PL) Mr President, I would also like to raise the matter of the European Commission's hand luggage regulations."
"I do not know whether the President and the Commission are aware of the fact that the food and cosmetics industry is unable to keep up with these regulations, and the majority of cosmetics do not come in 100 ml packaging."
"This means that shampoos, lotions and other cosmetics in liquid form have to be poured down the sink and the remainder poured into 100 ml containers because 200 ml containers are not allowed on board the aircraft."
"Of course, you can have your baggage checked in, although 5 million pieces of baggage go missing each year worldwide."
"Often total chaos and confusion prevails at airports, and the officials responsible are unable to cope."
"So it appears that the terrorists are one step ahead of us again, and have got us in a corner."
"The way things are going, it will not be long before they have us all flying in strait-jackets and disposable hospital slippers."
"(PL) Mr President, 'JEREMY', a joint and extremely valuable initiative of DG REGI and the European Investment Bank for 2007- 2013, is currently being negotiated with individual Member States."
"The aim of the initiative is to facilitate access to European Regional Development Fund cash for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The aim of JEREMY is to help regional business start-ups and development through all kinds of non-grant based instruments such as microcredits or guarantees."
"Unfortunately there is resistance on the part of some Member States - for the decision depends on them - to re-allocating part of their structural funds towards this new initiative."
"Some refuse outright to include them in their programmes, even though it is clear that they will be unable to utilise all of their funds and will have problems with uptake."
"This means running the risk that JEREMY, a superb instrument capable of supporting business initiative in the regions, will remain unused."
"We as the European Parliament have the obligation to encourage Member States to make use of the opportunities offered by JEREMY, because in addition to major investments from the structural funds, it is the development of small business and the generation of business activity that are the powerhouse of regional development, and therefore they deserve particular support."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year, and for the tenth time, the Europa Centre in Graz organised a European youth meeting with participants drawn from all over Europe, devoted to the theme of 'European future objectives' and with the participants giving their attention to the future development of the European Union."
"Following an information session on the European Union and its institutions, the participants - over sixty of them - moved to a role-play exercise in which they imagined themselves as representatives of these institutions and worked through a large number of items, producing a twenty-point resolution to the effect that, inter alia, the powers of the Union should be extended, that the budget should be topped up and that there should be no further enlargement before the treaty on a constitution for Europe has entered into force."
"Young people are Europe's future, and we should be very strong advocates for their education and further education, for that, too, is where our future lies."
"(EL) Mr President, one of the achievements of democracy is university asylum which, of course, does not develop in the same way in every country."
"In Greece, suddenly, university asylum means the anarchists, the pockets of terrorism which we pursue hotly in this Chamber, are creating cells and using universities as sites to manufacture Molotov cocktails and attack shops and neighbours."
"It is a terrible problem faced by my country, which is unable to find a solution."
"It is unable to take them on and that is where the main problem lies."
"Can we legislate uniformly in all the countries of Europe for equal respect for asylum, because this situation is spiralling out of control, and not just in Greece?"
"In other capitals of countries of Europe we have the same problem: the anarchists in asylum are a state within a state."
"There should be respect for asylum, but this should not become cells, pockets of anarchy, of all those going around in hoods violating, extorting and plundering the life of the citizens."
"Let us at long last legislate for the good of universities, for the good of students, and not for the good of the extremists or certain extremists fighting against the state."
"(HU) Mr President, it might become one of the signs of discrimination against the new Member States if administrative costs for 2007 were to be reduced at their expense."
"Paring down bureaucracy is a worthy aim, but it puts at risk the filling of eight hundred positions for the new Member States."
"These civil servants ought already to have been hired in the first half of 2006."
"I call upon the Commission to fulfil its obligations and to continue hiring new civil servants at the agreed pace."
"I hope that the European Commission will not listen to the Fidesz party."
"I would not wish to see the new Member States suffer from the smear campaign that party has launched, claiming that the new Member States do not deserve to be treated as equals because they are run by post-communists who trample human rights underfoot."
"Whatever Kinga Gál and József Szájer may say in this Chamber, to my mind, it is the interview given today by Elmar Brok, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which holds true: Hungarian democracy and the rule of law are not in danger."
"(HU) Mr President, a few days ago, as a result of an energy network breakdown, millions of Europeans were left without power, if only for an hour."
"This blackout, unprecedented since the 1970's, has once again shed light on the fact that it is increasingly difficult to bring energy regulation, which is largely within national jurisdictions, into line with the demands of energy security in the 21st century."
"At the same time, the dangers with regard to gas supply are becoming increasingly evident."
"The conflict over gas prices that has been developing in recent weeks between Russia and Georgia makes it clear that Russia is prepared, in a completely overt fashion, to use its energy resources for political purposes."
"This is the reason - one that is all the more frightening for the EU - why Russia, which plays a key role in our gas supply, does not wish to sign the European Energy Charter."
"Having thus experienced our dependency on two occasions in recent days, our response can only be a common EU energy policy based on solidarity that speaks with one voice at the international level."
"The Energy Green Paper currently being debated in Parliament should serve as a suitable starting point for formulating such a policy."
"Mr President, a study carried out by the highly renowned Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical School in the USA in collaboration with the Baghdad Medical School, published last month in the internationally prestigious medical journal The Lancet, showed that approximately 655 000 civilians have died as a result of the violent hostilities in Iraq between March 2003 and July 2006."
"Of these, many thousands have been children whose deaths were deemed by vicious criminal terrorists in Iraq and seemingly heartless politicians in Washington and London to be acceptable collateral damage."
"Mr Bush's and Mr Blair's invasion and occupation of Iraq has turned into a bloodbath of innocent people, worse than during satanic Saddam's rule of terror."
"We can no longer look on passively."
"I call upon you to recommend to the Conference of Presidents an urgent debate on the carnage involving civilians in Iraq, in the hope that we might help convert the madness of war into the logic of peace."
"Kyoto was and is a blueprint for sane and sensible environmental policies, by way of the reduction of damaging greenhouse gas emissions."
"Unfortunately, the reasonable targets set and agreed by Member States have been, and continue to be, ignored in many cases."
"In the case of Ireland, for example, we have a tradition of signing up to international agreements and protocols and then walking away from them."
"The big offender, however, is the United States of America."
"I welcome the results of the United States congressional elections."
"The fact that the American people have turned their backs on George Bush because of Iraq may also be an indication that his stubborn refusal to embrace Kyoto is not shared by the vast majority of the American population."
"Could it be that the tornadoes and the hurricanes and the natural disasters in the United States caused by global warming are a result of the reckless dependence on and usage of fossil fuels?"
"As a former British chief economist with the World Bank, Dr Nicholas Stern, put it very succinctly: good environmental practice does not simply make environmental sense, it also makes good economic sense."
"Mr President, last week a group of Irish MEPs met in Brussels with a group of mercy sisters who are working very closely with poor and marginalised members of the asylum and refugee communities."
"The stories we heard from those religious sisters were very alarming, especially as they came from a country that says it is civilised and treats people properly, though I dare say Ireland is not the only country not to treat refugee and asylum seekers correctly and humanely."
"We intend, as a group, to pursue this issue within Ireland."
"It would appear that the Dublin II Regulation - evaluation of which we currently await - is not working."
"Very often we hear from people working in this area that the theory and the practice do not match."
"We need to do something about that."
"Of particular concern, however, is the phenomenon of children lost to the system."
"Such children are in Ireland but nobody knows where exactly or who can account for them."
"That is an appalling prospect in a Member State of the European Union."
"We need to look very carefully at how we treat the poor and marginalised in our Community."
"We need an independent evaluation of the process and a long-term solution to the issue of why those people should need our support."
"(EL) Mr President, I think that developments in universities in connection with the basic issue of education are a cause for concern for millions of workers and students in the Member States."
"We therefore need to be extremely careful when we refer to university asylum, which is a fundamental achievement of the student movement in our country."
"The student uprising at the Polytechnic is - thirty-three years on - a shining example of the right of the peoples for democracy within universities and of the need for radical changes to be made at this level."
"These opinions being voiced in the European Parliament on restricting these basic democratic freedoms are dangerous."
"(PL) Mr President, I am shocked by the latest session of the diplomatic heads of the Member States, where the majority of foreign ministers asked for a European Union mandate to negotiate a new agreement between the EU and Russia before Russia lifts the trade restrictions it is imposing on Poland in the form of an embargo on Polish meat and agricultural produce."
"In other words, instead of European solidarity, what we have is an agreement with Moscow made over Poland's head, leaving my country to fend for itself."
"However,Warsaw is rightly demanding that the negotiating mandate include a ban on trade barriers in relations between Russia and individual EU Member states."
"Instead of a few words of support from Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, relations between the European Union and Russia should be based on the slogan of the Three Musketeers, 'one for all and all for one'."
"Failure to do this would make European solidarity nothing more than a meaningless phrase, and I say this forcefully in the country of the Three Musketeers."
"(ES) Mr President, last week Volkswagen unfortunately announced job cuts at its European factories, which may affect the plants at Pamplona in Spain, Brussels in Belgium and Palmela in Portugal."
"In Germany too, 20 000 of the 100 000 workers at the plant may be laid off."
"That will mean the loss of one in five workers, and 2 400 jobs may go at the other plants."
"If we add to that the problems that we have had with Opel and General Motors in Portugal, it is quite clear that we are facing a very serious problem, an industrial crisis that demands a response."
"In my view, we can no longer put off establishing a framework agreement with the entire European car industry and a code of conduct with the multinational companies, basically so as to guarantee jobs."
"I think the time has come for the Commission and Europe's institutions to take a very strong stand on this."
"(EL) Mr President, the former leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, has been sentenced to death by hanging for crimes against humanity, because he was found guilty of the death of 148 Shiites following an assassination attempt against him in 1982."
"I believe that, as repulsive as the crime is, the death penalty is not a solution and is not in keeping with the European acquis."
"However, I noted with regret that the British Foreign Secretary, Margaret Becket, expressed her satisfaction with this verdict and stated that those accused of crimes against the Iraqis should be brought to justice."
"I therefore ask you, as the death penalty has been abolished in all the countries of the European Union - because it is an insult to human dignity and simply encourages violence, while doing absolutely nothing to prevent crime - how can a Member State of the Union welcome such a verdict?"
"How can the death penalty uphold the justice cited by Mrs Becket?"
"(PL) Mr President, the 16th October saw yet another German violation of Poland's territorial sovereignty."
"On that day a German vessel was bound for the Polish port of Świnoujście."
"On entering Polish territorial waters she was boarded by Polish customs officials who discovered contraband alcohol."
"When the vessel was a few metres from shore, she suddenly turned about and headed for the German side."
"Despite orders from the harbourmaster for the vessel to remain in port, and despite being pursued and ordered to stop by two pursuit vessels of the Polish Border Guard, the Germen vessel left Polish waters with the Polish customs officials aboard."
"They were then arrested in Germany on charges of unlawful activity."
"The whole affair is an outrage!"
"I would also like to point out that in August the German Navy conducted manoeuvres in Polish waters without informing the Polish authorities, and causing problems to passenger ferries trying to get to Polish ports."
"This is the latest German provocation which ignores the Polish-German border."
"It is in breach of international law and jeopardises internal relations within the European Union."
"I call upon German politicians to come to their senses and finally acknowledge their country's borders with their neighbours."
"(PL) Mr President, we as MEPs have been receiving correspondence from individuals and organisations about the problem of the savage treatment of stray dogs in Romania."
"The reason I draw attention to this is that in the European Union we have adopted certain standards: recently, when debating an action plan for animal protection, we accepted the principle that the protection and humane treatment of animals is a challenge for European culture and civilisation in the 21st century."
"Romania is about to join the European Union in a few weeks' time and we cannot accept standards that are at odds with European standards."
"It is an issue I would like to draw your attention to, and I ask the European Commission also to address this issue and to intervene appropriately."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to draw the Members' attention to the abuse of and negative references made to periods of history, especially the Middle Ages."
"We often hear talk of 'mediaeval employment' which is, apparently, being imposed in the resolution on the directive on services or with the promotion of the revised directive on working times."
"The Middle Ages were a long period in history during which the foundations were laid in Europe of its present form and work was carried out to combine the Greco-Roman civilisation with Christianity."
"Of course, during the Middle Ages, employment relations were typified by an uninterrupted connection with the 'master', the employer, and the place of work, and were organised in the form of professional guilds, which were impenetrable regimes which safeguarded monopolies."
"Today, liberal united Europe, on the contrary, has safeguarded free movement and mobility and is proceeding to liberalise services and abolish the practices which plagued the inhabitants of Europe during various periods in history, such as the Middle Ages."
"That concludes this item."
"2006 annual report on the Euro Area (debate)"
"The next item is the report by José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 2006 annual report on the euro area (2006/2239 (INI))."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, this is the first time that Parliament has debated a report on the economic situation in the euro zone and I therefore regard this report as being of unique importance, particularly as this debate - this analysis that we are conducting jointly for the first time - is taking place at a time when the situation is both politically complex and economically uncertain."
"I say it is politically complex because, as we are dealing with institutional issues here, I cannot ignore the fact that the debate on what to do with the Constitutional Treaty is still ongoing."
"Another point that I cannot ignore, either, is that this report is being debated within a 'new era' in terms of monetary policy - with interest rates that have been rising for some time and threaten to keep on rising - and at a stage when we are embarking on the new Stability and Growth Pact as revised by the Commission, and when the Member States are for the first time coming before the European institutions to account for what they have done regarding the Lisbon Strategy in their national reform plans."
"I say that the situation is economically confused because, while I agree with the Commission's view that the economic situation is good, or at least much better than it was previously, I must emphasise that our potential 2% growth is not enough to absorb Europe's unemployed, to keep pace with our competitors or to maintain our standard of living."
"As is customary in this House, this report is divided into several sections: macroeconomic policy; reforms, with special emphasis on the internal market; and institutional issues, focusing on economic policy coordination and external representation."
"In the area of macroeconomic policy, there is nothing really new other than what we said in the debate on the broad economic guidelines."
"What the doctor prescribes for our macroeconomic policy is more stability, more stability and more stability."
"On monetary policy, the point that we highlight - and I repeat that we are highlighting institutional issues - is that we would like to see greater transparency and openness in the European Central Bank."
"We would like to know why it does what it does, and how it manages and takes into account the two pillars on which it bases its decisions."
"That is why we are asking for short minutes to be published showing the arguments for and against a particular decision."
"On the subject of budgetary policy, this report's first finding is that monetary policy may be losing the momentum that it has shown so far, and budgetary policy must take up the torch."
"That, as I have highlighted before, leads us to call on the Commission to adhere to a strict interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact, and on the Member States to work harder at cutting their deficits, especially in good times."
"Something new that we are calling for is greater coordination of Member States' fiscal calendars and of the economic forecasts that they use in making their budgetary projections."
"It does not make sense for countries taking part in the European Economic Union to use different forecasts of oil prices or of interest or exchange rate trends; in our dialogue with the national parliaments, we should like everyone to know what we are talking about."
"On the matter of public debt, we also call on the Member States, as usual, to make a greater effort to cut public debt in order to free up resources and to address the Lisbon Strategy and the budgetary challenges that will result from the ageing of our population."
"The last point - which has been repeated already - is to review our fiscal systems in order to enhance the competitiveness of Europe's economy."
"With regard to reforms, we prescribe Lisbon and more Lisbon."
"We want the public to see how well each Member State is performing."
"We therefore call for a code of conduct that will enable us to put greater pressure on the slowest countries and, through the dissemination of good practice, enable them to see how countries at the top of the class operate."
"Regarding the internal market, we need freedom and more freedom, in contrast to the protectionist temptations that we have seen in recent years, as well as development of the services market."
"In short, we want consolidation of fundamental freedoms."
"As regards institutional issues - I want to focus on improving the way the Union operates - we call for a trialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament to take place quarterly, in parallel with the dialogue that we have with the European Central Bank, although I am aware that the Commissioner is not enamoured with the idea."
"To facilitate this trialogue, we ask that the Eurogroup draw up a roadmap showing which way the euro zone will be heading in the next two years."
"We call on the Commission to provide us, in subsequent reports, with a more specific toolbox in order to promote such talks, and we invite the Commissioner and the Council to meet with us every three months."
"On the matter of external representation, we find that it is not consistent with the international weight of the euro."
"We are pleased that the Member States spoke with one voice at the meetings of the international institutions in Singapore, and we call for greater coordination and imagination to ensure that the Member States are represented as a single entity in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international bodies."
"I am grateful to all the shadow rapporteurs and all my fellow Members for the efforts that they have made."
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr García-Margallo and the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the interest that it has shown in analysing this first Commission Annual Report on the Euro Area, whose main objective is to promote dialogue and debate between our two institutions with a view to identifying the priority measures that will improve the way that the whole area operates."
"Since I had the opportunity to present this report to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in July, the predictions for growth in the euro zone for this year and the following two years have significantly improved."
"Last week I presented our autumn predictions, which can be summarised by saying that all of the economic indicators are pointing in the right direction: rising economic growth, which is the highest in the euro zone since the start of the decade, falling unemployment, stable inflation and clear reduction in public deficits."
"The factors that have contributed to this positive picture include external factors, such as the sustained strength of the global economy, but also internal factors, which contradict the image of stagnation and paralysis that has been used to portray European economies, and in particular the economy of the euro zone."
"Among these internal factors are the reforms in several countries in the euro zone in recent years, the budgetary consolidation efforts and the response of European economies to the significant increase in oil prices, which is more efficient than many expected."
"The existence of the euro zone has also significantly contributed to this favourable climate, thanks to the good finance conditions for families and businesses provided by the current level of interest rates and also thanks to the protection the euro has provided against the turbulence of the financial markets, as occurred in the spring."
"However, all of these positive factors do not invalidate the main conclusions of the Commission report on measures that should enable us to improve the operation of the area, which the majority of you agree with, according to Mr García-Margallo's report."
"I am talking about the need to go further with structural reforms, to consolidate the single market and to ensure more effective and integrated external representation of the euro zone than there has been so far."
"These three priorities, which are set out in the report, will also be included in the Annual Economic Report that I will present to the Commission on 22 November, which this year focuses on the operation of Economic and Monetary Union and, in particular, of the euro zone, in the light of the eight years of experience that have been accumulated."
"Having examined these three priorities and in relation to economic reforms I agree with the statement made in the report regarding the importance of carrying out the reforms promised by the Member States in the national reform plans as part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Once monetary policy has been unified and budgetary policy has been made part of the Stability and Growth Pact, the economic policies of each of the national governments should make the necessary adjustments in terms of productivity, competitiveness and the operation of markets in order to ensure a high degree of convergence within the area."
"In December, based on the reports submitted by the Member States, the Commission will adopt the report on the first year of application of the national reform plans."
"Our report will include an explicit evaluation of the degree to which each of the Member States has put these reforms into practice and, if we consider it to be necessary, we will give recommendations for each of the countries."
"We will also include an evaluation in the report of what we the European institutions have done in application of the reforms required for the Lisbon Community programme."
"We agree, as I said before, on the need to go further with the internal market, which, along with the single currency, is one of the two essential instruments for promoting more efficient allocation of resources and offering greater opportunities to businesses and more choice to consumers."
"The integration of the financial system is also a top priority for the proper functioning of Economic and Monetary Union."
"In this sector, the roadmap is set out in the Commission White Paper on financial services covering the 2005-2010 period."
"With regard to external representation of the euro zone, I can confirm that the European Parliament agrees on the need for coherent external representation."
"As I had the opportunity to explain in one of my recent speeches to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the European Union spoke with once voice in Singapore, as Mr García-Margallo has just reiterated."
"In October, after this meeting, both in the Eurogroup and in Ecofin, we debated this matter again and arrived at some additional agreements that are moving in the right direction."
"Mr García-Margallo's report also contains comments on monetary policy and on the application of the Treaty criteria for expanding the euro zone."
"The European Central Bank is one of the most transparent central banks in the world and this perception is highly valued by the markets, which appreciate the Bank's communication policy."
"With regard to the application of the inflation criteria for the enlargement of the euro zone, which we have debated many times in this House recently, I refer to what has been said so far."
"Finally, I do not know what doubts Mr García-Margallo has perceived."
"I am entirely in favour of dialogue with this House on the operation of the euro zone."
"The Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is well aware of this, as just a few days ago I had the opportunity to discuss with her how we can put it into practice."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this report; not only is there no dispute about that, but we also say 'yes' to its demands, its analysis and its substance."
"By way of elaboration, I would like to say something about six fundamentals."
"The first is that the euro is the EU's most potent response to globalisation."
"The second is that it may be the most important instrument for a successful internal market, but it is not the only one; it must go hand-in-hand with the accelerated implementation of the four freedoms in the internal market by means of pro-active innovation, the removal of structural weaknesses and the stabilisation of the social security, pensions and health systems."
"Thirdly, all EU Member States need to join the euro zone."
"Any EU Member State that resists the euro and sets itself in opposition to the euro zone, that fails to make every effort to become part of the European currency area, weakens the internal market and lessens the European Union's resistance to the effects of globalisation."
"Fourthly, the Maastricht criteria are the entry ticket, and I am glad that the Commission, in its decisions over recent months, has held fast to them."
"Fifthly, the Stability and Growth Pact is the necessary framework for budget policy."
"We demand that cyclical increases in revenue be used to reduce deficits and states' debts."
"Sixthly, according to today's newspapers, the French interior minister, Mr Sarkozy, is calling for the euro zone to be under European economic government."
"Those who want to strengthen the European economy need to ratify the constitution and endow the Commission with the necessary powers; that is why we favour a strong euro on world markets and a single voice in the IMF, along with a European foreign minister to enable the European Union to carry some global clout."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the opportunity presented to us by this debate in plenary to review together the operation of the euro zone at a time when, as you have said, the outlook in certain areas is improving, yet when all agree that the potential for growth is not fully realised and when our economies are handicapped by an exchange rate that makes euro zone exports difficult and leads some of our businesses to contemplate relocation in order to produce their goods in the dollar zone."
"This report presents an opportunity for review at a time when the Stability Pact has been revised and all agree that the commitments made by the Member States of the euro zone perhaps need to be better differentiated from the commitments made outside of the zone."
"From this point of view, the report is valuable, and I believe that we must also congratulate our fellow Member Mr García-Margallo on the spirit in which he approached it."
"We need to go further than reforming the Stability Pact in order to better coordinate timeframes and data and to ensure that, essentially, the Commission and the Central Bank do not evaluate the performances of the Member States of the euro zone solely from the point of view of their deficits, but also in the light of their strengths and weaknesses in a wider context."
"You mentioned this in your speech, Commissioner, and I am grateful for your having done so."
"I invite you, moreover, to continue along these lines."
"There is also a need to link macro-economic analysis more closely with developments on the financial markets."
"Furthermore, the way in which rating agencies have been able to be involved in the Italian question and to assess that country's debt must prompt us to be more vigilant, since, if rating agencies had to take a high-level role in the assessment of the debts of the Member States, there would be a very serious risk with regard to the leadership of the euro zone."
"One final word, Commissioner, to reinforce what has been said by several others on the subject of exchange rates: we need more economic policies and economic leadership in this area."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Economic and Monetary Union, with a common currency, is the highest level of economic integration the European Union has thus far reached."
"The euro zone has already been operating for six years, and its first enlargement revealed that the Maastricht criteria established more than a decade ago no longer correspond to the reality of the enlarging EU and the developing global economy."
"The euro zone countries are unable to implement the indicators that are important for the operation of the euro zone, especially the requirement for price stability."
"The European Commission (according to the EC Treaty) and the European Central Bank are both applying different criteria of price stability to the euro zone."
"According to the European Central Bank, price stability ensures lower inflation, which is still close to 2%."
"Based on the methods of the European Commission, the stability of prices in the euro zone is established by considering more than just the rate of inflation of the euro zone countries and, therefore, it is impossible to eliminate uncharacteristic inflation factors."
"I call on the Commission and the European Central Bank to work together on improvement of the concept of euro zone price stability and methods for its establishment in order to avoid misapprehensions in the process of euro zone enlargement and implementation of indicators in the euro zone itself."
"I invite euro zone Member States to properly implement the euro zone membership criteria that were adopted by the Member States themselves for better economic integration."
"Furthermore, I would like to emphasise that structural reforms are necessary for the successful competition of both the European Union and the euro zone in the global economy, and especially in further implementation of a domestic market with free movement of services, which has contributed to the competitiveness of the European Union."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commission, fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking Mr García-Margallo y Marfil for this report on the situation in the euro zone."
"The rapporteur observes that the prognoses for the euro zone look better than they have done for a long time."
"That depends, of course, on what economic policy it is intended to conduct."
"The policy pursued so far has not exactly been a success."
"Large parts of Europe are in social and economic crisis."
"According to the latest statistics, seven million people are living in poverty in Europe's largest economy, Germany."
"One of the causes of this is, specifically, economic and monetary union. EMU is presided over by the world's most conservative central bank when it comes to inflation, and its Stability Pact stymies economic policy."
"As the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) recently observed in a report, it is not more of this inflexible policy that we need."
"Instead, the peoples of Europe need an active financial policy and a reorganisation of EMU."
"As you know, my own country, Sweden, is not a member of EMU."
"In 2003, a clear majority voted against participating in it."
"That is why I am rather disturbed to read the report, which notes that, as from 2007, the euro zone will comprise 13 Member States but that - and I quote - 'macro-economic policy coordination and the internal market will involve all 27 Member States'."
"What does that mean?"
"Does it mean that Sweden, which has voted against EMU, will have to participate in it sooner or later?"
"I should be grateful for an answer from the Commission and also from the rapporteur, if he is given the floor at the end of the debate."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, in our discussion of the 2006 annual report on the situation in the euro zone there are two points I would like to make."
"The first is the much lower economic growth rate and higher unemployment in the countries of the European Union, and in the euro zone in particular, than in the USA and in the emerging markets such as China and India."
"Economic growth in the euro zone will in 2005-2007 be almost half of that of the USA, while unemployment will be almost twice as high."
"The second point is the higher economic growth rate and the lower unemployment rates in three of the fifteen countries which did not join the euro zone compared with countries inside the zone."
"No wonder that those countries are not rushing to join the single currency."
"The new Member States now have even greater reservations about joining the euro zone, even though they are continuing to work hard to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, growth in the euro zone has been the lowest in the world for many years, as it was in 2006 as well."
"But instead of looking for the causes at home, in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank, attempts are being made to impose the so-called harmonisation of budgetary and tax policies in the Member States."
"This is an attempt to hobble the initiative of Member States, a kind of diktat imposed by the stronger on the weaker."
"If the point of creating a common currency was firstly, to simplify the system and thereby to reduce costs, secondly to attract foreign investment, and thirdly, to make use of the privilege of issuing currency and creating a new world currency, then in the latter two cases the desired effect has not been achieved."
"Foreign investment continues to focus on the United States and Asia."
"Demand for the euro as a world currency is comparatively weak."
"The opposite effect has been achieved: keeping interest rates high and artificially bolstering the euro has undermined the competitiveness of European manufacturers and reduced export earnings."
"The common currency and the policy of the ECB appear to be serving the interests of finance capital at the cost of businessmen, consumers and the Member States' national budgets."
"The single currency has had an indirect impact on the exports of the new Member States by slowing their development and holding them back."
"We therefore take the view that there needs to be a radical review of EU monetary doctrine towards restoring authority over currency issue and interest rates to the monetary authorities of the Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, we can all, in fact, take pride in the euro."
"Much of what was predicted before its introduction has not come to pass, but there are three things that need constant emphasis."
"One is that the tax revenues that are now coming in must actually be used to reduce deficits, and we demand this in paragraph 5 of the report."
"Another is the urgent demand that the Maastricht criteria be rigorously applied."
"Relaxing them again, in the way they have been in the past, will surely get us nowhere."
"Thirdly, there is transparency."
"The ECB lags a long way behind global standards."
"The ongoing failure to produce anything like adequate minutes of decisions - or indeed any at all - defies comprehension, and this state of affairs is in urgent need of improvement."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report."
"It underlines the need for cooperation in strengthening the European economy."
"It is fair to say that the euro has provided Europe with stability that we have never seen before."
"When I listened earlier to my Swedish colleague, it sounded as though it was a problem for the European economy to have low interest rates."
"However, the truth is that we have lower interest rates than ever before."
"Does anyone think that the European economy would have been better if we had the interest rates of the 1970s or 1980s, or if we had the budget deficits of those years when Europe was losing out in the European economy?"
"Let us stop dreaming and look at the reality."
"Today we have a common currency that places the emphasis on and encourages competition, trade and investment and focuses on the need for structural reforms, as well as the need for fiscal discipline."
"That is good."
"That provides us with opportunities, because the problem of the European economy is not the interest rates, it is the lack of deregulation, it is the lack of more trade and of more of the internal market."
"We can see that we are more efficient and more successful since we opened up the markets."
"I believe that the euro will never be stronger than the European economy and the discipline of the countries participating in the euro."
"That also underlines the need for the European Central Bank to be independent, as underlined in the report."
"That is very important, because otherwise we will lose credibility."
"From a Swedish perspective, we will soon have the euro in a number of new countries around the Baltic Sea."
"I hope we will have a debate in my country that will make it possible for us to join them and other euro countries in the years to come."
"(DE) Mr President, I am glad that the Commission has produced this report and that it is committed to observing what happens to the euro zone, but equally glad to be able to say that Mr Juncker's presence here today means that there will be a contribution to our debate from the person who has the responsibility of speaking on behalf of the euro zone's members."
"So, then, where do we stand?"
"For the first time, we have got closer to the growth target that we set ourselves in Lisbon; growth in the euro zone now stands at 2.8%, which is almost the 3% that we took as a base figure at Lisbon."
"In this situation, what is the challenge for the euro zone?"
"What is the essential thing that is at stake?"
"Will we be content with this being nothing more than a little gust of air, no more than an upturn in the cycle that will be gone by tomorrow, or do we want to put something structural in place to ensure that we can draw a deep breath and get the chance to generate a long-term upturn that will last and will - since it is not merely data that make the economy, but people - foster popular confidence?"
"That is why I believe that we have to make the effort to do what is now needed, namely to make smart investments in the euro zone."
"Yes, consolidating budgets is a good thing to do, but we cannot simply chant that as a mantra when what we need to be doing is making use of the upturn we are experiencing now in order to embark on a policy of intelligent modernisation that gives us a chance of seriously reducing unemployment, and that, too, is in the report."
"Finally, I would like to thank our co-rapporteur and shadow rapporteur Mr Rosati, who contributed to our discussions on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and I do not want to omit Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, to whom thanks are due for having - and not for the first time - made an essential and seminal contribution to macro-economic debate in this House."
"Mr President, events seem to have overtaken this report."
"In spite of Commissioner Almunia's comments, its upbeat projections for growth in the euro zone contrast sharply with the economic data released at the end of last week, which put growth in the French economy at zero."
"There are also signs of faltering growth across the euro zone, which will not be helped by the austere taxation regimes being introduced in Germany and Italy next year to meet the euro zone's stability requirements."
"What this report does not tell us is that the Government of Italy is on the brink of collapse because of Mr Prodi's determination to introduce tax increases and budget cuts demanded by the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs to bring Italy into line with the Maastricht Treaty."
"It also does not mention the riots in Hungary following the Hungarian Prime Minister's revelations that he had lied morning, noon and night about the tax increases and public spending that he had secretly promised that same Commissioner."
"Forcing many of our new members of the EU to abide by deflationary policies designed for the more developed economies of the euro zone is generating weak demand, weak growth and mass unemployment."
"This report also fails to mention that the Maastricht Treaty has turned the Eastern Europeans into second-class citizens: they have no chance of joining the euro zone in the foreseeable future, while having to manage their economies in line with its requirements."
"Sooner or later the people of Europe are going to get restless with a system that keeps them permanently in the economic slow lane, while denying them any democratic say in how it should be run."
"(SK) I would like to welcome and support the proposal by the opposition in the European Parliament concerning the 2006 declaration on the anniversary of the euro zone."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the passage calling for a thorough examination of the mechanism of the three Member States that are the best performers in terms of price stability, and the methods for calculating the reference inflation rates."
"The point is that the varying rates of inflation among the euro zone Member States do not reflect different approaches to macroeconomic policy, but are rather the result of structural factors."
"This premise, I believe, applies especially to the new Member States of the European Union."
"The relative share of energy-intensive and raw material-intensive output in many of these countries is greater than in the euro zone."
"A major portion of this output is then transported to the euro zone either directly or as part of finished products, for instance in respect of the sheet metal used to manufacture car bodies."
"Because of these structural reasons, the new Member States are more susceptible to fluctuations in the price of energy and raw materials; by the same token, they serve as a buffer that absorbs the impact of price changes on the euro zone."
"This problem particularly affects the Slovak Republic."
"The current approach to assessing inflation criteria is, therefore, inappropriate and may in the long run diminish the chances of new Member States gaining entry to the euro zone, even if they comply with all other requirements."
"(HU) Mr President, first of all, I congratulate the Commission and the rapporteur for their consideration of this difficult subject."
"I am particularly pleased with the remarks concerning the flexibility of the labour market and the goal-oriented approach to education."
"I believe that our conclusions point in a single direction."
"As someone from one of the eastern European countries waiting to join the euro zone, I would like to make only four brief remarks:"
"First: with respect to the enlargement of the euro zone, no other standard for admission should be applied than the political standard that applies to those who are already inside."
"Second: it is important that the new Member States join as soon as possible, and therefore there can be no interpretation, above all in the matter of inflation, sustainability and the reference level, which would in practice postpone for a long time the accession of the new Member States, which are still lagging behind the EU economic average, and are thus still in the process of catching up in terms of wage and price levels."
"This is a point on which Mr Kozlík has given a very good explanation."
"Third: I agree that the statistics of the Member States have to be closely monitored, and that the Commission must respond with political tools, if nothing else, such as informing a European Summit, if a Member State is particularly undisciplined and heading in the wrong direction."
"In the long run, turning a blind eye is unacceptable."
"The Commission has a political responsibility as well in this regard."
"Fourth: deepening the internal market is essential, and it is important that everyone observes the criteria."
"The new Member States are doing this."
"However, there is a contradiction: on the one hand, the labour market, the Schengen zone, remains closed to the new Member States, and the Labour-Intensive Services and the Posting of Workers directives are very restrictive."
"On the other hand, however, we are obliged to open up the market in financial services to everyone."
"This imbalance does not make the integration of Member States any easier from the perspective of deepening the internal market."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report contains several interesting and welcome recommendations for which I would like to thank the rapporteur."
"Thus, instead of simply calling for public spending cuts, the report recommends freeing up resources to make what are presumably necessary public investments in education, training, infrastructure and research."
"Furthermore, instead of recommending wage cuts, the European Parliament admits - that is in fact the term that is used - that, in the long term, real wages and productivity should grow simultaneously."
"I would thank the rapporteur for his efforts at moderation and conciliation."
"However, the subject of this debate is the economic performance of the euro zone."
"In fact, I believe that, despite the recent and even unexpected improvement of growth indicators, the economic situation remains fragile and unsatisfactory."
"After all, the Commission's macroeconomic policy affects the daily lives of millions of Europeans whose purchasing power, I would point out, is threatened by stagnating salaries and by an increase in the cost of living and whose working conditions continue to decline, while social protection is also dwindling."
"The practical response offered by the Commission and the European Central Bank is always the same: to fight inflation through budgetary austerity and wage cuts, while increasing competition in the services, capital, products and labour markets."
"Perhaps the time has come to evaluate the results of this policy and to consider whether dismantling public services, deregulating the labour market and cutting public expenditure really is a sustainable way of driving growth in the euro zone and in the European Union."
"Unfortunately, no period of reflection is on the agenda."
"In two days, we shall have to give our opinion on a 'services' directive that is admittedly improved, but that remains true to Fritz Bolkestein's deregulatory model."
"In a few months' time, we will have on our agenda a directive proposing the end of the public postal service."
"As for energy, despite the chronic instability of the oil-producing zones, despite the gas blackmail exercised by a neighbouring country, despite global warming and despite power cuts extending across half of Europe, it is all to no avail and the response remains the same: to complete the liberalised and deregulated internal energy market in Europe."
"The euro zone's economic report is perhaps a little better this year, but its social and political performance remains, in my eyes, as bad as ever."
"(EL) Mr President, I have been listening to the speakers all this time, especially the competent Commissioner, Mr Almunia, arguing in favour of the canonisation of the euro."
"But is that really the case?"
"Perhaps, what we are tying to canonise, here in this Chamber, is the bad demon of the citizens of Europe which we represent?"
"The value of the euro rises and we are all delighted."
"However, at the same time, the number of citizens living below the poverty line also rises."
"Of the 500 million people in Europe of 27, 100 million people are living below the poverty line."
"In other words, people who can only afford meat once a fortnight, who cannot buy clothes for their children, who cannot change their car until they have had it for 15 years."
"What does the euro mean to these people?"
"I would remind you that it started with an imperium."
"We do not want one and two euro notes and yet 75% of daily transactions are below the 5 euro line."
"We are delighted that the euro is rising."
"It has risen from 0.87 cents to the dollar to 1.30."
"What does that mean?"
"No country which does not have proprietary products can sell to the United States of America or other countries."
"Of course Germany can sell Mercedes because it is a Mercedes, but how can my country, which has no proprietary products, sell to America - the big market - when it can find the same product in a neighbouring country outside EMU for a third of the price?"
"How will tourists come to Greece or, Mr Almunia, how will American tourists go to Spain when it is impossible to monitor the value of the euro."
"Can we not look at all this?"
"Can we not address all this?"
"It is a huge problem and you have a huge responsibility in the Commission, especially you personally, Mr Almunia."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we who live in the euro zone must, of course, make it our concern to leave our children in as little debt as possible, not under any circumstances must we, in our striving for a more vigorous economy, dispense with social standards."
"Whenever we are invited to compare our growth rate with that of the USA, the lack of virtually any kind of social system in the United States must not be left out of the equation."
"I do not think that we are going to catch them up by forcing masses of public sector workers into retirement and privatising their jobs, or by means of jobs paying EUR 1 an hour combined with the forcing of more and more staff into what appears to be self-employment."
"We have, in the past, seen more and more of the family silver being sold off in order to gain membership of the euro club, and that must come to an end; we must instead make the effort to get on top of the explosive growth of black-market work, to cut down the bureaucratic hurdles that face small and medium-sized businesses, some of which are becoming harder to surmount, and make it easier for such businesses to get access to grants."
"Only then will the euro zone have a future characterised by growth."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, it gives me great satisfaction to announce my support for the European Commission's presentation of the first annual report on the situation in the euro zone."
"The report provides a good basis for discussing the main challenges facing the euro zone now and in the coming years."
"There is plenty to discuss."
"The average growth rate in the euro zone in 2001-2005 was a mere 1.9%."
"Unemployment rose to 13 million, and the situation with public finances got worse, rather than improving."
"Last year did bring a slight improvement in the situation, as you were kind enough to confirm, but this does not change the fact that Europe is falling further behind not just the United States and Japan, but also the Asian boom countries."
"Unresolved structural problems lie at the root of European stagnation."
"The high cost of setting up and running a business, high overheads on labour costs, reluctance to innovate, and the maintenance of harmful barriers to the labour market and the services market all reduce the competitiveness of European firms, holding back growth and increasing pressure on public finances."
"It prevents us from making full use of the opportunities offered by a common currency and a uniform monetary policy."
"I therefore call upon the European Commission to put pressure on the Member States to speed up implementation of the necessary reforms."
"The need for this has been demonstrated in numerous reports and studies, including the Shapiro report and the high-level report made under the chairmanship of Wim Kok."
"Macroeconomic policy in the euro zone needs to be improved."
"What is missing above all is proper coordination of fiscal policy among the Member States."
"At the same time, the common currency requires fiscal discipline which needs to be observed jointly by all Member States."
"This will make it possible to balance macroeconomic policy and to restore a proper policy mix."
"Monetary policy needs to be based on clear, transparent rules, and must be more forward-looking in character."
"Excessive secrecy in decision-making, lack of clear regulations on the role played by the 'two pillars' of monetary policy, particularly the M3 monetary supply, which create serious doubts regarding the rules for appointing members of the board of the European Central Bank, all restrict the effectiveness and transparency of the common monetary policy, and may undermine the position of the common currency."
"A substantial element in strengthening the euro zone is expanding it and taking on new members."
"In this process we must observe the rule that candidates are bound by the treaty, the whole treaty and nothing but the treaty."
"This means that they must meet the criteria set out in the treaty, but also that additional requirements cannot be imposed upon them."
"I am convinced that the accession of new euro zone members, whose deficit and public debt levels are often much lower than those of the other Member States, will help to strengthen the euro zone."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Juncker, the president of the Euro Group, for taking part in our debate, and hope that it will inspire him and help him to manage the Euro Group even better."
"I would also like to thank Mr García-Margallo y Marfil for preparing this excellent report, and give my full agreement to the majority of the proposals made in it."
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, thank you very much to all of the Members for their contributions."
"I think that the debate shows that it is useful to have a report like this every year on the operation of the euro zone and its results, this being the first time that it has been adopted by the Commission and is being debated in Parliament."
"As a conclusion to today's debate, I can make an optimistic observation: the euro zone is growing again, despite the fact that some said that it was a zone of very low growth."
"The euro zone is growing by 2.6% this year, perhaps even more at the end of the financial year."
"The euro zone is creating jobs and reducing unemployment."
"According to our predictions, between now and 2008, five million jobs are going to be created in the euro zone."
"It is not said very often, but it is true that since the beginning of this decade, despite low growth, in the euro zone and of course also in the whole of the European Union, significantly more jobs have been created than in the United States, which always establish themselves as the reference point to be imitated in policies and strategies for job creation."
"I therefore think that, if we analyse the operation of the area and the results that we are achieving through monetary integration, there are elements that could justify a moderately optimistic assessment."
"However, it is also true that there are elements that should continue to attract our attention, as there is still a great deal to do."
"There is still a great deal to do, as many of you have said, in order to increase potential growth and continue to reduce unemployment, so that greater growth and a higher level of employment can improve the lives of our citizens, reduce inequalities and offer more solid bases for our social protection systems and for our social services system."
"This firstly requires, as many of you have said, that we continue to comply and comply better with the stability and budgetary discipline criteria laid down in the Treaty and implemented through the application of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is being applied in a reasonably positive way on which there is a consensus."
"We also need to continue with the reforms and go further with the Lisbon Strategy, because this plan of eliminating barriers and facilitating the four freedoms has proven to be a solid basis for creating better conditions in which to face the future."
"It also requires, according to the analysis and many of its conclusions, better governance in the euro zone."
"I think that the efficiency of the operation of the Eurogroup, since it has had a stable presidency, led by Mr Juncker, who is with us today, has improved."
"It is enabling us to make better progress in analysis, mutual understanding and coordinating decisions that affect the Member States, but which cannot be imposed on them from above, and need to be adopted by consensus, with their full conviction, and in accordance with their competences."
"We also need to strengthen dialogue."
"If any of you still have any doubts, ladies and gentlemen, in the opinion of the Commission, and in my opinion, as the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, we need to enhance bilateral dialogue between the Commission and Parliament on these matters."
"I think that we need to move forward in a tripartite dialogue between the Presidency of the Eurogroup, the Commission and Parliament, on the following matters: the operation of the Eurogroup, on any subjects that draw our attention and, if you agree, I also think that we need to move forward with a dialogue including, while fully respecting its independence, the European Central Bank and why not? which has a monetary dialogue with you but also has a monthly dialogue with us."
"I think that Parliament can and should, every now and again, be part of this exchange of views between all of the institutions, whose common goal is for the euro zone to operate correctly and for the euro, our common currency, to produce the best possible results for all the citizens of Europe."
"President of Eurogroup. (FR) Mr President, I should like first of all to apologise for being late."
"The Luxembourg-Strasbourg route is terribly congested at the entrance to Strasbourg, and traffic jams prevented me from arriving on time."
"Being conscious not to disturb the peace and quiet of the people of Strasbourg, I did not want to 'go all out';"
"I scrupulously adhered to the highway code, and I was the first to suffer, since I have arrived late for this debate."
"Nevertheless, I should like to tell you that I attach importance to this debate because Parliament's thoughts are not only important in themselves, but they also sustain the debates within Eurogroup, which I chair, assisted, inspired, driven and spurred on by the Commissioner for Monetary Affairs, my friend, Mr Almunia."
"I should like to begin by saying, Mr President, that I believe that we have strong growth: it is expanding and it is not under threat, despite the attempts to dampen it down, particularly on the part of France."
"The employment rate is rising and unemployment is going down, although it has not attained acceptable levels."
"As regards growth, if we look at it in perspective, it is probably stronger than we think at present and is, at any rate, stronger than we thought six months ago."
"In 2007, we shall have to see to what extent the cyclical slowdown in the United States affects the economic performance of the euro zone."
"At Eurogroup, we believe that the impact of the US slowdown on the euro zone economies will be less marked than in 2000-2001."
"We see that the US cyclical slowdown is primarily hitting the building sector and that it is not going to spread to other sectors of the US economy."
"Thus the impact on growth in the euro zone will be less marked than before, even though the country-by-country results will reveal some big differences."
"Why have we attained a level of growth that seems more acceptable to us today than it did a few years ago?"
"Firstly, because the euro has protected us to a huge extent over the past few years."
"It is never said enough, when the introduction of the euro is reviewed: the euro has protected us, is protecting us and will continue to protect us!"
"Imagine the state of the European economy and the state of the European monetary systems if the euro had not existed during times of crisis!"
"During this period, when preliminary work was being done on the euro, we witnessed the Latin American, Russian and South East Asian financial crises."
"Imagine how out of control our system would have let things get before the European system was implemented, at the time of the war in Iraq and of 11 September 2001!"
"Imagine what the performance of the European currencies would be if they still existed, while the geostrategic dramas being played out are a constant cause for concern!"
"Imagine how certain national currencies would have performed after the French and Dutch 'No' votes!"
"The euro has protected us, and it has even protected countries that expressed some misgivings about Europe when it came to their approving the Constitutional Treaty."
"The budgetary situation improved when, in all wisdom and with the agreement and often even the active support of Parliament, we amended and reformed the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Some people felt they were entitled to express their grave concerns following the adoption of the reformed pact."
"We see today that the mechanisms of the reformed pact are holding up well and that all the governments are making every effort to implement the main rules and guiding principles contained therein."
"The budget deficits are decreasing, and a general consensus is emerging, which is aimed at all of the Member States taking the prevention aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact seriously: they have all decided to allocate as a priority the fiscal surpluses resulting from the cyclical upturn to the reduction in the deficit and to the reduction in the level of public debt."
"I welcome that decision."
"We, at Eurogroup, are giving more thought to stepping up budgetary controls and we are doing so together with the Commission, whose cordial manner of assisting Eurogroup's presidency is proving to be very effective."
"We will see during our next meeting - which will be held towards the end of November, and thus after my visit to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which you, Mrs Berès, expertly chair - how we can step up these budgetary controls."
"We will do so, from now on, on the basis of a Commission horizontal report, which will not fail to emphasise the real political problems that exist, including the political-economic ones, or to draft specific recommendations - the form of which we have yet to decide on - to the various Member States, and even to the entire euro zone."
"With regard to the currency area as a whole, I should like us to take what is, by now, a long-standing invitation from the Commission seriously this year, and that is to devote a specific chapter of the European Council's conclusions - when it examines the progress made by the Lisbon Strategy - to the euro zone, a chapter that includes the structural reforms that we will have to implement within the various member states of the euro zone."
"As regards the structural reform problem, I would quite simply say, Mr President, that we underestimate the value that these structural reforms have already added to the coherence of the euro zone."
"I do not agree with all - or in general, some - of the structural reforms that have been implemented within all the Member States, but the fact is that, contrary to the idea, to the image that we very often present of the euro zone, an important raft of structural reforms is underway, and we are now already reaping the rewards of this far-reaching structural reform that we have implemented with regard to the euro zone."
"When you look closely at the national reform programmes that the various Member States have introduced, you will see that there are many structural solutions, that they are generally in line with each other and that we must proceed further with this raft of reforms, without for all that lapsing into unsavoury neoliberalism and into a boundless, shameless form of frenetic deregulation, to which I am opposed because I still believe that the euro and the euro zone and the consistency of the policies that we will be implementing would gain in credibility if we supplemented our work on structural reforms with the implementation of a set of minimum social rights."
"This would guarantee all workers, throughout the euro zone, a number of minimum rights, which the Member States, in trying to enhance their national fighting spirits, could not undermine."
"Workers in Europe have a right to know where they stand."
"We must stop giving the impression that the monetary Union is a business that is run by the ministers of finance, the bankers and the big investors and big businesses and that it actually works against the most basic rights of workers, who do, after all, make up the majority of the population in Europe."
"I should like to say a word about the enlargement of the euro zone."
"I disagree with all those who imply that we, in the euro zone, have become stricter than before towards the new Member States which want to join the zone."
"The criteria that we are applying are those laid down in the Treaty of Maastricht."
"There has been no demand to change the criteria that we adopted when the Treaty was signed in Maastricht, on 7 February 1992."
"There is no question of abandoning the nominal convergence policy so as to replace it with a criterion that would omit the application of certain criteria, which the first members of the euro zone had to meet."
"As for those who call into question the nominal convergence criteria, in non-theoretical terms, I would guard them against the genuine risks of seeing the nominal convergence criteria replaced by real convergence criteria."
"The application of real convergence criteria would make the new Member States' accession to the euro zone a very distant prospect."
"I therefore think that we would be wise to confine ourselves to the criteria that are currently ours, and this policy will enhance the credibility of the euro zone."
"The way in which the euro zone is represented outside Europe does, in fact, warrant a lengthy explanation, but a brief explanation may suffice."
"The euro zone must be represented by a man, by a voice and by a seat within every international institution, and particularly within the international financial organisations."
"I am convinced that we will not have reached that stage when my term in office comes to an end on 1 January 2009."
"Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the day will come when even the most reticent of Europeans will realise that we are constantly making fools of ourselves in aspiring to co-manage the world's monetary affairs if we continue to appear in international forums without a common plan of action."
"There you have a few comments that I felt it my right to make, while I apologise for not having been able to reply to all of the speakers, as I usually do;"
"I had to reply briefly because I was not present when the speakers, with the commitment that characterises this Parliament, took the floor."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30."
"Written statement (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(FR) Even though the report by my excellent colleague, Mr Garcia-Margallo y Marfil, puts forward some very interesting analyses and proposals on the euro zone, I regret the fact that it does not raise the issue straightaway of the development of the euro from a technical currency to a political tool benefiting growth and employment."
"The monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) seems to be at odds with reality: the exchange rate should normally be strong when there is strong economic growth and should depreciate when there is weak growth."
"The fact is that, in Europe, the opposite has been true since the start of the 1990s."
"While the Member States are undergoing reforms, the quest for zero inflation through an inappropriate monetary policy is leading Europe to record mediocre results in terms of economic growth."
"If this state of affairs continues, at a time when the price of raw materials and of energy is rocketing worldwide, we will have zero inflation and zero growth, and manufacturers will end up setting up their businesses in the dollar zone."
"With everything that is happening, it is as though the ECB is disregarding economic policy, while its US counterpart is thinking of nothing else."
"Community action in the field of marine environmental policy - Thematic strategy on the marine environment (debate)"
"The next items on the agenda are"
"the joint debate on the report by Marie-Noëlle Lienemann on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the proposed Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on community action in the field of marine environmental policy - Thematic strategy on the marine environment (Marine Strategy Directive) - C6 - 0346/2005 -"
"the report by Aldis Kušķis on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the thematic strategy for protection and preservation of the marine environment"
"Member of the Commission."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to launch this joint debate on the thematic strategy for protecting and preserving the marine environment and on the proposed Marine Strategy Directive."
"I should like to thank both rapporteurs - Mrs Lienemann for the proposed Marine Strategy Directive and Mr Kuskis for the thematic strategy."
"I also wish to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their efforts."
"Furthermore I should like to thank the Committee on Fisheries and in particular Mr Gklavakis for his highly constructive approach to this important issue."
"Seas and oceans cover 71% of the Earth's surface and contain 90% of the biosphere."
"Europe's marine waters extend across 3 million square kilometres, the same area as mainland Europe; in other words, 50% of Europe's territory is covered by sea."
"Marine ecosystems play a key role in climate and weather patterns."
"The status of Europe's marine environment is rapidly deteriorating, however."
"In some areas, we may have gone past the point of no return."
"Nutrient supply has a major influence on the Baltic Sea's marine environment."
"Fish populations are in a poor state throughout Europe."
"The Northeast Atlantic has one of the highest shipping levels in the world, with all of the risks and consequences that that implies."
"The Mediterranean is under serious threat from uncontrolled development of its coastline."
"If we are to reverse these trends, however, the existing measures and efforts - be they at international, national or EU level - are clearly inadequate."
"Most measures drawn up at EU level were not geared towards protecting the marine environment as such and they therefore have a limited impact."
"It has been demonstrated that measures adopted at international level are very difficult to implement or promote because they are not binding."
"A healthy marine environment is crucially important both for life as a whole, and for the quality of our lives."
"It is also an essential prerequisite for fulfilling the economic potential of the oceans and seas."
"A dynamic marine economy can flourish only where there is a healthy marine environment."
"The Marine Strategy will therefore make a significant contribution to the growth and employment goals enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy."
"For the reasons outlined above, it is clear that the protection of the marine environment cannot and must not simply be a by-product of other policies."
"At EU level what is needed is an integrated strategy that takes into account all of the pressures and influences on the marine environment."
"This is precisely what the thematic strategy on the marine environment seeks to achieve."
"It consists of the proposed Marine Strategy Directive and a report detailing the current state of affairs."
"On a broader level, it covers the EU's environmental record on the marine environment and explains why the EU needs to take action."
"Marine strategy must be viewed within the broader context of a new marine policy for the EU."
"According to the Commission's Green Paper drawn up in June, the objective of the new policy is a dynamic European marine economy, operating in harmony with the marine environment."
"The marine strategy is, within the area of the environment, one of the pillars of the future marine policy."
"It will be based on the specific activities needed to protect marine ecosystems, which provide the sustainable wealth, productivity and employment opportunities and, from a broader perspective, people's livelihood from the oceans and seas."
"The purpose of this Marine Strategy Directive is to achieve 'good environmental status' in the EU marine environment by 2021, in other words to restore the environmental health of our seas over the next 15 years."
"This date will coincide with the first review of River Basin Management Plans under the EU Water Framework Directive, allowing for synergies on the further implementation of both directives."
"The joint implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Directive thus brings together the protection of both marine and freshwater environments."
"The directive establishes European Marine Regions on the basis of geographical and environmental criteria, and defines sub-regions as management units for implementation."
"At an EU level no management-related measures will be adopted."
"In the first phase, the Member States will be tasked with developing a marine strategy for the seas in each of their regions, and proposing practical solutions to address the specific needs of those seas."
"Marine strategy should firstly include taking stock of the marine environment and the threats and pressures it faces, setting further environmental goals and indicators, and establishing monitoring programmes."
"In the second phase, the Member States will be required to draw up and implement measures aimed at achieving good environmental status."
"Cooperation is of vital importance between Member States and with the third countries with which Member States share saltwater bodies. In order to achieve this objective, Member States will need to work within the framework of the regional marine conventions."
"Regional conventions are invaluable partners when it comes to strategy implementation, as is evidenced by their long track record of scientific and technical competence, and the fact that they are able to work effectively at a regional level."
"To conclude, I should like to stress the importance and sensitivity of marine ecosystems."
"A high level of protection for the marine environment is a vital prerequisite for deriving the maximum economic benefit from the oceans and seas."
"The marine environment is clearly the foundation of our marine economy."
"The marine environment is under threat."
"Consequently the EU must act effectively proactive."
"I hope that the proposed strategy will contribute towards achieving that aim."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all, as rapporteur, to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs from the various groups and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for supporting a joint piece of work aimed at enhancing the Commission proposal."
"As you said, Commissioner, the seas and oceans of our planet are in a worrying state: a crisis point has been reached."
"Moreover, a recent study published in the Science review sounded the alarm bell by highlighting the risks of fishery resources disappearing from our seas and oceans."
"The quality of the marine ecosystem plays a fundamental role in the planet's global environment and, in particular, plays a very important role in regulating the climate."
"Our seas also play a decisive role in people's lives in every part of the globe."
"As you pointed out, they play a major economic role when it comes to fishing, transport, tourism, sources of raw materials or even activities carried out along the coastlines that border them."
"Yet, our seas and oceans are subjected to growing pressure and worrying pollution."
"Let us first address this figure: 80% of maritime pollution comes from the land, and, as you said, Commissioner, there is clearly a direct link between the framework directive on water and the directive that you have presented and that our Parliament wishes to enhance."
"However, if pollution comes from the earth via water, then it also comes via the atmosphere."
"Recent studies show a significant interaction between atmospheric movements, air pollution and the sea and oceans, such that urbanisation and human activities taking place far away from the coasts may have a direct impact on the quality of water."
"Pollution is also caused by activities linked to the exploitation of the oceans and seas, such as transport and aquaculture."
"A few years ago, waste produced by fishing and oil industry activity reached altogether excessive and dangerous levels in certain sectors."
"We are also at a time when we can see new threats looming, which the directive must anticipate."
"In particular, we are seeing a large increase in the number of projects aimed at desalinating seawater."
"We have to be certain that these activities are not going to affect the quality of water in the future."
"Major international debates are taking place on the storage of carbon dioxide."
"Thus, we can see that the threats are, indeed, real."
"The aim of the directive has been to implement a structure enabling us finally to have access to a strategy that goes beyond international agreements, the results of which have mostly not lived up to our hopes thus far."
"Our directive is based on a fundamental point: restoring the good ecological status of seas."
"Parliament would like, Commissioner, the requirement for results to be far more present and far stronger than the text in its current state provides for."
"Secondly, our Parliament would like the good ecological status of seas and oceans to be defined with a great deal more precision so that this is not some sort of pious hope and so that we come closer to doing what can be done to restore the life and balance of the ecosystem."
"Thirdly, our Parliament would like the deadlines to be shorter and, at any rate, we would like there to be a good balance between the deadlines, the level of the demands regarding good ecological status and the requirement for results."
"Finally, we advocate the creation of marine protected areas, because the experiences of the Americans and the New Zealanders have shown that these protected areas - indeed, in some cases, these genuine marine reserves - were such as to enable fish stocks to be built up again."
"Finally, we would like territorial cohesion to be enhanced by an effective piece of work carried out at marine and submarine regional level, without, however, the Member States being exempted from their responsibilities in view of the objectives set by the management plans and the plans for measures aimed at restoring good ecological status."
"We are anxious to include the Black Sea in the document."
"We would like to sound the alarm bell concerning the Arctic: we need to think about the future of this part of the world."
"It is directly linked to us and its development has a considerable impact on the future of the planet, which may be endangered as a result."
"We would like the outermost regions of the Union, which do not yet feature in the document, gradually to become at least the subject of an appropriate strategy."
"I shall conclude by mentioning the democratic issues."
"We see everyday, whether we are talking about fishing or transport, that sea users, ecologists and scientists feel the need to exchange their points of view so that the decisions that are taken are taken on the basis of a shared diagnosis and of a rational analysis of the problems."
"In any case, that is the spirit of the amendments that we have tabled."
"rapporteur. - (LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your cooperation so far and the valuable proposals that you have submitted, so that together we may improve the Commission's proposal on the thematic strategy for the protection and preservation of the marine environment."
"I very much hope that this report will foster real changes that will preserve and improve the marine ecological environment."
"I am happy that the report also touches on as sensitive an issue as the problems of the Baltic sea environment."
"In the Baltic sea, which is also known as Europe's internal lake, it is particularly important to preserve the balance of the ecosystem, by not allowing it to be further threatened, and by taking special account of the specific low water exchange indicator."
"I would like to emphasise, on this point, that the European Parliament ought also to scrupulously assess and join in monitoring the design and construction of a gas pipeline which is hazardous for the Baltic sea environment."
"In my view, it is important for the people of Europe, and particularly those whose countries border the sea, to be able to personally see positive changes - the fact that water quality and cleanness is increasing, that a renewal of biological diversity is taking place in the seas and, finally, that there is considered, balanced and sustainable administration and development of the marine region following the adoption of this legislation and similar pieces of legislation."
"I would like to stress that this report is the product of collaboration with non-governmental organisations and representatives of this field in industry, with whom wide-ranging debates took place even before the expiry of the deadline for submitting proposals, and that many of their ideas were included in the report."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to urge the European Commission and also ourselves to talk less but to work more and achieve concrete results, so that we may all live without fear beside our seas."
"From this point I shall switch to English and, speaking also for my colleague Mrs Korhola, who cannot be here today for this debate, share some comments and messages."
"The thematic strategy is decided on under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme."
"That is very necessary."
"As the Commissioner has rightly said, for some time we have needed a strong, integrated EU policy on marine protection."
"The EU marine strategy directive will be an important new instrument in integrating the existing approaches."
"Great things have already been achieved with the various policies - legislation, programmes, action plans and various international conventions - but still the state of the marine environment has been deteriorating at an alarming pace."
"We need more overall joint action."
"There are big challenges, such as the role of third countries, which might raise some questions."
"But if third countries turn out to be the biggest polluters and if they think of this as only a European Union matter, how do we ensure that actions and efforts put in place by the Member States produce good results when, for one reason or another, third countries do not cooperate?"
"We have tried to address the issues in committee, but we shall only find out later how this actually works."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, has done some excellent work, influenced strongly by the NGOs, and she has been very environmentally ambitious."
"She has made some radical changes and integrated ideas into the report that were widely requested by the stakeholders."
"In general, the rapporteur has made the directive stronger and more concrete, more ambitious and effective."
"She has added the much needed guidelines and criteria and has tightened up the time limits."
"Building on the rapporteur's approach, we have a solid chance to make this a real environmental pillar for marine policy as planned."
"Here are a few key elements of the draft report."
"The time limits and schedules for achieving good environmental status have been tightened up, from 2021 to 2017."
"General definitions of measures which Member States are to take in order to achieve good environmental status are added and a detailed list of GES criteria is provided."
"There is no clear definition of European marine waters."
"The Black Sea has been added as one marine region in the directive."
"Preparation timetables are tighter, as are programmes of measures."
"Marine-protected areas are added, something that was not mentioned before."
"More emphasis is given to cooperation by Member States in the same marine region in monitoring programmes, etc. More emphasis is laid on third countries in broadening responsibilities and deciding who should be involved."
"All in all, this report is making a strong point, from the European Parliament side, that we need effective measures to tackle this important issue."
"Mr President, the main objective of the proposed directive is to achieve a good marine environmental status."
"This strategy is more urgent today than at any other time, because the marine ecosystem has deteriorated significantly."
"However, in order for this strategy to be effective, we must pay attention to two or three things."
"First, we have a saying in my country, that you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs."
"The money budgeted for this action is very, very little."
"Provision has been made, for administrative expenses alone, for approximately EUR 90 million per annum for the first two years and for EUR 70 million per annum thereafter."
"I think this sum is inadequate."
"Saving our seas is such a serious issue that it merits our spending more money."
"Secondly, we need coordinated actions."
"First of all, we must make fishermen our partners in this endeavour."
"We must come to an agreement with them; they must be persuaded that, first of all, they need to protect the environment, but that is not all; all of us involved in transport, tourism, industry, health, nutrition, agriculture and, above all, fisheries, must sit at the same table, so that we can agree and proceed."
"The third thing I wanted to say was touched on by Commissioners Borg and Dimas and that is that we must agree on certain common indicators so that we can measure the environmental status at the moment, so that - and this is very important - when we speak of a good marine environmental status, we are referring to the same thing."
"In other words, we must agree on common measurements."
"To close, I wish to say and to emphasise that the directive on the marine strategy must give fisheries its proper place and must be at the heart of the endeavour."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work, and at the same time I want to thank the Commission, which has embarked on this important project."
"The Commissioner with responsibility for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, Mr Borg, himself in fact organised a conference on maritime transport safety in July in my home town of Turku, at which these important matters were discussed."
"This is just the sort of proper work which we in the EU should be doing together."
"I would in particular like to raise the matter of the Baltic Sea, as the Baltic is an important EU sea, though at present it is a blot on the landscape."
"The Baltic Sea is seriously ill."
"Let me give you an example of this."
"Last summer, blue-green algae took over the entire sea, aided by the warm weather."
"It is hard to explain to your little children, who want to go and swim, that they cannot go in the sea because not only is it dirty, it is actually toxic."
"There are toxic algae in the sea, and that can cause various diseases in children if they go and swim in the sea in warm weather."
"Now the Commission and all of us are being urged to take swift and determined action and provide the resources needed to rescue the Baltic Sea."
"That will of course mean that much action will have to be taken."
"One excellent project now under way is the financing of the St Petersburg sewage plant."
"This is one of the most important examples."
"We also need dialogue with Russia, for example, in the area of safety regulations for shipping."
"We will not succeed if we do not work closely with Russia."
"Saving the Baltic Sea is no longer just an environmental issue."
"It is above all a political one."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FI) Mr President, it is no exaggeration to say that Europe's marine regions are in a crisis and there is an urgent need to take action to protect the seas."
"Over the next 50 years, for example, fish stocks are threatened with collapse."
"The Commission proposal for a directive in the field of Marine Environmental Policy and a Marine Strategy is a way to seek a pan-European integrated approach to saving marine ecosystems."
"Although all our seas are in a poor state, it is only reasonable to examine the question of their protection from a regional perspective."
"Marine regions vary in terms of their characteristics, and at least some of the problems are essentially local."
"What they all have in common, however, is that they should all be capable of achieving good ecological status within a specific period of time."
"Hopefully that will be before the year 2021."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the rapporteur's endeavour to define what we mean by good environmental status in the marine environment."
"To achieve good status, as defined, we need to establish sufficiently stringent conservation objectives to prevent deterioration and for measures for the recovery of the seas and restoring them to a sustainable level."
"These measures may be quite tough, but I hope that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will support them in the vote."
"It is important that the measures are properly binding and not merely recommendations."
"The protection of the seas is about cooperation, not just among the Member States of the EU, but also with third countries with links to marine regions."
"For example, effective protection of the Baltic Sea region cannot succeed without Russia's commitment to cooperation."
"For years now, there has been cooperation in the context of HELCOM, or the Helsinki Commission."
"HELCOM is presently overseeing a Baltic Sea Action Plan."
"Conservation action under the strategy should start within the framework of the HELCOM Action Plan so that practical measures can be taken as swiftly as possible in the Baltic Sea region."
"I would like to thank both the rapporteurs for having adopted this view within the context both of the strategy and of the directive."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, having a marine strategy that does not concentrate on fish is like filling a goldfish bowl with clean water after the cat has already taken and eaten the goldfish!"
"Having said that, there is strong support in this House for the principles behind this strategy and for the legislation, and that is hardly surprising given the catastrophic picture the Commission has painted of the state of our seas."
"We need to introduce protective measures that are enforceable through the courts in order to ensure that Member States apply them."
"The Commissioner used strong words, which we welcome, but the proposals originally submitted to Parliament highlighted some of the weaknesses and divisions within the Commission itself."
"One thing we are most pleased about is the fact that the whole idea of good environmental status has been reinserted into the proposals and given a clear definition, and we are united on there being powers to create marine protected zones."
"However, why were those ideas not in the Commission's original document?"
"When it came out of DG Environment they were, but by the time it emerged from the College some of these crucial matters had been deleted."
"The time has come for the Commission to back up its fine words on sustainability with some united action from the Commissioners of each department."
"We hear that there are divergent views in the Council - so be it."
"But the message to the Commission and the Council from this Parliament should be that there is strong cross-party support for a significant improvement and strengthening of the measures being proposed."
"The Commission was right to draft these proposals, but let us now ensure that the warm sentiments can be transformed into practical action."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their exemplary work and their excellent reports."
"They improve the Commission's proposal by demanding that good environmental status be achieved by 2017 instead of 2021."
"Moreover, the targets are made binding, and the importance of marine reserves is emphasised."
"Climate change, waste, unsustainable fishing, noise, eutrophication and the extraction of raw materials threaten our seas."
"If the mass destruction and the natural disaster taking place in the depths of the oceans were instead to be taking place - visibly - on land, the debate on the protection of the marine environment would dominate everyday discourse."
"Species of fish, birds and mammals are threatened by extinction."
"The Marine Strategy can, in fact, be a small step in trying to get to grips with the problems, but only if it is as ambitious as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety proposes."
"The Member States must assume their responsibility for setting up significantly more marine reserves."
"We have national parks in all the Member States, but marine reserves are conspicuous by their absence where they are most needed."
"There is overwhelming statistical evidence that marine reserves provide protection that increases both the fish population and biological diversity in the immediate surroundings of the reserves."
"When fish are protected and are thus able to increase in numbers, the older fish disperse and make for better catches."
"The Baltic Sea, in particular, is an extremely sensitive sea with brackish water."
"The countries around the Baltic Sea must always be entitled to introduce more stringent water protection requirements if they think it necessary to do so without, as a consequence, being constantly threatened by protracted legal proceedings because the internal market has to take precedence over protection of our seas."
"I wish to point out the importance of the committee's call for no support to be given to agricultural activity involving large-scale nutrient leakage into the seas."
"My Amendments 81 and 82 are designed to introduce responsible regulation of discharges from waste disposal sites."
"The original proposal is too weak on this point."
"I am opposed to Amendment 90 about removing the reference to radioactive substances, because doing so would be contrary to the original objective from 2002."
"Finally, the Maritime Strategy's call for utilisation of the seas must be adjusted and altered so that it falls within the framework of the Marine Strategy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work she has done in the report and to stress that she has managed, with a great deal of success, to include in her report the views of all the members and of non-governmental organisations, and as a result she has improved the Commission's original paper significantly."
"The marine environment, which is a basic and valuable source of life, is under daily threat."
"Maritime pollution, climate change, shipping and coastal developments continue to threaten the marine environment and to have an adverse impact on human health."
"The directive in question, which is designed to plug the gaps in environmental policy, is an important step towards improving health and restoring the seas."
"It is important for us to support amendments requiring the Member States to achieve a good environmental status, amendments which recognise the threats to the marine environment and which aim for the shortest possible timeframe for the implementation of the directive."
"I refer to Amendments 24, 27, 73 and 78, which I urge you to support."
"Furthermore, actions by the Member States must be based on the principle of prevention, on an approach based on the ecosystem while, at the same time, account must be taken of accurate evaluations carried out on the basis of current European legislation, as referred to in Amendments 23, 49, 45, 51 and 60."
"Finally, I call on you to support Amendments 81 and 82 banning any systematic or deliberate dumping of any liquid, gaseous or solid body in the water or on the sea bed, in keeping with the provisions laid down for carbon dioxide, except where the relevant approval is granted in accordance with international law and a prior environmental impact study is carried out in accordance with the directive."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports under discussion could not have come at a better time, since they examine the notorious construction of the Baltic pipeline, a project that, in the absence of a serious environmental impact assessment, risks causing an ecological disaster in a sea already suffering, moreover, from a worrying level of pollution."
"Not only that: the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, where fish stocks are becoming ever more scarce, also suffer in some areas from a high level of pollution, caused, among other things, by oil extraction and, above all, by oil refining."
"I refer, in particular, to the industrial triangle of Syracuse in Sicily, which is the largest petrochemical complex in Europe."
"In this industrial zone, not only is there an extremely high level of air pollution, causing the tragedy of birth defects and the indefensible death rate due to tumours - over 57% higher, in fact, than the Italian average - but there is also the problem of marine pollution."
"The consequences are obvious: the poor-quality fish stocks are down to critical levels; fishermen, often small operators, either cover more miles to find better fishing waters, or are forced to give up their traditional livelihoods."
"As if that were not enough, plans are underway to construct a regasifier in this industrial zone, a project I have condemned several times before this House."
"The proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive and the appropriate amendments that, in our opinion, improve it, are therefore very welcome, Mr President."
"Above all, I hope that it will shorten the timescale for achieving the objectives of a healthy ecology and environment."
"We need to make up for the severe delays that Europe has accumulated in this sector, and, as we all know, political timing does not always coincide with the needs of the environment."
"From this evening, we can afford to be a little more optimistic."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the marine environment has faced various threats for a long time now, which is why a far-reaching marine strategy is a necessity."
"The European Union has territorial waters greater than its entire territory, with 1 200 ports, and 90% of its exports are transported by sea."
"We consider it crucial to emphasise the interdependence of a common fisheries policy and the proposed marine environment strategy."
"It is logical and advisable to allow a hazardous vessel that has been penalised to sail to the nearest shelter, and then to the nearest available shipyard provided that it does not pose a health or environmental threat."
"Another proposal worthy of attention is that of declaring the Arctic a nature reserve dedicated to peace and science."
"I have the privilege of representing Scotland in this Parliament and that means I also represent a large share of the EU's indigenous resources of oil and gas."
"As I understand it, we are committed to maximising the potential of our indigenous energy resources."
"Surely this is only sensible for economic and logistical reasons and for security of supply."
"It is also the case that the extraction of hydrocarbons in the North Sea is already well regulated in all its environmental and ecological aspects."
"Yet certain amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety will effectively stop exploitation of these resources."
"That is just plain absurd."
"Indeed these amendments will even, I understand, cause suspension of a major offshore wind project in the Moray Firth."
"Much of the research funding for this came from the European Union."
"Do we want to look ridiculous?"
"Do we want to hobble our few indigenous energy resources and become even more dependent on one or two dominant, and often domineering, external suppliers?"
"The North Sea's ecology must be considered holistically in North Sea terms."
"The North Sea is not the Mediterranean."
"I appeal to the rapporteur and other sensible groups to support the PPE-DE amendments, which will make this proposal ambitious - yes - but also responsible and practical."
"(SV) Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Lienemann and Mr Kušķis who, I think, have done a very good job indeed on these directives."
"I myself live by the Baltic Sea and have therefore, unfortunately, been able to see at extremely close quarters the significance, not only for individual people but also for employment and growth, of the seas' ecosystems being out of balance."
"I also know that people expect us in this House to make a vigorous effort and do something about the problems they experience every day."
"I therefore hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will not listen to the previous speakers but will instead give broad support to the changes backed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Firstly, it should support a considerably accelerated process, whereby the measures are implemented earlier, together with a timetable significantly more ambitious than the one proposed by the Commission, specifying precisely when the objective of good environmental status in our seas is to be achieved."
"Secondly, it should support more clearly defined objectives that, just as Mrs Lienemann said, are a guarantee of our in actual fact achieving something and are not, in the end, just so much empty talk."
"Thirdly, it should support making what is perhaps the sea in the worst situation, namely the Baltic, into a pilot area for this strategy - an area in which the measures are implemented particularly early and are preferably based on the Helsinki Convention."
"These measures are needed if the Baltic Sea is to be saved."
"(SV) Mr President, two weeks ago, Nicholas Stern, a former World Bank employee, published, on behalf of the British Government, a shocking report on the consequences of climate change."
"The message was plain."
"We must no longer think of nature as being something without value as, if we do so, the consequences may be incalculable."
"The same also applies to the state of the sea."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have prepared a number of amendments in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"They are all aimed at increasing the level of ambition, bringing stricter timetables about, strengthening cooperation with third countries such as Russia and plugging loopholes in the legislation."
"One serious loophole, for example, is in relation to the international waters that begin 12 nautical miles off the coast."
"In the vulnerable Baltic Sea, mainly cargo ships - but also passenger vessels - continue to dump latrine waste straight into the sea."
"That is something that they are able to do legally in international waters."
"Out in the Baltic, 1 800 vessels are dumping in more ways than one all the time."
"The mind boggles."
"We are pleased that the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs with whom we have worked are taking on board our amendment about plugging this loophole in the law. The amendment needs to be implemented quickly, without the decision getting caught up for years in the International Maritime Organisation's decision-making machinery."
"We must have a high level of ambition."
"The EU must support Russia in its efforts to cleanse St Petersburg of all waste water."
"It will be expensive, but not to take action would be still more expensive."
"Drilling for oil and the laying of gas pipelines must not, out of economic considerations, take precedence over the environmental risks presented by such activities."
"The harmful effects of traffic too must be reduced."
"I believe that our populations wish to see the EU genuinely able to take action on these issues pertaining to the fate of humanity."
"Only in that way can we increase confidence in the EU."
"The objective must be to protect Europe's seas and restore them to their former state and to ensure that human activities are conducted in a sustainable way."
"Mr President, the European Union has 68 000 kilometres of coastline;"
"Scotland has 11 000 kilometres."
"Almost 50% of the EU population live within 50 kilometres of the sea; in Scotland 70% live within 10 kilometres of the sea."
"Clearly it is in Scotland's long-term interests to protect the marine environment and to conserve its wealth of marine resources for the long term."
"Scotland has oil and gas reserves for at least another 30 years."
"I will be supporting various amendments that will ensure that oil and gas extraction can continue to benefit the Scottish and EU economies."
"I cannot support committee Amendment 8 in the Lienemann report, as drafted, because it seeks to link the marine strategy to 'the principles of the common fisheries policy'."
"The CFP has been a miserable failure and the last thing I want to see is a new marine strategy linked to such a flawed set of principles."
"The idea that Member States should determine what good environmental status is in waters under their jurisdiction, and work with their neighbours in logical marine regions, makes a lot of sense."
"Fisheries management should be brought into that common sense situation, and jurisdiction should be returned to the Member States so that, for example, countries around the North Sea can work together with those who have most to gain from conservation being encouraged, giving the incentive to make a marine strategy succeed."
"(EL) Mr President, systems to protect the marine environment are covered in a fragmentary manner by various sectoral policies of the European Union, with the result, however, that there is a compilation of policies, legislative acts, programmes and action plans, without any overall integrated policy for protecting the marine environment."
"The aim pursued in the two combined legislative arrangements on the thematic strategy on the protection and conservation of the environment and the marine strategy directive is to achieve a good environmental status of the marine environment in the European Union by 2021."
"However, if we take account, firstly, of the more general nature of the two arrangements and, secondly, of the pillars on which they are based, it is certain that in 2021, not only will there not be a good marine environmental status, but there will hardly have been any improvement to the present poor status, which is directly acknowledged in the explanatory statement to the proposal for a directive, which points out that overall there has been a fundamental deterioration in the marine environment over recent decades."
"The substantiated scientific data of the United Nations Organisation concerning the causes of the deterioration and pollution of the marine environment are incontrovertible: they are shore industries and shipping and the non-existent or under-developed infrastructures for storing and processing residues."
"More importantly, the pillars on which both the thematic strategy and the proposal for a directive are based are the common fisheries policy and the Green Paper on the European Union's shipping policy, all - of course - within the framework of the 6th Environment Action Programme for the period from 2002-2012, which we have acutely condemned."
"In our opinion, these are in essence numerous, insubstantial interventions on the same wavelength as the Commission proposal, the most daring and ambitious aim of which is to bring the deadline forward from 2021 to 2017."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, I would like warmly to congratulate Mrs Lienemann, and I am not doing so in a superficial way or because protocol requires it."
"I think that this Directive has achieved something important."
"Thanks to her extensive experience, she has an extraordinary knowledge of philosophy and of European legislative formulas and has achieved a succinct, short Directive."
"Despite the number of amendments, it does not have too much in it and her own amendments are very generic ideas that are typical of a framework directive."
"I know for a fact that she worked with experts and was open to many suggestions; amendments were not even needed in order for some of them to be incorporated."
"I would like to say that it is an extraordinary and wonderful thing that finally Europe is discussing the sea."
"Its time has come."
"I would, however, also like to say that this Directive should be the start of a subsequent development of legislation, as precisely because it is a framework directive, there are still many aspects that need to be developed in the future, which is what I want to talk about."
"For example, Amendment 27, which is practically the same as Amendment 86 tabled by my group, suggests several aspects that should be developed: among other things, activities at sea, many industrial activities, many of which are new, such as desalination, which I am not against, but it has not yet been studied, and the methodologies for studying the marine environmental impact, which are practically in their infancy, that is, they have not yet been done."
"I also think that the indicators should be developed more and that digital marine charts should be drawn up, which should also be used for cultural purposes."
"I think that one of the great treasures of world and European history are archaeological charts."
"This is something that needs to be developed in order to preserve our heritage and I think that it will be one of the most stimulating discoveries for all of us."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to congratulate my honourable friend Mrs Lienemann on her complete and detailed work."
"It is now essential that the European Union acquire an integrated policy for the protection of the marine environment, because the fragmentary legislation which has applied to date has not managed to reverse the reduction in biodiversity and the loss of habitats."
"It is our duty, therefore, towards future generations to achieve a very high level of protection of the marine environment, so that our strategy on sustainable development can be combined with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, not forgetting that, in many countries in Europe and for a substantial section of the populace, the sea is a large pole of economic development."
"At the same time, this directive offers the Member States an historic opportunity to collaborate in a field which, until recently, was a field of conflict and antagonism, such as sea fishing areas and fishing quotas."
"The basic objective must be to clearly define the term good environmental status of marine ecosystems, so as to achieve a cohesive and effective marine policy at European Union level."
"I believe that adopting protected marine areas, as a tool for protecting ecosystems and combating the reduction in biodiversity, will also help considerably in achieving this objective."
"At the same time, we are calling for the deadlines for attaining the targets of the proposed directive to be brought forward to 2017."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Lienemann and Mr Kušķis on their excellent reports which, despite the view of some Scottish colleagues, have been wisely strengthened by the Committee on The Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"European marine waters, as indeed international waters, have often become the dustbin for waste of varying quantities and levels of toxicity."
"This practice has been carried out for many years by individuals, companies and governments, who have shown little knowledge of or regard for the enormous diversity and importance of marine ecosystems."
"In many instances that has resulted in unprecedented environmental damage."
"In other cases, the survival of certain species is now balanced on a knife edge."
"It is high time for the EU to intervene decisively in order to protect our marine environment."
"Therefore, we should all fully support these two welcome reports in the hope that the implementation of the necessary strategies and directives will be forthcoming unhindered, as well as extended to third countries, and that further, complementary measures will be introduced in the near future."
"After all, the protection of our marine environment is an essential element in safeguarding our own survival on this planet."
"(NL) Mr President, first of all, my heartfelt compliments to Mrs Lienemann, who really has written an excellent report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is not easy for fish to survive in the seas and oceans surrounding the European Union; overfishing and pollution have taken their toll, and when the fish are gone, they are gone, so we must take drastic measures now in order to prevent the situation arising around 2040 of there being no fish left."
"Let this prediction by scientists serve as an important warning."
"Whilst the marine strategy is a sound initiative, the directive is not specific enough for my liking."
"First of all, fish reserves need to be set up."
"By setting up reserves at spawning locations, fish are given the opportunity of reproducing at their leisure."
"This has proved effective in New Zealand and Australia."
"If, alongside reserves, sustainable fishing methods are introduced, then we can safeguard the future of fish in the waters surrounding the European Union."
"In addition, something needs to be done about exotic species and the problem of ballast water."
"The Japanese oyster has found a pleasant living climate in the North Sea without natural enemies, but this oyster is actually thriving too well."
"The purification of ballast water is a simple procedure that must be undertaken across the board."
"The marine directive requires Member States to think about how the marine environment can be improved and how we can cooperate better, which is in the interest of us all."
"I warmly support Mrs Lienemann's report, and I hope you will all do the same."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, it feels good to be back again, and I have been able to begin work by reading two constructive reports."
"We are all of us responsible for ensuring that our seas can survive the stresses to which the marine environment is exposed."
"An additionally large responsibility lies with this Assembly and the European Union to find the right forms of coordinated and vigorous cross-border cooperation."
"As many speakers have pointed out, time is extremely short."
"In my own part of Europe, the Baltic is the most important sea and the one that has been, and still is, exposed to the greatest threats."
"That is why we view the planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany with great concern."
"Tomorrow, more detailed plans are to be presented."
"A gas pipeline in the sensitive Baltic Sea constitutes a considerable threat to the environment."
"The gas pipeline may be damaged by ships or old unrecovered mines and be exposed to terrorist attack."
"The gas pipeline would constitute a threat to the environment and to fishing, both when it was being constructed and during the period that it was in operation."
"In my opinion, the risks are manifestly greater than the advantages."
"Certainly, Europe needs energy supplies, but this natural gas pipeline must not be laid on the bed of the Baltic Sea."
"If the pipeline is to be constructed, it must be so on land - for the sake of the marine environment and of the Baltic."
"Member of the Commission."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I have followed your debate with interest and I am pleased to note that in principle you have endorsed the holistic approach favoured by the Commission."
"On the other hand, it is clear that this issue is a complex one, requiring urgent action in many areas."
"It is also clear that a range of different opinions has emerged and that further analysis and clarification are required."
"I should like to refer to some of the main amendments in more detail."
"In the timetable for implementation (Amendments 20, 24, 31, 32, 35 and 69), the Commission chose the year 2021 as the date by which the Member States have to achieve 'good environmental status' of their marine environments."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety proposed an earlier date."
"Although the Commission would like 'good environmental status' to be achieved quickly, the committee's date is not in my view a realistic one."
"The Commission's proposal addresses firstly the need to improve our understanding of the marine environment and the threats it faces, and secondly the need for action."
"In order that we may find the most appropriate, and cost-effective, measures to protect the marine environment, we must equip ourselves with the essential knowledge and skills."
"Under these conditions, to bring the deadlines forward would be counter-productive."
"This is clear, especially in view of the parallels with the current Water Framework Directive, to which this directive is closely related. In the Water Framework Directive, successfully adopted in 2000 due to the fact that Mrs Lienemann was the rapporteur, 'good environmental status' is called for by 2015, that is to say, 15 years after the adoption of the directive."
"The Marine Directive should operate in the same way."
"In view of the extent of the sea area addressed by the Marine Strategy Directive, and in view of the size of the task, no one should be in any doubt that our proposed timetable is highly ambitious."
"The date proposed by the Commission in the directive, 2021, will moreover coincide with the first review of the River Basin Management Plans under the EU Water Framework Directive, allowing synergies on the further implementation of both directives."
"Apart from this, the Commission believes that it would not be practical to call on the Member States to 'achieve good environmental status by 2021' as the Committee on the Environment is proposing in the Directive."
"Nor would it be realistic."
"The measures that must be taken as part of the Marine Strategy will be up and running by 2018 according to the proposed timetable."
"Some measures will not deliver immediate results because it will take time for some of the ecosystems to react to the measures."
"Overall progress towards good environmental status must be shown, however, which is why the Commission has proposed the idea of 'achieving good environmental status'."
"The Commission is prepared to support the insertion of an article stressing the importance of marine protected areas (Amendments 27, 39, 62 and 72)."
"Such an article should ideally be based on Article 6 of the Water Framework Directive on protected areas."
"The Commission is also prepared to back the idea that in order to meet the objectives of the Directive it may be necessary to create further protected areas or even closed nature reserves."
"It cannot accept, however, the proposal from the Committee on the Environment for the mandatory creation of marine protected areas as part of the implementation of the proposed Directive."
"Protected marine areas should be created only when they can contribute directly towards achieving a 'good environmental status'."
"They should not simply be created as an end in themselves, but should be viewed as a means rather than an end."
"The Commission agrees with the committee's wish to integrate the fundamental definition of 'good environmental status' (Amendment 80) directly into the Directive."
"The Commission nevertheless has definite problems with the list of definitions proposed by the Committee on the Environment."
"Many of these definitions are based on the factors influencing the marine environment and the threats to it, rather than the quality of the ecosystem."
"This is a dangerous approach because some potential risks and threats may be omitted or, on the other side of the coin, unduly emphasised."
"Even more importantly, if we monitor only the influencing factors, the EU will not be able to move away from the current fragmented approach on managing the marine environment towards a more integrated approach, which would cover all of the factors as well as their mutual impact on the marine environment."
"Lastly, with regard to financial matters, (Amendments 19 and 74), there are a number of EU funding mechanisms from which the Member States can benefit, for example the Structural Funds, LIFE+ and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"Consequently, it is not necessary to create any special funding mechanisms."
"Honourable Members, the debate has touched on the complexity of this whole issue, including the fact that the marine environment receives pollution from the atmosphere, and that the quality of the marine environment depends to a large extent on tackling climate change."
"It has also been mentioned that some seas have not been included, as in the case of the Black Sea, and naturally the approach adopted by Romania and Bulgaria will fundamentally change the situation and open up fresh possibilities."
"As regards the Arctic Ocean, owing to its geographical situation it is not possible to change the Commission's position significantly and nor is it possible to create an independent strategy for what is an exceptionally sensitive and important environment here, albeit in no way connected directly to EU territory."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I shall pass on the list of Commission opinions on the Amendments to Parliament's Services."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"(SV) It is very gratifying that attention is being devoted to issues concerning the marine environment because there is a great need to ensure that our seas do not suffer still more pollution or destruction."
"The amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are, for the most part, positive and will hopefully improve the condition of the marine environment, especially as a result of good environmental status being defined."
"The Commission's proposal does, however, contain an article that gives rise to a certain amount of concern."
"Article 13, on special areas, opens up opportunities for, to some extent, disregarding the environmental objectives if the alterations in a particular area have taken place as a result of actions taken for reasons of great public interest."
"One can imagine this article being invoked very extensively."
"It is therefore extremely important that the Commission impose significant restrictions if and when this happens, because the future environment we are all to live in is also of great public interest."
"(IT) Europe is surrounded by four seas and two oceans, containing different types of ecosystems and different biogeographical regions."
"The European coast extends over 100 000 km, and is where 16% of Europeans live, many of whom are strongly tied to the sea for their work, leisure, or sport, or because of the natural resources and energy it provides."
"In the case of enclosed or partly enclosed seas, such as the Black Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean, the risk of pollution is particularly high."
"The proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive, which seems desirable and long-awaited, must enable the current political framework for the protection of the marine environment in Europe to be expanded and strengthened."
"Its effectiveness will determine the future health of European seas, and has the necessary potential to guarantee the environmental basis needed for the sustainable use of the resources and functions of the sea, both within and outside of Europe."
"European electricity network breakdown (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the European electricity network breakdown."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, the serious incident on the continental European electricity network on Saturday, 4 November led to blackouts over most of the system."
"We know from E.ON that the fault originated in northern Germany, where switching off an extra high-voltage line in Lower Saxony later led to the switching off of lines across Europe."
"E.ON had carried out a planned deactivation of an overhead line and this operation had also been done with a previous line."
"The incident led to the splitting of the Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity Network into three zones: west, east and south-east."
"The western zone was short of power and the eastern zone had too much power."
"To cope with the lack of power in the western zone, automatic devices had to switch customers off in the countries affected."
"The worst affected countries were France, where five million customers were reported to have been cut off."
"In Germany, millions of customers were affected, as in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain, where some hundreds of thousands of customers were without electricity."
"Affected countries also included Austria, Slovenia, Portugal and Switzerland."
"The incident was resolved after an hour and the power supply was re-established."
"The incident could have had much greater consequences but the cooperation between transmission system operators and the size of the network made it possible to supply customers very quickly."
"The precise cause of the failure is not yet known."
"I have asked the European regulators to provide a report on what actually caused this blackout."
"That involves analysing a huge amount of information before the blackout and after the blackout, so at this stage I cannot report to you on what actually triggered it."
"The UCTE investigation committee will also provide a report, as will the European transmission system operators, who are investigating the incident."
"As soon as we have a full report and a full-scale investigation has been held into this incident, I will report to Parliament in an appropriate form on what actually triggered it; but as far as I can see three lessons should be learned from it."
"In 2003 a huge-scale blackout had already occurred in Italy and it is clear that the measures taken afterwards were not sufficient, in particular in three areas."
"One proposal, therefore, is that we should set up a formal European grouping of transmission system operators which will have the task of putting forward common positions on issues identified by the Commission and in particular network security standards."
"We should also institute a mechanism to ensure that these standards are formally binding on network operators."
"It is also clear that much more investment is needed in transmission system networks to provide for an adequate response when such incidents happen, but most importantly to ensure that lines are not overcharged."
"I am very pleased that you put this question on the agenda of this House, as it is a very important issue."
"This was not a natural disaster but a system failure, and we should analyse it and draw the necessary lessons from it. As soon as the report is ready, the Commission will not hesitate to draw the necessary conclusions and take the necessary action."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, many thanks for that level-headed report: the problem lasted an hour, and then it was sorted out."
"That, too, is an argument worth mentioning."
"Secondly, like you, I take the view that a full report needs to be produced first in order that we do not arrive at premature answers about all the things that might have gone wrong."
"Thirdly, we politicians must face up to the question as to whether the approach we take might be somewhat contradictory: on the one hand, we call for more investment in electricity grids, while, on the other, we threaten the grid operators with the unbundling of their property."
"Nobody can be expected to invest in networks when they are, at the same time, facing the threat of those same networks being taken off them; that can hardly be regarded as logical."
"Fourthly, at the same time as we call for more and more renewable energy, we know that wind power contributes to the reliability of the grids being a very real problem."
"I have nothing against wind power, but nobody should be surprised when problems of this sort occur."
"Fifthly, we demand - and rightly too - more connection points, because we want electricity to be transmitted from one country to another."
"Right though it is that we should want that, we are, perhaps, paying too little attention to the need to ensure that, at the same time or as a prior requirement, the grids before and after the connection points are adequately prepared."
"One consequence I would like to see resulting from this occurrence is our handling energy policy issues in a more realistic and down-to-earth way, without making contradictory demands that can never be met."
"Perhaps that is a contribution that we will be able to make; whether or not we do so, I look forward to a precise evaluation once the facts are before us, and then we will be able to consider what the political consequences must be - if any."
"Much of what was said in the days following the power failure was precipitate and resulted not so much from in-depth analysis of the event but rather more from a momentary snapshot of what happened."
"I am much obliged to you, Commissioner Piebalgs, for what you are doing."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the blackout in Europe affected 10 million people from Germany to Spain."
"The power cut was a salutary reminder of how closely we are connected to each other via the electricity network and how vulnerable we are at the same time."
"We still do not know why it happened."
"In practice Europe has a common electricity network, but not a common energy policy that would secure supply."
"No viable internal market for electricity has been established."
"It is paradoxical that the more our networks are connected, the more vulnerable we are to power cuts."
"Although connecting up the networks is an attempt to improve the security of supply of electricity everywhere in the Union, an adverse effect is that any problems that arise will affect us all."
"That is why we need above all to ensure that our common networks function properly, that there are emergency systems that operate nationally, and that the system is monitored by one authority."
"We need security standards, as the Commissioner said."
"The likelihood of other energy crises was heightened when the energy production plants were privatised."
"The state used to own these companies and invested in the long term."
"Now we have reached the quarterly investment stage where cash has to be recouped fast, and that is why there is no long-term perspective."
"The Commission has taken prompt action, and we are grateful for that."
"The national transmission system operators must in future cooperate more comprehensively and more transparently."
"In addition, the strategic review on energy out in January needs to examine the possibility of setting up a common regulatory authority."
"Moreover, companies need to take responsibility and invest more than they do now in transmission and emergency capacity."
"If that does not happen, governments will have to intervene and do what they had been doing up until the current phase."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Thank you for your communication, Commissioner."
"It is imperative that an extensive and rigorous investigation be carried out into the causes of the power cut that affected a number of EU countries."
"Should this breakdown be attributed to a lack of information?"
"To a failure to comply with procedures?"
"To a network fault?"
"To a shortage of investment?"
"To a fault in the maintenance of the network or to a commercial cause?"
"Some Europeans view this breakdown as a disastrous consequence of the liberalisation of energy; others view it as the product of inadequate interconnections and of an inadequate trans-European energy network."
"As you pointed out, one might also take the view that the management of this breakdown demonstrated the Member States' solidarity towards Germany, deprived as it was of electricity, and that the power cut procedures were implemented in order to prevent far more serious consequences resulting from a European black out."
"If the breakdown was a commercial one, the Member States' regulators must together define and review the applicable rules in order more effectively to control the electricity market."
"If the breakdown was due to technical problems, or to a procedural fault, then the power distribution network managers need to be coordinated more effectively, as they are the operational links in the chain of free flowing and secure energy exchanges."
"The creation of a European Centre for Energy Networks would enable us to implement a European code of networks aimed at harmonising the standards and procedures of the Member States' networks."
"To conclude, I am delighted that the Commission has launched this investigation and I hope - allow me to emphasise this point - that it communicates the results with all due transparency so that we might make progress in preventing any incidents of this kind."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, since Mr Reul, two or three days after the electricity blackout, went on German radio to attack wind energy in much the same way that Mr Glos and E.ON had done, I am glad to hear him, ten days on from the event, declaring that he has nothing against it."
"It has since become clear that German wind energy did absolutely nothing to help bring this calamity to pass, since the wind on that day was quite normal."
"'Day ahead' was delivered, and it did indeed turn out that the wind farms in Germany had made a vital contribution to getting the grid up and running again, in other words, in those situations in which it is possible to define a good interface between the grid operators, the regulators and the providers of wind energy, wind energy did in fact, have positive effects on the grid."
"In Spain, by contrast, many wind farms were taken out of the grid during a moment of low frequency, which makes no sense whatever, as wind farms are less vulnerable to low frequency than other generation facilities, and they could have helped to stabilise the Spanish network."
"What can this breakdown teach us?"
"The first thing it can teach us is that we have to prepare the networks for long-term investments in energy; electricity generation will migrate to the coasts, and I am talking here not just about wind energy, but also about condensing power plants, which will find it impossible to cool themselves down further inland by reason of the warmer climate and warmer rivers."
"We will also have to invest much more in decentralised energy provision, in the shape of biomass, biogas, combined heat and power, as well as gas power stations, which can be sited close to the centres of consumption in industry or in towns, which will, to some degree, compensate for this migration and enable us, by means of these decentralised investments, to make more room on the networks for business."
"Secondly, what is needed is an EU regulator - not one who will abolish the national regulatory authorities, but an EU regulator with quite specific functions in the sphere of trans-European electricity trading, improving not only transparency but also the interfaces between the national networks."
"We need this authority right now, but with a clearly defined and narrower spectrum."
"Thirdly, the networks are in need of long-term investment, and that cannot be maintained on the basis of high yields in the short term."
"It is precisely because E.ON and RWE want returns of 30% that we need ownership unbundling, for such high yields are not necessary in a monopoly sector, where no more than a return of between 6% and 8% on the investment to be made is needed."
"A clear separation of the grid's interests and the production and trading interests will improve security of supply and also the European network's capacity to act."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, energy is produced heterogeneously among the Member States."
"In some countries, cheap hydro-electric energy is of key importance; in others, cheap nuclear energy."
"In other countries, electricity is produced by burning ever more expensive fossil fuels or by means of expensive wind power."
"The picture of the market is further muddled by the EU's emissions rights trading scheme, and we do not know what the future holds for that in 2008, let alone 2013."
"Connecting the EU's electricity networks does not solve all the problems."
"Harmonisation of the market will produce winners and losers."
"There are many countries that will not agree to invest in interconnecting networks or pay a high price for electricity just so that it might be cheaper in another country."
"I am glad that the Commission's standard answer this time has not been that the harmonisation of markets solves everything, but that instead it is actually trying to find out what this was all about."
"(ES) Mr President, the power cut that was experienced on 4 November once again demonstrated the high level of interdependence between the electrical networks of the Member States."
"The fact that ten million citizens and about a dozen countries were affected gives us an idea of the gravity and scope of this incident."
"There is undoubtedly a positive side to this, which is the swiftness and efficiency of the reaction by the operators, who, by taking the appropriate measures, managed to solve the problem in just under an hour."
"However, although we should be pleased with this, what we should not do is tempt fate."
"Commissioner, you said that a detailed investigation is going to be conducted into the causes of this incident and there is no doubt that this needs to be done, because from every crisis like this we learn very valuable lessons."
"I am sure that when you have all the necessary information, you will pass it on to this House so that we can also analyse it."
"Commissioner, I fully agree with you that there is a need, as you recently mentioned, to create a formal group, at European level, of transmission system operators that can make technical proposals on safety standards for the networks and other issues that are relevant to what we are dealing with."
"A few years ago I proposed a similar initiative in relation to the report on security of supply and I must say that, on the part of the regulators and many colleagues in this House, the initiative was not very successful."
"I hope that after this latest crisis, this proposal will be re-examined with more realism."
"Finally, Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to make a comment to the Council: it is now time that, in a Europe in which there is free movement of services, goods, capital and people, in which twelve of the Member States have the same monetary policy, in which we all share an international trade policy, we stop pretending that the decisions that we take about energy only affect us."
"This latest incident made this very clear."
"It is not about taking sovereignty away from any Member State, but about acting together on all those things in which joint action benefits everyone."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the blackout of electricity networks on 4 November is a sign that should highlight the urgency with which we must provide common responses to the energy problem."
"The episode has shown clearly how closely networks are interconnected, and the lack of appropriate management to support this."
"Commissioner, the guidelines presented by the Commission on 9 November to rationalise the cross-border transport of electricity in Europe, which are aimed at improving the management system, are welcome."
"However, it is important to enforce greater cooperation among regulators: we must speed up the implementation of a single European regulatory authority, a European centre for energy networks, as proposed by the Commission's Green Paper."
"It is also necessary, in my opinion, to have network administrators that are independent of commercial operators, as well as greater computerisation, enabling transmission networks and distribution networks to communicate."
"The internal market is a key aspect of common energy policy. Today, more than ever, this policy is essential and must be regarded as a priority."
"We must continue down this road with greater courage. Together with the Member States, we must speed up this process, overcoming national protectionist self-interest that slows down liberalisation and competition on the market, so that episodes like that of 4 November will no longer happen, and, above all, so that Europe, as a single actor, can negotiate the delicate international geopolitical balances, securing for itself a protected, sustainable and unified energy supply."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we must first do is ensure that the grid is well divided up between large and smaller suppliers, between strong central units and regional ones that will enable us to build up a strong structure."
"For that, of course, trans-European networks are needed, as is a regulator or coordinator to handle these matters, but what is needed above all is the fiscal incentives that will get the profits that will be made used for investment allowances or shorter-term rates of depreciation."
"The most important thing, as I see it, is to draw up emergency plans that will give us a chance of shutting down the network quickly and efficiently in the event of a crisis and then restabilising it and restoring the power supply as quickly as possible."
"We also have to introduce a qualitative dimension into the security of energy supply, meaning that those who are willing to have themselves removed from the network at short notice should also be able to benefit from price reductions, or, conversely, that those who want to remain on the grid as long as possible and be put back on it with the minimum possible delay, should also pay higher charges."
"Where energy is concerned, we must get away from debating it only in terms of quantity; there is a need, in energy supply, for qualitative factors that will make it possible for the price schedules to demand that a user who wants absolute security of supply would also pay more."
"If, though, a user is flexible by reason - for example - of being able to draw on the energy for his warm water requirements either by night or by day, then he should be charged at a correspondingly more favourable rate."
"Everyone should be able to choose their own energy supplier, and everyone should be able to get their electricity from the generator of their choice; if they could do that, it would give us a real chance of reshaping the European market."
"Mr President, this was an example of the law of unintended consequences, not a disaster."
"We must await the outcome of the inquiry you have launched and avoid kneejerk reactions."
"We have learned once again that people's behaviour is not always predictable."
"I submit that it is not possible to legislate against every eventuality."
"This was primarily a technical problem and not necessarily one about policy."
"I would remind the Commissioner and the House that we already have legislation in place in the shape of the security of electricity supply and infrastructure directive, for which I was Parliament's rapporteur."
"We should wait for that piece of legislation to bed down and be seen to be properly transposed and implemented in Member States before we move on to enact more legislation."
"Let us learn from this, but let us also remember that the network operators - the transmission system operators - have a remarkable record of maintaining supply."
"As my colleague, Mr Rübig, has said, a 100% supply is a difficult target to achieve."
"I believe they do a pretty good job."
"I invite the Commissioner to come and join my colleagues on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"We are going back to our committee meeting after this discussion."
"One of the matters we will be discussing is Mrs Morgan's report on the Green Paper."
"It is good to see the Commissioner here and if he does not have to rush away he will be very welcome to join us."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, firstly, I am very grateful for the invitation and I will definitely come, but I shall only listen to the debate and not intervene in the proceedings of the committee."
"Secondly, it is important to have all the results of the investigation before we reach a conclusion."
"That is why I want to launch all these inquiries, because we really need a factual basis."
"It was a planned action and not a natural disaster."
"We really need to know why it happened."
"Thirdly, today's debate has been very valuable."
"In a way it has been a prelude to the debate to be held in the committee, because it has examined how best to ensure that the necessary investments are made in power and in the energy sector in general, and which are the best ways to guarantee that investments are made and the system functions properly."
"I should like to praise the transmission system operators, who really cooperated on a voluntary basis."
"Their quick response prevented an even worse blackout."
"I should like to inform Parliament that during the summer the European transmission system operators always pay close attention to demand and supply on the electricity market."
"As you know, summers are becoming hotter and the consumption of electricity at that time increases tremendously, so every year there is more and more demand for electricity and the networks are overloaded."
"It is very important also to mention that network security standards must always be observed."
"Therefore, we definitely need a binding standard to which all network operators have to adhere."
"We have already seen the example of the Swiss blackout, which caused the blackout in Italy."
"It was clear the operator had not complied with the network security requirements and that resulted in a large-scale blackout."
"We should ensure that such a situation never occurs again and, at the same time, establish a system that is very reliable, where the size of the European network and the size of the UCTE system help to prevent blackouts, rather than causing blackouts or making them more widespread."
"I thank you for the debate."
"As I promised, as soon as the results of the inquiry are available, I will be ready to come to Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"Milk quotas (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission on milk quotas by Duarte Freitas, Carmen Fraga Estévez, Salvador Garriga Polledo, Esther Herranz García, Elisabeth Jeggle, Albert Jan Maat, Mairead McGuinness, Francisco José Millán Mon, James Nicholson, Neil Parish and Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group - B6-0444/2006)."
"author. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank the political group and the other groups for the interest that they have shown in this subject and that made it possible for this oral question to be put quickly onto the agenda."
"This level of interest is indicative of the importance and sensitivity of the issue of milk quotas."
"Commissioner, you suggested at the informal Council meeting that the system of milk quotas appears increasingly outdated and that it should be questioned and examined in such a way that farmers can plan their lives over the long term."
"On 3 October, at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Rasmussen, representing the Commission, confirmed that we would see changes following the CAP 2008-2009 health check, most probably a phasing out of the milk quota system before 2015, when the 2003 Agreement is due to expire."
"It was not Parliament that raised this issue now, but it is in Parliament that the issue must be clarified, because our voters are most concerned and are anxious to know what is going on."
"The truth of the matter is that the market reacted to these statements immediately, and various organisations and political agents appeared in public to have their say on the future of milk quotas."
"Although the CAP health check cannot be viewed as a mid-term review, we are aware of the internal and external pressures to make changes that go beyond merely simplifying the processes."
"In the dairy sector, planning is done over the long term."
"As regards, on the one hand, quota acquisition and, on the other hand, genetic improvement, environmental obligations and investment in determining the quality of the milk fat and protein content produced by each cow per lactation, analysis is required every six to eight years."
"Accordingly, what politicians are saying today will have repercussions until 2014-2015."
"As I come from a region in the Azores which accounts for 30% of Portuguese milk production, where milk is the main source of income and where there are no medium-term alternatives, I am particularly sensitive to these changes."
"It is therefore essential that we know whether or not the agreement must be complied with and whether any stringent mechanisms are to be put in place before or after 2015."
"On the other hand, it is also crucial to state for political purposes that the EU will take into account the social and economic impact that changes of this nature could have on regions that depend on milk and, in particular, on regions in which there are no production alternatives."
"What we really need to know now, Commissioner, is whether the milk quota system will be maintained in its current form until 2015, so that the market and the producers can be kept fully informed."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, for the time being the quota system provides some kind of stability for the European market, allowing successful full implementation of the 2003 reform without undue disturbances."
"However, if the milk sector is to meet the challenge of competitiveness in the future and prosper in a more liberal world, the milk quota system will gradually become a less adequate instrument for achieving our goals."
"I have therefore decided that a debate on the future of the quota system should take place within the health check process in 2008."
"The most promising long-term scenario for the European dairy sector is one without quotas."
"This would allow the more efficient producers to benefit from growing markets while avoiding the huge cost, especially for young farmers, of obtaining production rights."
"The value of the quota system varies tremendously between the Member States."
"Quota levels per Member State are fixed until 31 March 2015, as Mr Freitas rightly said."
"After that date, in the absence of a proposal from the Commission and a decision taken in the Council, the system of milk quotas will end."
"That is important."
"If no decision is taken, the system will expire on 31 March 2015."
"Were the Council to take a decision to continue the quota system after 2015, this should allow for a gradual transition from the current rules to a scenario without production limits."
"It is in everybody's interest to have a soft landing in order to avoid disturbances to the sector."
"When I travel around the Member States and talk to farmers, they ask for predictability."
"We owe it to the farming sector to give them a clear signal, and not a last-minute one on 1 January 2015, as to whether the quota system is to continue or not."
"We need to provide this predictability, and in this scenario specific measures should perhaps be introduced during a transitional period in order to make the milk quota system much more flexible than it is today."
"However, it is still too early to take the appropriate measures."
"We will all have a much clearer idea of the situation, and of the different options for change, once the dairy market outlook report is completed at the end of next year."
"That report will be presented to Parliament and the Council and will look at the overall objectives and results of the 2003 reform, namely market orientation, competitiveness and the sustainability of the CAP in political, environmental and economic and budgetary terms."
"I hope we can have a solid discussion on the future and on how to provide this predictability, which I consider so important, not just for the younger generation but also for those already in business."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks to you for what you have said, but I also want to extend warm thanks to my colleague Mr Freitas for taking the initiative and putting this oral question."
"As you have already, and repeatedly, pointed out, Commissioner, the current state of affairs - that is to say, the decision to retain the quota until 31 March 2015 - and the question as to what will succeed it, is a cause of vigorous debate, particularly in certain regions that are, or believe themselves to be, dependent on milk and on the quotas."
"It is good to hear a clear statement from you - as we indeed just have done - in which you give us the facts - namely, that the quota has been agreed on up to this point - and also tell us that we should have a debate in good time on what we propose to do about the situation."
"If we want to carry on having a quota, then the farmers must be aware of that and supportive of it, exactly in the same way as they have to be of the decision to abandon the system, as is in fact currently being envisaged."
"The question then arises as to what instruments might be feasible in the current financial situation as a means of preparing for its abandonment; it may well be, for example, that an increase in the milk quota is under discussion, but I would venture to express doubt as to whether this is the right way of going about it."
"How are we dealing with the option for young farmers who need the security to plan ahead and who very probably ought not to be investing a great deal more money in quotas, but rather in restructuring for the sake of their own competitiveness?"
"How, too, are we to deal with areas that are nothing more than green spaces and need dairy farming if they are to be maintained as such?"
"These are, in the main, areas with very beautiful and very interesting landscape, in which there are, as a rule, very few other ways available of earning a living, and so we must support them in this way."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, I should like on behalf of my political group to thank the Group of the European Peoples Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and Mr Freitas for his reflections on the question of the Commission statements on milk quotas."
"Commissioner, I shall not refer to what we all know to be the importance of the milk sector in Europe at the level of production, employment, investments, foreign trade or food security."
"However, I would point out that any proposal to abolish or keep milk quotas must be studied promptly and carefully and an analysis must be made of its repercussions, firstly on rural incomes and the other sectors acutely affected, and on rural development itself."
"This analysis should include all the regions of the Union, as well as the peculiarities of milk production in some of them."
"Commissioner, we cannot be in favour of controlling milk production after 2015 under the current preconditions, which often create oligopolies in the sector."
"It is a production model of the previous common agricultural policy philosophy."
"On the other hand, however, we cannot accept the liberalisation of milk production quotas from one day to the next before 2015."
"In this transitional period which we are going through, it is necessary to strengthen measures of transparency, efficacy and competitiveness of the sector in certain regions of the Community."
"Nor can we announce any review of any product within the framework of the health check in 2008-2009."
"If we want to believe that it is a health check, what we have is a simplification of the common agricultural policy."
"I would like to put one question to you: is there any possibility of unbundling subsidies in 2007?"
"How can this be combined with the liberalisation or maintenance of the quota system?"
"Commissioner, I know that you will submit an honest proposal as regards the limits, so as not to give rise to any insecurity among producers."
"I think that you have this political commitment, but above all it is the question of timely consultation with the European Parliament that will give competitiveness and a clear orientation to the sector."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking Mr Freitas for taking the initiative and raising this important topic this evening."
"When talking about the milk quota, it is important to note that the situation when this quota was introduced back in 1984 was completely different from now."
"In 1984, there were large surpluses that could not be sold, and that is clearly no longer the case."
"The difference between the global market prices in 1984 and the price in the European Union was enormous, but it is now considerably less pronounced."
"If EU prices approximate to those on the global market, there is far less reason to have a quota system than there was in 1984."
"I am in complete agreement with the Commissioner's statement a moment ago to the effect that it is important for farmers to know where they stand."
"I do not know when the Commission will be able to indicate the proposals or direction in detail, but it would be ideal, in the framework of the health check, to also address all other components of agricultural policy and also to hear the Commission's view on the quota system."
"The situation in the European Union is not - as somebody has already mentioned - the same everywhere."
"When the Commission presents this analysis, it is important that this is done on a country-by-country, and perhaps even region-by-region basis."
"For some regions, it is important that a quota system remains in place."
"Would the Commission address this aspect during the analysis?"
"Whatever the outcome, on the basis of current knowledge, I think it would be preferable to phase out the quota system over a period of time."
"After all, if we compare the EU's presence in terms of dairy products within the global market today to that in 1984, the situation is now considerably worse, and that is much to be regretted."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, the Commissioner's position on the milk quota system is most worrying, in that she is suggesting that they might be dismantled by 2015."
"Although she says that it is too early to take substantive measures, the path to liberalisation to which she refers overlooks the importance of milk production in various disadvantaged farming areas."
"For example, in Portugal, both in the North and Central Regions of the mainland and in the Autonomous Region of the Azores, any dismantling of the milk quota system would hinder rural development and would impoverish vast areas in which the production of milk and other dairy production is the main activity."
"We therefore emphasise the need to protect the specific characteristics of farming in various Member States and, in particular, in Portugal."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the author of the question for initiating this greatly needed debate on dairy quotas."
"The problems associated with these quotas are a concern for farmers throughout Europe."
"I would like to make the point that if these quotas are to be maintained for a longer period, it raises the obvious question of how high they should be, because the sizes of milk quotas are blatantly unjust: I can cite many examples of how they do not conform to market demand in particular Member States."
"There are countries which are greatly damaged by quotas not being in line with their demand as consumers."
"Examples are Italy and Spain, while Poland, a new Member State, is definitely another one."
"For that reason, if the quotas need to be retained, then the size of these quotas must be reviewed for the sake of fairness and European solidarity."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, since we are on the subject of milk quotas, I want to bring a serious situation to the Commissioner's attention."
"The Irish milk quota sellers' group, whose members are all older farmers, all hold milk quotas which they wish to sell."
"Their decision to sell the quotas is based on illness, infirmity or old age."
"The Irish Minister for Agriculture has stipulated that she will prioritise in favour of young farmers."
"European law prohibits discrimination on the grounds of age, yet our Minister is openly discriminating against older quota owners in favour of young farmers to whom she wishes to give quota - and this is the key - at below market value."
"She proposes to take the cost out of present quota owners' pockets."
"This is interfering with the market."
"Many of these older farmers are at present subject to scaremongering, with inaccurate information from their cooperatives."
"The Minister intends to confiscate quotas not offered for sale on two bases: if the quota owner does not produce for two consecutive years or if the quota owner has a leasing arrangement which expires in March one year and he does not sell his quota by the end of March the following year."
"Minister Coughlan appears to want to divide the traditionally cohesive farming community by the exploitation of one group by another."
"The threat to confiscate quota is an attempt to pressure farmers into poor arrangements and to sell against their will."
"I ask the Commissioner to clarify this situation."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Freitas for the way in which he has presented the European Christian Democrats' initiative, and the Commissioner for opening the debate on the future of dairy products."
"Let us be honest: the situation has changed over the years; high quota costs have caused the cost of milking to soar, while European dairy policy is increasingly becoming snarled up."
"We have now lost 60% of our exports within the global market, and the European Union and the European dairy sector have lost 4% of world production."
"Since current demand for dairy products by far outstrips production globally, Europe would do well to face the facts and ponder the question what to do after 2015."
"On the one hand there are the entrepreneurs who would like to grow but are crippled by the high quota costs."
"On the other hand there are areas in Europe where the quotas are currently no longer being achieved, the United Kingdom being a case in point."
"There is therefore every reason to look at how we can come up with a good timetable after 2015 in order to attain a better and effective system."
"I should like to make a few suggestions in this respect."
"First of all, milk quotas must become tradable internationally."
"The superlevy must be lowered when the quota is being used but when sales are done with virtually no support to the European Union."
"We could also consider levelling the milk quota at European level."
"When one country does not manage to fill the entire quota and another country could do with some more, we could quite simply even the matter out afterwards."
"A gradual quota increase for dairy farmers and cooperatives who sell their products without European support is also conceivable."
"Finally, we advocate an effective use of European funds for rural development in those areas where small dairy farmers face problems in terms of employment and conversion."
"In that way, the Commissioner may well be able to use a good timetable that leads to a more market-oriented focus and, as a member of the Dutch Christian Democratic party, the CDA, I would very much welcome it if the Commissioner were to adopt this line."
"I have to congratulate her, also because a number of these proposals have already been expressed by Mr Rasmussen, Head of Section for Milk and Animal Products in DG Agriculture."
"This bodes well for the future in terms of a timely debate on dairy products."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the mid-term reform of the CAP was announced as simply an intermediary review, but despite this it has been one of the most significant reforms that the policy has undergone since it began."
"Given this history and the public statements that you have been making regarding the quota system in recent months that have generated a significant amount of alarm and uncertainty in the sector, I would like you to make it perfectly clear that the check-up planned for 2008 will assure us that the reform is working and that under no circumstances does the Commission intend to go further, or move forward to the date with regard to which Parliament gave its opinion in the debates on the last reform. I would like to remind you that it was in favour of extending the current rules to the 2014-2015 financial year, in accordance with the Commission's proposal."
"Other colleagues have said the same thing."
"This prospect of stability, Commissioner, which the Commission proposed at that time, remains essential for an economic activity which, like any other, needs to make plans, make investments, pay and prepare for what the future may bring, with a previously established regulatory framework."
"In my region, Galicia, as in others that have been mentioned, such as the Autonomous Region of the Azores or Northern Portugal (and I would like to thank Mr Freitas whose question made this debate possible), farms play a decisive role both in social and environmental terms and also in restoring territorial balance."
"Agricultural unions maintain that it is the Galician model, based on family farms, that is the clearest demonstration of the multifunctional role of these types of farm and their capacity to tie people to the region."
"If the Commission wants to change the rules of the game, it should first explain what it plans to do, when and how it is going to do it."
"This should all be done with maximum transparency, because uncertainty, Commissioner, is the worst scenario for those working in the sector."
"The sector needs stability and not shocks, time to adapt itself and to plan, and I therefore think that we should finish applying the current reform before thinking about the next one."
"(FI) Mr President, milk production is a typical feature of the worst off farming regions."
"It has provided a livelihood and has been a vital force in regions where other areas of agricultural production would be difficult or impossible."
"It has been able to make use of good levels of coarse fodder productivity in areas that are infertile, for example."
"Milk production is capital-intensive."
"The investment needed is massive."
"The modern production structure can cost up to a million euros."
"It only normally creates jobs, however, for family farms."
"Milk production is subject to quotas."
"Many young farmers have made huge investments in acquiring additional production rights."
"It is not uncommon for production quotas to be bought for EUR 150 000 or more."
"Milk production therefore needs a long-term protected framework."
"That cannot be seen as an eight-year goal."
"What is a sound system has resulted in a balanced framework for the farmer in which to engage in production."
"Price fluctuations have been small and the market stable."
"Abolishing milk quotas would alter the situation immediately."
"The large industrial concerns in Europe's best regions would be in a strong competitive position."
"Agricultural diversity would be all the poorer."
"Massive investments in milk quotas by family farms would immediately lose their value."
"The milk markets would lose their stability."
"All this would make the enterprise a very risky one and would have an adverse effect in particular on farming regions that are worse off in terms of their prevailing natural conditions."
"(PL) Mr President, the common agricultural policy has raised many doubts and will continue to do so."
"It will always have its supporters and its opponents."
"The European Commission's intention to review the common agricultural policy, and with it milk quotas, has raised concerns as well as hope, especially in the countries that suffer from it, including Poland."
"The quota allocated to Poland was insultingly low."
"A case in point is Germany, which has 80 million inhabitants, and has a quota of around 28 million tonnes, while Poland, which has half the population, is only allowed some 9 million tonnes of milk."
"In practical terms that means Poland has a quota four and a half million tonnes less than the thirteen to thirteen and a half million tonnes it should be allowed."
"The question we would therefore like to ask is what would happen if milk quotas were abolished, particularly in countries such as Poland, where family-owned farmsteads rather than big farms predominate?"
"Would the change to the rules of the common agricultural policy not force these farms into bankruptcy?"
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, to me it is highly regrettable that the new Member States benefit the least from the common agricultural policy."
"They are participating in this 'Marshall Plan' for agriculture, whose great virtue used to be its long-term focus and vision."
"Well, we joined the European Union late."
"This is not the Commissioner's fault: such is the history of Europe."
"But unfortunately Polish farmers are still grappling with the milk quotas, which are several million tonnes too low, and in the meantime we pay fines for over-production of milk, when they are to be lifted in 2015."
"Unfortunately during that time many Polish milk producers will disappear from the market."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, as a representative of Galicia, a milk-producing region par excellence, I think that this oral question put to the European Commission today is very opportune."
"Commissioner, producers are quite disconcerted by information that has been circulated, from which it can be deduced that there will be changes to the system established in 2003 for the milk sector and specifically concerning the quota system."
"You were not very specific today, Commissioner, but I think that you made a series of things clear: that you are going to launch a debate, that there is going to be a transition period prior to the removal of quotas in 2015, from which I deduce that there is going to be a phasing out period prior to 2015 when quotas are permanently removed."
"Commissioner, we are talking about an economic sector that needs legal security and medium- and long-term guarantees that will enable a minimum degree of planning, and any further change or uncertainty could, at least in my country, have serious social and economic consequences."
"Quotas are a very important asset to farmers."
"In a region like Galicia, in which there is a need to continue with the restructuring process, it is essential, in order to complete it, that the current quota system is maintained as planned."
"If not, the consequences could be catastrophic, as removing quotas would have drastic repercussions for the price of milk, and consequently for profits in the dairy sector."
"I therefore ask, Commissioner, that any transitions be made and ideas proposed from 2015 onwards."
"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the fact that the policies of the Member States need to cooperate in the whole of this process and that therefore any restriction on exchanges of quotas in a Member State should be considered as a serious obstacle to the capitalisation, competitiveness and development of the sector, as is unfortunately the case with the national plan proposed by the Spanish Government."
"(PT) I should once again like to thank you for being in the Chamber, Commissioner."
"Your frequent attendance in Strasbourg is ample demonstration of the continued importance of farming in Europe."
"We have been considering the common agricultural policy."
"My group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, held an important seminar just last week in Brussels on the theme of the CAP as it is and of the CAP as we would like it to be."
"Reflection on the future does not necessarily mean introducing any element of instability."
"Farmers work with nature and value nature's cycles, and markets, as we know, react to all elements of instability."
"That being said, instability does at least rule out inertia, and we must not therefore fall into the old trap of defending the status quo simply for the sake of it."
"Commissioner, the latest statements coming from some quarters have, then, given rise to extraordinary alarm in the sector, to which an appropriate political response needs to be given so that the instability felt by the sector on this matter is not in some cases exploited in the service of untoward political objectives."
"Instability and insecurity can only be tackled by providing regular, transparent information that is as clear as possible."
"I would therefore call on you to adopt as effective as possible a strategy of clarification for the sector and also to make it clear to the sector that the Commission honours its agreements and the arrangements fixed until 2014."
"These arrangements must naturally be fulfilled without prejudice to the debate and without prejudice to the examination of alternative arrangements that may prove appropriate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the ability to have a clear and certain future is very important for any business, none more so than for dairy farmers and for the dairy industry."
"Quotas are in place until 2015 and this I believe was a good decision during the mid-term review."
"But to now cast doubt on this on the part of the Commission sends the wrong message and I am pleased that the Commissioner went some way tonight to assure us of what the Commission's position is."
"Commissioner, you said that quotas have outlived their usefulness."
"Well, OK, you may be right, but I have to say to you that 2015 is a long time away and it is very difficult to crystal-ball gaze and see what conditions will be like at that time."
"In 2015, you rightly say, we should have a soft landing and when the time comes for quotas to disappear I think that soft landing should come into place."
"What I question is the timing."
"So far from the date, by all means let us have an exchange of views on what may or may not happen, but how do we encourage our young people to go into the industry?"
"How do we take young farmers into the industry?"
"How do they plan for the future if the future is being questioned at this moment in time?"
"The dairy sector, as you know only too well, is the backbone of the agricultural industry throughout the European Union."
"We must work together to achieve a sound future for that industry."
"Only by working together can we achieve that sound future."
"I hope that you will take the opportunity to engage with us in the Committee on Agriculture and positively and actively be involved in ensuring that there is a future for the dairy sector, for dairy farmers and for the dairy industry."
"It is not only the people who are employed on the farms who are important; the people who are employed in the processing industries and off the farms are equally important."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we all agree that the European countryside and European farmers and livestock breeders need some certainty."
"The Brussels Agreement in 2002 provided that certainty, and in exchange for it, the Member States tolerated a reform of the CAP that required serious sacrifices for the rural world, especially for the 'cohesion countries'."
"This certainty meant, among other things, that the system of milk quotas would remain in force until 2015, allowing farmers sufficient time to reorganise their farms in order to make them more competitive and, if necessary, to leave the sector."
"But we want the certainties to be maintained, and you know that quotas are the only guarantee for farmers in a market in which prices are falling."
"And quotas are an asset for farmers, who need to have the freedom to transfer and sell them when they want to cease production."
"What uncertainty does, Commissioner, is reduce the value of quotas."
"In my region, Asturias, 94 000 tonnes have been lost in two years due to farmers giving up."
"Between 1996 and 2006 the number of farms has dropped from 30 000 to just 3 200."
"Young farmers, who we all talk about so much, including young farmers with high milk quotas and profitable farms, are leaving the sector."
"The Government has also forbidden transfers of quotas between individuals."
"Our problem, Commissioner, is rural development."
"You are going to do a health check on the common agricultural policy next year."
"We hope that you will be acting as a doctor and not as a forensic scientist."
"Do you think it is right to talk about transitional measures when there is not even sufficient funding secured for rural development?"
"I would like to remind you that, for example, my country is going to lose 50% of rural development funds in the next few years."
"Are you planning to report this situation during the review that you carry out next year?"
"(PL) Mr President, the debate in this House on dairy quotas is intensifying."
"We are all wondering what will happen if we end the quota system for milk production."
"There has been a great deal of criticism which focuses on the fact that the current system is an archaic one which inhibits the development of the dairy sector and makes it less competitive on the world market."
"Ending the system is opposed by the countries which have unfavourable natural conditions for dairy production."
"To them, ending the system will mean that production will shift to other regions, leading to loss of livelihoods and stable incomes for many farmers."
"This may also affect the least developed regions in the east of Poland, Poland being one of the countries that was allocated an unfair, extremely low milk quota."
"We may soon become net importers."
"According to some experts, the negative impact of a rigid quota system will be worse for Poland than for other Member States, because all the system does is restrict opportunities for modernisation and utilising production potential because of the low level of aid for the milk sector in the European Union."
"Many people assert that the milk quotas have lost their economic raison d'etre."
"We are also in negotiations with the WTO, in which we have promised to eliminate export subsidies and greatly reduce the tariffs set up to protect the internal market."
"How will this affect the EU milk market?"
"It appears that limiting the restrictiveness of the system, for instance, by combining wholesale and direct quotas and restricting the penalties for exceeding the limits would be fair at this moment."
"I would like to remind the Commissioner that there are some countries which are not currently using their quotas to the full."
"Mr President, in Ireland they speak of little else."
"I spoke to a large group of dairy farmers in Navan, County Meath on Thursday night and the question they are asking is not so much if quotas will be gone in 2015, but what is going to be done from 2008 to collapse the value of the milk quota."
"I am indebted to last Thursday's edition of the Farmers' Journal for outlining five key points that the Commission has in mind."
"It is well worth bringing them to the attention of the House."
"I believe you are looking at gradually increasing quotas from the health check onwards, reducing super-levy costs to Member States, balancing quotas across the European Union so that an over-quota in one Member State may be taken up by slack in another."
"Cross-border trading is on the table, as is reducing the value of quotas in Member States."
"That is already happening, certainly in Ireland."
"There is a downside to all of this."
"Every single study that I have read on the subject says that the abolition of milk quotas will lead to a substantial drop in milk prices in many Member States and there will be a corresponding increase in production."
"That would happen in Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg."
"The key to all this is that we are all for abolition if markets are positive in 2015, but none of us knows what the markets will be like at that time."
"I look forward to your analysis of the dairy market."
"It will have to take a very close look at the future, because if global markets are not positive I cannot recommend to farmers that they run faster to stand still."
"It makes no sense."
"To those who have concerns about young farmers - and I have many myself, although my little farmers are quite small at the moment! - who would encourage anyone to go into a business where they have to work twice as hard to earn half as much money?"
"It does not make sense."
"We need to bear that in mind."
"The key is the WTO and what happens there."
"But at least we are having a debate and that is a positive sign."
"We should discuss these things more in this House, rather than reading about them in our national newspapers."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Freitas for bringing this forward and the Commissioner for being here tonight, because this debate is really worthwhile."
"We have to face up to the fact that, as milk quotas and set-aside do not fit easily into a decoupled agricultural policy, they will have to be phased out in the future."
"We must also set a date and stick to it, because ever since I have been here quotas have been about to be phased out, and it has never happened."
"We must face the reality that one day they actually will go."
"Everyone in this House accepts the value of dairy production to all our Member States - nowhere more so than in my own region of the UK, the West Country, where dairying is the bread and butter of the whole area but is also under huge pressure."
"What is interesting about quota and the value of quota is that ten years ago in the United Kingdom the rate was nearly a pound a litre, whereas now it is worth a penny a litre."
"We must therefore remember that in many ways quota is not a tangible substance, and its value can disappear overnight."
"We have to be very careful about how we deal with this."
"In the UK, it is the power of the supermarkets and the driving-down of prices which is now the real problem."
"We are not even meeting our national quota, which shows there is a problem with price."
"At certain points over the last 20 years there has been a world increase in dairy trade, but because in Europe control is exercised over the amounts produced, it has never been able to take advantage of this."
"We therefore need to have a more flexible regime in the future."
"I should like to hear the Commissioner's views on that."
"New Zealand - which probably produces milk as effectively as anybody - still has a form of quota, because it has a national cooperative, of which farmers have to be shareholders in order to be able produce extra milk."
"It is interesting to explore the arrangements beyond 2015, but first we must face up to the reality that quotas need to go."
"author. - (PT) Mr President, thank you very much."
"As author of the question, I should very quickly like to ask the Commissioner a specific question, so that we can all leave the House with this issue clearer in our minds."
"We know, as the Commissioner said, that, if nothing is done, the arrangements will end in 2005."
"We also know that, in the view of the Commissioner herself, this is an outdated system that must be brought to an end."
"What we want to know now, and this is the question that I should like to ask you, Commissioner, and that I want you to answer very, very clearly - is whether you accept that phasing out can begin before 2015, as Mr Rasmussen, your representative in Parliament's Committee on Agriculture, assumed it could, or whether the process will begin from 2015 onwards."
"This is a crucial question to which I should like you to give me a very clear answer."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I have listened with great interest to this interesting and very passionate debate."
"It reflects perfectly the importance of the dairy sector."
"As Mr Mulder rightly said, the quota system was introduced in 1984 at a time when we wanted to maintain high prices for our products."
"At that stage, therefore, the quota system was a good idea."
"However, things have changed dramatically over the last 20 years and there was therefore a discussion, as part of the 2003 reform, on what to do with the dairy sector."
"The decision was taken to maintain the quota system until 31 March 2015."
"It was decided to increase quotas and reduce prices."
"The phasing-in of these changes will be finalised next year."
"Then there was the possibility of this health check."
"There is not going to be a new reform in 2008/2009."
"That is important."
"The health check simply provides an opportunity to streamline and simplify the common agricultural policy, in line with the 2003 CAP reform."
"In my dealings with Parliament I always try to play with a very open hand."
"I do not keep my cards close to my chest."
"We need to have a discussion, as part of the health check, on what we do with the quota system when it expires in 2015."
"I have no fixed ideas on phasing-out, but we need to tell the dairy sector whether or not we want to prolong the quota system."
"I am not proposing any changes, as the quota system will expire in 2015 if we do not do anything, but we must therefore tell the sector whether or not we are sticking to the agreement to abolish the quota system in 2015."
"If we say nothing, farmers all over Europe will assume that this will not happen."
"They will keep their quotas on the basis of these still being worth something after 31 March 2015, only for the Council and Parliament to suddenly decide to abolish them, with the value of quotas falling to zero overnight."
"They will be worth absolutely nothing!"
"That is not predictability, and we must therefore send a clear signal of what the future will be."
"As I said in my first contribution, we will have this dairy market outlook report at the end of next year."
"I have a tradition, Mr Nicholson, of working closely with Parliament, and specifically with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, so at that point we can discuss what is going to happen, in order to provide stability and avoid uncertainty for the dairy sector in the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statement (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(HU) In recent times, several reports have been circulating to the effect that the Commission is preparing to reform the organisation of the milk market, an important element of which would be the abolition of milk quotas."
"The Commission has not denied these reports."
"This news is unsettling if only because, in recent years, reform has been undertaken primarily in those sectors in which the system would in any case have ceased to be in force."
"There is no such compelling reason in the case of the milk sector, since the regulations for this sector are in force until 2015 and, moreover, the quota system has been providing the market and producers with adequate stability."
"Should the quota system be abolished, the income of dairy producers would fall across Europe, leading to further concentration in the sector."
"Tens of thousands of farmers producing for the local markets would be obliged to stop production."
"As a result, those Member States in which conditions are less favourable would see their milk production fall significantly."
"This would oblige several Member States to supply their dairy needs predominantly from imports."
"Although in Hungary milk production is primarily in the hands of large-scale industries and is competitive, nevertheless it would not be in the interests of our country either to abolish the quota system."
"Because of current economic difficulties, milk consumption is low, and Hungary is not able to take advantage of the quotas allocated to it."
"At the same time, however, we hope that if the economy picks up then consumption will also rise."
"Therefore, Hungary would find particularly unacceptable any transformation of the quota system that involved transferring the quotas of Member States that make less use of them to those countries that make greater use of them."
"(HU) The reason for maintaining the strict milk quota system is that the quotas that are presently in effect allow for a greater volume of milk production than what the EU consumes internally."
"From 2007 on, direct payments to milk producers have to be kept completely separate from production, that is, payments will be received not by the milk producer but by the one who owns a milk quota during the reference period, in the form of a lump sum based on land area."
"Under current rules, the milk quota system will remain in force until 2014-15."
"Commissioner Fischer Boel stated that in the context of the review, we should look at the question of quotas, but she did not give any concrete details."
"Maintaining the quota system is the sole guarantee of market and price stability."
"Without quotas, production would rise significantly, and the resulting surpluses would bring down prices, which would very easily stifle small producers."
"At the same time, without support only the most competitive industries would be able to compete with the pressure from imports or to succeed on the export market."
"In Hungary, milk production is steadily declining due to problems of efficiency; in spite of the fact that purchase prices are not falling, we are using only around 70% of the Community quota allocated to us."
"Unfortunately, in contrast to Western European practice, producers here do not own the processing establishments."
"If the quota system were abolished, the proportion of imported products would rise, making the problems of competitiveness among Hungarian producers even more evident, and the fall in domestic production would probably accelerate."
"For all these reasons, I do not support the abolition of the milk quota system."
"Support for rural development by the EAFRD - Voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP (debate)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, before going into the content of the reports I want to thank the rapporteurs, Lutz Goepel and Jan Mulder, along with the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their efforts in drafting the two reports."
"I should like to start with Mr Goepel's report."
"I have carefully taken note of the Committee on Agriculture's position, which is to reject the proposal concerning voluntary modulation and call on the Commission to withdraw the proposal."
"Before addressing some of the report's points I should like to recall why I presented the proposal and what the guiding principle was for the drafting of it."
"The Commission proposal is a response to a request made by the European Council last December to present a proposal on voluntary modulation."
"Such a modulation was a means to enable Member States to transfer funds from the first pillar of the common agricultural policy into the second pillar in order to reinforce the rural development budget, an objective with which most of you would agree."
"I have expressed my concerns about certain aspects of the Council agreement, in particular that it would apply both to direct payments and to market-related expenditure as well as the fact that it derogates significantly from the basic rules of rural development expenditure."
"The Commission tries to address those concerns to the greatest extent possible and ensure as much coherence as possible with the rules governing compulsory modulation and rural development spending."
"That is in line with the Commission's declaration on the interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspectives."
"With regard to some arguments in Mr Goepel's report, it is said that voluntary modulation would lead to a distortion of competition."
"I do not share that view."
"Both the single farm payment and rural development expenditure are considered as non-trade distorting under the WTO rules."
"It is claimed that there is no proper impact assessment."
"Firstly, in the short time available during the meeting last December that simply was not feasible."
"Secondly, it would have encountered methodological difficulties since we have no idea which Member States would apply voluntary modulation, and if they did so, we have no idea of the percentages they would apply."
"So, the proposal does not go against the principles of rural development, such as national cofinancing."
"We propose optional cofinancing as a compromise, to meet the expectations of the Council."
"Let me now turn to the Mulder report on the proposed amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005."
"The text is a legal translation of what was decided last September by the heads of state and government in relation to the so-called 'capping provision', which is common to all structural instruments, including the Rural Development Fund, and is also reproduced in the general regulation on the structural funds."
"Moreover, the text reflects the non-cofinancing requirement for an amount of EUR 320 million as part of the Rural Development Fund allocation to Portugal, which was also agreed at last December's Council meeting."
"I have taken note of the draftsman's position, in particular on cofinancing."
"I agree that the exemption of EUR 320 million for Portugal from the requirement of national cofinancing should be an exception in rural development, since cofinancing is a basic rule in rural development."
"It also means co-responsibility for expenditure and it is an essential element of the subsidiarity that is applied in the policy implemented in the various Member States or regions."
"I look forward to a fruitful discussion on this issue."
"I will respond at the end of the debate."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, let me take this opportunity to once more express warm thanks to all my fellow Members from all the groups who have supported me in creating a framework worthy of this debate, which is of such great importance to this House and to Europe's farmers."
"You, Mr President, by your wise and astute decision, have ensured that Members from all groups will get the chance to speak, albeit at a rather later hour."
"Following a decision by the Council - which, as is so often the case with agriculture debates, is notably absent today - the Commission submitted a proposal according to which 20% of agricultural direct payments would be shifted from the first pillar of CAP to the second, from which they could be spent without mandatory co-funding."
"That is a concession by the majority on the Council and, whether it wishes to or not, on the part of the Commission, as part of the budget compromise reached in December 2005."
"The Commissioner has confirmed as much."
"This House has already expressed strong misgivings about this in the interinstitutional agreement on the Financial Perspective."
"When I say that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development firmly rejected this proposal, I mean that it did so with only three dissenting votes, and its rejection of the draft legislation was indeed unanimous."
"This is not just about differences of opinion where specific policies are concerned; it is also about where Parliament, as an institution, should stand in the forthcoming debates on the reorientation of the Community budget."
"As part of the Budget compromise, all the institutions agreed that all the Community's outgoings, among them the post-2013 agricultural expenditure in particular, should be subject to review, and that this House will play a full part in this process from an early stage."
"Now, though, we see the Council adopting, through the back door, an extensive remodelling of agricultural funding, and this House has no option but to kill it off, for there was no prior consultation with us."
"Instead, the Council has decided to proceed with such an extensive reallocation of resources that there will be such limited scope for debate in 2008-2009 that serious discussion will scarcely be on the cards."
"This is something that we in this House cannot tolerate if we are to be taken seriously in future, and the proposal is, moreover, questionable in terms of financial policy."
"What is worthy of note on the agricultural policy side is that there is no impact assessment accompanying the proposal."
"On the contrary, the impression is given that a short-term reduction of 20% in direct payments would not cause farmers any problems."
"Taken together with the cuts resulting from mandatory modulation and those generally expected after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, what this means, for those Member States that want to apply this voluntary modulation, is a reduction in payments of something like one-third over against what they were in 2003."
"Far from supporting structural change in agriculture, that amounts to a flagrant structural violation that would put the viability of many thousands of farms in rural areas at risk."
"It is generally agreed that what our farmers need is the security to plan ahead."
"In the absence of any impact assessment on the part of either the Council or the Commission, we caused evaluations to be carried out, and these confirm, not only that there will be massive distortion of competition and illegal discrimination against the farmers concerned, but also that modulation does nothing to serve the objects of the Community in rural areas, but rather jeopardises them to a considerable degree."
"To date, the Council has offered no response whatever to the legitimate concerns of Europe's farmers, and there has as yet been no discussion of the potential consequences."
"This sort of behaviour is not at all what we are used to in the European Union and is also quite obviously inappropriate."
"Since, moreover, the transferred Community funds are not to be spent in accordance with a strategy laid down at Community level, we find ourselves in the paradoxical situation in which the renationalisation of agriculture policy is being paid for entirely from Community funds, particularly when one considers the way the Council is thinking ahead;"
"I would ask you to take a look and see what happens at the next meeting on 14 November, this very week."
"We all want to strengthen rural areas."
"We have put forward proposals for solutions to their financial problems that are worthy of discussion; the Böge report is just one of them."
"The Council, though, preferred not to give these proposals any closer attention, so let us not reach out a hand to help it after all that we have done already."
"If there has to be a paradigm shift in agriculture policy, then let that happen only after a transparent and open debate in which Parliament, too, can have a decisive part to play, for this proposal is wide of the mark - legally, in terms of its substance, and as policy - and solves none of the problems that rural areas have."
"If we want our contribution to future debates on the valuation of the agricultural budget to be taken at all seriously, then we should firmly and forthrightly reject this proposal."
"I hope that the Council's response to the vote in this House will be to embark on a more in-depth discussion of the matters at issue."
"My colleagues in the committee, and I myself, are willing to join them in this, but the Council must make a move."
"It has to be said, though, that it probably does not entertain very high hopes at the present time."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, my report has received unanimous approval in this House's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"We considered additional aid for rural development in Portugal to be justifiable; although this was not, of course, ideal, it did form part of a package of measures nodded through by the Council in December, it was not something to which this House, during the negotiations on the financial perspectives, thought it necessary to make any changes."
"I should like to repeat, though, that it is not ideal and should remain an exception."
"We have to accept, after all, that something similar has been agreed on for various other countries as well."
"I should now like - with your permission, Mr President - to turn to the Goepel report."
"With regard to the financial perspectives, which were subsequently approved by this House as a whole, the committee made it quite clear that Parliament has suspended its verdict with regard to voluntary modulation."
"It is therefore surprising that the Commission should come up with a proposal so promptly."
"It has, actually, only followed the Council's 'orders', for want of a better word."
"I disagree with the Commissioner that there is no danger of a renationalisation of European agricultural policy; it is something I regard as a very dangerous trend."
"What matters most of all to the European farmer is the common market of soon to be 500 million consumers who we must try to retain as much as possible."
"In addition, as Mr Goepel has already indicated, it can hardly be said that there has been any examination of the policy's effects."
"It may well be that around 2013, the average farmer in Europe, as a result of all manner of measures, will need to make do with one third less of what he received in 2004."
"Is that the reliable authority that the European Union wants to be?"
"What are the consequences of this?"
"Can farmers survive this measure in certain regions and suchlike?"
"We have not received an analysis of it, and it would appear to me that the Commission has no choice, when the proposal is submitted, but to analyse its effects."
"One of the most important prerogatives of this Parliament, upon which Mr Bösch will undoubtedly elaborate, is the right to enact the Budget."
"We have approved the financial perspectives, which contain precise figures, with so much being set aside for this, so much for that and, among others, so much for market measures in the framework of European agricultural policy and so much for rural policy."
"If voluntary modulation were to be implemented, it would have an impact on these figures."
"Does that not amount to a change to the financial perspectives?"
"I do believe that it does."
"A change to the financial perspectives requires approval by the budgetary authority, that being the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"I am not at all certain that Parliament will go along with this."
"That is why I will be voting against the Commission proposals on voluntary modulation."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have not been in this House long, but I have been here long enough to realise that solid agreement between the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets, such as we have here with the rejection of this draft, is not that frequent an occurrence."
"The opinion of the Committee on Budgets does, of course, concentrate on the issues of relevance to the budget, and there are with regard to these sufficient arguments available to justify the firm repudiation of the Commission's proposal."
"The Member States can, by way of voluntary modulation, unilaterally and without consultation with Parliament, increase non-mandatory expenditure on rural development by many billions of euros, contrary to the wording and spirit of the interinstitutional agreement."
"Nor has the Commission adequately thought through the budgetary consequences of a voluntary transfer of this kind."
"It is irresponsible of the Commissioner to declare herself once more to be taking down dictation from the Council and not to have carried out an impact assessment before the proposal was adopted."
"What will be this proposal's effects on the common agricultural policy?"
"We do not know that any more than she does, and yet we are supposed to agree to it; well, we are not going to."
"Perhaps then exactly the same thing will happen as did with the European aid arrangements for cotton, which the ECJ declared null and void at the beginning of September this year; there, too, the considerable economic effects of the reform had been underestimated or insufficiently examined."
"Moreover, the proposal contradicts everything previously laid down concerning modulation, since it makes no provision for cofinancing on the part of the Member States."
"What our Heads of Government have come up with in order to fill the hole in the rural budget, for which they were responsible, is a cheap solution; if the Council were really interested in topping up the funds for the second pillar, they could quite simply have complied with this House's demands in respect of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"What we should do with this proposal is reject it, and firmly."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, according to Government figures, the average earnings of farmers in my constituency in Scotland in 2005 were GBP 10 000, or EUR 14 000."
"This is disastrous: it is forcing farmers into bankruptcy!"
"They do not have any room for reinvestment in the industry."
"Instead of offering practical help, Prime Minister Blair comes up with the startling proposal to slash 20% off farmers' single-farm payments, on top of the existing 5% compulsory modulation that already exists and, as we have heard from Mr Goepel, a further 8% that will be deducted to pay for Bulgaria and Romania."
"In other words, British farmers - as Britain appears to be the only Member State really pushing for this voluntary modulation - will lose roughly 33% of their subsidy, which for many of them is a vital lifeline."
"But worse, this naked discrimination against UK farmers will place them at a huge competitive disadvantage to all other farmers in every other Member State in Europe."
"I say to the Commissioner: it may be that in the eyes of the WTO this does not amount to trade distortion, but in the pockets of farmers it certainly amounts to a catastrophe."
"I must also protest at the threats being issued by the UK Government, which tells us that if we vote against voluntary modulation it will compromise the future of the popular agri-environment schemes in which many UK farmers have participated."
"This is tantamount to blackmail and coming from a government that has imposed more than 80 stealth taxes, from a Chancellor - Gordon Brown - who has made taxation in the UK higher than Germany or France and now wants us to believe that he needs to slash 25% off our farmers' single-farm payments in order to be able to afford agri-environment schemes, it is an absolute joke."
"I can tell Mr Brown that if he watches the way this House votes on this proposal, he will see what we think of his sense of humour."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are being called on today to take a stand on a proposal on rural development policy which we consider to be invalid, contradictory and dangerous to the future of the CAP itself, as well as to our own credibility."
"This is, of course, a proposal which emerged from a contradictory compromise by the European Council last December."
"On the other hand, however, it is worth our emphasising that the Commission proposal tries to improve the outcome of this highhandedness on the part of the European Council towards both the institutions and the Treaty itself."
"We agree in principle with the Commission proposals for defining the measure on a multiannual basis at national level and retaining the limits which exist in the Rural Development Fund."
"However, although these improving proposals could be considered as a good effort by the Commission towards the Council, they cannot be considered adequate."
"As the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we shall vote against the legislative text of the Commission regulation on voluntary modulation at this stage for the following reasons: firstly, in order to strengthen the Commission's negotiating position with the Council, which in essence wants voluntary modulation as a blank cheque for managing Community expenditure under pillars 1 and 2."
"Secondly, in order to give the Commission the time needed to present an integrated proposal which responds to the real needs and the real rural development support mechanisms, without renationalising the CAP."
"Thirdly, in order to provide a time margin for studying the effective and essential possibility of taking up Community resources transferred from compulsory modulation and from the new additional modulation, in order to avoid the return of significant resources from the Member States due to inadequate application of the programmes."
"Commissioner, there is already a timetable for evaluating the new CAP and its priorities."
"We expect the Commission to examine measures for viable, effective, simple and transparent policies which will contribute towards the objectives of rural convergence and development."
"You will find my group in agreement with such a policy."
"A ceiling on payments and an additional single modulation rate are policies with which we can agree in principle."
"However, they will have to be clarified as to their expediency, their added value and the degree to which they help to achieve the objective of rural convergence."
"Commissioner, only under these preconditions will the Commission be able to submit an integrated proposal so that, all together, we can save European aspirations and our credibility in the eyes of the citizens of Europe."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel, for their excellent reports."
"Voluntary modulation is a bit of an oddity, something which has never been tried before in the EU's common agricultural policy."
"The conclusion adopted by the European Council that a Member State may cut a farmer's direct aid and marketing payments by a maximum of 20% was both unexpected and very badly formulated."
"The European Council decided that even export aid could be cut."
"Luckily, the Commission did not go along with this totally unrealistic proposal."
"First of all, the cut would not be based on any objective rules but would merely be the result of high-handedness on the part of a Member State."
"It would lead to inequality among farmers and would distort competition."
"It would amount to an arbitrary additional tax on farmers."
"Secondly, it needs to be made very clear that the cut would not increase resources for rural development in the countries concerned."
"This additional funding would not be affected by national cofinancing as contained in the Regulation on rural development."
"A Member State could use modulated cash in place of its own national funding and thus reduce it."
"It would then of course be a case of a direct payment of agricultural aid to the Member State's Ministry of Finance."
"How could the European Parliament deal with discharge as regards such a transfer of funds?"
"Voluntary modulation would entail moving funds from the EU budget's compulsory expenditure to non-compulsory expenditure."
"That would mean that the interinsitutional agreement would have to be altered."
"The Council would thus be in violation of that agreement six months after it was concluded."
"The Council would therefore not be a reliable partner in the agreement."
"For these reasons I warmly welcomed Mr Goepel's suggestion that Parliament should reject the proposal."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Mulder, we are, today, discussing the second pillar and rural economic development, something that this House, and - if one is to believe its own utterances - the Commission too, regard as important, and even the members of the Council, in their speeches, keep on emphasising that this is where the future of European agricultural policy lies, yet here we are, rejecting a proposal that is intended, to all outward appearance, to put several billions of euros aside for this purpose."
"It is not easy to justify this rejection on the basis of the money involved, but the offer being made to us is an improper one."
"The powers that have caused it to be made are those who are responsible for rural development falling EUR 20 billion short of the budget proposal made by this House and the Commission; it is they who have forced through budget cuts come what may - not least to the detriment of this qualitative line - and are now saying: 'OK, you can take 20 per cent out of the first pillar, and then use it to top up what we have taken away from you.'"
"That is what I call improper."
"These powers are no friends to European agriculture, or, indeed, to Europe's rural areas; what they are seeking to do instead is to use the agriculture budget as a quarry in the same way as they are trying to do with many other policy areas, but what makes this so very deceitful is that it has the appearance of being a redistribution while not really being one, with the possibility of taking the money out without co-funding, so, in other words, the agriculture budget is, as a whole, more likely to lose something than have anything added to it."
"This is in fact not the proposal that the committee made for medium-term financial planning, in which we said that co-funding in the first pillar too would have made it possible for funds to be made available for the second; we would in fact have been able to restrict the co-funding of the second pillar to 25%, thus enabling a better flow of funds, but all these proposals were cast to the winds, and now along they come with this figure of 20%."
"The only thing is, Commissioner, that this financial plan has been agreed to by the Commission, and also - and this I have to say with bitter regret - by this House, which has gone along with this extortion in order not to put the European Union's financial future at risk."
"Commissioner, that must not be allowed to hamper us, though, and I will ask you just what you propose to do in order that rural development is not starved of funding."
"What are we in this House to do? How are we, in our groups, to make it clear that rural development can have a future not only through the reallocation of funds, and that this whole budget line must develop its financial arrangements independently, in the same way as the other structural funds have done?"
"It is to that question that I would like to have an answer from you, here and now, in order that the Commission, in our next negotiations on this subject, should show its colours more openly and that we, here in this House might perhaps stand up for ourselves a bit more."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, I should firstly like to stress the importance of adopting Mr Mulder's report, thereby giving assent to the Commission's proposal to exempt Portugal from the requirement to cofinance the amount of EUR 320 million, in line with the December 2005 Financial Council Agreement."
"My country, Portugal, faces known difficulties in meeting the unfair criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, given the fragility of our economy and the accumulating social problems, especially in rural areas."
"Hence the importance of adopting this proposal."
"As regards the Goepel report, I wish, secondly, to say that we are in favour of compulsory modulation, accompanied by capping and by the fair redistribution of these funds, and in the new Member States too."
"As previous speakers have said, this is not guaranteed in this Commission proposal. We therefore call on you, Commissioner, to reconsider your proposal."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Goepel on his excellent report, whose views I fully share."
"Although the proposed modulation directly affects the old Member States, it is also cause for concern among farmers in the new Member States."
"The modulation impairs the vision of stable agricultural rules until 2013, and will lead to what we fear greatly in the new Member States, that is, a partial re-nationalisation of agricultural policy, which the new, poorer Member States will not be able to afford."
"That is the reason for our concern."
"Let us adhere to the established agricultural policy rules."
"Keeping them stable until 2013 is the minimum of certainty we owe to our farmers."
"They have been subjected to too many upheavals in a short time: changes to the support system, liberalisation of agricultural markets, and increasingly stringent norms and standards in various fields."
"It is all too much, too soon."
"What agriculture needs is clear and stable rules for at least the coming few years."
"That is why I support Mr Goepel's report."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, today's debate on the voluntary modulation of direct payments once again highlights the different ways in which the old and the new Member States understand the common agricultural policy."
"When the old members think of the future of the CAP, they think of the future of agriculture in their own countries, rather than in the enlarged European Union."
"Rejecting the Commission's proposal is the most appropriate course of action."
"The claim that it is contrary to the rules of competition and solidarity, threatens re-nationalisations and breaks the promises made to the farmers, is correct."
"The point is, why were these arguments not considered when setting out the terms of accession for the new Member States in 2004?"
"These conditions have blatantly undermined competition and the principles of solidarity."
"The poorer states, who receive much lower payments, are forced to compete on unequal terms."
"Re-nationalisation of the common agricultural policy was introduced in the new Member States, which in 2004 paid as much as 75% to the first pillar, while the old fifteen members benefit from 100% EU support."
"This is hypocrisy."
"The terms of accession were not based on objective criteria, but discriminatory production quotas were imposed which took no account of the potential of producers and self-sufficiency in food production for example, the milk sector."
"Support in the most obvious cases (fruit and vegetable growing) has been neglected, and no consideration has been given to the extremely low income of farmers in the new Member States."
"This mindset is a threat to farmers, to consumers and to the entire economy of the European Union."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their excellent reports and by saying that I endorse the proposals contained in their reports."
"The Council's decision last December to allow voluntary modulation may lead to distortion of competition between the farmers of different Member States, depending on the percentages of modulation that they choose to adopt."
"The fact that there is soon to be a health check on the CAP 2008, in which we shall be able to discuss capping and the increase in compulsory modulation, is a further reason not to press ahead now with measures such as voluntary modulation, which may bring irreversible consequences."
"If this proposal is pushed through, we shall clearly be taking a further step towards renationalising the CAP and dismantling the communitisation of agricultural policy."
"Without wishing to underplay the political importance of rural development, I must say that investment in this policy will not be boosted by this measure."
"Let me give the example of my country, which returns more second-pillar funding to Brussels than any other country and which, in the EU-15, already had the largest balance between the first and second pillars, 53% and 47% respectively."
"Nevertheless, the Minister for Agriculture in my country, Portugal, has already announced the intention to adopt 20% modulation."
"Taking back money from farmers in order to fund the State budget or so that the money can be given back to Brussels will certainly not be the best solution for farmers, and it represents an approach based solely on economic criteria and aimed at using the money for rural development without cofinancing."
"With these practical risks, which are already clearly apparent in countries like Portugal - as evidenced by the example I mentioned - it is abundantly clear that, if we are to defend farmers resolutely and to champion a common agricultural policy, we must do all we can to ensure that voluntary modulation goes no further."
"(PL) Mr President, like my colleague before me, I would like to express my support for Mr Mulder's draft report on exempting Portugal from the requirement to cofinance its national quota of EUR 320 million."
"This is a good decision which shows solidarity, and is particularly important in the light of the drought that has hit that country."
"I concur fully with Mrs Batzeli's words on Mr Goepel's report, but as regards Mr Mulder's report, and in particular the final section, where the rapporteur criticises the method by which rural development funds are distributed under the current rules, and where he demands that distribution be based on objective criteria, I would like to draw your attention to the following facts."
"The new Member States are characterised by significant under-investment in the farming sector and their farmers' incomes are vastly disproportionate to those in the other Member States."
"They are also ignored as regards the fundamental principles of non-discrimination, solidarity and proportionality, and by having to cofinance direct payments from their own budgets, which are much smaller, not to mention the huge reduction of around EUR 20 billion in the pool of funds for rural development for 2007-2013 in comparison to what was promised during the accession negotiations."
"Here I must also point out that support for rural development as set out in the strategic Community guidelines should make allowance for the differing structural problems in the fifteen and the ten EU member states, including Bulgaria and Romania."
"Particular attention must be paid to ensuring the necessary funding for the new Member States in respect of their huge need for basic investment and the need to secure wide-ranging support for rural development."
"Rural development policy offers a range of mechanisms which make it possible to influence the differing needs of European farmers."
"However, we need to search further for effective mechanisms for such a policy in order for it to fulfil its aims and to make it increasingly effective for all countries of the European Union."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I too should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his steadfast work, not only on budgetary issues in general, but also on issues concerning the funding of agricultural and rural policies."
"If, in my capacity as permanent rapporteur on the Structural Funds within my committee, I asked to take the floor in this debate on the modification of the ceilings on EAFRD development support, it was to express two things: firstly, a 'democratic' regret, but also a kind of 'strategic' wish."
"I deeply regret the fact that the European Parliament is being forced to change the ceilings that it has already adopted, and this in order to bring them into line with the decisions taken by the Council."
"Furthermore, my 'strategic' wish consists in pointing out our attachment to the fundamental principles of rural development policy, and the extent of that attachment, because these principles give Europe transparency."
"I should like us to remain very cautious when faced with the temptation to make wider use of obligatory cofinancing, which could eventually lead to the renationalisation of expenditure under the first pillar."
"Such a decision must not be the subject of a 'go with the flow' policy, but must be considered as an important issue to be subjected to a clear and democratic debate."
"As for the necessary - and undoubtedly justifiable - Christmas 'presents' given to Portugal, on this subject too I regret that there is no real strategy and I would ask that we define one and that it be the outcome of an in-depth debate."
"(PL) Mr President, the proposal for so-called 'voluntary modulation' by the Member States as regards direct payments to agriculture will in effect lead to a cut of some 20% in the funds paid out to farmers, which will be in breach of the norms and procedures prevailing in the European Union."
"Exempting farms receiving less than EUR 5 000 from modulation means that only farms under 40 hectares will be covered."
"This system, which is on the face of it logical, cannot be cohesive, merely due to the fact that the new Member States, unlike the old countries, are already cofinancing the common agricultural policy by topping up EU payments from their own budgets."
"In my opinion, we should aim to eliminate the existing imbalances and introduce new rules and payments in all Member States as quickly as possible."
"Otherwise regional inequalities will intensify."
"I would like to remind this House that it was we Polish MEPs who warned of the consequences of approving an EU budget of just 1% of GNP and cutting rural development funds."
"(PL) Mr President, direct payments give many poor Polish farming families a chance to make ends meet."
"They have been a way of buffering the increased cost of production since Poland's accession to the European Union."
"Using voluntary modulation to reduce them by as much as one third from 2008, at a time when they are so low in our country anyway, would cause substantial losses to these farms and families."
"The important aim of developing rural areas, to which the money thus saved would be directed, should be pursued on the basis of other funds."
"We could restrict regional payments to recipients with a maximum not of 50, but of 100, 200 or 500 and more hectares."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their reports."
"My first point is that this is an extremely bad proposal."
"We know how it originated in the Council meeting last December."
"I would say to the Commissioner that this is a proposal that will only be implemented in the United Kingdom."
"We all know that."
"Even the dogs in the street know that."
"It has been brought in to help Blair and his government try and resolve their problem."
"It will place United Kingdom farmers in an impossible position."
"Financially, they will be in a totally invidious position compared to other farmers in all parts of the other 24 EU Member States."
"In Northern Ireland it will erode the concept of the family farm, which is the backbone of our industry."
"I therefore totally reject this proposal, and will not stand by and allow anyone to hijack farmers' single farm payments."
"This was something that was agreed."
"It was promised and it is depended upon."
"It is not the fault of our farmers that the UK Government has negotiated such a miserable deal on development of the second pillar in support of the rural economy."
"I must say to the Commission, the Council and the UK Government that they should not blame us if now they do not have sufficient funds to support some of their proposals for the rural and environmental development of the countryside."
"I can take no blame for this."
"It is totally the responsibility of the negotiators."
"I must also tell the truth, which is that the so-called negotiators have achieved the worst possible deal, and that they now want to hijack a maximum of 20% or perhaps even 25% of farmers' single farm payments."
"Such a proposal must not be agreed to, either now or in the future."
"It will turn farmers and other members of rural society against each other."
"It is unworkable and will spell the beginning of the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy as we have known it."
"It must not be accepted."
"This dossier will have to be referred back to committee, and I will call on the Commission not to fall into what is a skilful trap that would set farmers and other rural dwellers at each others' throats."
"We have a duty to reject this legislation."
"We must never agree to this covert means of undermining UK farmers and placing them in a position so subservient to the rest of the European Union."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is familiar with the 2003 CAP reform, which provided for the freezing of the first pillar and the strengthening of the second, namely rural development."
"The fact is that the agreement on the new financial perspective - which, I might add, I voted against - runs counter to these two commitments."
"Indeed, the rural development package has lost EUR 20 billion in comparison with the Commission proposal, a figure that represents, for the 15 old Member States, 35% less than the current period."
"The proposal for voluntary additional modulation, which is aimed at transferring a maximum of 20% of the sums from the first to the second pillar and which does not meet any of the criteria applicable to rural development policy, is unacceptable."
"I recognise that the European Commission has attempted, in its proposal for a regulation, to manage this tool, but I share the rapporteur's concerns and I endorse his proposal that it be rejected: the risk of distorted competition is too great if certain Member States choose to deduct 20% from direct aid and not from other types of aid."
"It is unacceptable for this voluntary modulation not to have to comply with the same rules as those that normally apply to rural development, and the risk of the CAP being renationalised is too great."
"The funding requirements for rural development policy are, however, real, and I fear more people abandoning our rural areas."
"That is why I am calling on the Commission to propose, instead of voluntary modulation, an identical increase in the rate of compulsory modulation in all of the Member States."
"I should also like to stress that compulsory modulation currently applies as soon as a farm receives more than EUR 5 000 in agricultural support per year."
"The large majority of farms are, indeed, affected."
"If we are to have a genuine tool for redistributing aid, we should also take account of other criteria, such as the size of the farm, its dependence on aid, the workforce employed, the standard gross margin, and so on. Furthermore, if we are to guarantee that agricultural support is divided up fairly, we should think about capping direct aid."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the UK delegation in my group."
"We fully understand the cogency of the arguments in the Goepel report and the reasons for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's voting indications."
"However, the approach of successive Westminster governments to EU rural development funding has restricted its availability in the UK."
"Our allocation for 2007 to 2013 is only a quarter of what fairness would in principle require."
"In default of some further degree of modulation, there would be severe constraints on establishing and maintaining effective rural development programmes, particularly in relation to the environment."
"There is also a risk of delays in making some of the payments of which farmers have a legitimate expectation."
"I am grateful to the Commission for its willingness to explore the ways in which it might be possible to overcome such immediate practical problems, but that can only be a stopgap."
"We need a much longer-term solution."
"We therefore call on the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to find a way of redressing the current historical imbalances in the allocation of rural development funding."
"As a Scot, I ask that, in any further discussions on modulation, both the Commission and colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture take account of the fact that the levels are of concern not only to Member States but to administrations at sub-state level as well."
"(PL) Mr President, in thanking both of our colleagues for their work, I would like to focus more closely on Mr Mulder's report."
"We are raising a question that affects the mechanism of funding designated for areas inhabited by some 20% of the population of the European Union, but which are very important as regards secure food supplies for Europe."
"We therefore need to do everything to strengthen the position of rural areas and secure the cohesion that we are supposed to provide."
"The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Regional Development should also serve this purpose."
"This is essential for all countries, including my own country, Poland."
"Although today we are debating changes to the regulations affecting Portugal - which I support - we need to stress clearly that this has upset the sequence of things."
"First of all the procedure should be set out, and only then the specific financial decisions made."
"Therefore, let us treat this as an exceptional situation and look for systemic solutions which, based on as objective and non-discriminatory criteria as possible, will really strengthen European farming."
"Any other course of action may end up by destroying European solidarity in this area."
"(PL) Mr President, in order to keep European agriculture competitive, we must maintain the current level of direct farm payments in the old Member States, and not introduce the additional modulation of 20%."
"The arguments put forward by the European Commission are unconvincing, while the proposition does not conform to the principles of the CAP."
"The new Member States need more funds for the development of rural areas, for reasons which include reducing the labour-intensity of farming and to speed up the transfer of land from social and small farms to large-scale market farms."
"This will improve the competitiveness of farming in the new Member States, mainly through economies of scale."
"Instead, what has been done?"
"If you remember, the new financial perspective adopted for 2007-2013 cut the rural development funds by 20 billion euro compared to what was proposed by the Commission."
"We must apply different methods of support, because there is a distinction between the countryside and farming in the European Union."
"Rural areas in European Union countries, including Poland, are poorer than the cities, and need more jobs, the development of services and better environmental protection."
"For this reason we need to support farmers and the countryside throughout the European Union for many years to come."
"(PT) I should like to congratulate Mr Mulder on his admirable report and to thank the members of the committee, who voted unanimously to adopt the report."
"The decision to exempt Portugal from cofinancing for the amount of EUR 320 million is a fair one and comes on the back of a number of Council decisions aimed at offsetting the recognised difficulties faced by Portuguese farmers in relation to the CAP as it stands, whereby farmers have been manifestly penalised."
"This is a way of compensating them."
"As for the Goepel report, regrettably I am not able to extend the same congratulations, because this is an eminently political matter and we must use political arguments to discuss it."
"We all know that the CAP unfairly works against various Member States, various regions and many farmers, and one way of correcting that injustice is to apply modulation mechanisms."
"In the case of Portugal, this distortion is utterly scandalous; just 5% of farmers receive more than EUR 5 000 per year."
"Consequently, given that voluntary modulation is possible and that compulsory modulation is currently impossible, voluntary modulation is preferable to having no modulation at all."
"I therefore feel that the positions that have come to light are deeply inappropriate. I should like to reassure the Commissioner that she is not alone in defending this position in Parliament."
"I believe that, in the interests of justice, it is only right that funds be given to the Member States. I should like to draw Mr Nicholson's attention to the fact that it is not only the United Kingdom that will apply the measure; the Portuguese Government has already announced that it will do so."
"I feel, therefore, that not allowing the Member States to use this instrument to do the right thing in relation to many farmers who are unable to receive a single cent under the first pillar of the CAP, or restricting their ability to do so, is a totally inappropriate position for Parliament to take."
"I say this solely on the basis of political arguments because I have neither the time nor the desire to discuss legal, technical and other aspects of the issue."
"(HU) Mr President, the use of the current Community payments, when placed alongside the decision of the European Council taken in December 2005, according to which Portugal receives special treatment through an exemption from the cofinancing requirement, raises serious questions about the budgetary decision-making process."
"In spite of the fact that there is broad agreement on the exceptional exemption of Portugal from the cofinancing requirement, questions and problems of legitimacy may arise in relation to the horse trading methods of negotiation engaged in by the Council."
"Although I do not oppose this one-time concession offered to Portugal, I consider it important that in future no Member State be allowed to benefit from special treatment solely in order to persuade it to support a particular agreement."
"On the contrary, equality and transparency are fundamental criteria that should be observed in all circumstances, and at every level of negotiation with the Council."
"In future, not only must we prevent these forms of positive discrimination, but since we have committed ourselves to an egalitarian agricultural policy, then the regulation of rural development should not be permitted to rely on exceptions."
"We need to put an end to all forms of discrimination."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the system should not make any distinctions or exceptions, but that we need a fair, standardised approach that distributes resources on the basis of objective criteria."
"However, I do not agree with the rapporteur that it would be a good solution to finance the direct payments in the first pillar, because although this would lessen pressure on the European budget, it would cause serious financing problems for the new Member States, which are in a strained budgetary situation because of the convergence programmes necessary for the introduction of the euro."
"As a result, this would further increase inequalities among Member States."
"For the same reason, I do not consider voluntary modulation to be the most appropriate solution."
"Apart from respecting current agreements, in future we must strive to create a truly united rural policy instead of making further exceptions."
"Mr President, I should like to thank both rapporteurs for their reports."
"When I reread the Presidency Conclusions, these seven lines of text read worse now than they did almost a year ago."
"It is literally a free-for-all for any Member State that wants to take it up and it has no regard for the rules that this House, and indeed the Council itself, had drawn up in relation to rural development."
"Voluntary modulation as outlined in this proposal is anything but voluntary, because the farmers certainly do not want it."
"Therefore we are misusing and abusing words."
"Of course this proposal distorts."
"It has to, because it is allowed in one Member State but it may not be applied in others."
"We need to look at the impact of this on agriculture generally."
"I am also conscious that we are looking towards a health check for the CAP in 2008 and, in parallel with that, a review of the financial perspectives."
"I should like to compliment the Commission on trying to make something good out of what is essentially a very bad proposal: the Commission is trying to get rules applied and is insisting that they be implemented; it is excluding market support measures."
"I shall conclude by saying that it is very difficult to make something good out of essentially a poor suggestion, or, to use an agricultural term: you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear."
"I compliment the Commission for even trying to do so."
"This is a bad proposal and we will be rejecting it."
"(ES) Mr President, the proposal that we are debating today is unacceptable."
"It is unacceptable because it is disintegratory, fragmentary, anti-European, selfish and highly hypocritical."
"From the point of view of agricultural theory, it involves cutting 20% of direct aid to farmers in order to fund rural development and thus fill in holes."
"These holes were created because, in the financial perspectives, 1% is not sufficient to fund the agricultural policies, and as the Member States are incapable of giving more money, they have to take it away from those who were receiving it until now."
"It also represents the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy: getting rid of the only truly European policy, the only policy that united European producers."
"And not only does it mean renationalisation, but, if we look at the proposal by the Spanish Government to the Council, it means going much further: not only renationalising, but regionalising."
"This way everyone will be able to do what they want."
"I think that it is part of the disintegratory madness of the socialist Spanish President, who, Mr Parish, also has no one here to defend him, because he, along with all the presidents who signed the financial perspectives and accept this change, do not care at all about the competitiveness of the European agricultural sector and the impact that these measures may have on their economies is of little importance to them."
"Therefore, and in defence of European farmers and livestock breeders and of the sector, we will of course reject this proposal."
"Mr President, I apologise for not being in the House when I was first called but my travel arrangements went rather awry today."
"Voluntary modulation is but fancy phraseology for a very unpleasant practice, namely government grab of farmers' money."
"As Mrs McGuiness has said, there is nothing voluntary about it, certainly in respect of those from whom the money is to be extracted, namely the farmers."
"The consequence is a very unbalanced rural development programme right across Europe, both in how it is financed and then in how it is delivered."
"That, of course, is then discriminatory against the farmers in those Member States that practice this madness of voluntary modulation."
"In my country we are already seeing the consequences, with delays in the intended LFA payments."
"Voluntary modulation is something to be resisted."
"I welcome the stance of the committee and the stance of this House when it rejects it and I urge the Commission to be robust in forcing a change of policy by the Council on this matter."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I have listened to the debate carefully and with huge interest."
"I can only repeat what I said at the outset, i.e. that the Commission proposal is consistent with the European Council's request."
"As Mrs McGuinness rightly said, we have tried to align it as much as possible with the existing rules on obligatory modulation and financing of the rural development policy."
"Tomorrow, if - or I should say when - the European Parliament rejects the Commission's proposal, I intend to raise the issue with my fellow Commissioners in order to consider our position carefully."
"That is completely in accordance with the framework agreement between our two institutions."
"Thank you, Commissioner, that was very clear."
"I thank all those who took part in the debate."
"I should also like to thank all the interpreters."
"That concludes the joint debate."
"The vote will be tomorrow."

"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. - (ES) Madam President, since the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Morillon, is not present, I simply wished to say on behalf of that committee that we are in favour of this urgent procedure."
"We believe that it is necessary to speed up the procedure, as the Commission has requested."
"The Committee on Fisheries is therefore in favour of this urgent procedure."
"(Parliament adopted the urgent procedure)"
"Presentation of the Court of Auditors' Annual Report - 2005 (debate)"
"The next item is the Court of Auditors' Annual Report."
"I am delighted to welcome the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Weber, to this House."
"Madam President, Vice-President Kallas, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity today of participating in your debate on the 29th Annual Report of the Court of Auditors, for the 2005 financial year, at the plenary session of the European Parliament."
"I presented this report to the Committee on Budgetary Control in Strasbourg on 23 October and to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) in Brussels on 7 November."
"Each annual report from the Court is the culmination of complex and exhaustive audit work performed in situ by our auditors over the course of the preceding 12 months at all levels of the administration of EU resources."
"In accordance with the principles of international auditing standards and as corroborated by external experts, the audit evidence of the Court is based on the exhaustive examination of samples of transactions from the individual budget areas and on assessments of the functioning of the internal control systems for expenditure."
"Only serious formal errors and errors with financial consequences, inflated expenditure claims, ineligible beneficiaries and expenditure form the basis of the Court's Statement of Assurance."
"One of the Court's primary duties, and one that it has been required under the Treaty to carry out since its inception, is to perform cost-benefit analyses, the results of which the Court publishes in its special reports."
"In addition, the Court's assessments of the internal control systems, which are required for the annual Statement of Assurance, form an important basis for these cost-benefit analyses."
"Allow me now to turn to the Court's key audit findings for 2005."
"In respect of those areas in which considerable improvements have been achieved, the Court duly recognises the Commission's success in managing and implementing the change from cash-based to accruals-based accounting."
"The Court has reached the conclusion that the consolidated annual accounts of the EU general budget for 2005, totalling EUR 105 billion, are reliable."
"I must qualify this audit opinion, however, in the light of the net overvaluation of assets and the inconsistent application of cut-off procedures."
"As regards the legality and regularity of underlying transactions, the Court again provides an unqualified opinion on revenue, funds commitment, EU administrative expenditure and pre-accession strategy, excluding Sapard."
"A positive view can also be taken of the Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS), which covers 56% of expenditure within the framework of the common agricultural policy."
"As in 2004, the Court confirms that the IACS has, where properly implemented, successfully played its part in preventing irregular agricultural expenditure."
"In practice this is the case in the EU15, with the exception of Greece."
"In the new Member States, the implementation of IACS has progressed well, although these systems are not yet fully effective."
"As the Court's detailed audit evidence shows, the remainder of the areas of expenditure, which accounts, in terms of value, for the majority of the EU budget, is still characterised by material errors of legality and regularity in the underlying transactions."
"In other words, the Court is once again unable to approve without qualification the expenditure areas, in particular, of agriculture (taken as a whole), structural measures and internal and external policies."
"This is the result of the high level of irregularities found, which include inflated expenditure claims, duplicated cost listings, ineligible beneficiaries and/or projects, claims for expenditure not actually incurred and breaches of the rules governing public tendering procedures."
"These irregularities are able to occur because the current internal controls on EU expenditure are inadequate."
"According to the EC Treaty it is the responsibility of the Commission to ensure that the internal control systems are in place and work effectively in practice at all levels of EU administration."
"Not only has the Court found evidence of the inadequate performance of checks on payments under shared management, namely agricultural expenditure and structural measures, but it has also found that the Commission has failed to lead by example in respect of EU expenditure managed directly by it, that is to say internal and external policies."
"Thus, in the field of research, for instance, the Commission considerably reduced its checks on expenditure claims in 2005 despite the continuing high levels of error and the inherent risk in this type of expenditure."
"The Commission argues that the errors found and reported by the Court are of little import since the various multi-annual correction mechanisms detect and correct errors and irregularities when the programmes are finalised."
"The audit work of the Court shows that in practice these corrections are insufficient and that they are not directed towards the final beneficiaries in all areas."
"Furthermore, there are numerous shortcomings in recovery procedures."
"In the areas of shared management with Member States, for example, the Court's findings were as follows."
"As regards agricultural spending, the financial clearance procedures are much delayed - the last fully cleared financial year was 1998 - and, due to failures in the system, the conformity decisions imposed fines only on the authorities of Member States."
"Since, in most cases, excess amounts paid to the final beneficiaries are not recovered, the burden is borne by the national taxpayer rather than by those final beneficiaries who overclaim."
"As regards structural measures, the 1994-1999 programmes have still not been completely closed and the Court finds that a number of the programmes that have been closed still exhibit substantial error levels."
"Moreover, the Commission closed a number of programmes without making financial corrections despite there being significant reservations in respect of the certified expenditure."
"This clearly highlights the risk that errors in intermediate payment claims may not be corrected in practice."
"I would like to emphasise the fact that the Court, clearly, welcomes recoveries to the benefit of the EU budget."
"However, it must be pointed out that flat-rate financial corrections are made for weaknesses in the control systems of the Member States. As a consequence of this, these corrections do not, as a rule, lead to rectification of the errors of legality and regularity in the underlying transactions at the level of the final beneficiaries."
"In the Court's opinion, there are a number of measures that should be taken to address these shortcomings."
"There needs to be a logical chain of effective internal controls based on unambiguous and appropriate rules and on common principles and standards, taking into account risk assessment of the nature of transactions and types of management."
"Effective recovery and sanction systems should likewise be applied in all areas of the EU budget."
"For its part, the Court of Auditors is keen to explore more intensively areas of common interest with the national audit institutions."
"For the meeting of the Contact Committee of the Heads of the Supreme Audit Institutions in Warsaw next month, the Court has suggested extending current levels of cooperation to cover assessment of internal control systems in the Member States."
"The European Union is facing renewed challenges in the shape of the rules of operation, the completion and closure of the current structural funds spending programmes and the opening of the 2007-2013 programmes, as well as the imminent accession of two new Member States."
"Allow me to conclude by setting out how EU financial management should approach these challenges."
"The Commission, together with the authorities in the Member States, must ensure that there are efficient and reliable internal control systems across all levels of EU administration; that these systems, in turn, include sufficient checks which are properly carried out, reported and followed up; and that the systems in question are based on simplified regulations governing EU expenditure."
"We should all be aiming for a European Union which has its budget under effective control for the benefit of its citizens."
"Thank you for your kind attention."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(ET) Madam President, Mr Weber, ladies and gentlemen, I presented my initial position concerning the annual report to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 23 October."
"The committee is presently actively taking follow-up action and correcting the errors that have been identified."
"On the day after the Court of Auditors' Report was published, the committee sent a letter to the Member States, in which it asked them to present comments and clarifications concerning errors identified in the countries concerned, and eliminate those errors."
"Thus we will take the conclusions of the Committee on Budgetary Control into consideration fully and promptly."
"Like you, however, the committee has also contemplated the political significance of the report after its publication."
"It is clear that the above-mentioned report is not yet a general positive statement of assurance."
"As Mr Weber, the President of the Court of Auditors, said, the Court submits a statement of assurance concerning the 'legality and regularity' of expenditures, obligations, pre-accession strategy expenditure, administrative expenditures and common agricultural policy expenditures that are part of the Integrated Administration and Control System."
"The Court of Auditors does not, however, present a positive statement of assurance concerning other areas, for instance research programmes and structural funds."
"The main reason for this is that the Court of Auditors has found too many errors in the sampling of transactions in these areas."
"As Mr Weber stated, the cause for these errors is 'simple negligence or oversight, poor knowledge of the complex rules and presumably also fraud connected with the EU budget'."
"I think that the criticism in the area of research programmes that was presented as a result of last year's control is, unfortunately, justified."
"The reduction of the number of auditors in this sensitive area by nearly half, and our recovery procedures should be more rapid and more forceful."
"It is true that we failed to notice many errors that the Court of Audits later detected."
"I believe that in both this and other areas, the poor knowledge of complex rules is the main cause of errors."
"Frankly, I think the Commission has done too little too slowly to simplify and clarify the rules and guidelines."
"We are addressing these questions in the Action Plan and in proposals for the new programming period."
"We welcome the continued attention and advice from the Court on how to improve the situation."
"I would also like to look at the topic of fraud."
"How much fraud is there in the performance of the European Union budget?"
"Any suspicions of fraud will be investigated thoroughly by OLAF, as witnessed by the two cases recently reported in the media in connection with the Chernobyl project and the Office for Infrastructure and Logistics in Brussels."
"Yet is the entire European Union budget 'riddled with fraud', as some journalists write year after year?"
"Let me quote from the report on the management and auditing of EU funds published yesterday by the UK's House of Lords."
"The report finds that 'much of the coverage in the press suggests that there is a significant culture of corruption in Europe's institutions."
"Our investigation has uncovered no evidence to support this suggestion'."
"Based on data from the Member States, the Commission possesses fraud estimates concerning two areas in which spending is greatest - agriculture and regional aid."
"These estimates show that 13-15% of notified irregularities are cases of suspected fraud, corresponding to 0.05% of the expenditures of agricultural funds and structural and cohesion funds."
"Last year the Commission wrote off EUR 90 million as irrecoverable financial losses, representing some 0.09% of the budget."
"Thus the rate of fraud is marginal."
"That does not, of course, mean that we should not seriously combat each specific case."
"This also appears to be confirmed by the Court's audit work in 2005."
"Of all the information, audits and about nine hundred sampled transactions the Court looked at in 2005, in only four cases did the Court have cause to suspect fraud or serious violation of the rules and regulations and inform the European anti-fraud office (OLAF)."
"After analysis, however, OLAF was unable to confirm any of the fraud cases of which it had been informed."
"However, the Court traditionally has once again provided useful data that is useful to OLAF in its operational work."
"Mr Weber, Madam President, now that these comments on our weaknesses, the need for simplification and the level of fraud have been presented, I presume the discharge authority would also like to assess the impact of the errors on the 'price-quality relationship'."
"The Court of Auditors' report (page 138) reveals that the Court audited 95 projects funded from structural funds, and found significant errors in 60 of them."
"Does this mean that two thirds of structural funds has been lost or wasted?"
"Does this mean that the objectives of these projects have not been achieved?"
"It clearly does not."
"Some ground-breaking research may have been done without all the necessary paperwork, and conversely, one can find projects that were brilliantly executed in terms of the formal rules, and all the paperwork was done, but the objectives were not achieved."
"Unfortunately the report gives no information on the true impact of the Community funding."
"Thus one wonders what conclusions Parliament and the ordinary citizen in Member States can draw based on the Court's overview of the errors in structural policies."
"The Court often states that it is only a messenger, and that the Treaty obliges the Court to give a statement of assurance on the whole budget each year."
"It does this through its samples of transactions and other audits."
"It tests compliance with the rules."
"This work, the Court does professionally, within the limits of its human resources."
"Who, though, then evaluates the impact of these errors on the achievement of policy objectives?"
"On what basis should Parliament make such evaluations?"
"After all, together with Council, you are the budgetary authority and have the final word on future budget allocations."
"The Court's report should offer you a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of budgets approved in the past."
"In this perspective, I think one should invite the Court to evaluate how significant an impact the errors have had."
"We know the Court has the expertise to do this."
"It does this kind of 'price-quality' evaluation in special reports, which we highly appreciate."
"So why is such analysis absent from the annual report?"
"For the Commission, sound financial management means reaching policy objectives in an efficient way and at a reasonable cost."
"It necessarily takes a multi-annual view of each aid programme, and ensures that the expenditure on control over the programme is in balance with the costs and benefits."
"The Commission is well aware that few university professors who apply for funding for research programmes are qualified accountants, and it knows that some will make mistakes in their applications for EU funding."
"Should the funding of research stop for this reason?"
"Absolutely not."
"We reduce the scope for error, but live with what remains."
"In terms of choices, there is clearly something missing between a negative DAS and a positive discharge."
"The Treaty - Article 248.2 of the Treaty on the European Communities - requires the Court to assess the soundness of financial management."
"Could it not also assess whether, in a given year, the Commission has indeed taken the steps necessary to ensure value for money?"
"This would not simplify the Commission's task, but it would give us all a clearer point of view!"
"You may think this sounds too radical."
"Perhaps it is, but the UK House of Lords goes even further in a very serious report published yesterday."
"The House says that 'substantial improvements are needed to the methodology underpinning the Statement of Assurance' and proposes, among other things: that the Court 'should distinguish clearly between irregularity and fraud, publishing separate figures for the level of fraudulent transactions and administrative mistakes'; that 'the Statement of Assurance should focus on giving a detailed summary of financial management in each of the spending categories and Member States' listing those Member States demonstrating poor management of European funds'."
"The Commission will carefully study this interesting report."
"Allow me also to touch on the issue of recoveries, or 'clawbacks'."
"In this year's DAS statement, the Court appears to cast doubt on the relevance of clawbacks for the DAS, arguing that recoveries do not right wrongs, nor do they dissuade the final beneficiary from making errors."
"This Commission thinks this does not fairly represent the actual situation."
"Every year, very significant amounts are clawed back by the Commission from Member States and by Member States from the final beneficiaries."
"This system contributes to the effective protection of the Union's financial interests."
"It has a preventive effect, by giving Member States an incentive to improve their management and control systems, to prevent, detect and recover irregular payments to final beneficiaries."
"We - actually the Member States - should receive the credit for that, and it should affect the DAS declaration as well."
"I would like, Madam President, to continue on a more positive note."
"The Commission has established working relations with many national audit offices and found a positive attitude towards auditing EU funds in shared management."
"I am very encouraged by the announcement made by President Weber that the Court is intending to propose joint audits with these national audit offices, starting with the areas of Structural Funds and financial corrections performed in Member States."
"Indeed, we could much more effectively convince Member States to take more responsibility for spending from EU budget, if the Court were willing to work with - and eventually use - the results of audits produced at the national level."
"I would like to end with a comment on some of the good news in the Court's report."
"Its President, Mr Weber, has pointed out that 'the Commission successfully implemented the new accounting system with notable rapidity, and it now offers additional key information that is significantly more complete than that provided through the previous cash-based system'."
"We are proud of this achievement."
"To sum up: the DAS is once again negative."
"The Commission regrets this."
"It will correct the errors made and take further actions to correct systemic weaknesses, as announced in the Action Plan for an Integrated Internal Control Framework."
"In acknowledging that there is still much work to be done, the Commission also notes that important progress is made every year and that the overall management of EU funds is sound."
"It is under control, but there is further scope for simplification of complex rules."
"Together with my colleagues, I look forward to the more detailed sectoral discussions in the discharge hearings ahead."
"Finally, the Commission would like to re-emphasise that there is a missing link between the list of errors reported by the Court and the discharge procedure."
"The Commission would welcome an audit approach which also looks at effectiveness or 'value for money'."
"We believe this would assist the discharge authority in carrying out its important task."
"Thank you for your attention."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, President Weber, Commissioner, this year we are once again being presented with the report by the Court of Auditors on the management of the Community budget and, this year once again, the European Parliament will pay the greatest possible attention to it, since it represents the most credible and reliable reflection of the state of the European public accounts."
"As the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture, Mrs Fischer Boel, said yesterday, we are genuinely going to subject the Union's finances to a proper health check."
"I do not intend to demand that the institutions take responsibilities that go beyond their particular competences."
"The Court of Auditors plays its role, often with little cooperation from the Member States and their national control institutions."
"I hope that Mr Weber will achieve in Warsaw what we have not been able to achieve over all these years."
"Despite its defects, the European Commission does an extraordinary job, an extremely difficult job, given its lack of resources and the huge quantity of work."
"We do not therefore want this report to become an object of controversy, but rather a genuine instrument for improving public accounts."
"The Council and the Member States also have their own responsibility, since, with the current institutional architecture, it is difficult to go any further with financial control of the budget and the execution of spending."
"Previous speakers have already said it: 80% is spent in the Member States but we do not even get the Finance Ministers in those Member States to declare the reliability of spending."
"There still remains much to be done, therefore."
"Amongst other things, I intend to use 'value for money' as a basis for the cost-benefit analysis."
"The guiding principle of our report will be good financial management."
"We shall attach great importance to management, both shared management and direct management and decentralised management, and to the recovery of funds."
"Finally, Madam President, we would like to see a new approach to the statement of assurance, but we shall talk about that over the coming months."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Madam President, those of us in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament too are, of course, unhappy about the fact that it is now getting on for many years in a row that the Court of Auditors has not been able wholeheartedly to approve the EU accounts and to give a positive statement of assurance as to their reliability."
"We should like to begin by, of course, emphasising this but, at the same time, also saying that, although there are many points of criticism, we are working in a balanced, progressive and proactive way with a view, of course, to solving the problems."
"It is not only a question of criticising. It is, first and foremost, about discovering what specific type of problems we are facing and how we can solve them."
"We think there is good reason to commend the Court of Auditors on its detailed report."
"We in the Socialist Group have on many occasions asked for further details."
"We have sought a higher degree of differentiation in relation to the various types of error."
"This has been provided, but the situation is still not good enough."
"We might have wished, for example, for more of a distinction to have been made between what is, factually speaking, fraud and what are, factually speaking, errors."
"Praise is due to the Commission for introducing a new accounting system: the integrated financial control system for agricultural expenditure."
"There are quite a few areas in which progress has been made, but there are, of course, also grounds for criticism, especially in relation to internal policies, where the Court of Auditors' report shows that things have in fact deteriorated since last year."
"We shall, of course, use the discharge procedure to look more closely at these matters, to demand some answers and, presumably, also to look ahead and come up with some better proposed solutions."
"We in the Socialist Group earnestly call on Commissioner Kallas and the Court of Auditors to continue their cooperation with a view to solving these problems in the best way possible."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, this debate is one we have been having for many years, with a number of recurring themes."
"Yet again, there is no Statement of Assurance, much to the discontent of everyone who is well disposed towards European cooperation, and yet again, it is not entirely clear why this should be."
"Every year, we ask the Court of Auditors for more detailed information and every year, we are faced with those typical phrases in the report, of which I should like to quote you a few: 'The Court of Auditors has concluded that generally, where CAP spending is concerned, mistakes of material interest still occur'."
"With regard to the structural funds: 'For both programme periods (1994-1999 and 2000-2006), the Court of Auditors has concluded that spending was not free from irregularities of material interest'."
"Indeed, we have been asking for high-risk and low-risk budget components for years."
"Is it not possible for the Court of Auditors to be a little more precise and, among other things, to specify what error percentages would be acceptable?"
"This would allow us to measure any improvements that are made."
"I get the impression that the Commission is becoming a little more assertive, and I see that as totally justified."
"It is not only a matter of bookkeeping, but also a matter of effectiveness."
"It is unfortunate for this Parliament that neither the President of the Court of Auditors, nor Commissioner Kallas have spoken one word about the new financial perspectives."
"This is new."
"We would ask that someone who carries political responsibility at a certain level would issue a statement of assurance annually."
"For Parliament, the question is essentially: How does the Commission intend to do this?"
"It is unfortunate that the Commission has given no indication of this, and that the Court of Auditors, for that matter, has not mentioned it either."
"Since it forms part of the multi-annual budget, it is up to the Member States and the Commission to implement it."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Mr Weber, Commissioner Kallas, I am, above all, grateful to the Court of Auditors for the report, which I regard as a sound one."
"I also think that the standard of its editing is continuing to improve."
"The report has been written in clear language and, above all, has recourse to 'naming and shaming', something I appreciate enormously."
"We are facing a special discharge, because this is the first budget year for the whole of which, the enlarged Union has had 25 Member States, and that falls entirely within the current Commission's remit."
"In that sense, I have to say that I am a little surprised, even shocked, about the rather defensive speech Commissioner Kallas gave here today - shocked, because when he came into office, he was the very man who stated on this platform that, during his tenure, we would at last see a positive Statement of Assurance being issued."
"What do we see now, though?"
"The Court of Auditors' criticism of key components of the budget remains unchallenged, and Mr Kallas goes into the defence with a report, which I read last night, and which is actually worth reading, from the House of Lords."
"This is not, of course, the right way of going about things."
"Having read the Court of Auditors' report, I can tell Commissioner Kallas that it contains very specific elements."
"For example, the integrated management and control system for agriculture works perfectly for those Member States that apply it."
"Greece does not."
"This was already mentioned in last year's report by the Court of Auditors and was an important component in Mr Mulder's discharge last year."
"What have you done about this since then?"
"What have you done to call Greece to account?"
"According to the same report by the Court of Auditors, there are serious problems involving export refunds."
"In Denmark and the Netherlands, exporters can simply seal their lorries without customs officers having to be present."
"What have you done to counter this?"
"These are, after all, specific questions, and there is no need to adopt a defensive stance."
"I have two specific questions for Mr Weber."
"The first question is: On 7 November, when you addressed the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, did you finally make it clear to the Ministers that it is vital for them to sign off their accounts?"
"Secondly, will you entertain the request made by the House of Lords that a black list should finally be drawn up of Member States that do not manage European funds very well?"
"I should like to have an answer to both those questions, Mr Weber."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Today, Parliament has the pleasure of discussing the enlightening report by the European Court of Auditors about the spending of European funds in 2005."
"Once again, the auditors are not impressed."
"There are still too many errors that are too substantial and too structural in the way in which European funds are spent."
"In that sense, this report is not very different from its eleven predecessors."
"What is different, though, is the reaction to the Court of Auditors' negative verdict."
"European institutions, the Commission among them, would formerly indulge in regular sessions of mea culpa and promises of improvement."
"This time round, the Commission has mounted a full-on offensive, and the Court of Auditors is being accused of being overly critical and having produced an ambiguous report."
"They even claim that we must learn to live with some mistakes."
"It is a fact, however, that Europe is the proud owner of 200 000 virtual cows that receive subsidies even though they do not exist."
"It is a fact that major errors have once again been flagged in the areas of olive oil, the export subsidies and the structural funds."
"It is a fact that, as a result, funds do not end up where they are most needed."
"Also, it is a fact that, as a result, the European public is increasingly losing faith in the Union."
"A grown-up institution should be able to use criticism to its advantage."
"The European institutions are demonstrating that they, even at the age of 50, have not yet reached this level of maturity."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, all of us in this House are saying that the Court of Auditors has produced a good report - it is informative and clearer than it usually is."
"What does the report tell us?"
"Well, it tells us that anomalies are continuing to occur just as much as before, and we have to ask ourselves whether we are to continue living with such anomalies."
"What we have here is, of course, an entirely unreasonable approach to the problems."
"What is needed is an examination of how and why things have got into this state and clear proposals from the Commission concerning what is to be done."
"Any examination of this nature would necessarily lead one to observe that most of what goes wrong has to do with the agricultural policy."
"There are, besides this, very many other reasons to change the agricultural policy, in fact to do away with it all together."
"If that happened, a very large proportion of the problems that we see in this context would simply disappear."
"I would nonetheless still like to remind the House that it bears a very great part of the blame for the EU losing its good reputation among the peoples of Europe."
"This House always votes to back everyone up but in practice never insists on responsibility."
"It was pathetic to see the leaders of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats standing here in Parliament, practically in tears, telling us that they felt compelled to postpone the granting of discharge to Parliament itself as a result of the scandal relating to the buildings here in Strasbourg."
"Despite the fact that I pointed out that discharge should not be granted to the Committee of the Regions, it was granted anyway."
"We cannot go on like this."
"Madam President, the Court of Auditors has confirmed there is no independent audit of any part of these accounts, including the treasury function, which sometimes sits on a pile of EUR 20 billion or more."
"I would like the Court to explain precisely how many years it has carried out a full and specific audit of the treasury function, and would also like confirmation as to how frequently, such as once annually, it might undertake such a task in the future."
"The Court has also confirmed that EU funds are held in the individual Member States before being allocated for use there."
"The cash flow and interest-bearing consequences of that are important and hitherto unknown."
"Net contributors like the UK and Germany are at a disadvantage, because a large proportion of their funds are stored in recipient countries."
"The French, on the other hand, are always holding the funds of net contributors and routinely earning interest on the overnight money markets."
"How much money has been lost to British and German taxpayers through the use of this system?"
"Finally, I should point out that I have been asking Mr Weber these questions for over six months, and still await a reply."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as well as for the control of the Commission's budget, this House is responsible for monitoring the budgets of what are termed the 'other' institutions, and if they are to be given a positive discharge, it must be clear that they have used European taxpayers' money properly."
"It is at this point that we have a number of things to discuss."
"If we take our monitoring role seriously, we also have to audit those items of expenditure that we formerly disregarded, for example, the Council's common foreign and security policy - and I regret that the Council is not present today to hear me say this, for it is in close cooperation with the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, that I am, quite deliberately, making reference to this policy area today and making a demand for transparent cooperation on the part of the Council."
"There will be several issues in relation to the Committee of the Regions in which closer examination will be required; the ones I would give as examples are the failure to implement the internal auditor's recommendations and the questionable use of the weighting, not to mention the wholly inadequate consideration of this topic by the committee itself."
"The buildings policies of the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and of the Court of Justice raise issues that also have to be addressed, and there are many other matters to be sorted out."
"OLAF, our anti-fraud office, has also exercised an effective monitoring role with respect to the institutions over recent years, and I wonder why it is that neither the Ombudsman nor the Data Protection Supervisor have as yet concluded an agreement with it."
"These bodies, too, will have to answer that question."
"I call on all the interested parties to answer the questions in a transparent manner, to play their part in enabling this House to get an all-round picture and to work together in devising ways of improving things."
"Only if this is done will we be able to give discharge for 2005."
"(HU) Madam President, the report by the European Court of Auditors, which, as in previous years, is the result of very thorough, high-quality work, states that the expenditure of the European budget has been carried out essentially with legality and regularity."
"I wish to emphasise the significance of this statement because once again this year, as in the past 12 years, the Court is unable to give an unqualified positive opinion."
"The reason for this is that some 80% of the European Union's budget is spent under the system of joint responsibility by the Member States, where the Court of Auditors has, in the course of its very thorough inspections, found fairly high levels of error that have a financial impact."
"This does not in any way mean that all expenditures of the Union's budget are burdened with error, nor can these errors be interpreted as indications of fraud."
"In its initial reaction, the European Commission objects to the methodology of the Court of Auditors, but continues to set as its goal a positive DAS by 2009."
"To this end, it has launched a process of reform, within the framework of which it has developed an integrated internal control system; the introduction of a goal-oriented budget management can also be counted as a significant step forward."
"Now that the Member States have recognised, at the behest of the European Parliament, that the declarations they are being asked to provide are necessary, we can look forward to a very successful Court of Auditors."
"Madam President, I am tempted to ask you simply to read the speech I made last year."
"The comments from the President of the Court of Auditors sum it up very neatly."
"Overall, the situation has not substantially changed since last year."
"In fact, the Court's press statement makes it abundantly clear that nothing has changed, with comments like 'due to continue in high levels of error' and the pièce de résistance, 'errors with a financial impact are found too frequently for the Court to conclude that all is well'."
"The only real difference this year is that the Commission has been more strident in denying its responsibility for the mess."
"I must thank Commissioner Kallas for providing me with the rib-tickler of the year, when he said that the perception of fraud in the EU finances is 'highly unfair' and that the spending of money in the EU is under tight control."
"Yes, and Santa Claus really does come down the chimney!"
"Blaming the nation states for most of the fraud is an easy way out."
"The Commission is supposed to enforce the rules and oversee spending."
"Therefore it must take the blame for all those invisible cows in Slovenia, a country that has only been a member for two years but has quickly learnt to play the system."
"Nothing has been learnt and the mistakes go on being repeated."
"(ES) Madam President, as the Court of Auditors' report says, we have made progress in many areas."
"I would like to thank it for its report. But there is one area in which we have not made any progress: in pointing to Member States individually."
"We are a group of twenty-five and we cannot just give one mark for the whole of the class"
"The 300 pages of its report contain references to Greece, but you have never said which Member States are mainly responsible for our not achieving the target or - if you do not just want to be hatchet men - which Member States are doing well or are greatly improving."
"Other institutions do it: the European Central Bank points to individual Member States by name."
"You are not an assembly of diplomats defending national interests."
"In your press communiqués, you must point out, amongst other things, which States are doing things well and which are not."
"The Finnish Presidency is not even represented here, but on the basis of the report by the House of Lords, a report for which we have great respect, I am going to ask, on behalf of the group that I coordinate, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for an initiative report to look into the Court of Auditors' methodology."
"I well remember how one of its members, the Belgian member, Mr Pinxten, took his post without giving up any of his economic or political responsibilities."
"In the end, when he was threatened with being brought before the courts, he had to leave by the back door."
"That shameful episode was not unfortunately the finest hour of the Court of which you are the worthy President."
"I would like to say one thing to Vice-President Kallas."
"In your speech to the Committee on Budgetary Control on the 23rd, you said that 2 100 million had been recovered."
"You criticised the auditor harshly - I do not know whether that is the best you could do - but I would like you to specify, if possible, which policies, programmes and Member States that 2 100 million recovered relates to."
"(DE) Madam President, I want to congratulate the Court of Auditors on a good report, which holds up a mirror to quite a few things; the only thing is that certain people do not want to look at it."
"I have to tell Commissioner Kallas that it is not acceptable that the new Commission, acting on the 'shoot the messenger' principle, should close its ears to the bad news from Luxembourg."
"If we re-read the treaties, we will find that they state that the Commission - and nobody else - is responsible for the implementation of the European budget."
"Yet I, Commissioner Kallas, read everywhere references to things for which you are not responsible, for the agencies, as you yourself say - and we will have more to say about that - or, for example, for Greece's failure to implement an integrated administration and control system (IACS); everywhere, the Commission is disappearing from the scene, and that is something that - since we have to deal with the new Commission for the first time - we will have to have serious discussions about."
"Commissioner Kallas, you must start taking on responsibility, or else you are in the wrong job."
"Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the Members of your House who have had some very friendly things to say about our report, in particular to Mr Staes, Mr Lundgren, Mr Pomés Ruiz and Mr Bösch."
"If I may come back to Vice-President Kallas, he has lamented the constant focus in the media on the subject of fraud."
"I can assure you that, together with the many of your Members who have spoken today - among them Mr Jørgensen, Mr Fazakas and Mr Titford - we are giving the Commission our wholehearted backing."
"It is not acceptable that the same old tune - 'fraud, fraud, and more fraud' - should be playing all the time; it is unjustified, it is damaging, and it is something we can do without."
"We do have rules."
"Let me now return to the second aspect, that being the recommendation from the British House of Lords, on which Mr Kallas believes we should act."
"We have a system."
"Our report cannot confirm that fraud has been committed; that is for judges, rather than the Court of Auditors, to determine."
"We will, though, look carefully at the report from the House of Lords, which reached us only around yesterday lunchtime."
"I myself had a hand in an agreement we reached with the Commission, according to which, if we suspect that fraud is in play, the matter is passed on to OLAF."
"As I have already said, the procedures are subject to rules."
"I can wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Garriga Polledo said; collaboration with our sister authorities is vitally important, and we will take with us to Warsaw your best wishes, for which we are grateful."
"Mr Mulder asked why it is that the accounts have once more not been approved without qualification, and the answer to that is quite straightforward."
"It is that the transactions to which the accounts refer are still, to a large degree, not subject to appropriate risk management."
"Only as and when they are will it be possible to give a positive Statement of Assurance."
"Here, too, though, the incidence of errors would only result in the media once more putting the spotlight on fraud."
"I am much obliged to Mr Staes for pointing out that a positive Statement of Assurance would be one result of improvements in the internal auditing systems, and for citing a number of examples;"
"I can do no other than endorse what he said."
"I expressed myself very forthrightly before Ecofin, and the British House of Lords has highlighted a number of problems, among them countersignature and the blacklist."
"We received their report yesterday and must first examine it very closely."
"I will respond to Mr Mote's comments by saying our concern today is with the Statement of Assurance, although the great importance of the matters to which he alluded is not in doubt, and I am quite happy to continue with him the dialogue on which we have already embarked."
"I have now answered, in essence, most of the questions put to me."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Madam President, I should like to thank all the Members for their remarks."
"This is just part of the process, and next week will see the start of more detailed hearings on the implementation of our budget."
"In response to some of the remarks, I would like to say that the Commission is not pointing the finger at anyone."
"It is seeking to achieve an accurate picture enabling adequate, balanced evaluation of the implementation of the European budget."
"We are fully responsible for everything we do, and we are willing to bear that responsibility."
"However, it would be unrealistic to expect, in response to an analysis of the implementation of the European budget the thrust of which is that the Commission is bad, for the Commission to say that it is not bad, but even worse."
"That would be inappropriate, although we fully recognise our weak points."
"Internal policy issues will be the most vulnerable area of our 2005 activities."
"During the three budgetary discharge processes in which I have been involved, I have seen real improvements and I know what can be done to improve the situation further."
"We will do our utmost to improve that situation, and are looking for comprehensive, adequate professional evaluation of the implementation of the EU budget in all its aspects, be this its achievements or weaknesses, errors or fraud, etc. It is our aim and desire to show everybody that although the machinery is huge and could be improved, things are not bad at all."
"Being familiar with the experiences of Member States in the sphere of public administration, and knowing what happens in different Member States and in other international organisations, I can state that things are indeed not bad at all."
"It is our desire for the general public, Members of Parliament and the Court of Auditors to also see this side of our activities."
"Concerning Mr Mulder's question on the financial perspective and the idea of increased participation by Member States in this process - the question of national declarations - I welcome the change in stance."
"When we started discussing this issue, only one or two Member States shared the attitude that Member States could take more responsibility."
"That attitude is changing but, as I know from my limited experience in European affairs, this will obviously take time."
"We are pleased that the Member States have agreed to provide a summary of the declarations of paying agencies, which is a step forward, and we are working with the Member States to take things further."
"Regarding the declaration itself, I fully share the opinion of the Court of Auditors that this will not solve everything per se."
"It is part of the much broader issue of systemic and structural control and audit, which should bring the expected results."
"Let us therefore discuss every aspect and not omit anything from the scope of our discussions."
"Let us also discuss the question of methodology and our actions and weaknesses."
"Let us hold a comprehensive, professional and adequate discussion on this issue, and then we will all be happy."
"Madam President, I was interrupted in the middle of my speech because apparently you were not correctly informed of the amount of time available to me."
"I was unable, therefore, to make what I believe is a very important point and draw to the attention of this House other words that are included in the House of Lords' report published last night, which say - and Mr Kallas omitted to mention them - that the Commission should focus on requiring officials and existing audit bodies to take responsibility for their systems and accounts, and that this process should culminate in the requirement for the Secretary-General of the Commission to sign an assurance that the Commission's annual accounts are true and fair."
"That seems to me to be one of the most important statements we have yet had on the process of improving standards in this House, and I wish to make sure it is fully understood."
"You were speaking on behalf of your group, which was given one minute's speaking time in this debate, and so it follows that I interrupted you at the right moment, and it is not right and proper that you should now, as it were, be using points of order to secure yourself even more speaking time."
"Madam President, I would just like to ask Commissioner Kallas something for clarification."
"He was a little ambiguous in his answer to my question, so I would just like to ask him again: when will the Commission remind Member States about the obligations in respect of the financial perspective?"
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Madam President, we already reminded Member States of this obligation in our letter to them and we will also do so during the Council meeting when these issues are discussed again."
"We are trying to promote the idea and do whatever we can, but, just as in the case of Parliament, there is a limit to what we can do in this matter."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"EU spending shares the weakness common to many large organisations, governments, ministries and international organisations: money is spent over such a range of activities and in so many places that the auditors cannot guarantee that the exact amounts were always spent correctly."
"The US federal budget has not had a positive statement of assurance for about eight years."
"Britain's Department for Work and Pensions has not had its equivalent statement for the last 15 years - and its budget is larger than that of the whole EU!"
"As the UK's House of Lords reported yesterday, there appears to be relatively little actual fraud on the EU budget."
"The auditors have rather found cases of technical irregularities, which normally result in a refund to the EU budget anyway, or a late payment, or incomplete paperwork which gets chased up later."
"Sensationalist press articles then classify all these as 'fraud', which they are not."
"Further progress in eliminating such errors is needed."
"I would like to see a system where the annual statements of assurance had to be given to the Commission departments and each of the 25 national governments individually, rather than in one single statement for the whole EU."
"(FR) In its annual report, the Court of Auditors gives a positive statement of assurance on the EU 2005 accounts and congratulates the Commission on putting in place the new accounting system for the fiscal year."
"However, as regards the legality and regularity of underlying operations - that is to say, payments to and from the EU coffers - the Court notes that adapted risk management is not always guaranteed when it comes to important areas of expenditure."
"Most of these mistakes are the result of ignorance of the applicable rules, ineligible expenses or attempted fraud on the part of end beneficiaries (farmers, local authorities or project managers)."
"Who is to blame for this?"
"Firstly, the Commission, which, according to the Treaties, is directly responsible for the implementation of the European budget."
"It has to strengthen the quality of internal control, and procedures must be simplified to prevent non-compliance with eligibility criteria, the double charging of costs and the overstatement of costs."
"Lastly, the Member States must also assume their responsibilities, given that 76% of the funds are spent by national or local administrations."
"It is in my view of paramount importance that the Member States undertake to submit their annual statements on how the EU funds that they manage are spent."
"Joint Undertaking for the European air traffic management system (SESAR) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of a Joint Undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR) - C6-0002/2006 -"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges on which you are invited to give an opinion is a thorough-going, high-quality report."
"I wish to thank Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, together with Mr Bradbourn, the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Legal Affairs, for their support for the Commission's proposal on SESAR, a major European project."
"Your report, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, coincides with the Commission's position, and we support most of your amendments."
"I shall not go into the details of the debate on all of the amendments that have been tabled, but limit myself instead to a few general remarks."
"First of all, I note that Parliament and the Commission take the same view of the strategic importance of major technological and industrial programmes like SESAR and GALILEO."
"SESAR is a vital programme for the competitiveness of the European aviation industry."
"It forms part of the Community's technological innovation programme, which lies at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy."
"In a sector as crucial for the European economy as this one, it is vital that public bodies and the private sector pool their resources to build together what will become the most efficient, most reliable and safest air traffic control infrastructure in the world."
"This public-private partnership requires a clear division of roles, together with transparent procedures, so that potential conflicts of interest can be pre-empted."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the amendments tabled by Parliament along these lines."
"As regards some of Parliament's means of intervention, there is a matter of principle at stake."
"SESAR is a partnership between the public and private sectors, and the essential prerequisite for private sector participation is that the programme is managed as a business."
"Furthermore, and Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges highlighted this point very well in her report, voting rights in the Administrative Board of the SESAR joint undertaking must be balanced and weighted in proportion to financial contribution, which is one of the sound principles of good management in any private business."
"It is accordingly difficult to accept Parliament's amendment aimed at gaining representation for Parliament on the Administrative Board."
"As Parliament is the Community's main budgetary control authority, it cannot perform its monitoring duties and, at the same time, sit even as a simple observer on a Board that it is charged with monitoring."
"On a similar theme, the industry is keen for the choice of executive director to be based on objective criteria of experience and technical knowledge, rather than on political criteria."
"It is important to acknowledge that the SESAR joint undertaking is an instrument for managing a technological research and development programme and has no regulatory-type role."
"Consequently, it would make no sense for Parliament to be directly involved in the process of selecting an executive director of the SESAR joint undertaking."
"The Commission does support, however, all amendments aimed at ensuring that Parliament be kept properly and continuously informed about the SESAR programme."
"Madam President, I am delighted with Parliament's work."
"I am convinced that a few differences of opinion will not hamper our joint efforts to make this programme a success for the EU."
"I should like to add that the whole of our environmental policy will receive a further boost, insofar as SESAR means aircraft being able to take off on time and not needing to be stacked, with the result that energy will be saved and needless carbon emissions prevented."
"This is why, from all points of view - passenger safety, energy saving and environmental quality - SESAR is an absolutely vital project."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today examining a report aimed at establishing a joint undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR)."
"As the technical arm of the single European sky, SESAR is tasked with adapting air traffic control to new technologies, ensuring the safety and regulation of flights, organising air navigation services and defining the respective roles and responsibilities of surveillance authorities and service providers."
"As you said, Commissioner, the project is, on various levels, of paramount importance to the future of European civil aviation."
"It is also one of the joint infrastructure projects identified by the 1994 European Council."
"We have already lost a good deal of time."
"SESAR will be indispensable, given the fact that air transport, which contributes some EUR 220 billion to the European GDP and employs 3.1 million people, is set to more than double in the next 20 years."
"Given that, because of its old age, the reliability of the control equipment, whose technology dates back to the 1970s in some cases, can no longer be guaranteed, SESAR will have a major impact on safety."
"The same goes for the environment."
"Once the project is up and running, it will be possible to make appreciable savings on fuel, due, on the one hand, to the optimisation of trajectories and better use of air space and, on the other, to a reduction in stacking."
"The Commission estimates that greenhouse gas will be reduced by 4% to 6% per flight."
"Passengers will also see their waiting times at airports reduced as a result."
"The Commission is proposing the establishment of a joint undertaking."
"It is to get off the ground quickly, even before the end of the definition phase, which runs from 2005 to 2007, and is to receive some EUR 60 million in cofinancing from the Community budget and Eurocontrol."
"Between 2008 and 2013, the joint undertaking will take charge of the development phase with a budget of EUR 300 million per year divided between three partners - the Commission, Eurocontrol and a consortium of private businesses."
"Then comes the deployment phase, which will be taken charge of by the industry and which is predicted to last from 2014 to 2020."
"This first public-private partnership in the field of civil aviation will bring numerous job opportunities."
"It will also be a major research and development project that may extend into markets outside the Union, provided this does not delay its entry into force."
"The enhanced cooperation procedure between our two parliamentary committees reflects the relevance of this project to two areas, namely research and transport networks."
"The Commission based its project on Article 171, meaning that Parliament was not involved in codecision."
"I should like to mention, however, the positive spirit of collaboration with the Commission and to say that Parliament will keep a close eye on events and that it will do all it can to help even if it is not represented on the Administrative Board."
"The amendments that we have introduced clarify the text as regards potential conflicts of interest."
"We also asked the Commission to produce a new document dealing solely with the third phase in order to dispel a significant proportion of the doubts raised by the first project."
"SESAR is a project that will serve the citizens' interests, that will place the European civil aviation industry at the cutting edge of progress and that will enhance our competitiveness."
"The industry's interest in the project justifies its financial involvement, and the distribution of voting rights will have to prevent any cumbersome administrative procedures."
"Parliament believes it has done the right thing in keeping open the possibility of creating a levy given that the industry's contribution, supported by figures, has yet to be confirmed."
"All that remains, Commissioner, is to express the hope that SESAR suffers neither the delays that affected Galileo, nor the debacle that beset Airbus, and that it shows that European research, Eurocontrol's know-how and the capacities of the industries concerned can come together in the interests of progress."
"Finally, it goes without saying, Commissioner, that the Member States will have to be prepared to organise the distribution of air traffic control on the basis of technological development."
"To conclude, I should like to thank all those who contributed and, primarily, Mr Bradbourn, my co-rapporteur."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - Mr President, the SESAR project is one which will greatly benefit not just Europe's aviation sectors, but the consumer as well."
"When SESAR is launched, airline efficiency will be improved, with more direct routing, less congestion in the skies and greater reliability for passengers."
"The environment will also benefit from the system, because it will shorten routes and reduce stacking and thus reduce the CO2 emissions caused by aviation."
"However, it strikes me that, with such an important project, it is unacceptable, given that the original single skies legislation was dealt with under codecision, for the implementation process only to be carried out under the consultation procedure."
"That surely raises the question as to why the Commission feels it can pick and choose about when to involve the only democratically elected EU institution in the development of such proposals."
"More worryingly, the Commission and Eurocontrol are attempting to accrue to themselves 60% of the voting rights on the Administrative Board."
"The SESAR project should be driven by industry, not by bureaucrats."
"We cannot expect industry to pay for the development of a project when it will have little control over its direction."
"That is why I and the co-rapporteur on the lead committee, on behalf of our group, have tabled an amendment to reduce voting rights, to give industry and the air navigation service providers the incentive to be involved from the outset."
"The SESAR project can help shape the future of European aviation."
"It can be a positive force for change if it is given the support of all players in the sectors on a fair and equal basis."
"I therefore call on the House to support our amendment to give this important project just the direction it needs."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, over the coming years, we will see more traffic on land, on water, and - above all - in the air as well, and more traffic means new problems, and more of them."
"The increase in quantity must be managed, the associated health and environment issues must be satisfactorily addressed, and all that will cost a lot of money."
"What we need to deal with the issues I have just mentioned is above all intelligent solutions, new technologies and better logistics, and it is on these things that we actually ought to be concentrating today."
"Unfortunately, though, we have not got that far yet."
"A number of things are already in the pipeline, though, and one that springs to mind is Galileo."
"At present, though, we are still concentrating on preparatory matters such as: how the administrative organisation should be structured, what we should do about Eurocontrol, how to involve the private business sector in our project, and much else besides."
"I would like to say a few things of an admonitory nature about public-private partnerships; it is right and proper that we should discuss these and focus on potential conflicts of interest, but we should be doing much more to get the business sector actually involved in our project."
"It has to be said, though, that previous experience with PPP models has scarcely ever been really successful."
"One exception I would point to - not least because we will be kicking off its successor in a few weeks' time - is the Marco Polo programme, where we managed to come up with the right mix of incentives for the private sector and the public interest, and that is the sort of thing we should concentrate on this time - more so than we did before."
"Quite apart from all that, I want to say how very grateful I am to both rapporteurs for the work they have put in, and that I hope that we will, despite the question as to whether this House should exercise codecision or only be consulted on this issue, head for our goal with concentration and in unity."
"Perhaps we will manage to tighten up the timetables a bit."
"That would have a very, very beneficial effect."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her sterling work on the report on a common European air traffic management system, SESAR."
"I agree that there is a need to develop a new generation of European air traffic system so that we might guarantee safe and smoothly flowing air traffic in Europe over the next 20 years."
"The current air traffic control systems are outdated and governed unduly by specific local conditions."
"They are, therefore, not especially suited to a rapid, reliable and economically sustainable development of air traffic in Europe."
"Therefore, SESAR is basically a sound initiative, which will make the air traffic management system in Europe more efficient."
"SESAR will mean safer and more efficient transport than is offered under current air traffic control systems, and at a reasonable price."
"When, however, it comes to environmental considerations, the Commission proposal sheds insufficient light on the challenges posed by increasing air traffic over the next few years in Europe."
"SESAR must not merely guarantee the safe management of air traffic. The environmental advantages must also be present."
"I am therefore able to support the amendments emphasising that SESAR must lead to more energy-efficient air routes that require less fuel to be used and are kind to the environment."
"Another important consideration is that it be made clear what benefit the Member States are to gain from SESAR, that is to say in terms of property rights to the material and non-material assets created through the SESAR Joint Undertaking."
"At the moment, it is not clear what is to happen regarding the rights of ownership of the assets produced through the SESAR Joint Undertaking when the ownership of SESAR is at some point transferred to industry."
"It is therefore crucial for the knowledge and assets created through SESAR continuously to be accessible to the constituent members for the purposes of their own, non-commercial product development."
"We do not want to end up in a situation in which all the Member States have standardised their technology in a European air traffic management system while, at the same time, the rights to this technology are owned by a private undertaking."
"I would again thank Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges for her report and hope that, through our joint efforts, we can launch SESAR within the planned timescale."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work."
"We need a new-generation air traffic management system for Europe to improve air transport safety and environmental performance."
"SESAR will deliver what the archaic and fragmented current air traffic control technologies are incapable of."
"The SESAR joint undertaking must be established now in such a way that we avoid unnecessary problems and delays further down the line."
"The approach of a public-private joint undertaking is still quite a new one and I hope that the Commission will be up-front and transparent on lessons learned from the Galileo joint undertaking."
"The SESAR joint undertaking needs to be reviewed periodically to make sure that the teething troubles experienced by Galileo are not repeated."
"Parliament, as well as the Council, should be kept informed and consulted on issues such as the accession of new members and the appointment of the executive director."
"It was strongly felt in committee that the appointment of the executive director must be made following an open competition and on criteria of competence and experience."
"In no way should it be a political appointment or a perk."
"The committee also stressed the ongoing importance of Eurocontrol."
"Its involvement is essential, given its experience and expertise."
"Finally, on the issue of where the joint undertaking should be located, I agree with the original Commission proposal that for practical reasons the seat should be in Brussels."
"Opening up the seat as a discussion point would unnecessarily waste time and could prolong the establishment phase of the joint undertaking."
"This is a point which will not be lost on those MEPs who deplore the waste of time, money and energy caused by the failure to locate Parliament permanently in Brussels."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if it is used properly and enters into effect as soon as possible, SESAR will be able to make an important contribution to reducing the gases that are detrimental to climate."
"It will be possible, by means of good cooperation with weather services and proper arrangement of flying altitudes and speeds, to reduce not only the numbers of aircraft circling over cities while waiting to land, but also the condensation trails that more recent research highlights more emphatically as causes of climate problems."
"Its efficient functioning is dependent on, among other things, the creation of regions of airspace that are well suited to helping to saving on fuel; it is unfortunate, though, that work on these is progressing very, very slowly, and this is an area in which Austria, like its northern and eastern neighbours, has work to do."
"The organisational form was a major topic of discussion in our committee, and I do not believe that Eurocontrol should under any circumstances be marginalised."
"There needs to be some central body to defend the public interest - which includes, and must in our view include, such things as climate protection - and Eurocontrol is probably better suited to doing that than the votes of industry alone, and industry's participation in this area can be ensured by other means."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, air traffic above Europe is gradually beginning to come up against restrictions arising from the large concentration of airports and the need to cope with ever more aeroplanes taking off."
"Some of these problems have already been solved by means of the International Civil Aviation Organisation agreement and other legislation adopted at various levels."
"The issue of air traffic is solved mainly by means of an international convention on managing medium height air traffic above central Europe, which has yet to enter completely into force."
"The SESAR programme should pave the way for significant progress in this matter."
"I should like to take this opportunity to raise two questions."
"The first concerns the funding of the projects."
"I feel that we should be very wary of using private capital, because this is one of the key projects in this area."
"It is important, in my view, that the lion's share of the funding should not come from the private sector."
"Funding should, rather, come from Eurocontrol charges and from the EU budget."
"A second question which is certainly important and has long been left unresolved is the definition of the parts of the air fleet to which the new air traffic system will apply."
"The question of differentiating between aircraft and ultralights remains."
"There is a different classification in force in Europe to that in the United States."
"I should therefore recommend that the determining factor be defined in the charter of the joint undertaking as an aircraft standby weight of 600 kg."
"I believe that harmonising the definition in this way will be beneficial for future negotiations relating not only to air traffic but also to air transport as a whole."
"To conclude, I wish to say that my group firmly supports the SESAR project."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work."
"The problems of air traffic, which is currently growing at a rate of approximately 5% annually, demand a solution that is quick, comprehensive and effective but at the same time caters for the long-term perspective."
"If the necessary steps are not taken immediately, Europe's airspace will soon be in gridlock."
"It is therefore good that we are implementing the joint undertaking SESAR, which will serve aviation management and safe operation of European airports."
"I am pleased by the news that the measures will improve the punctuality of connections and air safety, as well as having a positive effect on the environment."
"This undertaking should provide jobs for many highly-qualified people."
"The cofinancing of this project by the European Union and the private sector is a very important issue."
"I hope this project is approved, as it deserves implementation."
"It should, however, stimulate compatible solutions in other parts of the world."
"We should also continue to search for radically innovative solutions, for example, airborne air hubs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the SESAR is a very good idea, but you will, however, need to tell us directly something that not even you know: what will its scope be?"
"Where is Europe's airspace on the southeast side?"
"Do we know?"
"We need to determine this space."
"A few months ago a Turkish military aeroplane shot down a Greek military aeroplane southwest of Rhodes in European airspace, while a passenger aeroplane from Egypt was flying overhead within eye contact."
"Can you imagine what might have happened?"
"How, therefore, shall we determine its scope, when the Turkish FIR rather than the Nicosia FIR apply when you pass over the northern section of Cyprus, which is a member of the European Union."
"First determine the scope and then we shall welcome the SESAR which, in all events, is designed to speed up passenger movements."
"Fine, we shall succeed in the air, but what is happening on the ground when, for various bottles, perfumes and so on, we delay another half an hour so that someone does not take an extra gramme of deodorant. This is all stupid and ridiculous."
"If you want to determine something properly, go the whole way."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of its contribution to employment and to doubling GNI in the next two decades, the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR) will be one of the priorities of the EU and its Member States and a vital factor in meeting the challenges of the decades ahead."
"It will deliver security and fluidity in air transport at European and world level, and improve the functioning of the market, competitiveness, environmental impact management and European cohesion."
"I should like to mention some important points."
"Firstly, the legal basis should not only be Article 161, but should be based on both Articles 161 and 163, with a view to increasing and enhancing Parliament's involvement."
"Secondly, as you suggested, Commissioner, with a view to delivering efficient air traffic management and technology, without placing too great a burden on the taxpayer, private initiative, the industry, the operators and the scientific community should be guaranteed a role in the management model, and an absolutely central role should be given to the Commission and Eurocontrol, which are the partners with the biggest public responsibility in terms of financial contribution and participation in the vote."
"Mr President, the European Union had to develop this system of air traffic control, bringing together the 40 different networks currently in place in the EU, as a result of the projected increase in the volume of air traffic."
"That is why I believe the SESAR system to be of tremendous importance, and I congratulate both rapporteurs on their work."
"As an aside, I do not believe that an EU-US open skies arrangement will be possible in the near future, owing to the outcome of the recent elections in the United States."
"European governments will therefore have to strike individual agreements with the American Government in this area."
"Indeed, a member of the Irish Government has signalled that this is the route it will have to take in order to put in place an aviation agreement."
"I would also like it to be put on record that any such arrangement should guarantee the future of Shannon Airport in the west of Ireland, in its present form, owing to its importance to that region as a vital economic hub."
"Mr President, I must thank the speakers who have all shown Parliament's interest in the SESAR project, which will have a highly beneficial effect not only on air transport, but also in terms of environmental quality and energy savings."
"I should like to say to Mr Bradbourn that we have chosen the legal basis that we felt was most suitable for the purpose of this regulation."
"The objective at hand is to set up a joint undertaking charged with managing a technological research and development programme."
"This legal basis is Article 171 of the Treaty, as Mr Fernandez has just said, and this has been confirmed by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and by the Commission."
"I wish to stress the point, as mentioned by Mr Rack, that this is an example of a good public-private partnership (PPP), with, of course, the support not only of Eurocontrol - something on which you insisted - but also of the whole air transport industry, which of course will be the main beneficiary and is therefore very interested in seeing SESAR get off the ground."
"Even though this procedure provides for consultation with Parliament, rather than codecision, it goes without saying, Mr President, that I shall make it my business to keep Parliament regularly updated, in a most transparent way."
"As Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, the rapporteur, emphasised, we must of course do everything to prevent any delay to the programmes in question."
"This is what I wanted to say."
"I extend a warm vote of thanks to Parliament for the invaluable help it has given us in implementing this project which, as I said before, should give the EU the best possible air navigation system."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"Measuring devices containing mercury (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Sornosa Martínez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury - C6-0064/2006 -."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Sornosa Martínez, for her work on this proposal for what is a very important directive, forming part of the Community action to deal with mercury, the Community strategy on which was debated in this House only recently."
"This has to do with our common desire to prevent more mercury finding its way into the environment, and, in order that we may have no misconceptions about this, what we are talking about here is not just any old poison, but a particularly dangerous one, for mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to human health and the environment."
"The object of the directive we are debating today is to prevent new measuring devices containing mercury getting into circulation, and, if we were to succeed in that, we would prevent 30 tonnes of mercury - which adds up to a very considerable health hazard - getting into the environment."
"The proposed directive will prohibit outright the placing on the market of clinical thermometers containing mercury, the reason being that alternatives to them have been available for some time."
"It will also prevent the sale to the general public of all other measuring instruments containing mercury."
"These proposals were put together on the basis of a risk assessment and an extensive impact assessment devised for the mercury strategy, followed by consultations with the industry and with other interested parties."
"The proposed directive will not only ensure the protection of human health and of the environment, but also serve to maintain and strengthen the internal market, as harmonised rules for the marketing of measuring devices containing mercury apply throughout the Community."
"Members of your House have now tabled a number of amendments aimed at securing derogations."
"I agree with you that the marketing of antique measuring instruments should indeed continue to be permitted, 'antique measuring instruments' being those that are at least 50 years old, and, being in the main collectors' items, they are, by reason of their value, handled with very great care, traded only in very limited numbers, and the risk of such items ending up in waste is minimal."
"I can also support a time-limited derogation for new barometers containing mercury and manufactured by a few small specialised enterprises."
"A transitional period of two years will enable these businesses to adapt their production arrangements to the new rules without a disproportionate risk being presented to the environment."
"While I regard two years as appropriate, I have to make it clear that there is no reason for mercury to be used in the devices produced by these manufacturers, for they are capable of producing the same results without it, and, under certain circumstances indeed, a better one."
"There is no argument to support the idea that newly-manufactured devices of this kind must contain mercury."
"It is not the case that new technology needs to be developed first; the alternatives have been in existence for some considerable time."
"These manufacturers must be expected to comply with the demands of European legislation, and I am going to be very strict about this; two years really should be enough time in which to adapt."
"The situation is actually rather different as regards the use of measuring instruments in the health sector."
"It has been proposed in your House that there should - subject to a review at a later date - be a derogation from these restrictions for devices for measuring blood pressure, and I do in fact believe that there should be one."
"Sphygmomanometers are, in any case, used only in certain medical applications, and are absolutely indispensable in certain medical situations in which measurements are required to be of the utmost exactitude."
"We have examined this question in very great depth."
"Members of the medical professions regard sphygmomanometers of this kind as indispensable, especially in certain life-threatening situations, and so we should wait until safe and equally reliable alternatives to these devices have been developed before extending the provisions to the health sector."
"It follows that we have not reached the end of this process; on the contrary, more work is needed in this area."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to say that the negotiation process was characterised by close cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and so the Commission can therefore agree to all the compromise amendments proposed by your rapporteur, that is to say Amendments 12 to 18."
"I very much hope that we will be able to get this directive adopted at first reading."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House all agree that it is necessary to reduce the demand for mercury in the manufacture of products and to speed up its substitution."
"It would be appropriate to introduce Community level marketing restrictions on mercury-containing measuring and control equipment for consumer use and, with some exemptions, in the healthcare sector"
"We must prevent considerable amounts of mercury entering the waste stream."
"In that way, we shall contribute to guaranteeing a high level of protection of the environment and human health, whilst preserving the internal market, as required by Article 95 of the Treaty."
"Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife."
"Initially seen as a diffuse local problem, mercury pollution is now understood to be global, chronic and serious."
"As regards a potential blanket ban on the use of mercury in all devices, which is the aim of this proposal, it should be emphasised that the experts the Commission consulted came to the conclusion that hospitals need a high level of accuracy to treat life-threatening conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmia and pre-eclampsia."
"Mercury sphygmomanometers provide the appropriate level of accuracy and reliability to ensure patient safety. We are therefore currently proposing that these instruments be exempted from the ban until there are complete guarantees with regard to the functioning of possible alternative instruments."
"I would also call on the Commission to adopt short-term measures to ensure that all products containing mercury currently circulating in society are collected separately and safely processed. Otherwise, this Directive will be less effective in practice."
"Its dumping in rubbish tips or its inappropriate disposal causes waste mercury to infiltrate waste water and to be dispersed into the environment."
"Mercury is therefore found in foodstuffs, posing a particular risk to the aquatic food chain, making consumers of fish and molluscs particularly vulnerable."
"You said it, Commissioner: 30 tonnes may remain inadequately treated in rubbish dumps."
"Furthermore, I would call upon the Commission to increase awareness within the population, through the organisation of information campaigns on the health risks resulting from exposure to mercury and the environmental problems it may cause, since I fear that the citizens are not sufficiently well-informed about its toxicity."
"With regard to the amendments presented, like the majority of political groups, I hoped that there would be an agreement, as there has been with the Council and the Commission, with regard to barometers."
"The agreement we have reached relates to the exemption from the obligations laid down in this Directive for scientific instruments containing mercury, such as barometers over 50 years old intended for sale or marketing on the international antiques market."
"With regard to the production of mercury for new traditional barometers, we proposed an agreement: that there should be a transitional period for manufacturers to allow them time to conform to the new rules."
"Unfortunately, not all of the political groups have agreed to this, although I believe that we will have a sufficient majority in this House to adopt it."
"Finally, I hope that Parliament will sign up to the agreement with the Council at first reading, so that it can be applied as soon as possible and so that, in this way, the industrial demand for mercury can be reduced, speeding up its substitution with other materials that are not harmful to human health and do not prejudice the conservation of the environment."
"In summary, Commissioner, I entirely agree with what you have said."
"I would like to thank the Commission for its work and for the possibility of reaching an agreement at first reading."
"Thanks, too, to the Council and to the political groups that have agreed with this proposal."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, may I first of all pay tribute to the work that Mrs Sornosa Martínez has done on this report, even though I do not agree with all of her conclusions."
"Nevertheless, we have worked very well together on this."
"In March this year the House debated the Commission's mercury strategy."
"It asked the Commission to restrict the marketing and use of mercury in all measuring and control equipment but to allow for some exemptions."
"It also called on the Commission to permit the use of mercury by the small number of professional companies in the EU that produce traditional barometers."
"Nevertheless, I am sorry to say that the Commission completely ignored Parliament's wishes at that stage and went on to propose the directive that we are debating today."
"This directive will ban the production of all new barometers."
"As Members will be aware, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety subsequently adopted an amendment, which I tabled, introducing an exemption for this long-established traditional European art."
"Along with Mr Blokland, we have retabled that amendment for plenary to consider."
"I would point out to the Commissioner that we are not talking about the general introduction of new mercury into the environment - the vast majority of these makers actually use recycled mercury taken out of the environment in the production of these new instruments."
"There are a very small number of SMEs throughout Europe that continue this traditional art, mainly in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Portugal and the UK."
"If this directive is implemented as the Council wishes, those businesses would almost certainly be forced to close, thus eliminating places where consumers can take their existing instruments for repair and for maintenance."
"Let us not forget that there are hundreds of thousands of traditional barometers hanging on people's walls all over Europe."
"This directive would of course not affect that, but it could potentially remove places where people could get those instruments repaired and maintained."
"The banning of new barometers will not stop pollution; in fact it could become more prevalent as the general public would have nowhere to take their instruments."
"There are also some enormous loopholes in the legislation."
"It is only the marketing of new devices that is prohibited."
"There is nothing to stop manufacturers from selling new barometers without any mercury, along with a set of instructions on how consumers can fill them themselves."
"That is surely more hazardous than allowing them to continue production in carefully controlled and licensed circumstances."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I think the case for this legislation is compelling."
"The Commissioner said that there are alternatives to mercury barometers and I therefore support everything my colleague Mrs Sornosa Martínez has said."
"Mercury is extremely toxic."
"It is bioaccumulative and persistent in the environment and there is no safe exposure level."
"I ask the PPE-DE Group to think again."
"To Mr Callanan and the Conservatives I say that at your party conference your leader said that you want to replace dangerous chemicals with safe ones."
"The Tory Party website says that you are going to do that."
"You have to vote to change things and not just say you are going to do so."
"I hope that the PPE-DE Group will support this very sensible measure to phase out an extremely dangerous chemical from our environment."
"We have given a two-year extension to companies to phase out their production."
"That is not what the Council wanted, but we have 25 governments here, experts from 25 countries, the European Commission and the majority of political groups, and I hope that the House will support the report and be consistent with the principle of substitution of dangerous chemicals."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Sornosa Martínez for her excellent report and her cooperation with all the shadow rapporteurs."
"I also want to note the very helpful assistance of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as well as that of the Commission and the Council in formulating a small number of necessary final compromise amendments."
"Mercury, as you will all know by now, is a highly toxic substance that we all want and need to get rid of from our lives and the lives of generations to come, as soon as and as effectively as possible."
"The legislative proposal will begin to put into effect the mercury strategy that we endorsed in March this year and will ban or substantially reduce the presence of mercury in various non-electrical and non-electronic devices."
"Instruments containing mercury such as the household thermometer will be replaced by more accurate and versatile, quicker and safer measuring devices that do not contain mercury."
"As with most pieces of legislation, some differences of opinion were encountered in the examination of this proposal."
"Thankfully, a sensible compromise agreement was reached by most groups, but there are certainly still objections from some MEPs."
"The problem has been the insistence, mainly by a few English, Dutch and Belgian colleagues, that modern antique-looking barometers manufactured by a very small number of SMEs in England, Holland and Belgium should still be allowed to contain mercury."
"This is despite the fact that a two-year transitional derogation period has been allowed after the entry into force of the directive; despite the fact that, at the end of the two-year derogation period, the Commission is to review the availability of reliable safer alternatives that are technically and economically feasible for use in such instruments; despite the fact that barometers that are genuine antiques, i.e. more than 50 years old, would be exempt from this directive; and despite the fact that, if the compromise agreement in respect of barometers falls through, the whole legislative proposal effectively falls and has to go back to the drawing board."
"Do not allow yourselves inadvertently to be used by those who might want to kill the legislation as a whole and those who might want to use the issue of barometers to promote their Eurosceptic views."
"Please vote in favour of the compromise amendments and help get rid of toxic mercury, for health's sake."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, mercury thermometers have been banned in Sweden for more than 20 years now."
"At long last it is time for the EU to follow suit."
"Mercury measuring instruments are the technology of yesteryear. Mercury is a gravely hazardous chemical that we must stop using as soon as possible."
"Any claim that mercury is not dangerous is absurd."
"Even worse is mercury that leaks, finds its way into combustion plants or in some other way is disseminated and converted in the environment into readily absorbable forms that are yet more harmful to people and animals."
"We cannot, for reasons of nostalgia, continue to produce barometers that are environmental hazards."
"Anyone who wants to can buy an electronic replica that looks exactly like an old-fashioned barometer."
"Alternatively, they can buy a second-hand one, as the directive is about the release onto the market of new barometers."
"In the compromise, barometers have been given a two-year reprieve, which is completely unnecessary from a technical point of view, as the Commissioner said, but was unfortunately necessary from a political point of view in order to make it possible to reach a compromise in the light of far too much readiness to be persuaded by industry lobbying."
"Anyone voting in favour of anything other than the compromise will be sabotaging this entire piece of legislation and will be preventing any phasing out of mercury thermometers at all."
"We would then have to start again from the beginning within the REACH framework."
"The Commission is due to put forward proposals within the next two years for the phasing out, if possible, of other measuring equipment, in particular blood pressure gauges."
"I would like to remind the Commission that the compromise states: as soon as reliable alternatives are available."
"This is the case for blood pressure gauges in many instances."
"Go straight home to Brussels and compile a report on restricting the marketing of blood pressure gauges as soon as possible."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, I too should like to take my turn, having thanked and congratulated Mrs Sornosa Martínez on her work, to urge you to support the compromise amendments designed to remove mercury from measuring devices used by European consumers."
"The compromise amendments are the minimum and most realistic approach for protecting consumers and reflect the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council."
"As regards the proposed exemption from the directive for barometers, I call on you to reject it."
"Any such exemption jeopardises the final opportunity to limit mercury in measuring devices for which there are alternative solutions before the legislation is adopted for the REACH programme."
"This specific action is of paramount importance in order for the legislation on measuring devices containing mercury to be adopted as quickly as possible."
"At the same time, I should emphasise that, if the amendments on barometers - with the exception of those in the package of amendments - are accepted, the barometer industry will not achieve anything substantial other than, perhaps, gaining one or two years."
"It is almost certain that the Commission, either through REACH or through comitology, will revert to its initial position, which makes no provision for barometers to be exempted."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise that the package of compromise amendments follows our previous cohesive resolution on mercury for which Mr Marios Matsakis acted as rapporteur."
"Our aim must again be to protect the environment and public health and European consumers."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, although mercury and the compounds produced by it, in particular methyl mercury, are highly toxic, banning the sale of mercury thermometers, including specialised thermometers and other measuring devices with just an eighteen-month transition period is excessive and unreasonable, particularly for Poland and other countries where mercury thermometers are universally used not only in hospitals but for basic home diagnosis."
"Such a short transition period may have negative effects by compromising diagnosis, with the attendant health risks, and may impose additional financial strains on hospitals and household budgets, especially those of the less well off."
"In Poland we have a saying, 'when man hurries, the devil smiles'."
"Evidently the devil wants to get rich selling electronic measuring devices, while speaking fine words about people's health."
"We are in favour of a longer transition period."
"- (SK) I also welcome this report on mercury in the environment and on ways of reducing it."
"We all have to agree that where a substitute for a measuring device containing mercury exists, such a device must be removed from the environment."
"There is enough mercury in a single thermometer to contaminate fish in a twenty-hectare lake."
"However, it is also necessary to realise that there are other devices used in the healthcare sector that contain mercury but that as yet have no equivalent substitute - for example, pressure gauges, barometers and manometers."
"Mercury sphygmomanometers used in the treatment of high blood pressure or arrhythmia do not have an equivalent substitute capable of equal accuracy, and alternative methods would be extremely expensive."
"Therefore, I support the rapporteur's opinion that the directive should not apply to such healthcare-sector instruments, because while we might be decreasing mercury in the environment we would also be jeopardising patients' lives."
"The priority we must focus on in this legislative proposal is to reduce the amount of mercury in household waste."
"It will be probably difficult, particularly in the new Member States, to ask all households to replace the thermometers they use for measuring body temperature; however, we should be able to limit their use."
"Mr President, it is high time we acknowledged that mercury can and indeed does cause serious health problems."
"Mercury poisoning through the ingestion of mercury-contaminated food - usually fish - is the main source of contamination in the general public."
"Mercury and its compounds are not only toxic for humans: they also have very negative effects on wildlife and ecosystems."
"Therefore, the restriction of the use of mercury is highly desirable."
"However, I acknowledge the need to be realistic in the restriction of certain measuring devices containing mercury."
"Therefore, I welcome the fact that some medical devices are being excluded for the time being from the scope of the directive."
"Medical experts have indicated that in certain cases non-mercury devices may not be fully accurate, for example, for some cardiac conditions and in cases of pre-eclampsia."
"It is therefore preferable to continue to use mercury devices in these limited situations until suitable alternatives are fully examined and endorsed by the medical professions, but with a time-limited review clause for suitable alternatives appropriately validated."
"Given the toxicity of mercury, that is a reasonable demand to make on the industry, and I invite the industry to respond."
"I support the amendment originally tabled by my colleagues, which allows for a derogation for antique barometers and scientific instruments intended for sale or trade on the international antiques market and for the production and servicing of traditional barometers using small amounts of mercury in controlled and licensed environments."
"It is worth noting that traditional barometer-makers do not introduce new quantities of mercury into the marketplace but recycle existing mercury and, in this way, help to control and limit the substance - not to mention the fact that antique barometers are usually highly valued items and so even more unlikely to end up in our waste streams."
"Remember that the purpose of this directive is to ban the marketing of mercury-containing devices."
"It will allow the sale of a barometer with a separate phial of mercury to be added later by the consumer if we do not have a derogation for these antique barometers - a far less hazardous option in my view."
"(NL) Mr President, first of all, I too should like to express my support to Mrs Sornosa who has written an excellent report."
"As all speakers have said before me, given that mercury is very toxic, we must ban its use in all unnecessary applications."
"Given that alternatives are available, it is to be welcomed that the mercury thermometer, for example, is consigned to the past."
"Barometers are the subject of much debate, as we witnessed a moment ago."
"In the Netherlands, the use of mercury has been banned since 2003, but barometers were exempt until 2005 and then, pending fresh European rules, until 1 January 2006."
"This House is now arguing in favour of another two years' delay for traditional barometers, which is incredibly lenient of it."
"Whilst I can, of course, imagine that this is hard news for producers of barometers to take, if we want to banish mercury altogether, we must in any event ban consumer products that contain it."
"Products may break or leak, so that mercury ends up in the environment anyway."
"I hope we can finalise this legislation so that the mercury ban can be introduced as soon as possible."
"Mr President, across Europe barometer manufacturing has been part of our heritage for many centuries."
"It often involves the recycling of mercury from old instruments."
"The environmental and health threat posed is, I would suggest, so miniscule as to be out of all proportion to the devastating ban which this directive would impose on future production of barometers."
"It would kill off an historic skill in return for no meaningful gain."
"Thus I strongly support Amendment 19 to exempt barometer manufacturers from the ambit of this directive."
"Seeking to include barometers epitomises in a way the fanatical and irrational dogma that all too often drives and brings ridicule to otherwise sensible Commission proposals."
"I trust that in the name of common sense we will say no to the ban on the production of barometers."
"The Commission informs me that it does not wish to speak again."
"The debate is therefore closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"Mortgage credit (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Purvis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on mortgage credit in the EU."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, what I was trying to tell you before was that Mr Allister's speech was coming through in a foreign language on the English channel, so the English was being translated into something else, I do not know what."
"I am sorry Mr Allister, but we could not make out what you were saying!"
"European mortgage loans outstanding amount to some EUR 5 trillion, or 45% of the EU's GDP, and mortgage lending has grown by 9.4% per annum over the past five years."
"A home is usually the largest purchase made in a lifetime, and the related mortgage is the most important financial obligation most people ever have."
"It is no surprise, therefore, that the Commission has focused on this area as it shifts its attention to retail financial services."
"The mortgage market is fragmented along national lines and opening up this market should lead to consumers being offered better value and a greater choice of mortgage products."
"There could be more opportunities for those people who currently find it difficult to get a mortgage, such as first-time buyers or people with fixed-term contracts."
"It should make it easier for people moving to another EU country for work or retirement or wanting to buy a second property abroad."
"For lenders, a more integrated market would offer greater economies of scale, reduce costs and lower rates for the borrower."
"On the other hand, local culture and traditions have shaped the products available and consumers will not want any diminution of existing consumer protection standards."
"Full harmonisation would be expensive for the industry and could limit the range of products it offers."
"The industry is highly competitive within most of our Member States, so we must not take heavy-handed action that might damage this booming sector."
"We want to see a European mortgage credit market with a broad range of products at competitive prices and any changes must benefit mortgage borrowers above all."
"We are therefore against a grand harmonising piece of legislation."
"It would be bad for consumers and bad for business."
"Instead, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agrees that we should focus on targeted measures aimed at removing specific barriers to cross-border mortgages."
"Any measures should only be taken after impact assessments have shown that the benefits outweigh the costs."
"Non-legislative means are to be preferred wherever possible."
"Our first priority should be to bring about a better European funding market."
"There are a number of obstacles preventing this."
"I would therefore like to see a database covering the various mortgage markets and mortgage securities, so that investors can better evaluate and price mortgage pools."
"We suggest a range of standardised packages of European mortgages for trading on the capital markets."
"Mortgage brokers could play an important role in helping borrowers access mortgage credit from domestic and non-domestic lenders."
"I am pleased that the Commission has undertaken to assess any problems related to those credit intermediaries."
"On the issue of the annual percentage rate of charge, we need an EU standard."
"The majority in the committee wanted an EU standard comprising all the charges levied by the lender, but with information as far as possible regarding any other costs."
"The report considers that restrictions on early repayment charges and interest rates are likely to restrict the development of new products, especially those for higher risk borrowers, as well as the development of the funding market."
"Among other issues we raised are removing obstacles to the transfer of loans across borders and assessing the potential of the Euro-mortgage."
"The law applicable to mortgage credit contracts should be addressed, with the revision of the 1980 Rome Convention."
"On credit databases, we want to see a consistent format and non-discriminatory cross-border access to both positive and negative credit data, always subject to privacy protection."
"In the area of forced sales, we support the idea of a scoreboard, comparing the length and costs of judicial processes in the various Member States."
"Various professional bodies should agree on common property valuation standards."
"On land registers, the report favours improving access to standardised information, as well as supporting further work on the European Land Information Service."
"Tax barriers remain a problem and need to be looked at, even if their resolution is dependent upon the Member States under subsidiarity."
"The European Central Bank and the Commission have the important job of monitoring the potential risks of the massive and increasing levels of mortgage debt and their potential impact on capital markets."
"I much appreciate the support and input received from my colleagues on all sides of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The Commission seems to be set on much the same line as we propose."
"We look forward to the White Paper next year and we hope we will be able to continue the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed so far on this important subject."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010 sets out a roadmap for opening up Europe's fragmented retail financial services markets."
"One of the core elements of this strategy is our ongoing initiative on mortgage credit."
"The challenges of integrating European mortgage markets should not be underestimated."
"Differences in product characteristics, distribution systems, consumer behaviour and many other economic, structural and indeed social factors all have a significant impact on the sector."
"We should not forget that for most European consumers, taking out a mortgage is perhaps the most significant financial decision in their lives."
"Given the economic and social significance of mortgage lending, the Commission has adopted an open and consultative approach."
"Deliberations began in 2003 with the establishment of a forum group on mortgage credit, and a Green Paper was published in July 2005."
"A cost-benefit study was published in August 2005 to provide insight into the potential benefits of initiatives in the field of mortgage credit."
"The public consultation that followed the publication of the Green Paper confirmed that the Commission was on the right track."
"At the same time, however, it identified areas where further analysis was required, for example on mortgage funding, before the Commission could decide on the appropriate policy responses."
"Your report comes at an important moment in our deliberations."
"The consultation phase is drawing to a close and we are fast approaching a time when the Commission must decide how to proceed."
"I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their hard work in preparing what I believe is a carefully thought-through and pragmatic report."
"I would like to focus on some aspects of the report."
"I am pleased to read that you also believe that there are benefits to be obtained from integration."
"This position is consistent with our own analysis and the feedback that we have received in the Green Paper consultation."
"As the responses to the Green Paper consultation illustrate, there is a lot of debate on what the right means to achieve these benefits are."
"You propose a pragmatic and nuanced approach calling for focused measures accompanied by comprehensive impact assessments."
"As you know, I have a strong personal commitment to better regulation with a full impact assessment identifying the problems and setting out objectives and options."
"We in the Commission will be looking at the full range of tools at our disposal, not just legislative ones, in finding the most appropriate policy response to each issue addressed in the Green Paper."
"I welcome the fact that the report underlines the benefits from enhancing product diversity and asks the Commission to ensure that actions do not hamper innovation and competition."
"A wide range of products is currently available to borrowers in the European Union."
"However, in no single country can consumers have access to a complete range of products."
"In some markets, certain groups of borrowers - for example, the self-employed, or borrowers with low or incomplete credit profiles - find it difficult to obtain mortgages or are even excluded."
"Barriers also exist that limit mortgage lenders' incentives to operate cross-border, thus preventing new and innovative products and processes from being introduced in other markets across Europe."
"In this respect I think our goals fully concur with those set out in the report."
"Mortgage credit covers many contexts and technical issues ranging from consumer protection, through mortgage funding, to property valuation and land registration, to name but a few of the issues to be addressed."
"I look forward to continuing our very fruitful dialogue with Parliament on how best to address the policy challenges emerging from this in the interests of assisting the development of a genuine single market for mortgage credit that creates new opportunities for lenders and borrowers alike, and that ensures appropriate protection for what remains for the vast majority of Europeans the most important financial decision the make in their lives."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (ES) Mr President, I believe that the Commission has taken the right approach in relation to mortgages, because, as the Commissioner has said, it is probably the most significant commitment European citizens make in their entire lives: the loan to buy their own homes."
"We must therefore bear in mind that we are moving towards a single market and, within that single market, it does not make much sense to have 27 different national legislations or 27 different mortgage systems."
"Furthermore, it is an issue that relates to the most essential elements of the legal system of each State."
"Results will not be achieved either easily or immediately; it will take some time."
"In any event, we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection wish to stress the importance of making progress in the legislative field."
"It is not of course possible to adopt complete European Union legislation on mortgages, but it is possible to make some progress, in the field of information, for example, maximum permitted rates, repayment of mortgages at a given time, so that, when a citizen moves from one European Union country to another, they do not find themselves in a legal framework completely different to the one they are used to."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mortgage credit market continues to be divided up along national lines."
"Why is this so?"
"Is it because of difficulties with language, because of the different financial cultures, the legal framework, or is it because people have confidences in lenders with which they are familiar and which are on their doorstep?"
"What the Commission is proposing to do is to examine the possibility of harmonising the legal framework in order to increase the volume of cross-border lending and borrowing."
"Such an inquiry is to be welcomed."
"Even more to be welcomed is the statement in the Green Paper to the effect that extensive studies are still regarded as necessary before proposals for regulations can be made, and the Green Paper's own emphasis on the difficulty of the matter in hand."
"Legal differences in the Member States are not to be found in one area alone, although they certainly are present in mortgage law, but - as both Commissioner McCreevy and Mr Medina Ortega have just pointed out - they affect many aspects of the law, among them land registration, the practices of notaries, the law in relation to forced sales, the law of contract and the protection of consumers, all of which areas of the law are interconnected."
"In some of them, the European Union has no power to enact regulations, and harmonisation from the centre in one area could have seriously detrimental effects at the national level, doing, in fact, more harm than good."
"What is unreservedly to be welcomed, though, is further promotion of the refinancing markets, and so I want to say an unreserved 'yes' to this being investigated and analysed and to the efforts at achieving integration, albeit primarily through convergence."
"While I do not want to exclude the possibility of Europe-wide regulation, we do take a rather sceptical view of European legislation as a consequence of its capacity for destroying functioning markets."
"Extensive studies are, in any case, still needed."
"We also, perhaps, need to face up to the fact that this is where we reach the outer limit of what can be standardised in Europe through legislation at the European level."
"I do not think this House's role as legislator is without its problematic aspects, since it, when the Commission itself says that more extensive investigations are needed, must, to some degree, stay its hand and should not be precipitate in calling for legislative initiatives - and, indeed, has not done that."
"I endorse the essence of the report."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks to Mr Purvis for the work he has done."
"The Green Paper on mortgage credit that the Commission published in July 2005 triggered intensive debate on whether the EU's legislators should initiate action, and, if so, in which areas."
"Attempting to enact regulations applicable across Europe as a whole would seem to run up against very considerable differences between legal systems, and, above all, between financial cultures, but buying real property is the biggest decision on matters of expenditure that many households will take, and so the mortgage credit required to fund that is of commensurate importance."
"Studies show that private customers still - despite the euro and the internal market - have recourse to a credit institution they trust, as a rule to the bank with which they have an account, and that does of course have something to do with the fact that, of all financial markets, that for mortgage credit is the most complex."
"The giving of mortgage credit is therefore still carried out on a largely national, or indeed local, basis."
"Of all mortgage credit, only 1% is taken out across borders, not least - or so one surmises - as a consequence of the market and tax barriers involved; further integration would represent an estimated net 1% gain for European mortgage markets - a not inconsiderable sum that would be achieved over no more than ten years."
"If, then, we want an internal market in mortgage credit, we will have to guarantee that new rules applicable to it will result in a measurable added value for private customers."
"One of the most important things from the consumer's point of view is the ability to compare the various credit offers before signing a contract, along with the option of early repayment of part of the loan and the conditions subject to which variable or fixed interest rates may be agreed."
"The ways in which various associated charges are calculated must also be both comparable and transparent."
"Any new rules must also improve the situation of borrowers with poor or incomplete credit ratings, above all by enabling them to afford mortgages."
"Persons in this category include workers on short-term contracts and younger workers in particular, and these potential borrowers should not be excluded from the mortgage market."
"Experience has shown that the voluntary code of conduct to which over 3 000 lenders signed up in 2003 has not, in fact, been complied with, and here too there is a need for the Commission to review the situation and take action."
"In any case, though, the further integration of the EU's mortgage credit market would be beneficial not only to consumers but also to the economy."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to thank the rapporteur for a well drafted report and to emphasise the importance of the initiated discussion on a common European mortgage market."
"New needs in the mortgage sector are emerging due to the rapid integration of the EU labour and capital markets, and the development of the internal market."
"We think it is extremely important to duly assess the emerging challenges."
"First of all, there is a need to reduce the costs related to capital increase by creating a common market for mortgage financing and offering attractive and safe investment products."
"Secondly, there is a need to create favourable conditions for transition from the mortgage market of one country to that of another country in view of the increasing mobility of the labour force."
"Thirdly, there is a need to suitably organise the network of brokerage consulting services in order to provide the population with better choices and better access to more flexible and modern mortgage products."
"Fourthly, it is very important to enhance market transparency, as well as competitiveness, by unifying the payment procedures for various mortgage products and disclosing all costs related to the purchase of mortgage products."
"Acquisition of housing is one of the major and most significant life investments; therefore, the impact of all proposals must be thoroughly assessed and considered."
"Presently, mortgage crediting is mostly developed within domestic markets and is very fragmented, while development of a common mortgage market is considered to be a possibility for the banks to offer their mortgage products via their branches in other European Union countries."
"Therefore, the creation of a new mortgage market will be a serious and demanding challenge for all of us."
"(PL) Mr President, it is at present difficult to speak of a common European financial market."
"The financial market is highly fragmented, which causes legal, fiscal and regulatory problems."
"The majority of mortgages on the market are financed by the savings of small savers."
"Less than 40% of mortgages are financed by the capital markets, whose share is growing slowly, although this growth is insubstantial."
"In Sweden and Germany there are quite extensive markets in mortgage bonds."
"In Denmark, for example, mortgage institutions issue bonds to the entire value of the mortgage credit."
"While the market for mortgage credit-based bonds is strong in many EU countries, there are some countries where they do not exist at all."
"Over the last decade or so this market has also advanced a great deal in Poland, and this has had a substantial effect on economic growth."
"Seeing what a great impact this has had on the markets in our countries, I support the establishment of a legal framework allowing for effective portfolio transactions to be carried out."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, we are completing the consultation process launched by the Green Paper."
"Creating cross-border opportunities for lenders and borrowers raises important, but also very difficult, policy questions."
"There is no easy or quick fix."
"Over the next couple of weeks, I will be discussing with my services the options available for moving forward."
"Parliament's balanced report is an important contribution to this."
"I thank Mr Purvis and Mr Medina Ortega."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."

"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs on this report, in particular, Mrs Mastenbroek and Mrs Kudrycka, who have contributed to the final draft."
"Corruption represents a serious problem for the transparent management of public affairs: it undermines credibility, increases distrust of democratic institutions and jeopardises human rights and the rule of law, allowing organised crime to prosper."
"Corruption is an age-old problem of which there are many literary accounts: Cicero spoke of it as early as 70 BC."
"Unfortunately, the cancer of corruption has also gained a foothold in the workings of the European Institutions."
"It is worrying that the European Union Court of Auditors refuses to approve the Community budget because of serious doubts held over the proper use of funds, and it is equally embarrassing that the Belgian judiciary has opened legal proceedings against Commission employees for alleged payoffs for the acquisition of funds allocated for the Chernobyl nuclear disaster."
"In the same way, we see the problem of corruption in the use of the Structural Funds, as the funds are often managed for individual gain, or, as is the case in my region, the classifications are falsified, to the extent that the European Commission has had to impose fines of EUR 75 million."
"This is why we believe that problems of corruption are both subtle and dangerous."
"The fight against corruption must be a priority for the European Union, and, in our opinion, this Convention should also be signed by all the Member States of the European Union."
"In addition, we call on the Commission and the Council to take action so that, as well as this Convention being signed, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime is also signed."
"I believe that this represents a significant contribution towards the fight against organised crime, which is, unfortunately, still on the rise in the European Union."

"Formal sitting - Georgia"
"Mr President of the Republic of Georgia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you most warmly on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Three years ago, following parliamentary elections annulled by the regime of the time, the Rose Revolution took place in your country and history will associate your name with that revolution, Mr Saakashvili."
"Led by yourself, your compatriots demanded fair elections and an end to the corruption and bad governance that was ruining your country."
"(Applause)"
"Although the previous regime refused to accept your demands, it was brought down without a single drop of blood being shed."
"'People power' prevailed and the Georgian people were able to elect you en masse as the new President."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has supported democratic change in your country."
"We sent a mission of observers to the elections and our Committee on Foreign Affairs had the pleasure of receiving you soon after your inauguration as President, not here in Strasbourg but at our site in Brussels."
"The Rose Revolution reawakened hopes for real and free democracy in areas even further east of the Baltic, of Central and of Eastern Europe."
"A year later, the Orange Revolution took place in Ukraine."
"At that time the future seemed full of promise, but we are now seeing that many problems and obstacles have arisen on a journey that is certainly no easy ride."
"You have achieved a great deal over the years that have passed since then, but the conflicts in the break-away regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia have become worse."
"It is clear that Russia is now putting great pressure on your country - I can tell you that your country was discussed at great length at the dinner with President Putin - and you now have a great opportunity, on addressing the European Parliament, to explain the situation so that the representatives of the peoples of Europe can hear directly from you about the difficult circumstances being experienced by your country and the problems relating to energy dependency on your great neighbour."
"The European Parliament and the European Union as a whole fully support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of your country; there is absolutely no doubt about that."
"We have also said that the conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia must be resolved at the negotiating table, and by exclusively peaceful means."
"There can be no military solution to that problem either."
"In a resolution that we approved last month here in Strasbourg, we called upon Russia to put an end to all acts of repression and harassment against people of Georgian origin living in Russia and to revoke any measures recently taken against your country, including the suspension of all transport links and postal services."
"Nevertheless, we would also call for restraint in any verbal comments from all sides that may raise the tension unnecessarily."
"We believe that the Council and the Commission must find a way to help your country to overcome and compensate for the economic and social effects of the Russian measures against you."
"Mr President, we would like to express the European Parliament's support for the approval of the Action Plan on the European Neighbourhood Policy by the EU-Georgia Cooperation Council, which has taken place today in Brussels."
"We welcome you once again and I hope that your presence here will give us the opportunity, through dialogue, to overcome the problems faced by your country and which affect all of us."
"You have the floor, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"President of Georgia."
"(ES) Thank you very much for you words and your invitation, Mr President. They are very important to our country."
"Distinguished Members of Parliament, I wish to thank you for this kind invitation today."
"That we meet in Strasbourg is especially meaningful to me."
"It was here as a young student, coming fresh from the Soviet Union, that I first discovered Europe in all its diversity and richness."
"It was here that I first learned about human rights and the solemn obligation of the state to protect, rather than persecute."
"What a revelation!"
"And it was here that I dared to dream that one day what I studied could be applied to my own country and that I could plant those seeds which only now have finally blossomed."
"At that time, it was a radical and maybe even rather a dangerous dream, but it is one that I have never forgotten."
"Strasbourg is also important for me for another reason."
"It is the place where I met my wife Sandra at a human rights course."
"(Applause)"
"I called my mother from the street phone in the Orangerie across from the Council of Europe building where I was on an internship at the time to tell her that I had met a beautiful Dutch girl."
"Well, they are now sitting next to each other up there in the gallery."
"(Applause)"
"I am very proud that our multinational family is represented here today with three generations, including my grandmother."
"I want to say thank you, therefore, and thank you to this city and its institutions for giving me both knowledge and love, two priceless assets that I will never part with."
"Let me begin my remarks with a few words in Georgian."
"We do not want to be part of a debate as to whether we are part of old or new Europe, because I believe we are the oldest Europe, so we are observing from the side."
"(The President spoke Georgian."
"This is a translation)"
"On behalf of my country, I wish to express my gratitude to all of you - to the European Union, and to you the parliamentarians of Europe in particular - for your existence and your activism."
"Europe has always been home to many diverse nations, small and large alike."
"Georgians have been Europeans since the time Prometheus was chained to our mountains and the Argonauts came to our country in search of the Golden Fleece."
"When debates take place about the identity of Europe, if Georgians are European we do not participate in them."
"We are an ancient European nation."
"Georgians are not only Europeans, but we are enthusiastic Europeans and Europe was always the first choice to turn to for help and moral support through all the troubled periods."
"That which brings us together is a common and unbreakable bond, one based on culture, on our shared history and on a common set of values that has at its heart the celebration of peace and the establishment of fair and prosperous societies."
"This is the substance of what is often called 'the European project'."
"My nation is proud to be part of that just project and to contribute to its stability, strength and permanence."
"For in Georgia please know that you have a strong and reliable partner now and in the future, for ours is a common destiny."
"(The President switched back to English)"
"I just want to ask whether you have ever considered for a moment what the post-Soviet world would be like had there not been a European Union."
"At times like this, I am reminded of the vision and leadership that led to a united Europe, expressed so eloquently in 1950 by Robert Schuman."
"I wonder what Schuman would say today when presented with Europe's map and its current challenges?"
"From the rubble of war, you have created a beacon of justice, peace and prosperity."
"In that respect, your actions have provided the answer, as Schuman's vision continues to endure."
"In particular, your readiness to welcome new members from the former Soviet region has significantly strengthened peace and democracy in Europe."
"The success of these new Member States encourages countries like mine to move forward, for we have benefited and will continue to benefit from their experience and expertise, and your vision and prudence."
"Perhaps the best way in which I can express that gratitude is to state that we wish to emulate you!"
"But here let me be very clear: I do not want to alarm you by requesting outright that Georgia be admitted to the European Union."
"Membership is a distant goal, and it is not on our immediate agenda."
"Rather, it is the principles on which Europe is built that provide the cornerstones for our development."
"Here I see cause for optimism, based on enhancing our partnership."
"The Georgia we are creating is built squarely on the rule of law, human rights, democracy and peace."
"Our European path has been chosen by the Georgian people themselves."
"For them and for me, it is indeed the embodiment of our country's enduring European identity."
"It is the only way forward."
"I am in Strasbourg at a symbolic moment, because we will soon be celebrating the third anniversary of our Rose Revolution."
"As many of you know, three years ago Georgia was basically a failed state."
"Imagine a country where daily survival was a mighty struggle for all but the privileged few, where insecurity reigned and disorder prevailed, and where the security of the country was subsumed in the interests of larger neighbours."
"Georgia was a country with rampant corruption and endemic injustice, and certainly there was no rule of law."
"Today, three years on, Georgia has changed beyond recognition."
"We are reforming our institutions and economy to bring greater prosperity and stability to our people and our region."
"Had the changes of the last few years not been made, today we would be a totally failed state not only in our region but also in the European neighbourhood."
"Today, however, I believe Georgia can rise to the challenge of being a model European neighbour and that is the message I should like to share with you this afternoon."
"I make this claim before you because for the past three years we have consistently pursued four straightforward goals: the restoration of democracy and rule of law, the eradication of corruption, the creation of revenue for our citizens and the protection of our territorial integrity."
"All, as you can imagine, are interrelated and all have as their first assumption the strengthening of institutions and public accountability."
"For this vision to succeed, in essence, the poetry of democracy must be supported by the prose of the rule of law."
"In substance, this means enacting reforms based on the understanding that justice should reign in the country."
"When I say justice, I mean it in the European sense: democracy must be served by an infrastructure of values and institutions that give protection and opportunity to every citizen."
"The rule of law must prevail in a transparent manner that is equal to all."
"This is, of course, easy to say but harder to do, and I welcome the European Union's support in realising this vision."
"Today in Georgia we have completely reformed our police forces."
"As a result, Georgian drivers no longer worry about being arbitrarily stopped by traffic police demanding bribes."
"Georgian business owners do not fear random harassment."
"Three or four years ago a Gallup poll in Georgia showed that the rate of confidence in the police was less than 5%."
"Basically, the police force was the most hated institution in the country, but now, the rate of confidence is in the upper seventies."
"It is one of the most trusted institutions in the country and certainly more trusted than in any other countries in the post-Soviet region."
"This is a big change."
"We have made an irreversible commitment to reforming our judicial system and, through strong collaboration with European institutions, we created and are now funding a comprehensive multi-year programme."
"I wish to comment on some highlights."
"Today we are strengthening both the independence and professionalism of our judges and legal professionals, while at the same time reducing the powers of the President."
"With new constitutional changes, the President will no longer be able to appoint judges directly."
"I hope these changes will be adopted this December."
"We are reforming our legal education system and strengthening the protection of human rights by further educating our law enforcement officials."
"This is a matter of national interest."
"We are building new prisons that meet the standards of human rights monitors and streamlining legal procedures to ensure due process in due time."
"This is a matter of enforcing fundamental rights."
"We will continue to overhaul our system of justice, because without it our reforms will lack foundation."
"Today I am pleased to state that our Parliament exercises an unprecedented level of oversight."
"As Head of the Executive, I can attest to the fact that budgets are scrutinised, oversight is vigorous and careful consideration is given to Parliament in the decisions of the Executive."
"Georgia also enjoys one of the most liberal environments for the free press and a vibrant NGO community."
"Our media freedom legislation is one of the most - if not the most - liberal."
"Unfortunately for politicians, under Georgian law the media cannot be sued under any circumstances."
"That is good, because it offers more opportunities."
"Perhaps one of my biggest regrets to date, however, is the fact that Georgia still does not have an opposition that is sufficiently robust to challenge the Government."
"I do not say this lightly."
"It is not a good thing, but nothing would be more dangerous to a fledgling democracy than to artificially manufacture an opposition."
"It is bad for an aspiring government not to have a strong opposition which will be more responsible and more competent and which will test the Government."
"I am sure that this kind of opposition will be created as society develops."
"Perhaps one day - but I hope not that soon - it will prevail in open and fair elections."
"We have certainly established a political and legal environment in which that can happen."
"Now it is up to opposition groups to take the next step."
"Our path of transformation began with a very simple idea: that every citizen must feel secure."
"To achieve that, corruption had to be stamped out and that was our major goal."
"In order to provide a social safety net, we have been aggressive and imaginative in our economic reforms."
"Georgia today is an attractive target for investment."
"For a country with relatively few natural resources, we are left to work with our own ingenuity and discipline."
"That is why we have established the lowest tax rates in Europe, some of the most flexible labour laws and some of the simplest trade, customs and regulatory procedures."
"Liberal reforms have proven to be the best tool to fight corruption, while guaranteeing the freedom of business and protection of property rights."
"It has also proven the best way to generate revenue, so that we can build more roads, schools and hospitals."
"Today, I am proud of the fact that two years ago not a single school in Georgia had access to the internet, but now 80% of our schools have computers and internet access, and next year the process will be finished."
"We are building new schools comparable to the best schools in the Netherlands, Germany or the Czech Republic."
"This year we built 340."
"That is a lot for a small country."
"More roads have been built this year alone than since independence in 1991."
"At its annual meeting in Singapore this year, the World Bank ranked Georgia the most successful reformed country in the world and one of the best places in the world to do business."
"In two years we have switched from being one of the worst to one of the best places in the world to do business."
"Georgian economic growth this year will be strong, since, according to the World Bank, we are also the top-performing country among transitional economies in Eurasia in fighting corruption."
"In fact, the EBRD ranks us among the three most non-corrupt nations in Europe."
"Maybe other figures will say more about our achievements."
"The year 2004, the first year after our Rose Revolution, was the first time since 1991 that we had a positive immigration and birth rate."
"Last year, in a country of just under five million people, almost 100 000 more Georgian citizens came back to Georgia than left."
"They were in fact voting with their feet."
"It is an amazing story."
"So I do not think Europe should be afraid to open up to these areas, because Georgians are not going to flee to Europe overnight - they are coming back."
"(Applause)"
"An amazing symbol of this is the main central hospital in Tbilisi."
"It stopped being a hospital and was occupied by internally displaced persons from the war in Abkhazia."
"Last year a large team of Georgian high-level professionals came from the United States, Spain, Germany and Russia."
"They re-established the hospital."
"We helped them and carried out repairs."
"We provided the IDPs with assistance to leave and now it is one of the best hospitals in the world."
"Some Europeans said that there is only one other hospital of its kind in Europe."
"This is the symbol: Georgians like Nina Gedevanovna Ananiashvili, who was a top ballet dancer at the Bolshoi, are coming back and trying to recreate our country."
"She left a very lucrative career with the Bolshoi to come back and recreate our ballet group from scratch."
"It is now a very powerful group, perhaps one of the best in our part of the world, and it will soon be touring worldwide."
"Our goal now is to focus on steady job creation."
"With my economic advisor Mr Marklar, former Prime Minister of Estonia, who was one of the architects of the Estonian economic miracle, we have established very successful on-the-job training programmes."
"Our reforms in that sector will only be complete when every Georgian feels that he or she has a real opportunity for employment."
"Georgia is a country of tremendous warmth, hospitality and beauty."
"In fact I was just showing President Borrell an album of Georgian sites."
"It is a country that European travellers have enjoyed in the past and are now rediscovering."
"We are, in fact, Europe's best kept secret from that point of view."
"I would like to share with you a brief quote from the writings of Sir Oliver Wardrop, who in 1888 wrote a book entitled The Kingdom of Georgia."
"He wrote: 'There is no reason why Georgia should not become a popular resort."
"It is not so far away as people think."
"It has the great advantage of being almost unknown to tourists, there is none of the impudent extortion which ruffles our tempers nearer home and it is, after all, cheaper than Scotland'."
"Please, those of you from Scotland, do not be angry with me."
"I am only quoting."
"But in fact it is true!"
"(Laughter)"
"Reviewing the combined effect of our reforms, I believe it is fair to state that these steps have allowed us to move closer to Europe institutionally and culturally."
"You have provided the framework for further growth through the Neighbourhood Policy."
"Today we will be signing the Action Plan that translates many of our mutual priorities into detailed results."
"But in the spirit and the substance of that effort we must continue to build, for I want my country to work with Europe so that Europe knows it has an utterly reliable partner and friend in Georgia."
"For some, however, our strategy has proven an irritant, and it seems Georgia's reform path means we are departing from former - and, in their eyes, still applicable - spheres of influence."
"I believe, as you rightly said in your landmark declarations two weeks ago on Georgia, that the time of 'spheres of influence' is over."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to thank you for that declaration and for the very appropriate and specific language it contained."
"Each nation must have the chance to freely decide how and with whom it wants to build their future."
"We base our strategy on being a secure and reliable partner, not a tame and weak satellite."
"We are a nation with a long history of independence."
"That independence was interrupted 200 years ago with the violent expansion of the Russian empire."
"For three brief years between 1918 and 1921 we enjoyed another moment of independence."
"That again was taken away from us."
"What were the circumstances?"
"In 1921 the Bolshevik Army, claiming to protect a minority population in one of our regions, entered Georgia and reconquered it."
"During that period, more than 500 000 Georgians perished in the gulags, including several members of my own family."
"It was too expensive a price to pay and we are not willing to pay it again."
"We will not allow that history to be repeated, whatever it takes."
"After all, we are living in 2006, not 1938 or 1939, 1956 or 1968."
"At what point are small countries asked to sacrifice their aspirations for liberty?"
"How often can we ask the smaller party to tone down its voice and resist reacting to provocation?"
"Let us hope that we will never be asked to succumb and say that justice lies with size, numbers and power in this age, that might makes right and not vice versa."
"Let us hope that never again, when our or any other European nation is threatened, will the spectre of that famous reference by one statesman in the 1930s to 'quarrels in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing' be seen as an adequate response."
"Thankfully, I hope that policy has been left permanently in the past."
"I hope one day that Georgians, as well as proud representatives of that then far-away country the Czech Republic, will be equals in the European family."
"(Applause)"
"Today, because we have chosen to move as close as possible to Europe and to align ourselves with Euro-Atlantic institutions, Georgia is punished."
"Because we are a democracy, the pressures we are under have only resulted in further consolidation of our society."
"People who exercise pressure do not understand: you do not pressurise democracies, because you get exactly the opposite result from that you want to achieve."
"That has become increasingly challenging because, as you know, Russia has closed its market to Georgian goods."
"Our prized Georgian wines and mineral water - major sources of revenue - are now banned from the Russian market."
"The situation has worsened in the last few months as Russia unilaterally introduced a complete ban on transport and postal links with Georgia."
"Just a few days ago Gazprom announced a non-commercial more than doubling of the price Georgia must pay for gas."
"Altogether, in plain language, the sum of those measures can be called an economic blockade."
"I do not wish to use this opportunity to further elevate tensions between Georgia and Russia, or to see this afternoon as a chance to create anti-Russian feeling in the heart of Europe."
"We have enough tensions and enough mudslinging."
"Such rhetoric would serve no constructive purpose."
"Rather, it is now time for diplomacy, discussion, the constructive identification of areas of mutual interest and mutual responsibility."
"(Applause)"
"On behalf of my Government and my people, I stand ready to pursue that approach, for it is the only path."
"Let these words once again stand as an open invitation to our colleagues and all interlocutors to return to the path of normality and harmony through dialogue."
"I believe that the leaders of both countries share the responsibility for making sure that, under our leadership, relations between the two countries do not deteriorate beyond repair."
"Let us move forward with haste and good intentions."
"Like all of you, the people of Georgia are not and never will be anti-Russian."
"Please permit me to make reference to another great European statesman, Konrad Adenuaer, who, in his memoirs had this to say about his situation then: 'We were a small and very exposed country."
"By our own strength we could achieve nothing."
"We must not be a no-man's land between East and West, for then we would have friends nowhere and a very dangerous neighbour in the East'."
"Geography is a little different today, but I could apply some of those words to my country as well."
"Chancellor Adenuaer's words still resonate today."
"Our European aspiration is simply to be allowed to develop according to our own free choices, in harmony with all our neighbours, as many of you did decades ago."
"In that respect, I believe that current measures are temporary and that through patience and level-headedness, through dialogue and mutual respect, they will be lifted and our relations will and must normalise."
"That is a desire for which I have the full support of my people."
"However, if anything today gives me pause in our relations with Russia, it is the very issue that was raised so poignantly by the EU in Lahti and Luxembourg some weeks ago."
"Quite simply, it is the issue of justice."
"Here I would like to make reference to the great Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose then forbidden books I read with great passion as a teenager."
"He said: 'Justice is conscience, not a personal conscience but the conscience of the whole of humanity."
"Those who clearly recognise the voice of their own conscience usually recognise the voice of justice.'"
"I believe that your solidarity during this difficult period most clearly reflects the very same sense of justice. For when children with Georgian names are expelled from schools, all our children are at risk."
"When famous artists, writers, actors, sportsmen are hounded and silenced, we are all silenced."
"When thousands of citizens are forcibly deported from their homes, taken off the streets in handcuffs, we are all deported."
"I and the people of Georgia are grateful for your expression of support for our country."
"When we feared isolation, Europe raised the banner of our values."
"Indeed, this very Parliament has raised the voice of morality in Europe."
"We will never forget your solidarity."
"This is the awakening of fundamental values to which we all aspire."
"We see these values alive in Europe, in your statement."
"When I went to Lithuania after the Russian ban on Georgian wine, I saw young Lithuanian volunteers, including students from the Universities of Vilnius and Kaunas, going around supermarkets, together with their professors, telling shoppers to buy Georgian wine."
"They said that this was freedom wine, that Georgians were paying the price for freedom and needed immediate help, and that shoppers they should therefore buy that wine out of solidarity."
"The Polish army has decreed that at officers' receptions it will only serve Georgian wine, which is something we are very grateful for."
"We do not need arms from the Polish army, as this is a great help in itself."
"However, the greatest expression of solidarity came from within Russia itself."
"In fact the most powerful voices we heard were from there."
"I was moved by those Russian citizens who spoke out."
"There are many examples: in many parts of Russia ordinary citizens walked the streets bearing yellow stars with the words 'I am Georgian'; in Moscow, some high school directors threatened to fire any teacher who handed over lists of students with Georgian names to the police, at the risk of they themselves being fired on the spot for such acts; in St Petersburg, taxi drivers instructed by the city council to refuse lifts to passengers who even looked Georgian, and to refuse to take passengers to some of the numerous Georgian restaurants in the city, refused to obey those orders and threatened to go on strike if pushed."
"The acts of individuals can make a great difference."
"I was very touched by the words of the famous Russian actress, Inna Churikova, who recently said, 'Is every misfortune the fault of Georgians?"
"I do not like it when they try to brainwash me from the television screen."
"I already see the results: people are against Georgians and soon they will turn against Armenians and the others."
"This is shameful."
"I want to ask people - what are you doing?"
"Wake up!'"
"What courage and determination."
"I would also like to single out one more individual, the renowned Russian actor Alexander Saladasky, who is today's modern Russian hero because he applied for Georgian citizenship as a protest."
"Another modern Russian, and indeed European, hero is Shurshadze, formerly called Shurshin, a young student from St Petersburg about whom I read in the press."
"He, together with a number of his fellow students, in defiance of policies of xenophobia and hate, took a very bold step and changed his last name from Shurshin to Shurshadze, thereby giving it the Georgian ending."
"I think we are all inspired by the examples set by those Russian citizens, who have chosen to dissent from a policy that is contrary to what we call European values."
"I wish to thank all those people today from this place, the European Parliament."
"My purpose in travelling here today is to share with you Georgia's European vision."
"Part of that vision means applying 21st century European solutions to modern challenges."
"We are a small democracy which believes that only through and with Europe will our country and region become secure and lasting partners."
"We are unavoidably beholden to each other."
"And so, through European approaches to conciliation built on mutual interest, as well as on common values, we can arrive at solutions that will create an all-inclusive society where no one is a loser."
"To meet those standards, I want to give you some assurances and clarifications."
"In many circles, Georgia is labelled as a provocative state which is trying to restore its territorial integrity through force."
"I can say to you categorically that this is not true."
"Our intentions are peaceful and exclusively so, because we know what war is, we know what victims look like because they reside among our population today, and we know this cannot be a solution."
"I myself have dedicated my career and education to the study of human rights, specialising in particular in minority rights."
"I did my university thesis at the Norwegian Institute of Human Rights on minority rights, and more specifically those of the South Ossetian and Abkhaz peoples."
"Today fewer than 40 000 ethnic Abkhaz live in Abkhazia and fewer than 20 000 ethnic Ossetians in South Ossetia."
"I want you to know these figures because sometimes it seems like we are talking about hundreds of millions."
"They are a very small number of people, and as such I am especially sensitive to their concerns."
"I know what they are feeling."
"On the one hand these small groups have become pawns in a larger game - hostages if you like to big politics and a zero-sum vision, with the resurgence of imperial feelings."
"On the other hand, they have real and genuine concerns which I understand and with which I deeply sympathise."
"I know their concerns and we are trying to listen to and meet their needs."
"Unfortunately, there are many who continue to suffer from these conflicts."
"Over 300 000 ethnic Georgians, as well as Jews, Greeks, Russians and Ukrainians, were thrown out of Abkhazia."
"Even now we witness the property of those expelled peoples being inhabited by others, and in many cases sold illegally."
"Indeed, just recently one of the most famous Georgian-French film makers, Otar Ioseliani, while commenting on the recent campaign, remarked that history seems to be repeating itself, targeting the same victims for a second time."
"He reproached the world for being silent, just as it was the first time."
"He had this to say: 'The Russian administration first undertook ethnic cleansing in Abkhazia in 1993, where 500 000 people became refugees."
"Those who could not escape by walking through the high mountains were massacred by the hands of mercenaries."
"They devastated and destroyed the country."
"And by the way, then everybody was silent too.'"
"And now the same people are being picked up on the streets of Moscow."
"On my way to the European Parliament this morning I met two people from Abkhazia."
"They told me they had been deported from Russia, had paid a bribe to a policeman to be deported to France."
"It is all happening again."
"The first time was in 1993 and now it is happening again."
"So this is the painful legacy we have inherited."
"This time let us not be silent."
"Today we do not need retribution."
"The Ossetian and Abkhaz peoples are our fellow citizens, and here again I am drawn to the timeless words of Sir Oliver Wardrop, who in his book The Kingdom of Georgia wrote in 1888: 'At the very outset it is necessary to remove from the mind of the reader an opinion which is almost universally held in Europe and which is, perhaps, the chief cause of that apathy with which politicians look upon the Caucasus."
"It is generally believed, even by some of those who have been in the country, that Transcaucasia is inhabited by a vast number of tribes, more or less wild, having nothing in common but the doubtful benefits of Russian rule."
"Nothing could be more misleading."
"Students of ethnography may amuse themselves by making elaborate investigations into the origin of the Khevsur, the Svan, the Pshav, the Osset (and the Abkhaz), it is sufficient for us to know that all these people are, politically at least, Georgians, and have fought under the Kartvelian kings since the days of William the Conqueror'."
"Georgia is a multi-ethnic state and I believe that diversity, that tapestry, is one of our greatest strengths."
"Not a weakness, but a strength."
"I was proud that just a few days ago I opened a new Ossetian language school outside South Ossetia, the territory we control, because right now we have twice as many ethnic Ossetian language schools outside South Ossetia as there are inside."
"We are still a unitary state, but we are certainly open to all kinds of arrangements under which all minorities are accommodated and there is considerable wide autonomy for all of them, such as the ones in Southern Tirol and in many other places in Europe."
"For these reasons, our task is to extend our hand in peace, justice and reconciliation, to try and solve our problems through negotiation and compromise so that these areas and all the peoples who call them home can share and be blessed by the same prosperity and guarantees of security enjoyed by the rest of Georgia today."
"Some suggest that our separatist problems are simply an internal Georgian affair."
"Unfortunately this is not so."
"Our disputes have continued because they are based on recidivist territorial claims - remnants from the Soviet period when an empire collapsed and elites sought to retain their privilege and fiefdoms."
"Generals fought wars for dachas in Abkhazia because that was the main private property in Soviet times, and they are still clinging to those dachas."
"In this scenario, the tactic so visible today is to provide support to local proxies and create institutional blockages to bilateral discussions and negotiation."
"In this scenario it is the people and future generations born into a climate of fear and hate that lose."
"My message this afternoon is one of reconciliation, of openness and of recognition and protection of minority rights."
"We cannot have 19th or 20th century solutions."
"We appeal to your objectivity, interests, and above all sense of fair play when evaluating these challenges."
"(FR) Ladies and gentlemen, my remarks are founded on the conviction that, today, we must build 21st century European solutions, so that we never again witness the fatal responses of the 20th century, where 'might is right' and small states are inexorably torn apart by larger states."
"I hope that my conviction and responsibility as a democratic leader can be recognised."
"I will never remain silent or inactive in the face of a great threat to democracy and to the territorial integrity of my country."
"No: in such a difficult situation, Georgia must demonstrate calm and show that it can be constructive."
"That is precisely what we are going to do."
"Our aim is to continue with our political, social and economic reforms, as difficult as they may be, and build on our successes and our progress in order to send a positive message."
"In the 1990s, Russia used an economic blockade as a weapon to prevent the integration of the Baltic States into the European Union."
"In the end, however, these blockades served only to speed up the reorientation of the Baltic economies from the East to the West."
"The same will apply to Georgia."
"Today, I take advantage of the opportunity of this forum to propose a way forward calling for the strengthening of cooperation between the European Union and Georgia, in particular, by consolidating our cooperation in terms of the neighbourhood policy, and by exploring ways to deepen this relationship so that Georgia may forever become a model demonstrating what the European example can accomplish."
"We are ready."
"To achieve this, however, we need your judges, your legal experts, your economists and your security experts."
"We want a Georgia that secures its borders, so that Europe itself may be more secure."
"With your involvement, we can overcome the effects of the current embargo, in particular, if we are given the opportunity to trade freely with Turkey and to progress in this direction with the European Union."
"Spare us from having to ask for your help, by allowing us to trade."
"Let us work together to overcome our territorial disputes."
"I have proposed talks with Moscow and with the leaders of the separatist regions, in order to find common ground."
"We have asked European governments to become involved in order to facilitate this process."
"The time has come to build confidence."
"Together with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations and the European Union, we have offered the greatest possible forms of independence to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and I confirm this proposal before you today."
"May we who, in the past, have all been victims of war, work together today to build a better future."
"It is not in the interests of Europe, Russia and Europe's neighbouring countries to allow this issue to continue without creating a new framework for the emerging challenges."
"Therefore, if we want to prevent rampant separatism, we must begin a new approach, a European approach reconciling individual beliefs with self-determination and territorial integrity."
"This is vital for our collective security."
"Together, we can achieve it."
"It has been my privilege to share with you today my observations and thoughts on Georgia's European choice."
"I believe the path forward - one of engagement and mutual benefit - is finding greater resonance in the capitals of Europe and in European institutions, and this trend should be encouraged."
"In closing, I return to the words of Robert Schuman: 'Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan."
"I believe that today we are seeing the emergence of that solidarity."
"It is certainly present in this Chamber, and it is in our hearts and in our actions as we move forward together."
"(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"(in Georgian) Thank you very much for your words, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"As you can see, my Georgian is far worse than your Spanish."
"It is, in any case, a way of showing you how warmly you are received by the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament is a friend of Georgia."
"It demonstrated that in its recent resolution calling for an end to attacks against Georgian citizens."
"Furthermore, it hopes that your presence and your words in the European Parliament will contribute to improving the situation in terms of relations between your country and Russia."
"You can count on us, Mr President."
"Didi madloba."

"- Before the vote on Amendment 13"
"(FR) With the agreement of the rapporteur, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are prepared to delete Amendment 7, on condition that an oral amendment be added at the end of Amendment 13."
"This would specify each party's responsibilities in the field of foreign exchange policy."
"I will now read you the text of the oral amendment in English:"
"'Without prejudice to their respective powers and responsibilities in order to cope with international disequilibria.'"
"(The oral amendment was not accepted)"

"Explanations of vote"
"(DE) Mr President, experts agree that the trend towards flight from the land will intensify still further over coming years, and the high death rate among farmers is a factor in that."
"This disturbing tendency has also been encouraged by our misguided subsidy policy, from which, as a rule, only the big players benefit, not to mention the long years over which rural areas have been neglected."
"It follows that we have to ensure that small farms and those in mountainous areas can survive, with the creation of equivalent living conditions in town and country, and that we must press on with the development of the infrastructure in individual regions and the establishment of links between them."
"It is for that reason that I have voted in favour of the Daul report's adoption."
"in writing. - (EL) The Commission proposal on the development of energy crops and biomass production crops endeavours to mitigate the impasses created by the new CAP in the rural economy, for workers in agricultural product processing industries and for small and medium-sized holdings, from its first year in application and which will intensify on its completion."
"However, the incentives contained in the proposal and the preconditions for paying them benefit large farm holdings in the northern countries of the ΕU which have a comparative advantage due to their soil and climate conditions and size, but do not benefit countries with a dry summer climate and small holdings, because they are of a horizontal nature and deliberately overlook these differences."
"In our country, for example, there are no areas which were entered into the set-aside scheme in order to be cultivated with energy crops, with the result that there is no benefit from this measure, while the surface area subsidy of 4.5 euros per decare is insignificant and is not therefore an incentive of any substance."
"That is why we disagree with the proposed regulation, despite the fact that we consider the Commission proposal for the new Member States as regards energy crops to be positive in principle, because it moves in the direction of equal treatment, even though it does not constitute equal treatment."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed colleague, Mrs Descamps. on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of Canada establishing a framework for cooperation in the fields of higher education, training and youth."
"This report is entirely in line with a very long-standing tradition of cooperation, and it is logical that we should create privileged relations by means of the youth of the European Union and of Canada, who are the sons of Europe."
"The aim of these agreements is to strengthen our cooperation in the fields of higher education and training with Canada, on the one hand, and with the United States, on the other."
"The texts therefore renew, for an eight year period - from 2006 to 2013 - the cooperation programmes previously concluded with the European Union, in 1995 and in 2000."
"The cooperation agreement negotiated with Canada is designed to strengthen and expand the scope of the previous agreement, by providing a new framework for cooperation in the sphere of youth."
"Renewing the previous programme in part, the new agreement concluded with the United States establishes innovative programmes leading to the creation of Transatlantic Degrees."
"It aims to promote exchange schemes for students and teachers, strengthen the Schuman-Fulbright programme and encourage closer institutional collaboration in higher education."
"These two agreements have proven their usefulness in the past."
"Implementing them should improve the openness and competitiveness of our higher education systems for the future, while building bridges between our peoples and promoting mutual understanding."
"I am delighted that our Parliament has voted in favour of the conclusion of these agreements, thereby enabling the relationships linking our two continents to be strengthened."
"(DE) Mr President, the public are becoming more and more mobile; there is no longer anything exceptional about working or studying in another EU Member State, or about living in one in retirement, and so a number of complex issues and problems - which we have not yet resolved - arise with regard to social security."
"Although a certain amount has been going on since the first Community rules and regulations on this subject were enacted over 30 years ago, there is still a need for action in this respect, to which I do not believe the Matsouka report does justice, and it is for that reason that I abstained from voting on it."
"Businesses in the aquaculture sector, following the rapid development of the sector in indigenous species of fish and shellfish, want to get into the cultivation of non-indigenous species."
"The proposal for a regulation makes provision for certain safety procedures because there is a clear danger of disrupting the natural biodiversity in an area once non-indigenous species have been introduced and released."
"Nonetheless, there can be no full safeguard, especially as the data needed have been requested from the interested parties, as was the case with GMOs."
"Historically, of course, for species such as carp, trout and so on, there proved to be no repercussions in the areas in which they were released."
"Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that this historic precedent will be repeated, whatever the efforts and safety valves."
"On the other hand, the facility to import such organisms and the possible economic benefits which will accrue can be counterbalanced by fishing and/or cultivating them in countries where they constitute natural populations - in other words, with no danger to natural ecosystems."
"This would also allow these countries to develop, for the benefit of their peoples too, in direct disproportion to any economic results there would be in the Member States of the EU."
"In other words, the business interests would win, but [not] at the expense of the peoples in the countries of origin of the non-indigenous species."
"in writing. (SV) I am of the opinion that the EU's financial aid to the fishing industry should be abolished as soon as possible and that those Member States responsible for overfishing should themselves compensate the developing countries affected by EU fisheries agreements."
"Such compensation should not be paid for from the EU budget."
"I have, despite everything, decided to vote in favour of the report, as it reduces the chances of national special interests influencing aid."
"The United Nations Convention against Corruption is in fact the first global instrument designed to prevent and combat corruption."
"The purpose is thus to create a global strategy and framework, with a range of minimum, but significant, standards, which must be applied to all parties to the Convention."
"The standards should help in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of corruption and the freezing, seizure, confiscation and return of the proceeds of these offences."
"The Commission negotiated this agreement, which is based on elements of the Convention that fall within the scope of the Community's competences, and concluded those negotiations in September 2005 on the Community's behalf."
"I therefore welcome the conclusion of this agreement. I am very disappointed, however, that three Member States - Sweden, Slovenia and Estonia - have yet to sign up to the Convention."
"I hope the ratification process carried out by the Community, and by the Member States that have yet to do so, is concluded at the earliest opportunity."
"I wish to highlight the vital importance of this Convention entering into force as quickly as possible. Once this happens, more effective action can be taken to prevent and combat this type of crime."
"in writing. (SV) It is unacceptable for the EU now to attempt to bind all its Member States to a third party in an international treaty."
"The whole idea of the United Nations Convention against Corruption is one based on voluntary participation and respect for the national right of self-determination."
"The rapporteur, Mr Catania, has chosen to cite 26 assorted articles in his report as support for the proposal."
"None of these articles accord the EU the power or competence to enter into a legally binding treaty with a third party."
"The EU should instead focus on the widespread corruption within its own institutions."
"Internal corruption within the EU is a growing problem that is in the process of eroding citizens' trust in the whole European idea."
"The June List believes that the EU is exceeding its powers and is therefore voting against the proposal as a whole."
"This report is one that, naturally, I voted in favour of."
"The battle against corruption around the world is an essential objective for the good governance of all members of the international community, and in turn, a key factor in peace and development."
"Quite apart from ethical and economic considerations, there is a salient point that makes the fight against corruption on a world scale a key factor in international relations."
"Countries with corrupt governments are governed by rules, criteria and interests that are incompatible with those of sustainable development, cooperation and peace."
"To tackle them is to tackle one of the causes of conflict and poverty."
"It is not enough, however, for us merely to sign up to conventions of this nature."
"What is needed is for this fight to form part of our criteria for action at international level, not least in the area of cooperation in which the EU plays such a significant role."
"That is why I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (PT) The Commission's proposal, on which this report is based, is aimed at bringing Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 into line with the European Council Agreement of 15/16 December 2005 on the financial perspective 2007-2013, as regards the capping of allocations from the Cohesion Fund, and as regards the exemption of Portugal from the application of the cofinancing requirement for the amount of EUR 320 million."
"Under the terms of this agreement, the amount of EUR 320 million to be awarded to Portugal would not be 'subject to the requirement of national cofinancing' 'in light of the specific difficulties of Portuguese farming'."
"The provision of a 'national envelope' in the context of a global appropriation provided for by the new rural development instrument (EAFRD), and the doubling of the originally proposed amount, increased on account of the exemption in recognition of the difficulties faced by Portuguese farming, were, for Portugal, among the most positive aspects of the new political agreement that was reached under the UK Presidency as part of the lengthy and difficult negotiations on the financial framework for the next period 2007-2013."
"I therefore voted for the Mulder report, which advocates the adoption of the Commission proposal before us."
"in writing. (SV) The June List believes that the common agricultural policy (or 'rural development', as we will be calling it from 2007 onwards) should be abolished."
"This week (the week commencing 23 October 2006), the EU's Court of Auditors observed for the thirteenth time in a row that it could not guarantee that more than a small part of the EUR 105 billion from EU budget had been used correctly or for the purposes intended."
"Aid under the agricultural policy is one of the biggest problem areas to monitor, and there are great problems with monitoring in certain sectors, such as aid for olive oil production."
"This cannot go on."
"The running tap that is EU funding must be turned off."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
"in writing. This report approves the Commission's proposal to make two changes to the rural development financing mechanism in line with the December 2005 European Council's agreement on rural development funding for the period 2007-2013."
"Conservative MEPs condemned the December 2005 agreement and therefore cannot support proposals originating from it."
"The British Government squandered a golden opportunity to achieve a fairer distribution of rural development funds and allowed certain Member States, even at that early stage, to allocate for themselves substantial sums of the already reduced amounts."
"Ultimately, the UK ended up with only 3.5% of the funds available for the EU-15."
"The proposal in question allows Portugal to exempt itself from the obligation to cofinance the amounts it secured for itself at the December Council."
"Conservatives believe that this sets a dangerous precedent."
"In addition to general considerations concerning the need to bring agricultural policy and the funds awarded to farmers increasingly into line with the objectives of rural development, a further reason for my vote in favour of this report was that the exceptional situation faced by Portugal has been acknowledged and that the requirement of national cofinancing has accordingly been removed."
"Clearly as a consequence of the question I put to the Commission, Portuguese farmers, Portuguese farming and the potential for rural development have recently been hindered by the Portuguese government's inability or unwillingness to take action, with large amounts of funding going unused."
"For this reason, this special case is well justified."
"I voted in favour of the Lienemann report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy, because this Marine Strategy Directive will duly implement the proposals of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme on promoting the sustainable use of the seas and marine ecosystems."
"A significant proportion of European citizens live in coastal regions and depend on the sea for their livelihood, whereas for others it is a place of leisure."
"Developing national marine strategies - aimed at achieving good environmental status, and at protecting and preserving the most vulnerable marine ecosystems and biological diversity - will make it possible to maintain activities in the marine environment at levels that are sustainable and that compromise neither the uses and activities of future generations nor the capacity of marine ecosystems to respond to natural and human-induced changes."
"in writing. (PT) We welcome the initiative to establish an action framework in the area of marine environment policy, with the appropriate financial resources."
"Given its strategic importance, the Member States must set out assessment strategies and environmental objectives for their marine environment, in collaboration with the other Member States or with third countries, this after all being an issue in which one country's actions may have a knock-on effect in other countries."
"There is a key question throughout this process, and that is who owns and manages the sea areas to which this directive applies."
"Both the proposed directive and the amendments adopted today in the Lienemann report begin with the definition of 'European marine waters', which fails to clarify what our exclusive economic zone is and what the role of each Member State is in this context."
"As regards the creation of supranational bodies, there is no indication as to whether this is a decision that can only be taken unanimously on the basis of the principle of sovereign States with equal rights or whether, contrariwise, this can be imposed by a majority as proposed in the so-called European Constitution."
"Given the lack of clarity on these issues, we abstained from the final vote."
"The purpose of the 'Marine Environment Directive' is to establish a high level of protection for Europe's seas and oceans, to extend our knowledge of this heritage, on which there remains a great deal to discover, and to define a management strategy based on an integrated approach, with qualitative and quantitative objectives aimed at reducing the pressure on marine resources and their ecosystems."
"I wish to highlight the reference to the need for EU cofinancing of measures to be carried out in order to enforce the directive, and their inclusion in the budgets from 2007 onwards."
"This measure is very important for Portugal given that it is a country with an enormous exclusive economic zone, the largest in the EU, which therefore involves high costs."
"Approving the change to the deadline for achieving the objectives set out - from 2021 to 2017 - as proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is indicative of Parliament's ambitious attitude to this issue and the extent of its commitment to seeking 'good environmental status' for the marine environment."
"The remaining measures provided for, which are aimed at ensuring the sustainability of economic activities involving the seas and oceans, protecting biodiversity and preventing pollution, also proposed by the PPE-DE, are also highly important, improving substantially upon the Commission's proposal ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption at first reading of Mrs Lienemann's report on the 'Marine Strategy Directive', an essential document that is in line with the Framework Water Directive (FWD)."
"However, I would like to say that I am not convinced of the feasibility of the timescale that has just been adopted."
"Indeed, we do not yet have sufficient knowledge of the marine environment in order to reach a true assessment of the environmental situation of European seas within the shortened period."
"As we are witnessing with the implementation of the FWD, the preparation and analysis phase is always difficult and longer than anticipated."
"Moreover, the marine environment is by no means characterised by rapid change."
"I therefore feel that the timetable proposed by the Commission is already sufficiently ambitious."
"in writing. - (PT) We welcome the initiative of a marine environment policy as part of the cooperation and coordination that is needed between different countries, whilst ensuring that full sovereignty over territory and resources is safeguarded for each country, and that economic, social and environmental aspects are taken into account."
"The preservation of fisheries resources has been put in jeopardy particularly by marine pollution and by the large volume of shipping, both of which affect fishing."
"Fishing itself is just one of many factors, and certainly not the most significant one."
"Fish stocks, and the regeneration thereof, are an indispensable component in ensuring the future of fisheries; without fish there is no fishing."
"Fishermen are therefore the most important stakeholders in protecting and regenerating the marine environment."
"Against this backdrop, stock recovery measures must, with appropriate funding, involve much-needed economic and social compensation for the sector and its workers."
"The key issue is respect for the Member States' sovereignty, in particular over their exclusive economic zones and their ability to implement independent measures to defend their fisheries resources."
"Lastly, although the marine strategy and the CFP need to be closely linked, the latter must not impose its structures on fishing structures."
"in writing. The marine environment requires protection and conservation."
"The conclusion of Good Environmental Status should be welcomed."
"However, in supporting Amendment 91 we clarify that oil and gas exploitation in the marine environment can continue, subject to international rules."
"The contribution of the oil and gas industry to the Scottish economy is important to recognise."
"Mr President, mercury is a highly toxic and dangerous substance."
"Eliminating it from all uses, especially household uses, where there are adequate substitutes is an eminently sensible proposal, supported by all 25 governments in the Council."
"Yet the PPE-DE Group, egged on by the British Conservatives, has voted to allow extra exemptions for precisely those products which are likely to find their way into household use, which is the most dangerous place for them."
"That does not square with what David Cameron is saying back home in Britain, or even with what the Conservative Party website says about its commitment to phase out dangerous chemical substances."
"I hope at least that the British Conservatives, after weeks of campaigning against so-called 'diktats' from Brussels, will now refrain from using such language."
"They will have seen today that the outcome of European legislation is being determined by a democratic vote in this Parliament, rather than by European Commission 'diktats'."
"Even if they express no regret over what they have done today, I hope they will at least desist from using that sort of vocabulary when campaigning on such issues."
"in writing. - (PT) This proposal follows on from the 'Community Strategy concerning mercury' adopted in January 2005 and is aimed at reducing the use of products containing mercury by banning the marketing of devices containing mercury."
"Once this report is adopted, the marketing of all measuring devices will be banned and the Commission's original proposal will be amended so that the new regulation can enter into force as quickly as possible."
"Excluded from this regulation are products that are already on the market, devices regarded as antiques and collectors' items, and barometers, the manufacture of which should be duly licensed, and which may be phased out."
"The use of traditional barometers in Europe is very low, as is the total amount of mercury that they account for."
"Their exclusion and that of measuring instruments over 50 years old from this proposal is an important measure, because it protects existing small manufacturers, and because the mercury is usually recycled and reused."
"Had they been included - thereby hammering the final nail in the coffin of the traditional barometer manufacturing industry - there could have been contamination and unforeseen flows of mercury..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I voted in favour of the Sornosa Martínez report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury. In view of the highly toxic nature of this substance for human beings, ecosystems and nature, restrictions are needed on the marketing of these products."
"Devices containing mercury must be replaced wherever there are safer alternatives on the market. Exceptions may, however, be authorised in cases where there are no alternative solutions yet available and in rare cases of keeping traditional barometers, museum collections and industrial heritage."
"in writing. I voted for this report to limit the use of mercury - a highly dangerous substance."
"I was astounded to see the British Tory MEPs vote against a ban."
"This runs counter to their leader David Cameron's explicit commitment to banning dangerous chemicals."
"It is sad to see that the Tories hold the health and safety of future generations so lightly."
"Once again they say one thing at home and another thing abroad."
"in writing. A Lancet report published in the UK last week highlighted the dangers of toxic chemicals for the health of the unborn and young children."
"Mercury is extremely toxic, bioaccumulative and persistent in the environment."
"There are no safe exposure levels and yet mercury is getting into our waste stream from discarded household products containing mercury."
"That is why Labour MEPs agree with the 25 EU governments and the Commission that mercury should be phased out in all but essential uses."
"We are opposed to a permanent exemption for mercury barometers because substitutes are available, but we proposed and will support a longer, two-year phase-out period for mercury barometers to allow industry to adapt to the new law."
"in writing. - (FR) In January 2005, the European Parliament approved my report on the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 by a very large majority."
"Its recommendations included the progressive banning of a number of chemical substances which, like the mercury used in dental amalgams and in non-electronic measuring and checking devices, are extremely worrying in terms of human health."
"They need to be replaced by safer alternatives."
"Indeed, the 33 tonnes of mercury used each year in the European Union are, like other heavy metals, the cause of neurological illnesses affecting children, in particular."
"In our societies, where chemicals are ubiquitous, public health absolutely must from now on be the first consideration."
"That is why I regret that - notwithstanding the opinion of our rapporteur, Mrs Sornosa - 327 of my fellow Members have seen fit to limit the bans whereby items such as thermometers and barometers that contain mercury and are intended for the general public could no longer be placed on the market."
"Tomorrow, however, it will be necessary to go further and to call for the 25 Member States to take ambitious measures to ensure that mercury in all its forms disappears from public places as vulnerable as maternity hospitals, day nurseries, hospitals and schools."
"Mr President, this vote shows that reform of the common agricultural policy still faces stiff resistance from vested interests every step of the way."
"Despite such resistance, step by step reform has already led to a relative decline in CAP spending and a switch from spending on price support to support for more environmental improvements, income support and rural development."
"Export subsidies will also be phased out."
"But further steps down this path remain necessary."
"They will be achieved, despite the resistance displayed by the votes today."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party today refused to support the Goepel report on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments."
"The report rejects the proposal tabled by the Commission, on the basis of an agreement with the Council, to increase the flexibility of the common agricultural policy (CAP) basing it more closely on actual national conditions."
"This is a ridiculous position for Parliament to take, and one that we cannot support under any circumstances."
"The CAP currently discriminates against all of the new Member States including the Czech Republic."
"The rapporteur's reference to the principle of prohibiting discrimination thus makes a mockery of all farmers in the new Member States."
"Discrimination against these farmers is actually taking place."
"This year they received 35% of appropriations in direct payments, as opposed to the 100% received by farmers from the old Member States, and this explains why we voted as we did."
"(DE) Mr President, my apologies for not having been paying enough attention earlier on."
"What I wanted to say was that I very much approve of Mr Goepel's - our rapporteur's - approach and the line he has taken, and that I do not quite understand why the Commission is being so stubborn in holding to its own."
"I hope that we will, over the next two months, which the new timetabling arrangements have now made available to us, be able to find ways and means of preventing any renationalisation of agricultural policy at a time when money is needed right across the Community, and I will endeavour to work towards that end."
"I believe there should be room to negotiate, and I hope that the Commission will have a more sensible attitude to that."
"It goes without saying that the Dutch Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of more modulation, of transferring funds from the first to the second pillar of the agricultural budget."
"Modulation is, from a social democratic point of view, a considerable improvement on the unfairness of the present income subsidies."
"Indeed, the biggest farmers receive disproportionately a great deal more than the others."
"Moreover, income subsidies are inefficient, because they insufficiently increase farmers' spending power."
"Rural development offers more opportunities for all people living in the countryside."
"Young and old need good facilities, a strong infrastructure and a diverse economy."
"Rural development is also in the interest of the large majority of farmers."
"Although voluntary modulation is less desirable than compulsory modulation on account of the possible distortion of competitive relations between European farmers, the Dutch Labour Party can go along with it nevertheless, because it represents a step in the right direction."
"The Council has taken a decision, though, without walking the most basic democratic path first."
"The European Parliament has not been heard about this major intervention in the budget."
"The unfortunate fact is that, due to this democratic deficit, it is impossible for us to support the motion for a resolution, and we have therefore abstained."
"in writing. - (PT) We voted against the rapporteur's position and therefore in favour of the Commission's legislative proposal because 'modulation' - that is to say, the possibility of transferring up to 20% of appropriations granted to farmers receiving more than EUR 5 000 per year from the first to the second pillar of the CAP - is an essential instrument for introducing a measure of justice into the distribution of agricultural aid."
"We wish to point out that in Portugal only 5% of farmers receive more than EUR 5 000 per year."
"We fail to understand how the current situation can be preferable to the alternative proposal of 'voluntary modulation'."
"We, the undersigned to this explanation of vote, advocate that the ideal solution would be 'compulsory modulation', which we believe to be inevitable in the short to medium term."
"Given the alternative put forward, we find its rejection by Parliament incomprehensible."
"In Portugal's case, the proposed mode of application would make it possible to increase rural development aid by some EUR 50 million per year, which would benefit many farmers who are currently excluded from any support."
"The central thrust of this report is that the Commission's proposal is not a proposal for genuine modulation. Such a proposal would increase aid to those who receive the least, or receive nothing, at the expense of those who receive a large amount, the purpose of which is to ensure greater fairness in the distribution of aid among producers, countries and holdings and to support small and medium farmers and family farming."
"We feel that the Commission should table a fresh proposal in order to create genuine modulation, which would guarantee greater fairness and release financial resources by introducing a maximum limit to aid per holding (capping) and a percentage increase in aid for farmers who receive the least from the CAP (modulation), for example, by proposing a 15% to 20% increase for farmers who receive less than EUR 5 000 in aid and, in addition to this figure, taking various circumstances into account."
"Without this, there is a risk that existing inequalities will be exacerbated."
"We therefore urge the Commission to recast the proposal in order to ensure that a decision on this issue does not ultimately lead to the renationalisation of the CAP."
"Hence our vote against the report, in the hope of paving the way for a new proposal."
"in writing. - (FR) At a time when the EU is facing an upsurge in nationalist sentiment, the Commission's proposal to introduce a voluntary modulation of direct payments within the framework of the common agricultural policy signals a new stage in the disintegration of Community solidarity."
"Faced with this danger, Parliament had to respond and make its voice heard in order to reaffirm the commitment felt by the representatives of the European nations to defending the 'common' character of the EU's public policies, of which the common agricultural policy is the most potent symbol and the most successful achievement."
"With this in mind, I voted in favour of the Goepel report, which was presented today in plenary, and, in particular, in favour of the explicit request outrightly to reject the European Commission's proposal."
"This position, which expresses the opinion of the majority of Members present today, reflects Parliament's clear and unambiguous desire not to betray its vision of the future Europe and not to make of the CAP an adjustment variable intended to compensate for the reprehensible weaknesses of a European budget crippled by the EU Member States' lack of ambition."
"It signals the demand to retain a system of support for producers."
"Based on the principle of equity, this alone is capable of guaranteeing the future survival of viable and competitive European agriculture characterised by solidarity."
"in writing. (SV) We are voting against this report, but we are abstaining from voting on the Commission's proposal in this area."
"The explanatory statement in this report contains a number of views such as criticism of the common agricultural policy being abandoned or renationalised - something which the June List would find desirable - and of it contravening the European Parliament's right of participation, a view that the June List does not share."
"In addition, the explanatory statement maintains that the 'health check', or the 'mid-term review' as we prefer to call it, of the long-term budget planned for 2008/2009 should only form the basis of proposals for the financing period after 2013."
"The June List absolutely does not share this view."
"We believe that the mid-term review must lead to cuts in the agriculture/rural development budget as early as in the budget period currently at issue, 2007-2013."
"Following the Council's offer to the Member States of the option of voluntarily modulating 20 per cent of the agricultural direct payments from the first to the second pillar, this was incorporated into the Commission's proposal and will, without doubt, have cuts in agricultural subsidies as a consequence."
"The Council, Parliament and the Commission had, in the Financial Perspective, agreed to review the EU's expenditure on - among other things - the common agricultural policy, but not before 2013."
"Our farmers need the security to plan ahead if they are to remain competitive, and so it is now that we must ensure that the money set aside for the agricultural budget until 2013 remains unchanged, and that those funds will indeed be spent on agricultural activity."
"It is unacceptable that farming families should, through compensation payments, get better financial support in one Member State than in another."
"The object of European agricultural policy is to secure European farmers comparable economic conditions in a single market."
"Since the Commission's proposal was not preceded by an impact assessment that might have brought to light any unequal treatment, it is impossible for Parliament to endorse it."
"I voted 'no' in the hope of making the farmers' demands felt."
"The Commission is preparing a new attack on small and medium-sized farm holdings in its proposal to reduce direct payments by 20%."
"Transferring 20% of resources from the first pillar, in other words direct payments, to the second pillar, which is basically reaped by businesses and large holdings, means a reduction in income support for small and medium-sized holdings."
"The result will be to speed up the eradication of small holdings and the concentration of agricultural production in fewer hands."
"In numerous cases, agricultural production and employment will even shrink, without being compensated for by the development of second pillar activities."
"As regards the proposal for this transfer to apply voluntarily, on the one hand this will create twin-track farming and, on the other hand, the prospect in the immediate future will be of the voluntary transfer becoming compulsory."
"This sort of modus operandi has been used in the past."
"Farmers in Greece are experiencing the adverse impact of the new CAP."
"Tobacco production has fallen by 70% and sugar beet crops by 40%."
"The completion of the CAP will have the same adverse impact on other basic crops in my country."
"Today's proposal will be yet another blow to the cumulative and major problems of farmers, which is why we reject it."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the Commission proposal whereby it would be possible for the Member States to apply voluntary modulation within agricultural policy, and we have thus voted against Parliament's report, which rejects the Commission proposal."
"It must be emphasised that the Danish Social Democrats would prefer to see comprehensive, compulsory modulation. Since, however, it has not been possible to reach agreement to that effect, we see voluntary modulation as a serviceable alternative."
"It must be emphasised, however, that compulsory modulation - involving the long-term abolition of direct subsidies - continues to be the objective."
"in writing. The CAP requires continued reform."
"It is disappointing that the Commission's proposal to introduce voluntary modulation of the CAP has been rejected."
"The introduction of voluntary modulation of the CAP would have provided for a sustainable approach to rural development."
"I hope that all those Members who have a direct interest in farming declared their interest and did not vote on this measure."
"in writing. The Conservative delegation voted for the rejection of the modulation proposal presented by Lutz Goepel to give the Commission a chance to come forward with something better."
"We strongly object to the deal that Prime Minister Blair cobbled together last Christmas at the European Council which reduced the single farm payments made to English farmers in order to fund rural development schemes."
"My farmers in the Witham and Maldon area - around Coggeshall, Terling, the Teys and the Tolleshunts - as in other parts of England, want a fair deal from the common agricultural policy."
"Voluntary modulation of 20%, top-slicing the single farm payment, will mean that our farmers are likely to be 20% worse off than even their Welsh, Scottish and Ulster counterparts, let alone the French."
"My farmers have no confidence in the British government, through either DEFRA or the Rural Payments Agency, being able to make payments on time, accurately or indeed to be able to make the payment at all to many individual farmers."
"Furthermore, there is now a danger that the UK will be fined by the European Commission for its ineptitude, and farmers will pick up the tab."
"Our rural community needs a fair deal and they are being completely short-changed by an incompetent Government."
"in writing. (PT) The purpose of this Commission proposal, as confirmed in this report adopted today, is to set up a public-private partnership (PPP) to create a European air traffic management system."
"Such a PPP would set a dangerous precedent, given that it would be the first European PPP with the European Community's participation."
"We do not wish to call into question the need for air traffic management systems to be constantly updated and enhanced, in order to make them more reliable, more accurate and, most importantly, safer, given their importance for the safety of all those who work in and use air space."
"We feel, however, that this objective is not best served by subjecting it to the interests and pressures of the private sector."
"Quite the opposite, in fact."
"We are very disappointed at the rejection of the draft amendment to which we put our name in the Committee on Transport and Tourism (the committee responsible for delivering an opinion), which was aimed at safeguarding the interests of bodies representing employees in the air traffic management sector in decisions taken in the Board of Directors of the joint undertaking."
"Consequently, we could not support this report."
"The joint project for a new generation European air traffic management system gets my vote."
"It is particularly in my capacity as rapporteur on the extended powers of the European Air Safety Agency (EASA) that I wholeheartedly endorse the Community's declared objective of guaranteeing a high-performing air safety infrastructure that will make possible the safe, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly development of air travel while making use of the technical advances of such programmes as GALILEO."
"According to current predictions, the volume of air traffic in Europe is set to double by 2025, and this makes it necessary that communications between pilots and air traffic controllers, which are still transmitted via radio, should be brought up to the latest state of the art."
"I also advocate a public-private partnership, in which the European Community would participate, in order that SESAR's long-term success be secured."
"I have abstained from the vote on the report by my esteemed colleague, Mr Garcia-Margallo y Marfil on the euro zone in 2006 since, though it puts forward some very interesting analyses, I regret the fact that it does not raise the issue straightaway of the development of the euro from a technical currency to a political tool benefiting growth and employment."
"The monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) seems to be at odds with reality: the exchange rate should normally be strong when there is strong economic growth and should depreciate when there is weak growth."
"The fact is that, in Europe, the opposite has been true since the start of the 1990s."
"While the Member States are undergoing reforms, the quest for zero inflation through an inappropriate monetary policy is leading Europe to record mediocre results in terms of economic growth."
"If this state of affairs continues, at a time when the price of raw materials and of energy is rocketing worldwide, we will have zero inflation and zero growth, and manufacturers will end up setting up their businesses in the dollar zone."
"With everything that is happening, it is as though the ECB is disregarding economic policy, while its US counterpart is thinking of nothing else."
"As we know, the creation of the euro was a political decision that took no account of the specific needs of the members of the euro zone. This view is borne out by the differences, in relation to 2005, among those Members as regards economic growth, unemployment rates and inflation."
"We have always stated that, with a single monetary policy, given the budgetary restrictions arising from the Stability and Growth Pact, the workers would have to carry the can for the problems associated with adopting the euro, in order to serve the interests of economic and financial groups."
"The report before us makes this very clear: 'Labour markets should be made more flexible and those aspects of the legislation on permanent employment that may act as a barrier to labour market adjustment should be removed.'"
"It also calls for 'wages to respond more rapidly to changing economic circumstances', or in other words for wages to be reduced depending on the cycle."
"These intentions could not be clearer."
"Not satisfied with this, the rapporteur also promotes the liberalisation of services and energy, the strict application of the Stability and Growth Pact and compliance with the Lisbon agenda: the very blueprint for the European neoliberal consensus."
"Hence our vote against the report."
"in writing. (SV) Even though Sweden decided, through a referendum, not to participate in economic and monetary union (EMU), we have chosen to vote against the report and would like to take the opportunity to explain why we have done so."
"The report provides a clear picture of how EMU goes hand in hand with the creation of an EU state."
"According to the report, macroeconomic policy between the countries of the euro area is to be coordinated, and the euro area is to speak with one voice in international financial institutions and fora."
"The report advocates better fiscal, especially budgetary, coordination and the coordination of national fiscal calendars."
"Moreover, the objective of introducing a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base in Europe could be achieved through the mechanism of enhanced cooperation if Member States were unable to reach unanimous agreement."
"We can only conclude that the representatives of the 'no' campaign in Sweden's EMU referendum in 2003 were entirely correct in their argument when they pointed out that EMU was a major step on the road to a United States of Europe."
"in writing. The Conservative Party policy in relation to the euro is clear and unequivocal: we are firmly committed to keeping the pound."
"We have no desire to be part of the single currency, but neither do we have any wish for the project to fail, as we believe that there is a UK national interest in there being a strong European economy with a stable currency that provides a good trading environment for British business and industry."
"In line with our long-standing position on matters relating to the euro and euro area, I and my British Conservative colleagues have abstained on this report."
"in writing. As an oceanographer, I am delighted to support this report on the Strategy on the Marine Environment."
"The EU has for too long collapsed rural policy into agricultural policy."
"Finally this has begun to change in a positive way to recognise that farming is only a minority, if important part, of the rural economy."
"We face an identical problem with respect to maritime policy."
"It has been seen as fisheries policy writ large, but now, with the Commission Paper on maritime policy currently out for consultation - I recently participated in a conference on the subject in Weymouth organised by the South West Regional Development Agency - this report and the Lienemann report voted earlier today, it looks as if we are going to finally move away from a one-dimensional maritime policy to a policy that embraces our seas, oceans and coasts as vital for food and the environment, transport and tourism."
"in writing. (SV) In this commentary on the strategy on the marine environment, the rapporteur brings up many interesting and important issues."
"One example is when he states that the Common Fisheries Policy must meet the requirements for sustainable development, whilst those Member States that wish to adopt more urgent measures in order to protect a particular stock should have the opportunity to do so."
"Amongst the negative aspects of the report are the comments on funding; the rapporteur is concerned about the lack of resources with which to implement the strategies, the implication being that resources from the Community budget should be contributed for this purpose and that it would be a good idea to use resources from, for example, the Structural Funds."
"We have made the judgment that the positive elements in the report outweigh the negative ones and we have therefore voted in favour of the report in today's vote."
"in writing. (PT) This own-initiative report is aimed at creating a single European market for mortgage credit and the promotion thereof at cross-border level."
"The banks and the capital markets have a major interest in this issue given that in 2004 the volume of outstanding loans was EUR 4.7 billion, equivalent to 45% of the EU's GNI. This is very much a growth market."
"The report follows the neoliberal line. It provides for more competition in the sector, European or cross-border mortgages, a secondary market for mortgage credit and the possibility for it to be negotiated on the capital markets, cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the financial services sector, the opening-up of this market to institutions other than credit institutions, guaranteed freedom to provide services and the liberalisation of these services, restrictions on the State's ability to regulate, online marketing of mortgage credit and access for foreign organisations to customer credit databases, including non-compliance."
"It is not difficult to see the risks involved with all of these proposals, in terms of market volatility. This would jeopardise mortgage assets, that is to say, the savings of many workers and other home buyers."
"We therefore voted against the report."
"It goes without saying that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are in favour of opening up markets, including the market in mortgages."
"I am therefore well disposed towards the Purvis report, which suggests investigation into different measures that might benefit the consumer through, for example, competition among mortgage lenders, but I have no choice but to vote against it on the grounds that the report is not very clear about the different systems of tax benefits when mortgages are concluded, and particularly harmonised."
"This is an exploratory first proposal in which, above all, the call for further analysis is prominent."
"The legislative phase is a long way off."
"Since the mortgage market falls within the scope of the free movement of services, I support the creation of an internal market for mortgage lending."
"I refuse, though, to lend my support to the harmonisation of the system of tax deduction of mortgage interest via a backdoor in Brussels."
"Time after time, politicians stress that Europe must look after the core themes and cross-border issues, but this statement by the European Parliament is at odds with that."
"Most of its Members do not appear bothered about the fact that tax policy is not one of the EU's competences."
"That is why the Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy delegation in the European Parliament deemed it necessary to vote against paragraph 45 of the Purvis report and, indeed, against the report as a whole."
"I find it regrettable that, since none of the big groups dared apply for a roll-call vote on this matter, the European citizen can only guess how individual MEPs have voted."
"in writing. I welcome the Green Paper on Mortgage Credit, which explores how competition in the EU mortgage market could increase consumer choice and reduce costs."
"Consumer confidence in banks is of paramount importance."
"Therefore the willingness of a borrower to deal with a foreign lender will be determined not only by the competitiveness of the mortgage, but also by the level of consumer protection that will apply to the foreign lender."
"Ireland enjoys a relatively sophisticated mortgage credit market in EU terms, including access to the full range of competitively priced mortgage products."
"Expansion of this market across borders may develop naturally through subsidiaries or branches abroad on a more widespread basis, if the market is encouraged in other areas."
"Therefore I believe that legislative intervention should only be used as a last resort and to address proven market failure."
"I fully encourage the Commission in creating electronic land registers which can be accessed online."
"The fact of the matter is that lenders cannot enter other markets without absolute certainty regarding the security of their collateral."
"Given the experience that many citizens have had purchasing overseas property, an online register reflecting all relevant charges affecting property ownership rights is vital."
"in writing. - (FR) There are 25 national legislations governing mortgage credit, and soon there will be 27 standing in the way of a common European approach."
"This Green Paper issued by the European Commission will finally make it possible to carry out proper studies of this issue and to go for the sensible options."
"Any Community measure concerning the European mortgage credit market must, above all, be of direct benefit to the public."
"However, consumers often come up against too many obstacles, be they legal or economic."
"In voting in favour of the report by Mr Purvis, I opted for making the mortgage credit market accessible to a larger number of potential borrowers."
"In the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I had, in this connection, personally pushed for its rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, to take account of borrowers with insecure and insubstantial credit profiles, workers on fixed-term contracts and first-time buyers."

"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Commission Question Time"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0445/2006)."
"We will take the questions to the Commission."
"Part I"
"Subject: European universities"
"A survey carried out in 2006 by the Times Higher Education Supplement, ranking universities on five continents, lists 40 European universities, mainly in the UK, among the top 100 universities in the world."
"Most of the other 60 universities are in the USA, Australia and China."
"The survey also reports that the annual budget of Harvard University which retains top position in 2006 - amounts to 26 billion dollars."
"Will the Commission take further measures to support the competitiveness of European universities and what will those measures comprise?"
"Does the Commission intend to increase further its co-funding of institutions of higher education and does it plan to draw up an official ranking list of European universities?"
"Member of the Commission."
"Under the principle of subsidiarity every Member State of the European Union retains full responsibility for the content and organisation of educational systems."
"I have just come from the Education Council which completed its work today under the Finnish Presidency."
"The Commission played and will continue to play a role in building a policy for the modernisation of higher education as part of the implementation of the important Lisbon Strategy, through policy dialogue and mutual learning, in particular through the open method of coordination in education and training as well as in the field of research."
"As set out in the Commission communication on delivering a modernisation agenda for universities, measures in higher education are needed, ranging from curriculum reform to governance and funding reforms."
"The main responsibility, of course, lies with the Member States' national authorities and universities."
"There is also financial support for the modernisation agenda from the Community programmes in education and research."
"There is potential for substantial support from the structural funds under both the competitiveness and the convergence objectives."
"With regard to university-based research, it should be noted that the forthcoming Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development substantially widens the opportunities for enhanced university research activities."
"As you know, total eligibility for projects is going up from 50% to 75% and programmes in lifelong learning and research for the next seven years will both see a very substantial increase in their budgets for the 2007-2013 period."
"I think a very important message is sent out by the European Institute of Technology."
"That is not something outside the framework of this question."
"It is a very important initiative to boost the transfer of knowledge by those who intensify investment in creativity, innovation and the improvement of our competitiveness."
"The EIT can improve European competitiveness in all three parts of the knowledge triangle: education, research and innovation."
"With regard to ranking, which is an important part of the question put by Mr Mavrommatis, there are indeed several international rankings worldwide."
"Each has its own strengths, but also its own weaknesses."
"Although they are useful in terms of giving an impression of the competitive position of universities, the diversity of universities' missions means that no single set of criteria can be considered as an objective measure."
"Different ranking systems give different weights to various criteria and consequently arrive at different results."
"However, provided the criteria are explicit, they can be a useful tool for both policy-makers and managers."
"At this stage, to answer the question directly, the Commission is not planning to draw up an official ranking list."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, do you believe that many of the higher education institutes in top positions in the general classification of another two new surveys since carried out owe chiefly their progress and progress in their courses and of their students to the fact that they have private education standards and, if so, does the Commission perhaps intend to subsidise Member States which will try such an endeavour, irrespective of the private grants that many of the universities in the world receive?"
"Member of the Commission."
"I think that Mr Mavrommatis is right in pointing the finger at the teaching, because when teaching is separated from other activities, namely research or even the transfer of knowledge, via innovation, into real practice and the real economy, then all those aspects become rather weak or average, and we fall in the rankings, moving into a second division."
"The best answer is therefore to invest more and better."
"The question is slanted towards more investment in teaching and research, whereas better means efficiency and the way we organise ourselves, how we transfer knowledge and how we build partnerships between public and private interests and between academia and society. All these can be improved in our various policies, and in the EIT, which I mentioned as one of the examples of how these issues could be integrated."
"Secondly, there is also a need for more investment."
"I would not call this a subsidy from the European Union, but rather support for European cooperation, because we put together monies and distribute them in line with agreed rules, and these rules should lead us to excellence, the transfer of knowledge, and the rewarding or promotion of quality, not just quantity, in our academic institutions."
"That is our shared responsibility and common task."
"(DE) Madam President, I can follow on seamlessly from where the Commissioner has just left off."
"Research is important, but education and teaching of students are undoubtedly another of the lofty objectives of universities."
"When I worked as a professor, I was saddened to find that some universities, particularly those that always appear right at the top of the major rankings - for example British elite universities such as Oxford and Cambridge - were extremely reserved when it came to the Erasmus programme, in contrast to many other universities."
"Could participation in the Erasmus programme be made one of the criteria?"
"Madam President, Mr Davies, the Commission attaches great importance to the voluntary commitment on the part of the automobile industry to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars."
"These commitments have made it possible to achieve considerable reductions in consumption by new passenger cars. In 2004, average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars were 12.4% lower than in 1995, falling from 186 grams of emissions per kilometre to 163 grams."
"It is in the industry's own interests to keep to the commitments it has entered into."
"Failure to attain the target value of 140 grams per kilometre would threaten the credibility of voluntary commitments as an alternative to legally binding regulations."
"So far, all three industry associations have attained the interim targets that were set as part of their voluntary commitment."
"Although they consider the final target very ambitious, they have all reaffirmed their determination to achieve it."
"I shall not hide the fact, however, that I am very concerned in this regard."
"Since the appearance of the report on the progress achieved by the end of 2004, I have been concerned about the fact that the average annual reduction over the coming years will have to be very much greater than before if the final target is to be achieved."
"We do not yet have any final data for 2005, but I expect no greater reduction for that year than for 2004."
"If it becomes apparent that the industry is not going to meet its commitments, the Commission - as I have already announced - must step in and propose legal acts to ensure that CO2 emissions are reduced to the level considered necessary."
"The Commission is currently reviewing the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars."
"The CARS 21 High Level Group recommends the future strategy consist of an integrated approach involving all relevant stakeholders and thus a wide palette of measures."
"I consider this approach essential for achieving a further reduction in CO2 emissions from passenger cars at reasonable cost."
"A Commission decision on the future strategy is to be adopted at the end of the year."
"This strategy will certainly require further progress in automotive engineering."
"We are also considering laying down mandatory targets for motor-vehicle fuel efficiency, for example, but other aspects, too, have to be taken into account, such as policy measures to promote the use of low-carbon fuels, and changing driving habits."
"Incidentally, we should also pay greater attention to the other two main components of the strategy: labelling of and tax concessions for low CO2 emission vehicles."
"It must be said, unfortunately, that these two parts of the strategy have had extremely little effect so far, but I do believe that there is potential for improvement in this regard."
"I am glad the Commissioner is worried, as indeed he should be, because the car industry has comprehensively broken its agreements with the European Union to meet these reductions."
"This was largely for profit reasons, because there is money to be made in four-wheel drive SUVs or 'Chelsea tractors' as they are known in the UK."
"Three weeks ago, from the very same seat, Commissioner Dimas said legislation would, of course, be necessary."
"Can the Commissioner indicate what the earliest date will be at which legislation can be introduced, once the Commission has carried out its review to be published in December?"
"I should like to start by responding to Mr Davies' assessment of the European motor-vehicle market."
"One of the reasons for the failure to meet the targets - but only one of them - is indeed the fact that European market habits have changed, with one market segment undergoing particularly rapid growth, one that is not exactly helpful with regard to CO2. This is the segment of SUVs: the large, supposedly off-road vehicles with very heavy fuel consumption."
"Astonishingly, these heavy, particularly high-emission vehicles have enjoyed favourable treatment in regulations up to now."
"The Commission's proposal for the 'Euro 5' standard plans to put an end to the preferential treatment of these particularly large, particularly polluting vehicles."
"That is a very important point."
"This issue is currently being discussed in Parliament."
"As far as the timing is concerned, for reasons of fairness and trustworthiness, the industry has to be given the time we have granted it: that is, until 2008."
"If, however, it becomes apparent - as it is doing - that the targets are not being met, the Commission will have to start preparing legislation next year, so that it can be presented in 2008."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, particulate-matter emissions from diesel vehicles are a topical issue."
"Parliament, together with the Council, lays down high values for pollution."
"What is planned with regard to emissions?"
"Is there any relevant legislation that relates to diesel vehicles and is aimed at the motor-vehicle industry?"
"Of course, Mr Rack."
"The proposal the Commission presented at the end of last year to introduce a 'Euro 5' standard for vehicles reduces particulate matter from both light commercial vehicles and passenger cars."
"Our proposal reduces the limit value for soot-particle emissions from diesel passenger cars to 5 milligrams per kilometre as of 2009."
"We cannot set this value any lower as it would then be impossible to measure."
"In 2009, therefore, the limit value of 5 milligrams will enter into force, which means that, as of then, diesel vehicles without a particle filter will be a thing of the past."
"The situation with nitrogen oxides is more difficult as, for a large majority of vehicles, the relevant technology is not yet available - at least at present."
"The Commission's proposal provides for a reduction to 200 milligrams per kilometre and is currently being debated in Parliament."
"A second measure also being discussed at the present time is my proposal to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesel vehicles from 200 to 80 milligrams. This would enter into force in 2014 or 2015."
"(DE) Commissioner, these CO2 emissions have a global impact, and of course global CO2 emissions also have an impact on Europe."
"For this reason, I should like to ask whether the Commission knows of any figures from other industrial centres as to the situation there regarding the reduction of emissions and, secondly, whether the Commission is attempting to influence this."
"Vice-President of the Commission. (DE) I am much obliged to the honourable Member for asking this question, as it gives me the opportunity to dispel a relatively widespread misconception."
"Of course we have access to such figures, and it is pleasing - in my view - that levels of emissions from new European passenger cars are far, far below the average for passenger cars in other parts of the world. They are significantly below those in the oil-producing countries - the USA and Japan included."
"It is interesting to note here that such countries with poorer emissions levels than ours have legally binding regulations in place for all fields."
"Part II"
"Member of the Commission."
"I would like to inform honourable Members that on 8 September 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal to adapt the minimum rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages to take account of inflation since 1993, when the current rates were established."
"This proposal was inspired by a call made unanimously by the Council on 12 April 2005."
"The proposal provides for the proposed increases to come into force from 1 January 2008."
"However, in order to ease the difficulties that some Member States may have in increasing their national rates to meet the revalorised minimum, transitional periods have been proposed until 1 January 2011."
"The inflationary increase is 31%, based on Eurostat data and the harmonised index of consumer prices."
"For beer this means that the current minimum rate of 74.8 euro cents per hectolitre per degree will rise to 98 euro cents."
"In other words, the current minimum duty based on half a litre of beer of an alcoholic strength of 5% will rise from 4.5 euro cents to 6 euro cents, an increase of some 1.5 euro cents."
"The majority of Member States are not affected by this proposal, as their national rates are already above the proposed revalorised minimum."
"However, the impact on those Member States that are affected will clearly depend on the level of their current national rates."
"Germany, for instance, will need to increase its national rate on beer by 24.5% in order to meet the revalorised minimum."
"This equates to a duty increase on half a litre of beer of just over 1 euro cent."
"Furthermore, under the transition period proposed, Germany will have until 1 January 2011 to make the necessary increase."
"Honourable Members will see that the impact of the proposed adaptation to inflation will be rather modest and does not justify the outcry in some Member States."
"In response to the specific question asked by Mr Paleckis, the Commission points out that the purpose of the minimum rates is to limit distortions of the internal market through different tax levels being set by Member States."
"Therefore, the minimum rate should be the same across the European Union."
"In the Commission's view it makes no sense to have different minimum rates depending on the point in time one or the other Member State joined the European Union."
"As mentioned above, the Commission's proposal contains appropriate transition periods."
"Finally, I would like to add that the proposal is currently the subject of discussions in the Council."
"These are proving to be more difficult than one would have expected considering that the proposal sets out a purely mathematical adaptation, which has only a marginal effect in some Member States."
"I want to inform honourable Members that on 7 November, just a week ago, when we discussed it for the first time in the Ecofin Council, three Member States - Germany, the Czech Republic and Lithuania - opposed the proposal."
"It did not, therefore, gain the unanimous support requested, so we postponed the final decision and debate to the next Ecofin meeting which is due on 28 November."
"As honourable Members are certainly aware, it will also be the subject of discussions in Parliament."
"(DE) Did the Commissioner know that, when Bavaria joined the German Reich in 1871, it did so only on condition that beer be recognised as a basic foodstuff whose consumption was permitted even during military service?"
"In Bavaria, therefore, beer is a basic foodstuff."
"In addition, should a sharper distinction perhaps be drawn between beer and alcopops - that is to say, between a healthy natural product and a load of rubbish?"
"My second question for the Commissioner is whether greater account should perhaps be taken of regional and national traditions."
"In particular, I should like to ask him whether a better idea might be to reduce VAT and beer taxation for the catering trade, in order to ensure the survival of our high-quality catering establishments - which are essential for health."
"The healthier the catering trade, the healthier the people."
"Member of the Commission."
"I do know this concept and I do appreciate it."
"I like beer myself."
"But this is a position not shared either by the Commission or by the Council."
"- (LT) Until now, a minimum excise duty has been applied to the most popular alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer, with zero excise duty being applied to wine but not beer; at the moment, there are efforts to increase the excise duty on beer."
"How can the Commission explain such differences in excise duty on different types of alcoholic beverages, especially now, in view of France's negotiation for an exemption on a specific type of wine?"
"Member of the Commission."
"Last year, when the increase in excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic drinks was discussed by the Ecofin Council, some Member States raised the issue of the difference between the taxation of beer and the taxation of wine."
"As the honourable Members probably know, since 1992, when the current rates were established, there has been no positive excise duty rate on wine."
"At that time, it was finally agreed that wine would be zero rated."
"Unless there is another decision to re-evaluate the excise duty, zero remains zero, even if increased by a proposed 31%."
"I appreciate the views of those who argue there is basically not much difference between wine and beer, and it is also a fact that wine and beer are competing on the consumer market."
"However, to change the legislation would require unanimity and, as far as I know, at least ten Member States would certainly veto any positive rates on wine."
"- (LT) Unfortunately, due to changes in the order of the Commissioners' presentations, I have missed part of the answer to my question; therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner once again whether he can give any guarantee that the new members of the European Union will not be discriminated against as regards alcoholic beverages."
"Member of the Commission."
"It was already part of my answer that, according to the Commission, there would be no sense in having two different rates of excise duty for the new and old Member States."
"As regards the question of the point of departure, and whether or not this should be the excise duty rates established in 1992 and entering into force in 1993, these can be a point of departure and that is the basis of the current proposal."
"Should the Ecofin Council agree, we could find some other starting date, but that is not yet something officially tabled for the next Ecofin meeting, which will take place on 28 November."
"The Commission is, of course, trying its best to find a solution that is universal and the same for all Member States, be they new or old, and I do hope that on 28 November we will finally arrive at a solution acceptable to all Member States."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, although Europeans traditionally like a drink, alcohol consumption has been declining for years even without taxes and health warnings."
"Indeed, the US example demonstrates what happens when the consumption of alcohol is criminalised: young people turn to designer drugs."
"Perhaps the Commission would do better to step up the fight against illegal drugs instead of demonising and ever increasing the tax on alcohol, the preferred drug of European culture?"
"Member of the Commission."
"The Commission has certainly not proposed to increase the tax on alcohol, because what we are doing is just revalorising."
"The current excise duty rates were established in 1992 and came into effect on 1 January 1993."
"Between then and now they have lost 31% of their value."
"The proposal simply revalorised the excise duty, but it has not been increased by a single euro cent."
"Do you accept, Commissioner, that what we are facing in our single market is a double distortion, a distortion between beer and wine, which is grossly unfair, and the distortion arises that because of grossly different rates of taxation and excise duty between Member States."
"This is the cause, in my country, of hundreds of white vans going to Calais, filling up and coming back to Britain to sell on the black market, to the great detriment of the British brewing industry, pubs and retailers."
"I am sure it is the same elsewhere."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, in accordance with the principles of institutional and procedural autonomy which underpin the EC Treaty, it is for each Member State to determine which courts are responsible for competition matters."
"Most Member States, as you are aware, have specific procedural rules for competition-related issues and these include, for example, referring these cases directly to higher courts, limiting the number or type of competent courts or using specialist courts."
"National courts also have at their disposal a number of mechanisms in case of doubt about the application of Article 81 and Article 82 to a proceeding."
"In particular, further to Article 15 of Regulation 1/2003, national courts can ask the Commission for its opinion on any question on the interpretation of the EC competition rules raised by the facts of a case."
"So far the national courts have done so in some twenty cases."
"If a binding interpretation of the rules is sought, the national court can refer to the Court of Justice under the preliminary ruling procedure and a number of Member States also provide for the possibility for the courts to refer awkward questions to the national competition authorities."
"The Commission, of course, welcomes all initiatives taken by Member States to increase the expertise of the national judiciary in EC competition law."
"The Commission itself has already cofinanced the training of approximately 1900 judges on the application of EC competition laws."
"(EL) Madam President, perhaps the overlap between the competences of the national competition authorities and the competences of other regulatory authorities is leading to the fragmentation of competition policy in numerous Member States?"
"Is it perhaps a source of insecurity of law?"
"Do you think, Commissioner, that a strong institution merging the regulatory authorities - such as, for example, as in Holland, where the competition authority has taken over the energy regulatory authority and the telecommunications authority - would be a good model for other Member States as well?"
"Member of the Commission."
"It might indeed be a possibility to give more information on how the ECN is working in the situation you touched upon."
"In our regular contacts with all the authorities concerned we should push to ascertain what would be best in their specific circumstances."
"I believe that our formula, if it can be done in the Member State itself, and if linked with our rules and regulations in this area, can be of help."
"We should take into account that national courts have only had the right to apply under Articles 81 and 82 in full in actions already commenced."
"Coordination between the national authorities and the Commission is intense and on a regular daily basis."
"I am fully aware that the dialogue has been fruitful until now, and see no reason to expect any change."
"One of the benefits of decentralisation was supposed to be that the Commission would be able to concentrate better on the bigger cases."
"May I ask, then, why the Commission, as the world's biggest competition authority, has never effectively tackled one of the world's biggest restrictive practices, namely the De Beers Diamond Company, as regards the so-called supplier of choice system, which is highly restrictive to competition?"
"Member of the Commission."
"Let me start by offering my regards to the honourable Member, because he has touched upon a very important issue, starting with the compliment that we are the biggest competition authority."
"My colleague, Commissioner Figeľ, replied to a question about ranking, and at the moment our ranking in the competition field is number one."
"Being number one is an honour, but it is also a challenge because one wants to retain that position."
"You mentioned De Beers and I shall write to you in detail about what we have already done."
"As you are aware, we were active in the ALROSA/De Beers case and that was also quite specifically related to the issue you are touching upon."
"We have limited resources, but at a certain point, when it is decided to tackle a monopoly or a quasi-monopoly, we take things further."
"We will remain alert and follow this case."
"(EL) Madam President, I should like to comment on the Commission's position on the merger between competition authorities and regulatory authorities."
"I should like to point out in your reply that safeguarding the effectiveness of the regulatory authorities, the competition authorities and transparency come first."
"These are the basic principles."
"I believe that the regulatory authorities, as selected and decided by the Commission, especially the energy regulatory authorities, play an important role in maintaining their independence from the competition committee."
"Member of the Commission."
"The Commission is currently in discussions with the UK authorities concerning the UK film tax incentive scheme, which has been notified to the Commission under the state aid rules."
"The Commission is assessing that case on the basis of the 2001 Cinema Communication, which provides that Member States can grant state aid to film production if the content of the film concerned is cultural, according to verifiable national criteria."
"In line with the subsidiarity principle, the Cinema Communication leaves Member States to determine those verifiable national criteria."
"Neither Article 151 of the Treaty nor the Cinema Communication exclude the possibility that third-country productions or co-productions can benefit from state aid provided by Member States to support films."
"However, the Cinema Communication allows Member States to require that up to 80% of the film production budget be spent in the territory concerned in return for state aid."
"The UK scheme contains such a requirement."
"Also it was not quite clear, on the basis of the initial notifications of the UK film tax incentive, that European co-productions which meet the conditions of the European Convention on Cinematic Co-production do not need to pass the UK cultural test to benefit under the scheme."
"At the Commission's request the UK authorities have clarified that in their published guidance on the scheme."
"Therefore, the conditions for European co-productions to benefit from the scheme are in line with commonly used European standards."
"In contrast, US productions and US-UK co-productions must pass the UK cultural test to benefit from the tax scheme."
"The UK cultural test contains the verifiable national criteria, which are intended to ensure that the aid is being directed towards a cultural product."
"That is one of the aspects of the scheme that the Commission is examining."
"(DE) I should like to ask the Commissioner whether the drafts that the British Government has presented up to now already contain these cultural criteria for UK-US co-productions or whether they need to be added?"
"My second question is as follows. What is the situation as regards British co-productions in other EU Member States?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the Commission has been supporting the activities implemented by national and provincial health ministries since 1994."
"A number of non-governmental organisations have also received direct aid from the European Reconstruction and Development Programme and/or from the budget heading for poverty-related diseases."
"These activities have, by and large, achieved the results targeted by the various projects."
"Nevertheless, their sustainability, particularly in the social sectors, is a cause for concern due to the ongoing costs they involve."
"Two operations with the health ministries are currently benefiting from funding from the indicative programme."
"First, there are the partnerships for the provision of primary health care, including for HIV/AIDS, which have received EUR 25 million: this programme establishes partnerships between the NGOs and five of the nine provincial health ministries."
"The NGOs fund scholarships and provide appropriate training to untrained or poorly trained healthcare workers."
"These healthcare workers give basic care relating to AIDS treatment to patients who previously did not have access to such care."
"There are currently 187 000 patients receiving care from 5000 providers, and these numbers will increase considerably once the new programme, to which EUR 45 million have been allocated, comes into operation in 2007."
"The second programme comprises support for the South African Government's Comprehensive HIV/Aids Care Management and Treatment Plan, amounting to EUR 25 million."
"This programme was approved by the Commission in December 2004."
"It aims to support the implementation of this anti-AIDS plan, particularly with regard to human resources planning, marketing authorisations for drugs, funding for care and health promotion activities."
"There is also a programme targeting HIV/AIDS in the field of education - the programme on AIDS in higher education, HEAIDS - which has received EUR 20 million."
"This programme follows up on a project funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DfID) and Ireland."
"It aims to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in an age group that is particularly badly affected and is showing signs of lapsing into old behaviour patterns, as well as in the higher education community in general."
"A regional HIV/AIDS awareness and education programme - which has received Community funding of EUR 10 million, in addition to EUR 20 million provided by the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland - was approved by the Commission in 2002."
"It is being implemented by Soul City, a South-African NGO."
"For the last 14 years, Soul City has been receiving considerable aid from the European Community to develop its 'edutainment' - education and entertainment - approach, which involves the use of TV and radio soaps, backed up by leaflets and other documents in a wide range of languages, providing more detailed information on the subjects covered in the broadcasts."
"This programme covers not South Africa, but eight neighbouring countries."
"Although its activities in recent years have produced excellent results, it must nevertheless be noted that this programme is facing administrative problems connected to its cross-border nature and to the fact that it is supported by a number of different sources of funding."
"Alongside the programmes funded by the regional development programme, six projects funded to the tune of around EUR 10 million by various budget headings are currently being implemented in South Africa."
"All of them have objectives relating to the fight against AIDS."
"One project worth mentioning is a vaccine research project linking research institutes in South Africa and Europe."
"In terms of the use and availability of drugs, the Commission does not have a specific programme in South Africa to promote the use of generic drugs, but it does support the measures taken by the South African health department to rationalise and improve legislation on medicinal products."
"It should be remembered that the problem is very often not a lack of availability of anti-retroviral drugs, but the reluctance of patients to be examined and treated, together with lack of access to healthcare equipment and staff, particularly pharmacists to see patients and advise them before they start treatment."
"Commissioner, thank you for that comprehensive answer."
"I know of your personal commitment to this issue, but I met with Zimbabwean and South African AIDS activists at the weekend and the question they asked me, which was difficult to answer, was whether, in your opinion, in relation to the take-up of anti-retrovirals as well as all the other measures you announced, the EU is making a significant impact on the AIDS pandemic."
"Is it actually making a difference?"
"My worry is that in Zimbabwe we are clearly losing the fight because of the special circumstances there."
"But they were also telling me that the situation is still extremely serious in South Africa."
"Member of the Commission. (FR) I believe that the fight against this scourge depends primarily on there being far more consistency between the various players."
"From that perspective, the Commission has also paid a further significant sum into the Global Fund and it will do so again in the future."
"At the refinancing meeting in London, we paid something like an additional EUR 90 million into this Global Fund."
"I must say that this Global Fund refinancing meeting was not as successful as we had expected: even though we succeeded in raising a relatively large amount, we did not raise the amount that we wanted."
"Next, I believe that the European Union, the Commission, must fund projects and strategies that are effective."
"We ourselves have neither the necessary expertise nor the necessary ability to become operators or players in this area."
"We must therefore trust those who do have this expertise and who have already shown themselves to be somewhat effective."
"This will be a long-term fight."
"If we think that we can settle this issue quickly, then in my opinion we are mistaken."
"I believe that this action is effective, but that there is still a long way to go."
"For example, we cannot, in my opinion, ever do too much to promote the provision of education, if only at primary school level, for all girls in Africa."
"Indeed, if we really want to have an effective measure in Africa for fighting against this scourge, then we need to start by sending girls en masse to primary school, and to do so very quickly."
"I believe that this will be one of the most effective preventative measures for fighting this scourge."
"So, yes, Europe is doing everything it can."
"However, you are asking me a question that I have difficulty in answering."
"You are asking me whether I think we are being effective. Yes, I think that we are effective, but we will never be effective enough."
"Nor can I answer the question about when we will eradicate this scourge."
"We can only bet on the quantity of resources, on the strategy of the experts - of whom there are many, sometimes even very many - and on the strategy and the goodwill of the players - of whom there are many, sometimes even very many."
"Personally, I believe that it is in our interest to have coherent strategies, and I am not sure that spreading them, as it were, among all sorts of different players is the right answer."
"I am very much in favour of the idea of conducting strategies directly with the governments of the countries concerned because I believe that countries must take ownership of the actions that are carried out."
"Countries must get involved."
"In Botswana, for example, the government, the State of Botswana is making a real effort; it is really going from door to door."
"Its work consists in going into every home and explaining about prevention and treatment."
"I believe that there is certainly a systematic approach to be taken in this regard."
"To return to the question that you are asking me - it puts me in a predicament."
"I cannot tell you whether we are effective, because I would be lying if I said that, yes, we are effective."
"I believe that we are effective, but I cannot make a bet on it."
"- (LT) Madam President, Commissioner, I have a question concerning HIV/AIDS prevention."
"I had an opportunity to discuss this issue in Mozambican rural communities."
"All people know perfectly well what this disease is and that it must be combated."
"Still, the protection is a problem: it is either unavailable or too costly."
"What, then, can we do about preventing this disease?"
"For any action concerning migration and development to be crowned with success, it must be exhaustive and integrated, and we must use our financial instruments in the short and medium term and embark on an enhanced political dialogue, particularly with our African partners."
"The Commission's strategy for helping the countries of West Africa faced with returning migrants is thus based on three additional lines of action."
"Firstly, it is a question of responding to the urgent nature of the situation by harnessing the instruments available: I am thinking of the B-envelope, and of the rapid reaction mechanism."
"Regarding Senegal, for example, the Commission is going to spend EUR 9.6 million on implementing measures for supporting and reintegrating repatriated migrants."
"This sum is in fact the remainder of the ninth European Development Fund."
"These measures will be accompanied by other financial measures funded by the rapid reaction mechanism, amounting to around EUR 1.9 million."
"Secondly, we must work on the medium term by taking account of migration-related aspects when implementing our cooperation instruments."
"Migration-related issues constitute an important aspect of the tenth European Development Fund programme, in addition to the existing instruments."
"We have therefore provided a 'migration' facility with EUR 25 million, taken from the balance of the B-envelope under the 9th EDF."
"There are many types of reintegration-related measures that are conceivable in the medium term: to implement effective readmission systems between all of the countries concerned, while respecting people's dignity and fundamental rights; to emphasise training and admission so as to help returning illegal immigrants reintegrate into their countries of origin; to financially support national and regional programmes aimed at reintegrating migrants; and to promote information and awareness-raising campaigns for potential immigrants on the risks of illegal immigration."
"However, at the risk of seeming somewhat unrealistic, I should nevertheless like to add that we obviously need to ensure that the support and reintegration measures, whatever they may be, do not appear to favour migrants who return to their countries over those who do not leave."
"If they do appear to favour them, you will obviously encourage others to leave, and I think that it is extremely important to monitor this."
"Ultimately, in the long term, the real answer, as we know, is to have a policy for training and employing young people, which is one of the policies receiving the backing of the European Community, through its support for economic integration policies and through the negotiation of economic partnership agreements aimed at attracting investment and at increasing economic growth, which are prerequisites for the creation of attractive jobs."
"These policies are central to the development priorities and the strategy concerning Africa."
"I must tell you that, from this perspective, I am one of those who believe that, while growth does not necessarily lead to a reduction in poverty, there can be no reduction in poverty without growth: we must remember that."
"I am therefore convinced that the long-term answer consists in promoting economic partnership agreements and in supporting the emergence of integrated regional markets which, I might add, can go hand in hand with a massive aid effort on the part of the European Union in terms of bringing the qualitative standards of products up to the required level, of technology transfer and of the construction of regional and subregional infrastructure, of infrastructure to improve access, and so on."
"To conclude, I am going to take the liberty, Madam President, of digressing in order to make a somewhat personal observation, which deserves to be given some thought."
"There are immediate measures, which must necessarily be taken and which are sadly often of a security nature, which is something that I can understand because our citizens are worried, are bothered by the phenomenon, and because we have difficulty in managing migratory flows."
"There are also long-term policies, which are development policies."
"Alongside these immediate measures and these policies, I wonder whether it would not be useful if we were to start giving thought to what I shall refer to as supported migration."
"I am not talking about quotas, which is an old idea, and one that I am not very keen on for the moment."
"I am thinking instead, for example, that funding could be allocated to migration agencies in the migrants' countries of origin."
"These agencies could provide potential migrants with information and could also work with the Western European countries that offer job opportunities, without for all that encouraging a brain drain, which is another of my concerns."
"These agencies could, as it were, play the role of regulator in the two ways mentioned."
"There is in fact one thing about which I will not be convinced: it is not by closing the borders, it is not by taking coercive measures, and it is not by repatriating people en masse that we will settle this issue concerning migrants."
"We are going to have to live with this phenomenon for many years yet."
"Immigration is not a new phenomenon."
"There have always been migrations."
"We, in Europe, have the impression that we have suddenly unearthed a phenomenon that did not previously exist."
"For as long as the Earth has existed, there have been migrations."
"I am sorry to have to point that out."
"That being said, I understand that this phenomenon is difficult to manage and I understand that measures must be taken, and sometimes taken immediately, but I wonder whether, precisely because we are Europeans and because we uphold European values, we ought not to start giving thought to what I will call a third way, which I feel is more realistic."
"These migration agencies could easily provide training so as to enable young people from the countries concerned to become, for example, small business owners, traders and small craftsmen, because what is lacking most in these poor countries is a significant middle class."
"It is also lacking in both the economic and political spheres, since there is generally more political stability in countries in which there is a significant middle class."
"There you have the small digression that I wanted to make, Madam President."
"I believe that it is important to be a little bolder in our thinking."
"(ES) Thank you, Commissioner, because it seems to me that you are attaching the appropriate degree of importance to the issue of immigration and I agree with almost all of your comments."
"Nevertheless, masses of immigrants are currently arriving illegally, particularly on the shores of Southern Europe, causing not just a social and economic problem but also a political one."
"The mass arrival of immigrants at small islands in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic causes a political problem."
"I agree with the Commissioner that we cannot 'stimulate' immigration, but perhaps we should look at the phenomenon of immigration as evidence that something is going wrong in terms of development aid."
"This would lead to a policy that complements the policies we currently have."
"Member of the Commission."
"(FR) I have already answered that question."
"Let us imagine, for example, that we could devote ten times more resources to our development policies."
"The fact remains that, if you carry out development projects in developing countries in which, for example, there is no State capacity, not even any State sovereign capacity, that is to say, where the State is incapable of providing equal access to education for all children, access to the authorities, access to the judiciary and access to health care, then your development policy will not be truly effective."
"It will not be truly effective until you have States that are capable of providing their citizens with basic services and of organising society along social lines."
"That is why the philosophy that I try to propound in the tenth European Development Fund is all about saying that we absolutely must make these States more able to provide."
"That is what the debate on governance is all about."
"As you know, I recently presented a communication on governance, which was fairly well received by our Member States and which was well received, too, within the context of the meeting of the World Bank, in Singapore, in which we explained what made Europe different."
"Major development days on the issue of governance, together with numerous round tables, are due to take place in Brussels tomorrow, on Thursday and on Friday."
"The President of the World Bank will take part in these."
"Seventeen African Heads of State or Government, countless ministers, experts, Mark Malloch Brown from the UNDP and others will also be present."
"They will all gather together in order to hold a genuine debate on governance."
"How can we make States more able to provide?"
"The experience that I have acquired in this area leads me to conclude that we will never manage to make a success of development if we do not simultaneously consolidate the States concerned."
"What applies to Europe - what has applied to Europe, what has applied to our countries - also applies to these countries."
"I believe, in fact, that if everything that is poured into our development policies is poured into failing States, the consequences will only be negative: a great deal of waste, heavy losses and heavy efficiency losses."
"I have one final thought with which to conclude."
"As regards development, 75% of the resources that we devote to development are not used in order to bolster States' budgets."
"Only 25% of our development expenditure is going to help States, and thus to consolidate them or to give them a chance to consolidate."
"The remaining 75% goes to parties with an indirect involvement."
"Admittedly, these parties are useful and important."
"They need to become partners."
"However, I find it difficult to hope that developing countries will be endowed with this ability to provide if they are only given a quarter of the development budgets."
"I recognise that this issue warrants a far-reaching, open debate, but, as everyone knows, I am in favour of a substantial increase in the quantity of budgetary aid."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"You have answered part of my supplementary question already."
"However, does the Commission not feel that rather than pay illegal immigrants to return home, thus encouraging higher levels of migration, it would be better to alleviate the conditions that forced them to leave their homeland in the first place?"
"That, of course, would require much higher levels of development spending than we currently enjoy in the EU."
"Member of the Commission."
"(FR) I have already answered that question."
"It is very complex."
"Indeed, if the idea is to say that a sum of money will be given to all those who want to leave behind their countries so as to make them stay, that amounts to implementing a widespread intervention system targeted at individuals."
"That has nothing to do with development."
"That is extremely dangerous."
"On the other hand, I support your idea - since it is also mine - that huge sums must obviously be invested in development projects that, for example, create jobs or work; I am thinking of labour intensive work, which we are, moreover, funding."
"If you take Rwanda, we are funding road building projects, which are directly carried out by the unemployed, by people who have been put to work, who admittedly earn just one and a half dollars a day, but who have a status, who work and who therefore provide for their families."
"Yes, I totally agree with you: maximum investment is obviously required for development, but on the conditions that I mentioned."
"I believe that to merely pour out resources without having a State that can govern, that can orchestrate all of that, will not amount to very much."
"(DE) May I start by remarking that I found the Commissioner's views very refreshing."
"To move on to my specific question: migration and asylum policies in the EU create the impression that the majority of Member States have a policy of doing as they please, not doing what they are supposed to, and everyone joining in, even though we already know that a single European migration and asylum policy is probably the only sensible course of action."
"For this reason, I should like to ask what efforts the Commission is making towards a single migration policy, and how much longer it will be, in his opinion, before migration policy falls within the powers and responsibilities of the EU."
"Member of the Commission."
"(FR) Madam President, I am going to be extremely brief."
"I can only wholeheartedly agree with your remarks."
"Every time it makes proposals to unify, to align, the various laws and approaches of our Member States, the Commission - it really must be said - comes up against sharp divisions between our Member States."
"I therefore believe that things are moving forward, that progress is being made, but I also see the difficulties that exist when it comes to convincing the Member States to take concrete measures."
"Let us take the example of the efforts made by my colleague, Mr Frattini, to encourage the Member States to adopt a far more consistent and unifying policy."
"You are therefore absolutely right."
"The Commission is doing everything it can, but unfortunately it cannot force the Member States' hand."
"Council Question Time"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council that met last June asked the Finnish Presidency to work closely with the Commission to look into ways of improving decision-making and action in the area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of the current Treaties."
"The Commission has put forward several proposals for this in its communication 'Implementing the Hague Programme: the way forward'."
"The proposals are being considered by the European Council, which is expected to return to them at its meeting in December."
"The main proposal by the Commission for improving the decision-making process relates to the use of the passerelle clause under Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union."
"That would bring police cooperation and criminal justice within the framework of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"The proposal was discussed at the informal meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs this September, although it did not obtain the unanimous support it needed under Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union."
"The Presidency will be giving a report on this to the European Council in December."
"I would also ask the honourable Member to note that the Council gave a decision on 22 December 2004 on applying the codecision procedure in certain areas under Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which are measures referred to in Article 62(1), (2)(a), and (3) and Article 63(2)(b) and 3(b), which concern, for example, the lifting of checks at internal borders, checks at external borders, conditions relating to travel, sharing the burden of responsibility in matters to do with refugees, illegal immigration and illegal residence."
"(ES) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that you have given me the information you have at the moment."
"I simply wished to stress one point. immigration."
"At the moment we want to create a great Union market, a great area of freedom, security and justice."
"Theoretically there are external borders and then internal borders, but the external borders differ from State to State and, therefore, if decisions cannot be adopted in the Council in this area enabling immigration to be regulated in a uniform manner throughout the European Union, it will be impossible to create a great Union market."
"Do you think it will be possible to make progress at the December Council, at least on this point, in order to ensure that decisions relating to European immigration policy are not subject to unanimity, but to majority, in accordance with the 'passarelle clauses' that you have just referred to?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is the Presidency's aim specifically to strengthen the Union's consistent and comprehensive immigration policy, which covers both legal and illegal immigration."
"It is also worth pointing out that the second point in Article 67(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community allows the Council, acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament, to take a decision for the codecision procedure to be applied to legal immigration."
"Can the President-in-Office confirm that these are subject matters which, for the United Kingdom and Ireland, are covered by the special protocol annexed to the Treaty, which allows those two countries to opt in or opt out of any measures adopted?"
"Having regard to that fact, President-in-Office, do you agree that it is quite unreasonable for some people in those countries to object to switching to qualified majority voting on the grounds that national sovereignty would be lost, because, in any case, it is an area that those countries can opt in and opt out of, and it would be quite unreasonable to block such a decision on those grounds?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, representing the Council as I do, I do not want to adopt a position on debates going on within the Member States."
"Let me just say that the use of the passerelle requires the unanimous decision of the Member States of the Council, but hitherto no such unanimity has been found."
"This matter will continue to be looked into, however, as cooperation on justice and home affairs is just the sort of cooperation where Europeans expect and hope for effective action on the part of the Union."
"- (LT) Madam Minister, I have a question concerning migration."
"The European Commission has presented its Green Paper on an EU approach to managing economic migration."
"We all know that this is primarily economic migration."
"The Paper states that entry to a Member State is a question that falls within the competence of the Member State."
"Therefore, I would like to determine whether the discussion concerning the transition to qualified majority voting does not violate the subsidiarity principle in this case?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in September the Finnish Presidency proposed some Council draft conclusions on decent work."
"The proposal has now been debated by three Council preparatory bodies, where the discussions have been on social issues, questions relating to trade and questions relating to development cooperation, because decent work is a vital factor in all these three areas of policy."
"The Council is expected to adopt its conclusions in December."
"The Presidency's draft conclusions consider several matters with reference to the Commission communication on decent work, which the honourable Member mentions."
"Apart from proposing Council draft conclusions on decent work, the Council, during the Finnish presidential term, has spent a good deal of time and done a lot of work on the proposal for a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, something that has been examined by the European Parliament."
"Finland hopes that this will reach a conclusion as soon as possible so that the fund can be used to help employees who are likely to feel the negative impact of globalisation."
"At the informal Council meeting of Employment, Social and Health Ministers in Helsinki on 6-8 July, the ministers present discussed how productivity might be improved by developing the quality of working life."
"They stressed the importance, for example, of the spiral of growth of decent work and labour productivity."
"At the sixth ASEM Summit in Helsinki on 10 and 11 September, the Heads of State or Government acknowledged the need to strengthen the social dimension of globalisation and emphasised that productive employment, decent work, the rights of all employees, social welfare and dialogue in the labour market are decisively important for sustainable socio-economic development."
"'Decent work for all' was also the main theme of the high-level segment of the meeting of the UN's Economic and Social Council on 3-5 July 2006."
"The Commission is, moreover, organising a conference on decent work in Brussels on 4-5 December."
"The Action Programme for Decent Work covers freely chosen productive employment and a respect for rights at work, as well as labour standards, dialogue between the Social Partners, social security and gender equality."
"The Programme's scope is an opportunity for the EU's institutions, especially the European Council and the Council, as legislators, to examine, and encourage various bodies to examine, the notion of decent work in its entirety, both inside Europe and also in the context of Europe's trade and development cooperation relations with third countries."
"The social dimension of globalisation and decent work are the EU's priority themes in its efforts to achieve consistency in development policy."
"When the cash in the European Development Fund is allocated, special attention needs to be paid to several issues, including that of decent work."
"Considerations relating to certain challenges posed by globalisation were also on the agenda at the Informal Tripartite Social Summit in Lahti in October."
"(EL) Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her reply."
"I wanted to also ask if provision has been made for funding the decent work agenda and if there is agreement on such funding in the Council."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, no decisions have yet been taken on this funding, as far as I understand, and obviously Parliament, as an important budgetary authority, can also influence where common funds are channelled."
"Since today we are discussing the challenges of globalisation, my question is about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, our new annual fund, our new financial instrument to meet the challenges of globalisation."
"Is the Council in a position to enforce this fund as soon as possible, and by that I mean in 2007?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has noted the European Parliament's resolution on trade and economic relations between the EU and India."
"The Seventh EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October examined trade and economic relations between the parties."
"In particular, a report by the EU-India High Level Trade Group was examined."
"The Group was set up at the 2005 summit to look into how bilateral trade and investment relations could be developed and expanded."
"The Group recommended that a large-scale trade partnership be developed through talks on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement."
"It was also the Group's view that a major, comprehensive agreement would also be of significant benefit to both the EU and India."
"The Group recommended that future talks should cover the areas set forth in the report, such as trade in goods and services, investment, the promotion of trade, public procurement, technical regulations, intellectual property and geographical indications, competition policy, and the settlement of disputes."
"Discussions on this at the Summit were constructive and reflected support for the work of the Group."
"The EU-India Summit took a positive view of the Group's work and backed its proposal for a future, comprehensive trade and investment agreement."
"The view was taken at the Summit that both parties should promote the start of negotiations on an agreement of this sort. Both parties are now holding internal discussions on this."
"The Summit was also confirmation of the undertaking and commitment on the part of both parties to achieve a strategic partnership and close cooperation, which has helped strengthen relations between the EU and India."
"President-in-Office, only last week I was informed by Kamal Nath that he found the report I had prepared on behalf of the Committee on International Trade to be very helpful and that he was able to quote it in the negotiations."
"The notion of a free trade agreement with India is clearly a key element of Commissioner Mandelson's external review strategy Global Europe, which sets out a clear strategy for building bilateral trade arrangements with emerging economies, notably in Asia."
"What is the Council's view of this new strategy and does it believe such bilateral arrangements are the best mechanism for advancing Europe's growth and competitiveness, and how does this stand in relation to our commitment to the multilateral Doha round?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council discussed the matter of CIA secret detention centres at a meeting held on 15 September."
"EU ministers repeated that they were committed to the effective fight against terrorism using all the ways and means available."
"Terrorism in itself is a threat to the system of values that is based on the rule of law."
"The Council repeated its insistence that human rights must be respected and humanitarian standards complied with in the fight against terrorism."
"Representatives of the Member States therefore welcomed the statement by the US Administration that all prisoners would be treated in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention, and its assurances that the International Committee of the Red Cross would have access to the prisoners in question."
"The existence of secret detention centres, where imprisoned persons are held in a legal vacuum, is against international humanitarian law and international criminal justice."
"The EU ministers said that they would continue the dialogue with the United States of America which focuses on the notion that a respect for human rights should be guaranteed even in the fight against terrorism."
"This dialogue has been continued."
"These views, which were strongly expressed at the meeting, will appear in the bulletin on the meeting."
"deputising for the author. - President-in-Office, I am reassured by some of what you say, but great concern remains about so much that may or may not have actually taken place, and we need to establish the facts."
"According to an article in the Italian newspaper l'Unità, on 7 December 2005 Condoleezza Rice had frank discussions with EU ministers at a dinner at which the issue of extraordinary renditions was discussed."
"I should like to know whether this dinner took place."
"If so, who was there?"
"Were extraordinary renditions discussed?"
"If so, what was said?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, the dinner to which the honourable Member refers was not organised by the EU Presidency, at least."
"We know nothing about the dinners the Member States of the European Union organise within the context of their own foreign relations, and we cannot possibly comment."
"Excuse me, it may be a matter of the interpretation but I am quite surprised to hear what you say, because I do not think that you have responded to either of the questions."
"You have not responded to the first question that was put to you in writing."
"You refer to the dinner on 7 December of last year as concerning bilateral relations between Member States and the US."
"If I understand correctly, that was a meeting where all the Member State governments and the US were represented, and if I am not mistaken Mr Solana and Mr de Vries were there as well."
"I think, President-in-Office, that a great deal has come out in the meantime about the existence of secret prisons and the rendition flights that took place in Europe."
"Can you confirm that the dinner took place and that the matter was discussed?"
"When will the Council start its own investigation and recognise what the rest of the world already knows?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, accession negotiations with Turkey began when it was considered that that country met the Copenhagen political criteria."
"This means that Turkey is assumed to be complying with the reform process and endeavouring to bring in new reforms."
"As the negotiating framework adopted by the Council in October 2005 states, progress in the negotiations depends on Turkey's progress in the implementation of reforms."
"The Council of the European Union will not adopt an opinion on the alleged genocide of Armenians in Turkey."
"Making historical judgments is the job of historians."
"The Union takes a positive view of certain initiatives, such as the conference in Turkey on the Armenian Question and Prime Minister Erdogan's proposal to set up a joint Turkish-Armenian commission of historians to research the tragic events of 1915."
"The Union is enthusiastically encouraging Turkey to do all it can to improve relations with its neighbour Armenia, especially with regard to opening the border between the countries, which would be a very propitious move for the entire region."
"It was this summer that the European Council last reconfirmed that it would adhere to its commitments on enlargement."
"No new criteria should be set midway though the negotiations process."
"(SV) Mr President, it is not clear to me whether the Minister believes that Turkey must acknowledge the genocide or whether this is something that is to be left up to Turkey and Armenia to settle. What is the Minister's view on this?"
"Like the rest of the Swedish June List, I am in favour of Turkish membership, provided that Turkey meets the conditions of membership."
"Is it not a cause of concern that modern Turkey, which is a nation state founded, in fact, in the early 1920s, should refuse to acknowledge an action committed by the Ottoman empire many years before?"
"What does the Minister have to say about that?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, as I said in my previous answer, the Council of the European Union will not adopt a position on the alleged genocide of Armenians in Turkey."
"Making historical judgments is the job of historians."
"The Union, takes a positive view of certain initiatives, however, to shed new light on the tragic events of 1915."
"The Finnish Presidency and the Commission too have stated that an admission regarding the Armenian genocide is not a criterion for Turkey's membership of the EU."
"- (LT) Madam Minister, I fully agree that historians are the ones charged with evaluating history; however, they have different attitudes."
"A democratic state, which is unable to assess its own past, cannot be called democratic."
"I doubt that Turkey complies with the first Copenhagen criterion."
"Turkey also fails to meet other requirements, such as the specification of the Ankara Protocol to open Turkish ports to Member States of the European Union."
"It seems that Turkey is dictating EU membership terms; therefore, I am concerned about possible severe outcomes if Turkey starts dictating further terms."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, the Union itself dictates and imposes the conditions of membership for new Member States, but it is important that no new conditions or new criteria are set midway through the accession process."
"The last time that the Commission made an evaluation of the extent to which conditions for membership were being met was in its report out on 8 November."
"Ultimately, an analysis of the scope for continued talks with Turkey will also be undertaken at the December European Council."
"(FI) Mr President, Minister Lehtomäki, you have now twice stated the Finnish Presidency's view that recognition of the Armenian genocide cannot be a new condition for Turkey's membership."
"The Commission is of the same opinion."
"Is this the Council's common position, by which I mean has the legislative process on the Armenian genocide now under way in France been discussed and common conclusions adopted?"
"I would also like to ask how the Council intends to deal with the report on integration capacity adopted yesterday by Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs and which is to be adopted in December's plenary part-session."
"President-on-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has unfortunately not discussed this issue, as it does not fall within its competence."
"The promotion of human rights, however, is one of the European Union's main priorities."
"Commitment on the part of the Member States of the Union to a respect for fundamental rights is also written into the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Member States of the EU are also members of the Council of the Europe and thus committed to compliance with their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Presumably, when the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights is set up and in operation, it will strengthen the Union's monitoring and information facilities, thereby promoting the implementation of fundamental rights to the greatest possible degree."
"It still needs to be said once and for all that it is for the Commission, not the Council, to monitor implementation of the Union's Treaties."
"(FI) Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki, we nevertheless have precedents for the Council including in its agenda supposed or impending human rights violations on the part of one Member State."
"When Austria's new government was elected, certain Member States pushed through sanctions against Austria in the light of its government programme."
"This is now, however, a matter of concrete decisions which official bodies in Poland have taken, which is to say that they have completely rejected the perfectly reasonable application for YOUTH programme funding for no good reason whatsoever."
"Does the Council not think that this would be at least as important an issue as the Austrian government programme was, though that did not lead to any tangible human rights violations?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, following the case which I believe the honourable Member is referring to, the status of fundamental rights in the work of the Union was in fact reconfirmed in the Union Treaties."
"There is now no plan, however, to act on the basis of any sort of precedent, and the implementation of this Community programme and matters relating to its criteria are of course the responsibility of the Commission."
"As the author is not present, Question No 8 lapses."
"Subject: UN Human Rights Council"
"The UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has concluded its second round of sittings without adopting any of the resolutions put before it."
"The debates were dominated by those countries which have a history of human rights abuse, and no leadership was given by those states which are deemed to be the defenders of human rights."
"Furthermore, although the reform seeks to confer powers to enable rapid action to be taken in the event of serious violations of human rights, the UNHRC failed to deliver an opinion on the situation in Darfur, the attacks on civilians in Sri Lanka, or the consequences of the violence in Lebanon and the occupied territories."
"What is the Council's opinion of the outcome of the second sitting of the UNHRC?"
"What role is the Council prepared to play in the UNHRC's deliberations?"
"What measures are planned in order to tackle the challenges it faces if it wants to be an effective body?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union took an active role in the first and second session of the Human Rights Council."
"The Human Rights Council should live up to the high expectations which the international community has set for it, and needs to employ effective and fruitful mechanisms to be able to fulfil all its tasks."
"The European Union believes that it is too early to judge the work of the Human Rights Council properly."
"We are establishing a new body with new working methods and processes, and this will take time, patience and creativity."
"The Human Rights Council's broad mandate covers the prevention of violations and the building of cooperation and resources, but urgent human rights situations also have a major role."
"Crucial to the new body's role are cooperation and dialogue, which are contained in the UN General Assembly resolution, on the basis of which the Human Rights Council was established."
"The EU thus intends to continue to work steadfastly with other countries in the same spirit, and hopes that the other players involved are equally committed."
"The EU's view of the second session of the Human Rights Council is that it was a very positive achievement to hold discussions on situations on both certain matters and country situations, within the context of the Special Procedures, and with the UN's human rights body."
"Allowing extra time for the Special Procedures was a major improvement in Human Rights Council practices."
"The quality of the dialogue and the large attendance figures were a tribute to the important role that the Special Procedures and the human rights body play within the human rights machinery, in that, for example, they bring the discussions closer to practical realities and act as an early warning system."
"This work needs to be developed in future sessions."
"The EU welcomes the active participation of NGOs in the debate both on particular subjects and on national situations."
"The EU continues to support their active participation in all the work of the Human Rights Council."
"The EU supported the efforts made by Mr de Alba, President of the Human Rights Council, to draft a concrete 'omnibus' resolution, based on a consensus on Human Rights Council results, and relating to certain matters and urgent human rights situations."
"The EU regrets that the talks on the text did not lead to consensus."
"The EU is in favour of an approach based on consensus whenever possible, and worked very hard for this at the second session of the Human Rights Council."
"We will continue along this path in the future too."
"It was a disappointment for the EU that no tangible results were achieved regarding the very serious human rights violations that have taken place in Darfur."
"Action on the part of the Council is also needed in other urgent situations, such as that in Sri Lanka."
"The EU intends to continue to be active so that the Human Rights Council can fulfil all the tasks within its mandate at future sessions."
"deputising for the author. - (ES) Thank you very much for your reply, Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"We currently have the problem that the United Nations Human Rights Council is suffering from the same defects as the Commission on Human Rights, that is, its inability to adopt resolutions."
"The European Union and its Member States, particularly those that are members of the Human Rights Council, can help to overcome this situation."
"Specifically, tomorrow, 15 November, a special meeting is taking place on Israel's violations of human rights in the occupied territories, and from 27 November to 8 December the Council will consider its decisions."
"Does the Presidency-in-Office of the Council believe that the States of the European Union can help to achieve results in these two coming meetings?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, the Union has an important role to play in the work of the Human Rights Council, and preparations are now under way for the Council's third session."
"This will mainly focus on formulating the Council's working practices."
"The Union is now very actively participating in the preparatory work that is taking place in Geneva."
"The Council's future agenda is also being discussed."
"The EU aims to push its own objectives through in these talks, for example, to ensure that the special mechanism system is preserved and reinforced."
"In addition, the Union will be involved in discussions on the establishment of a new periodic review."
"- (LT) Madam Minister, as a member of the delegation of the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the European Parliament, I have participated in the session of the Human Rights Council of the United Nations and have seen the Member States of the European Union negotiating their positions and trying to speak with one voice."
"My question is as follows: what issues were initiated by the European Union to be discussed in the Human Rights Council during the Presidency of Finland?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council regularly evaluates the situation in the Middle East, and last did so at its sessions on 17 October and 13 November."
"It was then that the Council adopted its conclusions on these matters."
"These explored the Council's position with regard to various issues."
"Furthermore, contained in them was an expression of concern about Israel, and matters on which it would like Israel to take various forms of action."
"The Council raises these matters with Israel within the context of the EU-Israel Association Agreement at meetings held regularly with Israel."
"An opportunity for this last presented itself at the EU-Israel Association Agreement meeting held on 13 June 2006."
"A meeting of the Working Party on Human Rights on 7 June 2006 was an opportunity for a more in-depth debate on the EU's particular worries about Israel."
"Furthermore, the Sub-Committee on Political Dialogue and Cooperation, at its second meeting on 9 November, held a discussion largely devoted to these issues."
"Mr President, what is going in Gaza amounts to nothing less than sheer bloody slaughter."
"Just how many Palestinians have to die before the Council recognises that Israel might be in breach of the human rights requirements of the Association Agreement?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, Gaza and the Middle East situation was last discussed at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council held yesterday."
"At that meeting, conclusions on this situation were adopted."
"The Union has been especially worried about the appalling humanitarian situation in Gaza."
"The Union has provided its own humanitarian aid and has also regularly raised with Israel, in many different contexts, the matter of the measures which are needed to improve the humanitarian situation."
"As the author is not present, Question No 11 lapses."
"Subject: EU-Balkan relations"
"Can the European Council state what tangible measures have been made this year in terms of building closer economic and political relations between the European Union and the Balkan States?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, the Council has worked continuously to ensure that the Union is committed in the future to closer relations between the Western Balkan countries and Europe."
"It confirmed its complete support in the Salzburg Declaration of March 2006 for the agenda set out at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003 and for furthering the Stabilisation and Association Process."
"One of the major challenges this term has been how to ensure support for the current talks on the status of Kosovo, headed by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari."
"The talks have also featured a plan for the EU's future position and presence, especially in the areas of policing, the rule of law and the economy."
"Since the referendum in Montenegro and the Republic of Montenegro's declaration of independence, the European Union and its Member States have agreed to develop relations with Montenegro as a sovereign, independent country and have urged both Serbia and Montenegro to continue with their frank and constructive dialogue on future relations."
"The Council welcomed the fact that the elections in the Republic of Montenegro went peacefully and without problems, and the recommencement of talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"The Council stressed that the speed of progress of the talks and their conclusion depended in particular on Montenegro's progress in implementing the necessary reforms."
"Work has continued on bringing to conclusion the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"After the elections in early October, the Council emphasised that recently elected political institutions needed to accelerate the implementation of all the reforms that were required for concluding the Agreement."
"The Council also welcomed the report by Javier Solana and Olli Rehn on a reinforced EU presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"The purpose of reinforcing its presence is to prepare for, and put into effect, the move away from the current arrangement towards greater local responsibility."
"Talks with Serbia will continue once it is seen to be cooperating fully with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)."
"The Council repeated that a peaceful, prosperous Serbia, one that is a full ally of the European nations, is very important for the stability of the entire region."
"In accordance with the commitments made at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003 and the Salzburg meeting in 2006, the Council has endeavoured to make closer ties to the EU more tangible, by, for example, increasing contact between people by means of agreements that facilitate the issue of visas concluded with all the countries in the Western Balkans."
"The mandate for negotiations for such agreements was adopted yesterday by the General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"Similarly, the mandate for negotiations was adopted for readmission agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Macedonia in the former Yugoslavia, Montenegro and Serbia."
"Albania already has a readmission agreement with the EU."
"Negotiations with all the Western Balkan countries are to start on 30 November in Brussels."
"The purpose is to bring the talks to conclusion as soon as possible."
"The Council, moreover, supported regional cooperation and the local responsibility of various regional forums, not least the reform of the Central European Free Trade Agreement and its expansion to include all the Balkan countries."
"The Council welcomed the initialling of the Central European Free Trade Agreement on 9 November in all the countries in the Balkan region, excluding Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia."
"The Council anticipates that the Free Trade Agreement will be signed according to plan on 19 December during the CEFTA Summit in Bucharest."
"President-in-Office, thank you for that very comprehensive answer."
"I should like to focus on two other areas you spoke about in your response."
"Firstly, with regard to the role of Martti Ahtisaari in Kosovo and how that links in with the commitments from the European Union under the common foreign and security policy, what kind of money is being given for the rejuvenation of the police force and the judiciary within that area?"
"Secondly, has there been any further discussion of an idea that originally came from Croatia concerning the creation of a new semi-single market within the former republics of the Yugoslav Republic in order to try and create economic regeneration within that area itself, and has the EU been asked to participate or to advise with regard to any parts of that?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, we do have to remember that the job being done by Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari to find a solution to Kosovo's status is under the auspices of the UN."
"The Union, however, strongly supports Mr Ahtisaari's efforts and hopes that a solution to the question of status will be found."
"It is very important that stability in the region can be maintained and that long-term preconditions for development can be established."
"The European Union is preparing for a diverse presence and support in Kosovo even after a decision on its status has been reached."
"With regard to the honourable Member's second question, I would refer to my analysis of the Free Trade Agreement in my original answer."
"Projects connected with the Free Trade Agreement are well along the way, and we are expecting it to be signed this December."
"(DE) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to what extent are the local authorities in the countries of the Western Balkans and also in the countries the President-in-Office mentioned really prepared to work together with the EU on a common foreign and security policy, and particularly on combating organised crime?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community's energy policy is based on the third pillar: security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability."
"Energy efficiency is a way to promote the achievement of these three main objectives of the Community's energy policy."
"This we are aiming to bring about by, for example, improving security of supply by reducing our dependence on outside sources."
"In the same way, it is important to boost competitiveness in the European Union, so that new energy efficiency technologies can be developed, the position of industry in the Union in the field of energy-efficient products and services reinforced, and energy costs for companies and the authorities cut."
"To achieve these goals we also need to promote environmental sustainability, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the other adverse effects on the environment which result from the use of some forms of energy."
"Energy efficiency and energy saving may be regarded as both the cornerstone of the Community's energy policy and a priority goal, which the Council has been committed to for a long time now."
"This commitment is clearly reflected in the legislative measures and other measures which have recently been adopted or which are to be adopted in the Council's conclusions on energy efficiency and energy saving and in the conclusions by the Presidency adopted at the March and June 2006 European Council meetings."
"Regarding research and development, the Council would like to refer the honourable Member to the proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme, about which there have been intensive discussions between the European Parliament and the Council."
"Energy efficiency is one of the objectives in the field of energy that we intend to promote."
"Special attention is to be paid to coordination of the views on the reasonable and efficient use of energy in the framework programme and in other Community policies and programmes."
"As you will certainly know, the Council for its own part has already approved the results of the tripartite negotiations held on 26 October, meaning that efforts to reach agreement on the Seventh Framework Programme will be made at second reading."
"I believe that the Council and Parliament will continue to cooperate successfully and that it will be possible to adopt the Seventh Framework Programme by the end of this year."
"You will also certainly be aware of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme for the period 2007-2013, which was recently adopted and will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in the very near future."
"The budget for the 'Intelligent Energy - Europe' programme under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme is bigger than before, so it will help to make it easier to implement concrete action in the field of energy efficiency."
"Among the legislative measures and other measures which have recently been adopted or which are to be adopted soon, it is worth mentioning in particular the European Parliament and Council Directive of 2005 for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using products and the European Parliament and Council Directive of 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services."
"These two ambitious legal instruments, combined with the measures contained in the Action Plan on energy efficiency adopted by the Commission, will promote the realisation of the potential energy saving figure of 20% proposed by the Commission by the year 2020."
"At its meeting of 23 November, the Council will hold a general discussion on the Commission document 'Action Plan for Energy Efficiency: Realising the potential' and adopt its conclusions on it."
"These conclusions will help serve as the basis for the Council's instructions to the Commission, the Member States and other stakeholders for implementing the measures contained in the Commission's Action Plan."
"Implementation of many of the measures proposed in the Commission's Action Plan is one of the Council's priority areas over the next few years."
"deputising for the author. - President-in-Office, thank you for the response to the question."
"I have two very brief supplementaries in regard to that."
"President Barroso said here today in Parliament that climate change and energy are some of the main challenges facing the European Union over the next ten years."
"One of the elements relating to energy efficiency is that if you turn off your television properly instead of leaving it on standby, you can save 25% of the electricity that is normally used for a television."
"Maybe, when we speak about design and energy-efficient design, those kinds of design features should be taken out of televisions and radios and computers, so that there is no standby."
"Secondly, concerning the Stern report on economic environmental matters, I know you cannot speak on behalf of Finland but I also know it has one of the best records on alternative energy use and recovery of energy."
"The Stern report is quite explicit on the economic savings that can be made with regard to energy efficiency."
"Can we see legislative programmes directed towards that?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community's programme of development cooperation with Mozambique, as with the other African, Caribbean and Pacific States, is accomplished via the European Development Fund."
"The Fund's deployment is the responsibility of the Commission, which is the proper body to answer this question."
"I can nevertheless say that Mozambique is one of the largest EU development cooperation recipient countries among the ACP countries, and its share of EDF funding is also one of the biggest in Africa."
"According to the information that we have received, appropriations for Mozambique this year will be approximately EUR 165 million."
"The proper body to provide information on EDF payments is the Commission, so I suggest that the honourable Member consults the competent body on this matter also."
"deputising for the author. - I just wish to say that I understand that there is a cross-over here between the different rules."
"However, Mozambique is Ireland's biggest destination for development aid money and the reason is that the Irish Government works very closely with the Clinton Foundation in tackling disease, including AIDS, as well as giving education on the ground."
"Would the Council consider giving more support to foundations like the Clinton Foundation, which has proven to be so successful in individual countries?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, Mozambique's significant position as a recipient of development cooperation is obviously a clear reflection of the peaceful development that has taken place there and the successful transition which the country has gone through in the last 15 years since the conflict."
"With regard to the honourable Member's mention of additional funding from the EDF or the Community budget for the Clinton Foundation, this is naturally the responsibility of the Commission."
"I might say, however, that, to the best of my belief, several Member States also support work of this nature within the context of their national development cooperation programme, and, as the honourable Member referred to the example of Ireland, as minister responsible for development cooperation in Finland, I might add that Mozambique also plays an important role in Finland's programme of bilateral development cooperation."
"The presence of the European Union in Mozambique, in the shape of the Community and the Member States, is therefore important on the whole, because, as I have said, appropriations for Mozambique in the Community budget will be EUR 165 million this year, and the national presence of the Member States and the contribution they make are also undoubtedly considerable."
"Question No 15 has been withdrawn."
"Subject: Iceland"
"What negotiations has the Council had with the Republic of Iceland regarding the slaughter of whales?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is aware that Iceland has said it is recommencing commercial whaling despite the International Whaling Commission's moratorium on whaling, in effect since 1984."
"This issue was discussed at the meeting of the Environment Council on 23 October under 'any other business'."
"On 10 October 2002 Iceland rejoined the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling of 1946, although it expressed reservations with respect to the whaling moratorium."
"As the honourable Member knows, membership of the International Whaling Commission is open to every country officially aligned to the 1946 Convention."
"Each Member State can decide itself whether to join an international convention devoted to matters that do not fall within the exclusive competence of the Community."
"Up till now 18 Member States of the European Union have joined the Convention, and they are also members of the International Whaling Commission."
"The Commission has pledged to protect whales, as endorsed in the Habitats Directive."
"The Directive provides for high levels of protection for whales, at the same time banning any deliberate hunting and killing of whales in Community waters."
"In addition, the import of whale meat and other whale-derived products into the Community for primarily commercial purposes is tightly restricted under Council Regulation (EC) No 338 of 1977."
"When Iceland declared that it would recommence commercial whaling, 15 EU Member States that belong to the International Whaling Commission and the European Commission, together with Australia, the United States of America and eight other like-minded countries, made official contact with Reykjavik, urging Iceland to comply with the moratorium and end its commercial whaling activities."
"I thank the President-in-Office for her answer."
"It was perhaps more than I expected and I am very grateful."
"Iceland, as she and everyone here knows, is not a member of the European Union; it is, however, a member of EFTA and a member of Schengen - although that is obviously not related to this."
"However, it really proves the point that Iceland has close connections with the EU."
"I would urge the President-in-Office, in the time that she and her successors have left, to do everything they can to urge Iceland to not continue with the unnecessary and, I would say, cruel slaughter of one of the world's great mammals for unproven reasons."
"I applaud what the President-in-Office has said about not allowing whaling in Community waters and banning the import of whale products."
"Keep up the good work and push the Icelandic authorities even further."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, the question is actually not so much a question as a comment, and you have my sincerest thanks for that."
"I would nevertheless still like to mention some forthcoming measures that are presently being discussed with regard to this matter, in particular by the International Whaling Commission."
"Its next yearly meeting is in the United States of America next May, and we can be absolutely certain that at least the countries that share the Union's strongly adverse view of this will want to see a debate on Icelandic fishing, so this issue will be very much on the agenda."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Gambling and sports betting in the Internal Market (debate)"
"The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on gambling and sports betting in the internal market - B6-0443/2006)."
"author. - Mr President, I am not the author of the question but the Chairperson of the committee that is taking the question forward on behalf of Members."
"I want to stress that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection took a unanimous decision to table this oral question to ask the Commissioner for an update regarding the ongoing infringement proceedings against nine Member States concerning restrictions imposed on sports betting markets."
"The committee would like the Commission to tell us in particular what progress has been made on the infringement proceedings launched on 4 April 2006 and what future steps are planned in this area."
"Is the Commissioner considering a legal framework for online gambling?"
"As we are on the brink of agreeing the Services Directive, we are well aware of the need for Member States to fulfil their Treaty obligations under Article 49 as regards the free movement of services."
"The Commissioner will be aware of the committee's decision to remove gambling services from the Services Directive, not least because of the complexity of the gambling market."
"However, the freedom to provide services has in the case of the gambling sector clashed with national law in a number of Member States, which have introduced restrictive laws limiting the cross-border supply of online betting and gambling services."
"We support the Commission in ensuring that these laws are compatible with Article 49, while respecting the rights of Member States to protect the public interest, as long as the rules are necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory, i.e. not discriminating against other EU operators."
"It is hypocritical, on public interest grounds, for a Member State to prevent other EU online operators from entering a national market, while at the same time allowing its own national online market to grow considerably while not applying those public interest rules."
"That is the issue we hope the Commission will address."
"I would like to take the debate in a different direction."
"I believe that we need an EU response to the challenge of the global online gambling market."
"This is a market set to grow to a value of EUR 20 billion by 2010."
"In 2003, in the EU-25 commercial gaming industries, lotteries and casinos and betting services were worth some EUR 51.5 billion and there are some 2300 worldwide online casino sites."
"In the UK, for example, during the World Cup football matches, 30% of those making online bets on UK services were women."
"It crosses all classes and all generations."
"The rapid growth of online services and remote gambling and betting services has de facto already erased national boundaries."
"However, let us not follow the US model of pulling up the drawbridge by enacting the 2006 Bush legislation - the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, making it a crime for banks to process or transfer funds via online betting sites."
"This is simply protectionism hiding behind a smokescreen of the so-called protection of consumers against gambling excesses."
"In reality, it is a law to stop foreign operators from competing or undermining the US casino and gambling market, while the States of Nevada and Las Vegas continue to develop their own online and remote gambling services."
"I believe it would be good if the Commissioner, on behalf of the 25 Member States, would engage in the campaign to get an international agreement on standards and rules in regulating eGambling."
"This is one way to minimise the differences between not only the international community but also the EU Member States, to ensure in the end that all states opt in to high standards both for operators and consumers."
"The objective would be to ensure that we develop standards to protect vulnerable consumers, in particular young adults and minors, to engender a sense of social responsibility from good operators and investors and to ensure that gambling is not used as a source of crime or financing criminal activities."
"The internet genie is out of the bottle: some 3.3 million EU citizens are regular online gamblers."
"This is a market that will grow."
"The EU should therefore be part of a wider international campaign for good and high standards."
"We need greater international cooperation to curb problem gambling and more research into the extent of participation in remote gambling."
"The study commissioned by the European Commission on gambling services in the internal market highlights the need to find common international standards and regulatory requirements that will protect EU citizens while allowing the market to operate."
"I hope the Commissioner will feel encouraged by tonight's debate to continue with infringement proceedings."
"However, in reality, it is a thankless task, which takes years to resolve, often not with a satisfactory conclusion, and I believe the best way forward is for the EU now to be a leader, driving good and high common international standards that can help minimise the differences, protect consumers and force the operators to be socially responsible."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, gambling services are clearly services within the scope of the Treaty, and Treaty principles, including those on the freedom of establishment and the freedom of services, apply to gambling."
"The Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States' legislation is fully compatible with the Treaty."
"Therefore the Commission decided in April to ask seven Member States for more information on their legislation that restricts the supply of sports betting services."
"The Commission has responded to a number of complaints from operators in the sports betting area."
"Having met with the authorities of all seven Member States, my services are now examining the formal replies received from each."
"At this stage I cannot pre-empt the outcome of that examination."
"I should like to inform Parliament that I expect that to be completed in the next few weeks."
"Based on that examination I would put forward a proposal to the college of Commissioners on how to proceed."
"It would then be a matter for them to decide on the next steps."
"In addition to the seven cases opened in April, the Commission decided, on 12 October, to send formal requests for information related to the gambling sector to three other Member States."
"Complaints from operators, to which the Commission is responding, relate mainly to sports betting services."
"That is why nine of the ten cases opened so far related to the provision of sports betting services, some of them online."
"However, in October the Commission also enquired about national legislation in Austria, which prohibits advertisements from casinos licensed and operating in other Member States."
"We also have concerns that Austrian legislation requires national casinos to protect only nationals from excessive losses, without having similar protection for foreign players."
"As guardian of the Treaty, the Commission will examine all complaints that it receives."
"However, at the same time I do not underestimate the sensitivities that exist in many Member States on the question of gambling."
"Member States are fully entitled to protect general interest objectives, such as the protection of consumers."
"However those measures must be necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory."
"In particular, they must be applied to national and non-national operators in a systematic and consistent way."
"The Commission does not seek to liberalise the market in any way, but rather to be assured that whatever measures Member States have in place are fully compatible with existing EU law."
"Member States are well aware of the case law of the European Court of Justice, which I expect will develop further."
"The Commission accepted Parliament's request to exclude all gambling services from the scope of the draft Services Directive."
"It was made quite clear to me at that time that the regulation of gambling should be left to the Member States."
"I fully agree, provided that such national legislation is compatible with the Treaty."
"In the context of the infringement proceedings I am willing to work in close cooperation with the Member States to ensure compatibility of national legislation with Community requirements and allow for appropriate and effective protection to be put in place, for example to safeguard consumers and to protect minors."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, would you allow me to make a point first, before you start the clock."
"According to the agenda, this debate was scheduled to start at 10.30."
"That was quite clear and I notice that a number of my colleagues made an effort to be here at 10.30."
"So I am disturbed to find that I missed most of the speech of my colleague Mrs McCarthy, because the debate appears to have started at least ten minutes early."
"I do not think that is acceptable, if I may say so, and I am sorry that your predecessor in the Chair has gone away."
"If the schedule for the day says a debate starts at 10.30, I submit to you that it should start at 10.30, even if there has to be a short adjournment."
"Perhaps I could now move on and if you will restart the clock, please, I shall make my substantive points."
"I very much welcome the fact that Mr McCreevy is here to address this issue and I am pleased that, under the leadership of Mrs McCarthy, we have taken an initiative that I hope will shed some light on this issue."
"As the Commissioner made clear, this is a highly sensitive issue and it involves many aspects of public interest."
"But nevertheless, from the point of view of the operation of the Single Market, which is also of overriding interest to us, the situation is, as you suggested, deeply unsatisfactory."
"Clearly we await the results of your investigations but I suggest that, at the very least, it would be appropriate for you to issue some form of guidelines to Member States on their attitude to receiving applications from reputable and well-established gambling operators who simply want to be able to operate in other EU countries under the law of those countries, which they are perfectly entitled to do."
"One of the things you did not mention, but which seems to me to be rather extraordinary in terms of discriminatory practice, is that some Member States have tried to restrict access to those markets on the grounds that they do not want to encourage gambling."
"Yet at the same time those Member States are promoting participation in their national lotteries with billions of euros across Europe."
"Clearly that is entirely inconsistent."
"I believe it is sensible and good that the European Court of Justice has struck down some of the restrictions, but I think those guidelines will be important."
"As Mrs McCarthy said, in terms of operation and protecting the public interest respectable operations are extremely important."
"The big issue that we have to face is online gambling."
"Whether Member States want to preserve a monopoly or not, the fact is that consumers are taking advantage of online gambling."
"I believe it is much better, in the public interest, that we have well-regulated online gambling services than uncontrolled services which come into Europe from other countries outside the remit of the European Union."
"Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I am going to respond to a procedural motion."
"You are absolutely right; the debate was indeed scheduled for the time that you indicated."
"However, it was explained on the European Parliament's website, at the start of the afternoon, that the debate could start slightly earlier if question time finished earlier than scheduled, which was the case."
"Furthermore, the services tried to contact all of the speakers."
"They managed to contact all of them, except you, Mr Harbour, but I think that your presence in the Chamber this evening shows that you have not missed a great deal of the debate."
"That being said, I felt it my duty to explain the situation to you."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'Rien ne va plus' ['No more bets'] is the curious opening of the recent opinion delivered by the Advocate General Dámaso Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer to the European Court of Justice, which had been asked to rule for the third time on Italian legislation on gambling, following the Zenatti ruling and the Gambelli ruling, the latter rightly referred to in the recitals of the oral question under discussion."
"It is truly important to be familiar not only with the Commission's findings, but also with the recent measures by the Member States against whom infringement proceedings have been opened, and, specifically, the steps that the Commission intends to take."
"I believe that it is also important for there to be moderate but definite rules in this sector, also involving the European Parliament directly."
"That is the only way to help Member States exposed to the risk of appeals and negative judgments in what remains a worthy attempt to protect individuals, in particular minors and the most vulnerable, as has already been said."
"The explosion of gambling, lotteries and online betting is a problem that cannot be left to market liberalisation, even if the difficulty concerning the non-discrimination principle is obvious."
"I must just point out that the 'Services Directive', which has already been referred to here, excludes gambling precisely for reasons of public order and consumer protection."
"on behalf of the ALDE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I thank the Commissioners and my fellow Members for taking the trouble to discuss this topic, which is, after all, an exciting one."
"We have left gambling and Internet gambling outside of the Services Directive because we do not dare take a decision on it."
"It still falls within the scope of Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty and at the moment - as is also evident from the 11 infringement procedures - there is enormous legal uncertainty among the Member States and businesses."
"How should we tackle it?"
"I am pleased that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has put this oral question, for the problems are, after all, real."
"There is the problem that on the one hand, it is very lucrative for the Member States in terms of tax revenue, but on other hand, it also brings with it social problems."
"The main problem, though, is that, if there is no sound legal framework in place within a market where serious money can be made, this opens the floodgates to a huge number of illegal practices in which criminal organisations reign supreme."
"I therefore believe that the politicians, and I hope that the Commissioner will agree with me on this, must take up the gauntlet and dare take decisions."
"We must not surrender ourselves to the very wise judges in Luxembourg who then have the onerous task of biting the bullet."
"I fear that many more judgments from the European Court of Justice will follow as long as we as politicians do not take the right decisions."
"I hope that the Commission and the Council will get there in the end."
"If not, I hope that Parliament itself will produce an own-initiative report in order to guarantee legal certainty, which is desperately needed given the many problems that exist, including addiction, public health problems, illicit funds, money laundering, and the list goes on. We must solve this with a firm, clear directive on gambling and Internet gambling."
"I hope that the Commissioner will advise us as to how Parliament should tackle this."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner's statement that we must protect minors."
"To do that it is imperative to take a long hard look at Ireland's policy of having no age limit on gambling with the state-run tote."
"Children in Ireland are permitted to place bets at greyhound tracks and horse tracks if these are part of that tote."
"Other forms of gambling are limited to over-18s."
"Video evidence exists of Irish children as young as four years of age legally placing bets with the state-run tote."
"It is not uncommon for birthday, Christmas and first communion money to wind up in the Irish state tote and, ultimately, with the Irish Exchequer."
"The Chief Executive of Horse Racing Ireland, when asked his opinion of child gambling in Ireland, said that it was no problem and that he wanted to develop the customer of the future."
"For years you, Commissioner McCreevy, as Irish Minister for Finance, refused to amend the Tote Act and outlaw child betting in Ireland."
"As Commissioner, will you now change your attitude and, at this late date, support restrictions on child online betting, at race tracks, in bookmakers, on airplanes and anywhere else that this insidious practice persists?"
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, from the very first vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we decided to leave gambling activities, including lotteries and bets, outside of the scope of the Services Directive."
"It may be that some, as Mr Manders said a moment ago, were frightened of taking a decision."
"I am convinced that many felt that the Member States could be given quite a bit of freedom to handle this complex issue in their own way, in tune with the sensitivities and the situations in their countries, according to their own traditions."
"It goes without saying that, in this respect, the Member States should respect the Treaty, and we already know the answer of the Court to a number of prejudicial questions that have previously been asked."
"I hope, Commissioner, that the questions that are yet to be asked will not immediately prompt you to advise the Commission to start issuing rules and regulations."
"Whilst the Commission is, of course, the guardian of the Treaties, and we expect it to take its role seriously, this can also be done with some restraint."
"Getting the internal market to operate is necessary and positive in every respect, but this need not be at the expense of the effective protection of law and order, security and the consumer's mental health."
"I hope there will also be room for the Member States which, via state monopolies or not, as the case may be, commit to channelling the passion for gambling, monitor the fairness of the game and to donate the financial gain, as and when they can, for cultural, social and sports goals."
"Clear legal rules can certainly help, but legislation is not always the answer."
"I am certainly not talking on behalf of the whole of the group, but on behalf of a number of group colleagues who were unable to take the floor this evening."
"(ES) Mr President, gambling is not just another service, it is a dangerous activity."
"It is dangerous because people's innocence and ignorance is being exploited."
"In the majority of our Member States, gambling is currently subject to regulation."
"I do not understand how it can be possible for supranational bodies now to be planning to impose a liberalisation of gambling services on the Member States, when the majority of our societies do not accept it."
"The United States Congress recently banned on-line gambling, and it seems to me that, at the moment, we should follow the US example in the European Union, on the one hand, in order to protect our consumers from mafia organisations and, secondly, in order to protect all those social institutions in each of the Member States that currently rely on legal forms of gambling permitted by national authorities."
"I therefore believe that the Commission is right to look into the issue of gambling, but it must deal with it from the point of view of consumer protection and the protection of the institutions currently benefiting from legal gambling in the majority of our Member States."
"(DE) Commissioner McCreevy has also had an extremely tiring day today, and so he will understand our desire to present the matter to him with the necessary clarity and brevity."
"In my personal opinion, gambling and the abundance of lotteries have two different elements. On the one hand, there is the truly cross-border market for online providers that can only be regulated at European level."
"As Mr Medina-Ortega pointed out, the US has already managed to regulate its market."
"Europe, too, can resolve the issue of the online market only by joining with the Member States and introducing Europe-wide regulation."
"On the other hand, there is the market in traditional games of chance and traditional sports betting, which tend to take place in written form."
"In contrast to the infringement proceedings opened by the Commission - Commissioner McCreevy, in other words - we should proceed according to the principle that, if the Member States are succeeding in preventing addiction effectively by orienting their national monopolies towards a range of services that is as limited as possible and offers the greatest possible consumer protection, they should be given the chance to retain these monopolies in future - under the control and auspices of European law and the European Commission."
"It must be ensured, however, that the monopolies that the Member States already have truly pursue just one objective, namely the prevention of addiction, and that Member States do not use them to pursue other objectives, such as aiding the recovery of public finances or promoting sport."
"In this context, I would be delighted if Parliament and the Commission together could agree on a regime that, on the one hand, establishes European regulation of the online market and, on the other, maintains the national regulations in the field of monopolies for traditional sports betting, provided these are compatible with the internal market."
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the exclusion of gambling, including lotteries, from the Services Directive appeared to have introduced a measure of clarity to the sector, but we need to go further."
"We are aware of a number of complicated aspects involving certain types of gambling and betting. It is therefore necessary to guarantee consumer protection and to ensure effective monitoring of the financial circuits relating to such activities in order to prevent or combat money laundering."
"Naturally, we must not confuse the appropriate protection of the consumer with the undue protectionism that any particular Member State may want or may employ."
"In any event, however, it should be pointed out that every Member State has the right to regulate the phenomenon of betting for money on its territory until such time as another, European-level legal instrument appears."
"In this regard, online gambling deserves special attention from the Commission and immediately from Parliament, as previous speakers have mentioned and as is clear from the debate."
"Lastly, I welcome the fact that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection raised this issue, with the result that we have made some progress in clarifying it this evening."
"(FR) Mr President, I am going to try to be both quick and slow."
"This report is timely, and I might add that I consider the remarks made just now to be positive."
"Everyone would like the European Union to intervene using methods other than simple case-law."
"This issue does, in fact, involve a range of businesses and services: casinos, lotteries and other games of chance via traditional means or via the Internet."
"Therefore, this goes far beyond simple online sporting bets, which is the subject of Mrs McCarthy's question."
"While it is normal for these services to apply the principles of the internal market, Commissioner, freedom should not go hand in hand with the law of the jungle!"
"For reasons to do with the general interest, health, morality and security, these services need to be regulated and controlled."
"The Member States must be able to authorise and control public and private operators in the context of fair competition."
"The importance of 'cross-border' games does, however, require us to go beyond the national framework."
"In this regard, the recent decision taken by the United States is the demonstration that, if those who play and who make others play cannot be controlled, then it is better to take too many precautions than not enough."
"That is why, Commissioner, I consider the Commission's current approach, which is based exclusively on the Treaties and on the Court of Justice, to be inadequate and dangerous."
"It is clear today that the idea that the national laws are compatible with the Treaties is an unsatisfactory one."
"Commissioner, you must work alongside Parliament to establish complementary legislation that can organise this extremely important sector, both politically and economically, in a sound and rational manner."
"Let this sector develop, but let it do so in complete safety for the people and for the Member States!"
"(EL) Mr President, over recent years the system of the state monopoly in the gambling sector, which prevails in the majority of the Member States of the European Union, has been on the receiving end of more and more attacks from mainly private interests."
"At the European Union summit in Edinburgh in December 1992, the European Council decided, given the principle of subsidiarity, not to regulate gambling and to leave it under the sole jurisdiction of the Member States."
"The directive adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2000 makes provision for the express exemption of gambling from its scope."
"The draft 2006 directive on services makes precisely the same provision."
"Given the peculiarities of the gambling sector, the Court of Justice of the European Communities acknowledges the competence of the Member States to regulate the gambling market in what they consider to be the best way possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most important reasons for these decisions is the fact that there is a high degree of risk of addition inherent in the gambling sector, especially of young people, and of crimes being committed, such as fraud, money laundering and so on, and I personally believe that only the state can create the control, guarantee, reliability and transparency mechanisms needed in order to protect consumers."
"Finally, I am of the opinion that, once the gambling market is liberalised, the system of support for sports in Europe will collapse, taking cultural and social actions and subsidies with it, such as the fight against drugs, education and support for people with disabilities or special needs who mainly have financial support from the state gambling organisation."
"We believe in the free market, but do not occasionally ignore the risks inherent in uncontrolled gambling."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, for regulatory reasons, we have exempted games of chance and casinos from the Services Directive."
"I say this despite being a firm supporter of strengthening the internal market."
"We did not want to throw the baby out with the bath water, however."
"Secondly, there are many risks associated with games of chance, and so the argument regarding competition law and the internal market should not be the only one used by the Commission in support of infringement proceedings."
"Thirdly, a clear definition is needed."
"When we talk about 'games of chance', what is covered by the term?"
"Given the differences in the treatment of online markets, sports betting, machines, casinos and lotteries, a single definition is needed to ensure these are dealt with the same way everywhere, and a single legal framework is probably also required."
"Fourthly, I should like to point out to the Commissioner that there are other important fields, too, to be taken into consideration, such as consumer protection, health, taxation, international trade, the problem of money laundering, the prevention of addiction and the fight against crime, including organised crime."
"Fifthly, almost all Member States regulate the field of games of chance."
"Eleven have special legislative models, and four use the limited-licence model."
"Sixthly, in 2004, state lotteries achieved sales of EUR 63 billion, which is an average per capita net expenditure of EUR 140."
"Seventhly, that means that approximately 33% of all takings go on good causes and tax."
"In the event of liberalisation of the private sector this would be just 3%."
"Eighthly, it is estimated that the industry generates approximately 13 billion jobs in the EU."
"Ninthly, the sale of lottery tickets accounts for 195 000 jobs within the EU."
"I would ask the Commissioner to consider these arguments when making his assessment."
"Mr President, I should like to make one point."
"Much attention has been paid in this debate to young people and the effects of gambling addiction on them, and yet more people under the age of 12 are trafficked or forced into prostitution because of drug or alcohol addiction and abuse than the gambling addiction that is the subject of our debate tonight."
"Member of the Commission."
"There is no specific Community legislation governing gambling."
"If and how Member States wish to regulate gambling services at national, regional or local level is therefore a matter for each Member State to decide for itself."
"But the general principles of Community law and the Treaty continue to apply and any national legislation must respect those principles."
"The diversity of national approaches can lead to legal uncertainty for service providers and their customers, especially where national legislation fails to respect Community law."
"Tonight's debate helps to illustrate once more the diversity of opinion with regard to gambling services."
"I am, of course, aware of calls for a specific Community regulatory framework for gambling services."
"There are equally strong views opposing such Community intervention."
"In my experience, the first requirement in trying to find a solution is to have a clear understanding of the problem and of the policy options available."
"The Commission recently published a study carried out on its behalf by the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law."
"The study illustrates the complexity and diversity of national regulatory approaches."
"Should Parliament believe that, over and above our efforts to ensure the application of fundamental Treaty principles, more should be done to ensure legal clarity, I look forward to hearing Parliament's detailed views on what precisely the issues are that warrant Community intervention and what policy options would command a sufficient degree of consensus for a meaningful solution at Community level."
"In the absence of such a political consensus, legal certainty may ultimately only be provided by the European Court of Justice."
"I should like to add just a few more words to this debate."
"Mr Harbour put it fairly succinctly when he made the point that there was a great deal of inconsistency amongst many of the Member States, against whom we are now taking some action."
"We shall probably be taking action against some more."
"If Member States, their governments and their legislatures want to have very restrictive laws on gambling, etc., they may do so on public policy grounds."
"But they cannot do the things that Mr Harbour has referred to."
"They cannot spend millions and millions advertising gambling services for their own national operators or their own national, publicly-owned operators."
"They cannot allow their own national operators and bar everybody else."
"If Member States feel, as some Members of this House obviously do, that gambling is a greater scourge than alcohol addiction, tobacco addiction and all these other addictions put together, then they should ban it for everybody and allow no gambling at all in their Member State."
"That is one option."
"Then nobody would complain."
"The Commission would not take action against them and no one would worry about it at all."
"But it is a bit hypocritical for Member States to allow millions to be spent promoting gambling and at the same time allow nobody else to play the game."
"In all Member States gambling is regulated to some extent."
"The point made by Mrs McCarthy about international standards for online gambling is quite a good idea in itself, but first some form of consensus would be needed among the 25 Member States."
"We can start by getting consensus in this Parliament, but I do not think we will."
"I am certain that we will not get it in the Council of Ministers."
"I have about the same chance of getting consensus in the Council of Ministers and Parliament as I have of winning the lottery this weekend."
"Those would be the odds against it."
"So there is much to commend what Mrs McCarthy says, and if there was a consensus I would like to go in that direction, but my experience tells me that it would be very difficult."
"If you read the executive summary in the recent study, which, if I am correct, comes to 51 pages, and save yourself reading the other couple of hundred pages, it does not come down heavily on one side or the other."
"(comments off-microphone from Mr Toubon)"
"Well, I do not think my honourable friend Mr Toubon has read the report, but you can see from that how complex this problem is and the many different ways it is regulated."
"It will show you what a gargantuan task it would be to head down that road."
"In my political life I have not been afraid to take on impossible causes and tilt at windmills and run into brick walls, but I think that if we did attempt some kind of harmonisation of this area, what we would end up with, if anything, would be the most illiberal piece of legislation ever to go through any House anywhere in the world, because it is not possible."
"I have recognised for a long time that there are great differences of opinion here, long before I came to this conclusion."
"I recognise that throughout Europe, and even in my home country, there would be very different views about this."
"Some people, I know, think that it is worse than drinking addiction, worse than tobacco addiction, worse than anything possible, but others do not."
"I know which category I fit into, but I think trying to get some harmonisation in this area is going to be a long, long process."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(MT) Some Member States have unilaterally decided to introduce legislation preventing Europeans from using Internet gambling sites run by companies registered in other European Union countries."
"This violates the principle of unrestricted movement of services between Member States, as well as Directive 98/34 EC which stipulates that, prior to introducing regulations concerning information technology services, a state must inform all other Member States and the Commission."
"Last June, in response to a parliamentary question, I was informed that the matter was the subject of an investigation by the Commission."
"May we know the stage this investigation has reached, and whether any measures have been taken?"
"I agree that it is time this rapidly developing sector were governed by a legal structure that contained standards and regulations governing this service in a serious manner."
"These regulations would protect consumers and minors while, at the same time, permitting serious operators to work freely in all Member States of the European Union."
"A new framework strategy for multilingualism (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Joan i Marí, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on a new framework strategy for multilingualism."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the colleagues who helped me draw up this report, and especially the members of the Committee on Culture and Education."
"I also wish to thank Commissioner Figeľ, who has kept in contact with us, for his positions on plurality and on the issues related to minority languages, etc. Thanks are also due to all the other colleagues, from several groups, and other people involved in the report, especially the members of the various NGOs for the normalisation of languages who were in contact with us during the preparation of the report."
"I would like to mention in particular Vicent Santaló, a member of the legal staff at the Catalan Parliament, who worked with us until his death last summer."
"The main aim of this report is to move forward the concept of plurality in languages."
"Plurality and diversity are common values of the European Union."
"There should be unity among all Europeans in this area, which should have plurality as one of its main aims, because a non-plural Europe is a false and devalued Europe."
"This is reflected in a certain manner in languages."
"As you know, in sociolinguistic terms there are 'normalised' languages, which are the fully official languages used in all walks of our lives."
"There are also 'minorised' languages, which are not fully official and cannot be used for every purpose, despite the fact they are the main languages in specific language communities."
"There is also a third group, which is that of minority languages."
"All these groups must be respected and preserved, and the preservation of language diversity is one of the aims of the European Institutions."
"Europeans are not as multilingual as we think."
"Unfortunately, many European citizens have only one language - usually their mother tongue - and one of the main goals of the European Union is to have a citizenship able to speak several languages."
"In order to achieve that, it is very important for there to be a change in mentality."
"Our society was formed under the influence of Jacobinist states."
"Most European states are unilingual officially, and this is a remnant of Jacobinism."
"However, this is not a true reflection of the facts."
"The aim of the European Union is not to maintain this point of view, but to preserve genuine plurality and work towards citizens being able to speak several languages."
"We need a European language policy."
"That policy should promote multilingualism, improve the language skills of European citizens across the European Union and preserve all languages, whether or not they are official EU languages."
"To this end, the budget and European programmes must support not just the main languages, but all languages, in order to improve diversity."
"In this way we must make a special effort to support endangered languages."
"Every language is good for mankind, and if a language is lost we have all lost something because each language has its own unique expressions."
"It is for this reason that we must preserve genuine plurality and true diversity."
"In this sense, it is necessary to draw up a full report on the actions still to be developed."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Joan i Marí for his excellent report on the Commission communication relating to a new framework strategy for multilingualism."
"Not only the framework strategy, but also the report has been drawn up in the spirit of diversity and unity."
"That should be the leading line in our implementation of policies in this area."
"I am sure we would all like to see a multilingual European society in which the rate of individual multilingualism steadily increases until every citizen has practical skills and at least two languages in addition to their mother tongue."
"That is the famous 'Mother tongue plus two' formula agreed by EU leaders in Barcelona in 2002."
"I recently set up the internal multilingualism network in the European Commission and established the High Level Group on Multilingualism."
"These are both implementation initiatives under the new framework strategy for multilingualism."
"Another priority is to develop early language learning."
"If we want to build a multilingual society we have to start as soon as possible."
"We have to ensure that language learning in pre-school and primary school is effective, for that is where key attitudes towards languages and cultures are formed."
"The new lifelong learning programme will offer a wide range of funding possibilities for projects promoting language awareness, for access to language learning resources, as well as for networks contributing to the development of language policies."
"For the first time the education and training programme has, as a specific objective, the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity."
"For the first time also, a transversal action will support multilateral projects and networks in that field."
"These are new opportunities open to all the languages spoken in the European Union."
"Let me now say a few words on the European indicator for language competence."
"That was one of the subjects in another recent communication from the Commission."
"The first meeting of the advisory board took place just two weeks ago, at the end of October."
"The experts attending the meeting, representing 22 countries, showed much interest and consensus on taking forward the establishment of that indicator."
"I am pleased to note that the report by Mr Joan i Marí recognises the Commission's efforts to promote language learning and linguistic diversity in the European Union."
"The report contains a thorough analysis of our framework strategy to create a multilingual society and acknowledges our commitment to achieving the objectives stated in our communication."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for his inspiring report, and would stress that the Commission is determined to pursue the ideas and actions set out in this new strategy for multilingualism in our Union."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the debates on multilingualism and on the protection of regional and minority languages and the use of languages in the European institutions always lead people to adopt firm positions, which are sustained by underlying political conflicts."
"This own initiative report, which, let us remember, is aimed at implementing a new framework strategy for multilingualism, has the virtue of extending the debate that was already begun with the Ebner and Bayona report in 2003 and the Portas report in 2005, on regional and minority languages and on the learning of languages by immigrants."
"Parliament is thus called upon to confirm its previous positions or to amend them in view of the changing situation, for fear of contradicting itself."
"We tried hard, during the course of our work, to strike a balance that was acceptable to all parties, as was reflected by the outcome of the votes in committee, and, in doing so, we took account of the acquis, and also put the issue of multilingualism into perspective."
"I therefore call on my fellow Members to act wisely and not to fight the wrong battle."
"Languages must be the link between the citizens of Europe, not the weapon used to create divisions and to sow discord."
"My country, Luxembourg, is the only Member State, the only founder country, whose national language is not recognised as an official European language."
"Yet, the government of Luxembourg has decided not to request official language status, as it believes that multilingualism is our future."
"We were given language and intelligence in order to listen to each other, not to fight each other."
"Sixty-five years ago, on 10 October 1941, the people of Luxembourg had to take part in a referendum organised by the Nazi occupiers, for which they were asked to specify their race, ethnicity and language."
"Their response to the three questions was: Luxemburgish."
"As punishment, they were forced to enrol in the occupying army and deported to the concentration camps."
"The fact remains that, after the war, the generation of victims accepted the fact that German, together with French, was the main language taught at school."
"Luxemburgish has successfully developed and is doing well."
"As for our future, I hope that Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which requires the Union to respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity, protects us from any arbitrariness."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased that a framework strategy has been put in place for multilingualism in the European Union."
"Our motto, 'United in diversity' is a testament to the importance of the diversity of cultures, of customs, of beliefs and also of languages, to the construction of the Union."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights has made respect for linguistic diversity one of our fundamental values."
"This principle does not just apply to the official languages, but also to the many regional and minority languages spoken within the Union, including those of immigrant communities."
"This rich co-existence of different linguistic communities in Europe sometimes leads to extreme difficulties within the day-to-day working practices of the Community institutions."
"Despite the fact that all languages are of equal importance from a cultural point of view, it makes no sense to take the view that the European Union's institutions could operate if it were using all of them at the same level."
"I believe that progress on the promotion, defence and knowledge of this linguistic diversity must be supported by the Member States by means of active policies for promoting and defending languages in education and in the more social realm, including in the media, and the promotion of the learning of at least two foreign languages, with a view to facilitating knowledge of other cultures, promoting mobility and increasing awareness amongst the European citizens."
"Finally, within the Community institutions, it must be possible for communication between the citizens and the Union to be carried out in their mother tongues."
"Furthermore, in order to make the use of mother tongues compatible with the day-to-day work of the institutions, we must establish different uses for the different languages and it is in this area that we must work towards agreeing on the basic criteria to use in order to reach a consensus on these working languages, without forgetting any element, either cultural, the number of speakers or the status of the languages in their respective States."
"I hope that the new Commissioner responsible for multilingualism, Mr Leonard Orban, agrees with this idea and will work in that direction."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome the Commission's first communication dealing with multilingualism and setting major objectives for the European Union's linguistic diversity: to promote language learning and a beneficial multilingual economy, as well as to provide all EU nationals with the opportunity to familiarise with the Community laws and other information in their mother tongue."
"Today, the European Union represents 450 million people from various ethnic, cultural and linguistic backgrounds."
"Therefore, the benefits of foreign language knowledge are obvious."
"Language helps to understand different lifestyles and opens a door to cultural tolerance."
"Moreover, language competence helps in work, study, travel and communication anywhere in the world."
"Foreign language learning should start at a very early age, when the human brain is most receptive to taking in new information."
"This is my firm opinion as a medical doctor."
"Thus far, various surveys show that almost half of respondents admit to knowing only their native language."
"Thus, we have a long-term objective that cannot be postponed."
"At least 84% of Europeans agree that each EU national should know at least one foreign language."
"Consequently, we have great support from the society, the importance of which is increasingly acknowledged when adopting laws in the European Union."
"On the other hand, we must not forget the old European languages, of which my native Lithuanian language is one of the oldest."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of preserving such languages in the context of European linguistic diversity."
"We should not only learn foreign languages, but also keep in mind another challenge - preserving and cherishing the old European languages by legally ensuring their rights."
"I see the multilingual European as an educated person, who is able to live in a country other than his or her native land and who speaks foreign languages for professional reasons, and is willing to undertake further study."
"Sadly, quite a large part of the European society still fails to benefit from multilingualism, and the motivation of citizens to learn foreign languages is not very strong."
"We should promote that by any and all available means."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to use my one minute of speaking time to express my full and explicit support for the report presented by Mr Joan i Marí."
"If the Union wants to be true to its slogan 'United in diversity', it must give multilingualism pride of place, going beyond just the official languages."
"Just as protecting biodiversity is and must be a central value in our current societies, the protection of linguistic diversity must be seen as a central element of progress, the promotion of peace and development."
"Given that many of today's armed conflicts are the results of violations of cultural rights, linguistic rights and identities, it is urgent that we look upon promoting multilingualism as a tool for promoting dialogue, understanding and peace."
"Though this is important in the world in general, it is particularly important in a European Union which aspires one day to move on from being a Union of values to being a political Union."
"Promoting multilingualism in Europe therefore means wealth and progress."
"Opting for monolingualism, however, will make us poorer."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. -"
"(The speaker spoke Irish)"
"I want to thank Mr Joan i Marí for the work he has undertaken."
"I hope that the adoption of the amendments he has put forward can provide a basis for a meaningful EU language policy."
"As the rapporteur has said, we need to improve language skills and to maintain the whole range of European languages."
"Colleagues may be aware that Dublin will host an important conference on 24 November, entitled 'The Legacy of the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and the Future of Lesser-Used Languages in the EU'."
"It is important that NGOs such as the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages receive continued funding and that there is project funding for languages as well, particularly languages that are in danger."
"I fully support calls for an EU language plan, for project funding for the most endangered languages, for the Ebner report to be implemented in full, for the EU Ombudsman to have an explicit mandate to act in cases of language-based discrimination, and for a working party to be set up that can work towards giving a legal base to the concept of respect for linguistic diversities."
"I ask colleagues to support the rapporteur's amendments."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the draft resolution on the new framework strategy on multilingualism deserves particular attention, as language is the basis of a nation's culture and a resource that we must make use of."
"That is the reason why we pay close attention to all attempts to interfere in multilingualism in the European Union and react to all attempts to restrict it."
"It is with satisfaction that we accept the initiative to set up a European language competence index, but on condition that this initiative covers all official EU languages, and will not be restricted in undertakings and in studies to five languages only."
"For these reasons, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I tabled an amendment to Article 6 deleting those sections that detract from the idea of multilingualism and which allow the possibility of restricting studies just to five particular languages."
"I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, because otherwise this document which is so important and so essential for multilingualism, will not reflect the full intentions and tendencies that inspire us."
"(ES) Mr President, one year ago, in its first Communication on multilingualism, the European Commission set three entirely reasonable objectives: to promote language learning and linguistic diversity, to promote a multilingual economy, with the resulting improvement in work mobility and the competitiveness of the European economy, and to provide all of the citizens with access to information on the Union in their own languages."
"Everybody is aware of the close relationship between this Communication and the general European objective that we set at the Barcelona Council in 2002 of ensuring that children learn at least two foreign languages in addition to their mother tongue."
"It is precisely this that the report that this Parliament will vote on tomorrow must deal with; offering the 450 million European citizens a wide range of tools to allow them to learn languages and hence to enjoy the immense social, economic and cultural advantages of participating in our great integration project, a project rich in national histories, languages and cultures, which today represents a dream of unity in diversity, benefiting all of the citizens."
"The rapporteur's opportunistic attempt to use the report to make nationalistic proposals in his own personal interest is entirely inappropriate and entirely undermines the purpose of the Communication."
"In this regard, we should welcome the result of the work carried out by the Committee on Culture and Education, which has shown responsibility and good sense by using its amendments to redirect the initial text and its ideologically biased approach."
"The rapporteur's radical intentions are demonstrated by the fact that he has ended up voting against his own report in committee."
"Respect for diversity is one of the Union's principles, but using languages to split up States along ethnic and linguistic lines is an outrage that we in the Group of the European Peoples Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats will always vigorously oppose."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, in the Middle Ages, my home city of Pärnu, like the other Hanseatic cities, traded with Russia, Germany and the Scandinavian countries."
"Every merchant had to know the four local languages."
"I concur with the idea that pervades this report - Europeans should know two other languages in addition to their native tongue."
"Language proficiency considerably accelerated the Estonians' reintegration into Europe after the Soviet occupation."
"The ability to understand one another's language and culture will help Europe's sense of cohesion to overcome problems caused by the expansion of the European Union and by immigration."
"There is an Estonian saying - the more languages, the more lives."
"In the European Union, many people live many lives."
"People go to other Member States either to work temporarily or to live permanently."
"Many of the Member States' significant national minorities became established in the post-World War II era of reconstruction."
"My mother tongue is one of those European languages that are spoken by one million people."
"The report emphasises that small languages must be protected."
"I would like to add that they must be protected not only from the major languages of the European Union, but also from major languages from beyond Europe."
"Here I refer to Russian."
"By offering the motivation to learn in addition to language learning, we would alleviate the problems that have been very clearly identified by second- and third-generation immigrants in Germany, France and the Baltic States."
"They are far from the land of their birth, and they are also unable to participate sufficiently in the culture and life of their new homeland due to their poor linguistic proficiency."
"In such conditions, the costly efforts to enable official business to be conducted in major languages from beyond Europe are counter-productive, even detrimental."
"While language learning is the most important means of integration, it is also time-consuming, and must be embarked on as early as possible."
"(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the new framework strategy for multilingualism, I welcome the conclusions aimed at supporting and respecting linguistic diversity, which is a founding principle of the EU, especially in view of the shortsighted tendency to cut the number of working languages on the foolish grounds of wanting to reduce the amount of money spent on interpreting and translation services."
"Yes, support for multilingualism is an important factor in cultural, economic and social integration, but is not, and has never been, the major factor in solving the social differences and problems that unfortunately continue to exist."
"I should also like to emphasise and lend my backing to the view that in its language policy the EU must adhere strictly to the principle of solidarity, as it should in other areas."
"We cannot allow language policy to become a source of conflict among the EU Member States or the general public, which is indeed a genuine possibility."
". - (LV) I doubt whether adding another 60 languages to the 21 European Union official languages will achieve the goal of true multilingualism espoused by the rapporteur, since it is not possible to give equal weight to the role of the Welsh and the Russian languages."
"Experience shows that languages which are used more widely and in a more economically active way 'devour' small ones."
"Just let us imagine that Russian were to become an EU official language."
"I am almost certain that we would not have long to wait before Latvian and Estonian would no longer be used in general, not only in the European Union, but even in Latvia and Estonia."
"Before we tackle multilingualism throughout Europe, we ought to set an example in Parliament itself."
"How much motivation do interpreters have to learn the languages of small Member States?"
"How long will we have to wait before, when you arrive at Strasbourg, the heart of Europe, the border guard speaks to you in a language other than French?"
"I am convinced that we need to begin by strengthening the official languages of the small EU Member States, leaving minority languages policies to the Member States to deal with."
"In the future, the European Union will continue to be a union of states and not of ethnic groups."
"Thank you."
"(PT) Mr President, leaving aside a number of proposed amendments, which I shall be voting against tomorrow, this report in its current form broadly enshrines appropriate principles, which have been acquired over the years, and in particular since 2000, which was named European Year of Languages."
"Yet the application of some of these principles is dependent on what the subsidiarity rule will allow."
"Whilst it is true that everyone has the right to their mother tongue, it remains true that in practical terms applying this principle to the letter, over and above the official languages, would hamper the entire running of the Union's institutions."
"Moreover, we must prevent the use of what are referred to as minority languages for the purposes of nationalist extremism."
"The issue of extending the European indicator of language competence is also addressed."
"In its current form, it is only for measuring competence in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian."
"This system must not mislead us into fostering the widespread learning only of these five languages."
"I say this not only on the grounds of the necessary balance and legitimacy but also because the projection of European languages outside Europe is a highly important factor in an era of globalisation, not to mention the historical, human and cultural dimensions of these languages."
"The Portuguese language - and you will appreciate why I give this example - is, of all the EU languages, the third most widely spoken around the world behind English and Spanish, and ahead of German, French and Italian. Consequently, as in Written Statement 58, to which I was a signatory, I welcome the principle introduced in this report of ensuring that the European indicator of linguistic competence covers all of the Union's official languages, and, should it prove feasible, all the remaining languages spoken in Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Joan i Marí, on his report and its contents."
"I am very much in favour of supporting multilingualism and, in particular, the lesser-used languages."
"I will not speak in my native language, Irish, this evening."
"However, at the beginning of next year, in two part-sessions from now, I will be able to do that with the support of Parliament's services."
"I welcome that and look forward to it."
"It gives meaning to the phrase 'unity in diversity', which has been used so much here this evening."
"The lesser-used languages of Europe are as important, if not more so, than those which are widely spoken because we must support and strengthen them."
"That is why I believe we can look forward to unity and cooperation through a common strengthening of our languages."
"I would like to express my thanks for this discussion in support of multilingualism in European institutions, an issue that is significant both for individual countries and for our Community as well."
"There are several important principles that always define what we are."
"As part of our culture, languages are not only a technical instrument, but are also important bearers of our heritage, and as a cultural phenomenon they deserve respect and recognition."
"This is a very important responsibility of the Member States in particular."
"Therefore, it is essential to take a proactive approach to the teaching and use of languages."
"Through the programme, the European Commission has created opportunities for the continued support of multilingualism, including minority or regional languages."
"The European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages (EBLUL) has been a partner, offering opportunities for other activities within the framework of the new programme."
"The same applies to the language research network, MERCATOR."
"Let me remind you that the first piece of secondary EU legislation adopted in 1958 concerned languages."
"This was just the beginning, and it is extremely important that languages play their crucial role at this stage of European integration as well, a role that is not only political, but also cultural and, of course, economic and social as well."
"In conclusion, it gives me great pleasure to observe that I am to be the first Commissioner in the history of the EU to be responsible for multilingualism as a separate policy and that shortly, subject to your consent, the entire sector will become autonomous, in collaboration, of course, with other sectors."
"Moreover, another colleague, the designated Commissioner from Romania, Mr Leonard Orban, will be joining us."
"He can be of help not only in promoting this policy but also in ensuring a strong commitment to the development of multilingualism."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(FR) There was a time when all humankind spoke one language and used the same words."
"However, according to the biblical account of the Tower of Babel, people tried to build a tower that could reach the sky and put them on an equal footing with God."
"To thwart this plan, God multiplied the number of languages so that people would no longer understand each other and would disperse across the Earth."
"With this report on multilingualism, Europe is implementing an 'anti-Tower of Babel' project, insofar as it intends to promote and develop minority languages."
"In order to gauge the importance of multilingualism, we really must understand what it is all about."
"Cultural and linguistic diversity means showing respect for cultural identity, traditions and religions."
"By promoting the integration of a European society in which there are many different types of knowledge, Europe is implicitly acknowledging that language learning is a crucial factor in people's ability to communicate amongst themselves."
"Multilingualism is also an opportunity for the future, and it has become Europe's duty to safeguard it for its citizens."
"Faced with globalisation, which encourages monolingualism, the more linguistic diversity is recognised, the less we will be able to fall back on our identities."
"(PT) Today is a very special day for those European languages, like Portuguese, that are spoken around the world, because the European Parliament is acknowledging the significant role that they play."
"Recitals E and F and paragraph 3, which I proposed, enshrine the major strategic importance that we should attribute to languages like Portuguese within the framework of European multilingual policy, since they have the particular quality of facilitating direct communication with other parts of the world."
"This resolution recognises the fact that Europe cannot close in upon itself, but has to deal with the rest of the world and needs to address its ability to communicate globally."
"Certain languages are invaluable tools for it to do so."
"By recognising the true value of languages like Portuguese that are widely used around the world, the resolution has provided a better balance and greater strategic value."
"It paves the way for demands that the teaching and learning of languages with this potential should be more actively promoted; indeed, they should be promoted as the second, third or fourth languages for people in the EU to learn."
"I am grateful to my fellow Members for their support, to the rapporteur for her openness, and particularly to our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, for her willingness: her help was crucial in completing this initiative so successfully."
"The European Union's Generalised System of Preferences (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the European Union's generalised system of preferences."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I am happy to share with you further reflections on the GSP+ scheme and the philosophy behind it."
"It is an important EU development tool: it contributes to economic progress in developing countries and the reduction of poverty, while taking on board the enduring need for promoting core human and labour rights, as well as sustainable development and governance principles."
"One of the key priorities of EU trade policy is to be consistent with and to consolidate the objectives of development policy, in particular the promotion of sustainable development and good governance."
"This goal has been given greater prominence in the GSP+ scheme, which aims at encouraging developing countries to comply with international standards relating to social rights, environmental protection and governance, including the fight against drugs."
"It is worth recalling that the criteria on which the granting of GSP+ is based are objective and transparent and have been made public in the regulation itself - this is in line with our WTO obligations."
"The success of the GSP+ scheme is that it provides an incentive for the applicant countries to ratify key ILO conventions in order to comply with the criteria of the GSP+."
"It has played an instrumental role in the case of El Salvador, which deposited the ratification instruments of the missing ILO conventions on 6 September 2006."
"The ILO supervisory committees reported that most of the GSP+ applicant countries have made substantial changes to their legal systems in order to comply fully with the rights enshrined in the ILO conventions, which was the precondition for being granted GSP+ trade preferences in the first place."
"The GSP+ system is an instrument of encouragement and support."
"It cannot solve everything at once; its role is to give an incentive, as I say, not to punish, and to maintain the momentum of reform."
"The aim is also to integrate the GSP+ beneficiaries into the world trading system."
"I am convinced that integration into the world trading system will further help these countries to advance towards greater respect for the principles enshrined in the conventions and to lock in essential reforms."
"Following the ratification of these conventions, it is clear that actual implementation then needs to be monitored."
"Progress in the implementation of the GSP+ conditionality is assessed in relation to developments in government policy, to administrative capacity and other institutional, legal and budgetary constraints."
"Some of these can only improve over time."
"Regarding monitoring, the EU relies in its judgments, in particular with regard to the initiation of any withdrawal procedure, on the monitoring procedures and expertise of relevant specialised monitoring bodies, such as the ILO, for which the EU itself cannot be a substitute."
"However, we also have our own role to play in the proper application of the GSP system."
"Therefore, whenever the Commission receives information from trade unions or other stakeholders about serious and systemic systematic violations of relevant international standards, it thoroughly examines whether appropriate action in line with the GSP regulation may be taken."
"This is well coordinated, with relevant monitoring bodies, and Parliament should be regularly updated on developments."
"I would like to stress the important role the European Parliament and parliaments in the relevant countries can play, both in monitoring the situation and in helping to bring forward implementing legislation in the countries concerned and ensuring its effective implementation."
"Let me say to Members of this House: your interparliamentary contacts are very valuable for sending this important message and I am ready to engage in an even closer cooperation with you with a view to this end."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the Generalised System of Preferences has proved its worth, as it actively supports countries in their efforts towards sustainable development and good governance."
"We trade with these countries and also negotiate with them on equal terms."
"We open up our markets to them, which also gives rise to competition - only in the medium term, if need be."
"In other words, it is in our own interests, too, to ensure compliance with the rules and conventions of the United Nations and the International Labour Organization."
"In this respect, we fully support the Commission's endeavours."
"We also ask, however - and the Commissioner has already indicated that he is prepared to do this - that the Commission keep us informed on a regular basis."
"This relates to, firstly, its observations on the implementation of the various regulations in the beneficiary countries, secondly, any sanctions pursuant to Article 16 and, thirdly, a mid-term review of the effectiveness of the GSP+ rules."
"GSP+ should put us in a position to provide support whilst also benefiting from trade with these countries."
"At the same time, we should take account of the legitimate interests of our economy and labour market and strike a balance between these two objectives."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with Commissioner Mandelson's statement and, as rapporteur for the report on the generalised system of preferences, I would also stress the importance of GSP+ as an incentive to commit the more vulnerable countries to sustainable development and good governance."
"I take a positive view of the Commission's decision of 21 December to grant benefits to fifteen countries that requested it and the steps taken subsequently by countries such as Colombia, Venezuela and El Salvador, ratifying important ILO conventions."
"With regard to the functioning of the system, I would like to mention three fundamental issues."
"Firstly, the aim of GSP+ is to promote, amongst other things, human and labour rights through trade."
"This association is essential and must not be squandered."
"Trade must provide an incentive in terms of human and labour rights. We must ensure that protectionist tendencies do not undermine this aim."
"Secondly, in order to ensure that the system is successful, the number of benefiting countries must be increased."
"One of the Commission's priorities must be to ensure that that number increases significantly, since those countries currently represent just 3% of the world population."
"Thirdly, the effectiveness of the system must be guaranteed, by ensuring that it is applied intelligently, with the participation of the European Parliament."
"It is important that the Commission cooperate with the benefiting countries in their efforts to meet their commitments, by means of various initiatives and, in particular, by strengthening the rigorous and regular control and assessment of their implementation, transparently and with the participation of the main social actors and benefiting countries, as stated in Parliament's report."
"Furthermore, the sanctions provided for must be applied in the event of serious and systematic violations of the principles. Those violating them must be punished, but not operators who are fulfilling their commitments properly."
"Finally, as the motion for a resolution reiterates, the Commission, before the next review of the Regulation, must carry out a study to assess the impact of the system, to analyse its operation and to lay the foundations for the reforms carried out."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the GSP scheme was designed to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the world trade their way out of poverty."
"There is not a fixed list of countries that fit into that category."
"Where the GSP is a success, a country may graduate to a new relationship with the EU."
"However, not all movement is upward: some countries, through circumstances entirely beyond their control, may now be in a worse position than when the scheme was renewed."
"Pakistan is such a country."
"Despite the backing of this House, Pakistan was denied GSP+ status by the Council, at a cost of 300 000 jobs and GBP 40 million a year."
"Tragically, less than six months after the GSP scheme came into force, Pakistan and much of Pakistan-administered Kashmir was devastated by an earthquake that the World Health Organisation claims eclipsed the tsunami in terms of destruction and human suffering."
"The major impact of the earthquake in the north-east of the region caused large-scale displacement of Pakistan's skilled and unskilled labour force."
"They have traditionally provided a significant part of the workforce for the whole of Pakistani industry, notably in textiles."
"Many were left homeless, without spouses and with children to care for."
"Over one year later, they have been unable to return to paid work because they have been waiting for financial grants to rebuild their homes."
"As a result industrial wages have increased, driving up the cost of production and dramatically effecting Pakistan's competitiveness."
"Whilst the EU is always very generous in terms of the aid we offer to those countries in need, our pockets are not bottomless."
"We must revise the GPS in order to make sure that we not only help the poor trade their way out of poverty, but also help the hopeless trade their way out of the rubble of disaster."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, in order to be credible and genuinely effective, we have to demonstrate that the GSP+ scheme is working properly."
"In other words, the EU must act swiftly and decisively when there are infringements of the social or environmental standards in question."
"This is not merely a theoretical or academic discussion, but a very real discussion about real countries."
"The case of El Salvador has already been raised."
"In fact, El Salvadorian workers have for years seen incredible resistance by their own Government, company owners and the right-wing media to try to avoid, or at least delay, the implementation of core labour conventions, and it is very unfortunate that an EU Member State, Spain, has seemingly supported them in that attempt."
"However, the fact that the El Salvadorian Government has recently ratified four key ILO conventions is not the real victory it might seem, because by reforming its civil service laws the Government has actually succeeded in removing large numbers of workers from any possible benefits of those ILO conventions."
"That is totally unacceptable, and I therefore formally ask the Commission to initiate without delay an investigation into the situation in El Salvador and to consider a temporary withdrawal of GSP preferences."
"I would be happy to furnish the Commissioner with further details from the trade union groups and civil societies in El Salvador."
"Colombia is another case of blatant violation of workers' rights, despite the window dressing of official enshrinement of ILO conventions."
"The monthly and often weekly reports of trade union members 'disappearing' and being killed tell the true story of the blood toll paid by those who dare to assume that ILO rights officially adopted in theory will actually be respected in practice."
"We cannot wait until December 2008 before we review these cases."
"I ask the Commission to review them now."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, the Generalised System of Preferences, GSP+, is a good system that grants privileges to countries in the developing world in respect of their access to European markets, which is an enormously positive thing."
"There, are, however, a number of strings attached."
"It is right for Commissioner Mandelson to say that these countries should first and foremost be given encouragement and support."
"Nonetheless, situations can arise where it is not enough to provide encouragement and support and where, in addition, there is a real need to tighten up on monitoring and perhaps use the tools available if the conditions in the conventions on workers' rights, and the like, are not met."
"We know that infringements are taking place today, and we therefore want the Commission to tighten up monitoring and, where necessary, use the tools available to temporarily suspend offending countries."
"When such steps are taken, we would further desire the involvement of Parliament in the process, so that we can give our views and work together in order to make the system work."
"This must happen now."
"As many other speakers have pointed out, it is also important to carefully review a few points before we evaluate the system in 2008, namely: has the system worked in every respect, what shortcomings does it have and what do we need to consider when we renew the system?"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting the Council regulation of 27 June 2005 reforming the system of preferences that has been in force since 1971, the European Union has chosen to simplify and enhance its principal trade instrument for supporting developing countries."
"Thus, three systems shall apply from now on: the general system, the Everything but Arms system - which is a tool adapted to the specific characteristics of the least-advanced countries - and, lastly, the GSP+."
"The additional preferences granted under this last heading arose out of the firm belief that development can be considered only in close conjunction with the democratic process and with respect for human rights, labour law and the environment."
"Fifteen countries are currently benefiting from this mechanism, which both encourages and rewards those developing countries that are most vulnerable and that make the most efforts in these areas."
"However, if the GSP+ is to genuinely contribute to better governance and to greater respect for the environment, human rights and employment, it must be managed effectively, and that means, firstly, warning countries that are not fulfilling their commitments - of which there are still many - and, above all, making routine threats so as to effectively do away with the preferences granted to those who seriously and systematically violate the ILO conventions and who do not honour their commitments."
"Next, it is vital that a regular assessment be carried out to ensure that every country benefiting from the GSP+ is honouring its commitments."
"The assessment must be particularly exhaustive with a view to the renewal of this instrument at the end of 2008."
"Our credibility and the effectiveness of this instrument depend on what legal experts call the principle of congruent forms."
"These preferences cannot continue being granted to countries that are politically incapable of fulfilling these commitments."
"The same goes for the future of this policy."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I shall try to save you some money by making three points."
"First of all the Commissioner certainly agrees that we need to maintain high standards of surveillance and invigilation and we intend to do so."
"We have done so in the case of Belarus and have submitted proposals to the Council accordingly."
"As regards Pakistan, granting privileges in trade requires us to keep within the rules that create those privileges and that is what we are doing and what we have done in respect of Pakistan, but I entirely accept the honourable Member's view that we must do everything we can within those rules to give assistance to Pakistan."
"As far as El Salvador is concerned, yes, I entirely accept that having granted GSP+ status, we must now monitor, on the basis of reports of international bodies, the effective implementation of the two ILO Conventions in El Salvador, and it is our clear intention to do so."
"In accordance with Rule 103(2), I have received six motions for resolutions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.30 a.m."
"Agenda for next part session: see Minutes"

"Services in the internal market (debate)"
"The first item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council common position for adopting a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on services in the internal market (10003/4/2006 C6-0270/2006 2004/0001 (COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Gebhardt)."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today reaching the end of a debate that has been going on in this House for more than two years, on the subject of the services directive."
"I believe that we can be entirely happy with, and proud of, the work we have done on this issue."
"I am not, of course, the only one to have worked on this matter. Many of my fellow Members have played their parts in ensuring a constructive collaboration."
"Allow me to just name a few people I would like to thank as a way of thanking all those who ensured such a positive collaboration."
"Thus, I would like to thank my colleagues Mr Goebbels, Mr Swoboda, Mrs van Lancker and Mrs McCarthy, as well as Mrs Thyssen from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Jonckheer and Mrs Rühle from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and Mrs Jäätteenmäki from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"All of them have made great contributions to our success."
"There is, however, one person I would like to single out, and that is the shadow rapporteur from the PPE-DE Group, Mr Harbour."
"(Applause)"
"I would also like to express thanks on behalf of Mr Schulz, who asked me quite specifically to do this yesterday evening, for the constructive cooperation he has experienced, as it was neither easy to create a common text, given the differences of opinion that are represented in this House, capable of achieving a broad consensus and without leading to divisions between Parliament and the citizens of the European Union, nor could it be taken for granted that this feat could be accomplished."
"This constructive collaboration can also be seen in the text that we are debating today."
"It led to there being a symbiosis between the interests of employees and consumers and those of the economy."
"We have succeeded, with this text, in making a real contribution towards putting people more in the centre of politics."
"In my opinion, it is essential to our future work in Parliament that we should make it abundantly clear that we are shaping politics around the people, around the citizens of Europe."
"The economy is important, stability is important, but the most important thing of all is the people on whose behalf we make policy."
"With this common text that we have created we have succeeded, through the removal of the country of origin principle, for one thing, in protecting the rights of workers, namely labour law, social law, consumer protection and other important issues relating to rights, and in ensuring that we have a positive regulation."
"It was very important for us to have ensured that the rights of employees were advanced, thereby averting an unhealthy competition between the social systems of the Member States."
"By deleting Articles 24 and 25 we ensured that the services directive does not affect or jeopardise the Posting of Workers Directive, and that we were able to work well together on this area."
"By removing quite significant elements of the services of general interest from the scope of the services directive, we have ensured that a solution was found to a truly enormous problem. This is in the light of the fact that this services directive is in fact, of course, a directive for commercial services, a fact which means that health services and social services, which have totally different requirements due to the special interests involved, do not fit within the scope of the directive."
"We have not, however, merely done something for employees; we have also ensured that there are gains from this services directive for the economy, the service providers."
"We have ensured that the free movement of service providers across borders has been made much easier."
"This we have achieved by means, for example, of having actually codified the principle of the freedom to provide services, of having made it crystal clear that protectionist measures in the Member States must be abolished and that single points of contact are available in order to help service providers to move around the European Union."
"There are still a couple of points that we need to debate in Parliament and they are points that we have already debated."
"I believe that the Commission can provide an important answer to these questions today. Specifically, it can clear up a couple of points that are absolutely fundamental for us, relating, in particular, to labour law, social security entitlements, criminal law and the orientations that the Commission is to provide under the services directive and that the Commission, as far as I am aware, will not be using in order to undertake to provide interpretations of the implementation of the services directive, but rather to ensure that the services directive represents an aid to the Member States."
"Interpretation of the texts is a task for the Court of Justice and not for the Commission."
"The Commission has understood this and that is something we can very happily live with."
"Mr President, I now very eagerly await the statement that the Commission is about to give."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, the vote at second reading on the Services Directive will be a milestone in the history of the European Parliament, not only because of the importance of this Directive for European citizens and businesses, but also because of the leading role Parliament has played in the legislative process."
"It is undeniable that the Services Directive is an essential element in our efforts to boost the European economy and unleash the potential of the internal market for services."
"The text which is now on the table will provide real added value to the internal market, cutting red tape, removing barriers and improving legal certainty for business and consumers."
"It lays solid foundations for a new internal market framework with a positive impact on the freedom of establishment and the creation of new business."
"This is crucial for fostering entrepreneurship and for promoting growth and jobs."
"Service providers can be confident that they are dealing with fair and transparent authorisation regimes and swift and simple procedures."
"They will be able to obtain information and complete administrative formalities through points of single contact in any Member State and, in addition, in electronic form."
"This will simplify, accelerate and reduce the cost for the setting up of new business and obviate the need to deal with different levels of authorities."
"Equally, the Directive will provide a welcome boost to cross-border service provision."
"The new provision on the freedom to provide services, which was at the heart of the compromise in first reading, strikes a fair balance between guaranteeing the rights of service providers to free access and free exercise of a service activity whilst allowing Member States the right to invoke their most essential requirements in certain clearly defined circumstances."
"This will definitively improve legal certainty for service providers and consumers."
"Importantly, the Directive will be underpinned by obligations on Member States to cooperate among and assist each other, in order to ensure that businesses are properly and efficiently supervised across the European Union while avoiding duplication of controls."
"These three elements - simplification of establishment, freedom to provide services and assistance and cooperation between Member States - were always at the core of the Commission's drive to open up the services market."
"The position of the European Parliament has been crucial to finding a broad consensus on these issues."
"In this dossier, the European Parliament has shown its maturity and capacity to find well-balanced compromises on very complex issues."
"At first reading you clearly took the lead and were able to deliver the broad consensus we pursued."
"Getting a consensus in the Council was not easy."
"Some Member States had serious difficulties in accepting your delicate compromise on the scope of application of the proposal and the freedom to provide services mechanism."
"In the end, and after a vigorous defence by the Commission and the Presidency of the compromise reached in Parliament, the common position was adopted."
"It is a common position that respects and reflects Parliament's political compromise, with only minor adjustments introduced mostly to provide greater legal clarity."
"You are aware that the compromise reflected in the common position is very delicate and fragile."
"Attempts to reopen the text will inevitably give rise to a new debate in the Council and put in jeopardy the compromise reached."
"I call on Parliament to recognise that the common position closely reflects Parliament's first reading, and to refrain from seeking further modifications through amendments."
"The vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on 23 October 2006 demonstrates that this is possible."
"At this juncture there are no 'technical' or 'minor' amendments."
"I am aware that in discussions leading up to the vote in the committee, certain institutional and legal issues have been raised which are of concern to some Members of this House."
"In this context, I would like to make the following statements to address the concerns that some of you have raised."
"'Concerning the screening of national requirements which Member States apply to services provided from other Member States, the Council has requested the Commission to provide orientations and analysis and the Commission will use its best efforts to abide with this task."
"This will not give additional powers to the Commission which may, pursuant to the Treaty, if it considers it necessary, formulate recommendations and deliver opinions on matters dealt with in the Treaty."
"The orientations will merely consist of assistance to Member States for the proper implementation of the Services Directive."
"They will neither provide legally binding interpretation of the Directive, which is the prerogative of the European Court of Justice, nor will they amend the provisions of the Services Directive, which is the prerogative of the European Parliament and the Council."
"The Commission will carry out this task in an open and transparent manner in close cooperation with the other institutions."
"It will in particular regularly inform the European Parliament about the results and the follow-up of its analysis."
"Concerning the need to consider further harmonisation, in the future review of the Services Directive, the Commission will assess whether, in the field of services, further measures are necessary and, if so, what kind of measures are appropriate."
"The Commission will, in particular, examine whether for certain services or certain issues there is a need for additional harmonisation."
"The Commission will thereby take suggestions made by the European Parliament, in particular at the first reading of the Directive, into consideration."
"Where necessary, and in line with our Better Regulation approach, the Commission will make specific proposals, including proposals for harmonisation, where justified."
"Concerning the impact of the Services Directive on labour law, the European Parliament and the Council wanted to avoid that the Services Directive affects labour law or the rights of the social partners to defend their collective interests."
"The Commission wants to state unambiguously that the Services Directive does indeed not affect labour law laid down in national legislation and established practices in the Member States and that it does not affect collective rights which the social partners enjoy according to national legislation and established practices."
"The Services Directive is neutral as to the different models in the Member States regarding the role of the social partners and the organisation of how collective interests are defended according to national law and practices."
"However, Community law, and in particular the Treaty, continue to apply in this field."
"Concerning the impact of the Services Directive on criminal law, as is stated in the text, the Services Directive will not affect Member States' criminal law rules."
"This means that in general Member States will be able to apply their criminal law rules not only to service providers established on their territory but also to service providers from other Member States providing services within their territory."
"This is because criminal law rules, in general, apply to everybody in the same way, irrespective of whether a service is provided."
"However, Member States may not circumvent or prevent the application of the provisions of the Services Directive by making use of criminal law."
"Concerning the impact of the Services Directive on Social Services, social services relating to social housing, childcare and support of families and persons in need are a manifestation of the principle of social cohesion and solidarity in society and are provided by the State, by service providers on behalf of the State or by acknowledged charitable organisations."
"These services have thus been excluded from the scope of application of the Services Directive."
"It is clear that this exclusion also covers services provided by churches and church organisations which serve charitable and benevolent purposes.'"
"I have arranged for the text of these statements to be handed in to the secretariat for inclusion in the record of this part-session."
"I hope that these statements help to accommodate the concerns raised by some."
"The Commission hopes that they will facilitate the acceptance of the common position by Parliament."
"Before concluding, I note that Mrs McCarthy has tabled three amendments on behalf of her committee relating to the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny."
"These amendments result from the agreement reached between the three institutions last summer on the revision of the comitology procedure and can be accepted by the Commission."
"Next week it will be two years since this Commission entered office and I became Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services."
"The debate on the Services Directive has been at the forefront of attention for much of that time."
"I think we should now move to adopting the Directive and start implementing it."
"I look forward to hearing the view of this House."
"(Applause)"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, Mr Gebhardt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as earlier speakers have already said, today we are making internal market history."
"For almost three years the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been engaged in painstaking, ambitious work on the Services Directive."
"To be perfectly frank, the work has not always been easy and progress has sometimes been slow."
"We can take comfort in the fact that there is a stronger feeling of consensus here in the House today than ever before during the drafting process."
"The directive represents a major European reform."
"No wonder, then, that there have been numerous obstacles along the road to the agreement."
"There have been genuine differences of opinion on its content as well as the occasional slight misunderstandings."
"Although today we all want to look to the future, I would nevertheless like to raise one or two matters that arose during the drafting process."
"Firstly, I wish to remind everyone of the vote in Parliament last spring, the result of which might be seen as a historic compromise."
"Parliament managed to arrive at a compromise, in what was a very challenging political situation, which enabled the proposal for a directive to move on to a subsequent and successful drafting stage."
"In this connection, I would like once again to thank the European Parliament for this compromise, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, the Chairman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mrs McCarthy, the shadow rapporteurs and numerous other Members who have worked so hard to find common solutions."
"Six presidencies of the Council have been involved in the difficult task of drafting the directive."
"For Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency now, the situation at present is at once a welcome and demanding challenge."
"The Finnish Presidency has been able to take advantage of the results achieved by former presidencies, especially the Austrian Presidency."
"The Council's common position since last spring has given the Presidency a strong mandate to take this matter forward."
"A lot of work also went into the Council's adoption of its common position and it involved a considerable amount of flexibility and a genuine desire for compromise."
"I also especially appreciate the fact that the European Parliament has shown sensitivity in the matter of a common decision here too and the added value which comes with that."
"The Commission's role in the drafting process has also been crucial."
"When the debate in Parliament and in the Council has been at its most vehement, the Commission has, in accordance with its fundamental role, endeavoured to use constructive arguments to take the drafting process in a sustainable direction."
"Commissioner McCreevy today mentioned some delicate issues in the directive, on which the Commission has been required to adopt a position."
"Speaking on behalf of the Presidency, I fully support and acknowledge the Commissioner's message, and the need for a declaration and its content."
"The Commissioner's personal role during the complex drafting process was exemplary in terms of its objectivity and the way it respected the opinions of both institutions."
"One result of this lengthy drafting process is that the proposal for a directive has now in many ways changed during the debate."
"The common objective and intention to develop the internal market has nevertheless remained unchanged."
"The directive will open a number of doors, both to service providers and, at the same time, the receivers of services, be they consumers or businesses."
"The Services Directive does not, however, represent an end to the development of the internal market in services."
"On the contrary, the directive is a unique step forward in the development of the internal market in viable services."
"It has become clear over the last few years that provisions in the Treaty are not enough by themselves to regulate with absolute clarity the internal market in services, which is the real heart of the Union."
"I believe that the Services Directive will provide market actors with just the sort of legal security that they have been waiting for for so long."
"This is the directive's greatest added value."
"The Finnish Presidency of the Council warmly welcomes the fact that today only some of the amendments are to be voted on."
"Of these I would like to mention the three amendments relating to comitology introduced in the plenary debate."
"I can confirm the Council's acceptance of these, and in this respect the Council is able to amend its common position."
"With regard to the other amendments, I hope that the common position will remain unchanged."
"Mr President, I hope that Parliament will take a final and definite decision on the Services Directive today in the plenary part-session."
"Then the objective regarding the agreement shared by both institutions, the European Parliament and the Council, would be realised at second reading."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, it is my belief that, with the official statement from the Commission, the last legal uncertainties in relation to particular aspects such as, inter alia, labour law and social security legislation, have been cleared up."
"I now therefore feel able to recommend to the House that it should adopt the Common Position as presented to us by the Council of Ministers without making any amendments, excepting of course the three amendments relating to the comitology procedure on which we have agreed among ourselves."
"I think that we, in this House, have performed very well, and I would like, once again, to thank the Commission and the Presidency of the Council for having accepted our text almost unaltered."
"There is one more point I would like to make, however, and it is one that is just a little unpleasant. I would like to recommend to the present and to future Presidencies of the Council that they should desist from the sort of behaviour we have seen from them thus far."
"It is not acceptable for the Presidency to constantly repeat during a second reading that it is not possible to discuss the issue further and for it not to accept amendments that Parliament wants because a fragile compromise has been achieved in Council."
"A similarly fragile compromise was brokered in this House too, and it is important to ensure that the rights of Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission are given full expression in the course of codecision."
"For this reason, the way things have come to pass on this occasion cannot serve as a template for future legislative processes."
"I have accepted it this time because 90% of Parliament's text was adopted and because we in this House did not suffer any great losses. This will not always be the case, however."
"When that happens, the Council must not say 'no' and insist that no more discussion is possible on this issue."
"That is not constructive cooperation and I truly hope that this will be an isolated example and that, in future, we will again be able to enjoy normal cooperation in the codecision process."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, this is an important day for European citizens."
"I emphasise that because sometimes when we talk about concepts like the internal market we forget that we are engaging people at the heart of what goes on and in our political work here."
"This directive is about improving the standard of living of all citizens in the European Union and encouraging growth and dynamism in the economy."
"It is as fundamental as that."
"What is so important about this directive - and sometimes we perhaps forget this during our big debates - is that it has actually been the result of painstaking work by the Commission, to whom I would like to pay tribute."
"It addresses the deep frustrations that businesses, particularly small enterprises, have faced in exercising their rights under the single market."
"That is what this directive is all about."
"It is extremely detailed in its provisions."
"It has directed at the Member States no less than 40 specific measures to take down barriers and 65 provisions to improve their procedures."
"Now it is up to the Member States."
"It is they that are going to have to deliver and we are going to be keeping an eye on them to make sure they do deliver."
"I particularly want to single out the fact that for the first time we have a specific requirement on Member States to promote the single market in relation to their businesses, to encourage businesses to take advantage of the single market in the services sector and go out and trade crossborder."
"The single market is a shared project of all of us."
"It is not decided here, it is actually decided out there in the Member States."
"We can do our best and this directive is a major step forward in achieving that."
"A notable thing about this directive is that it has been good politics."
"Why do I say that?"
"Because it has been the product of a lot of constructive and detailed argument: long debates and votes in committee, because different sides want to reinforce their position, negotiation and compromise."
"It has been good politics, and at the heart of it has been Mrs Gebhardt."
"She was generous enough to pay tribute to me and I want to say to her that it has been a pleasure to work with her."
"It has been a challenge, sometimes, because she has been a very determined leader in pushing this forward, but I think that what we have done together will be good for European citizens."
"However, it is not just we who worked on this, but all the members of our committee, and others as well."
"I particularly want to thank my own team on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, many of whom will be speaking shortly, but we also worked very closely with our Liberal colleagues, particularly in the crucial vote that the Presidency was kind enough to mention earlier on."
"They will speak in more detail now."
"I want to conclude with my thanks to the Federation of Small Businesses in the United Kingdom and say two things to the House today about the importance of this directive."
"The first one is that small and medium enterprises represent nearly 90% of the services sector."
"They are crucial to this proposal."
"Secondly, if every small business in Europe created one more job, we would have dealt with the problem of unemployment in the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, naturally, I should like to thank Mrs Gebhardt on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - and particularly Mr Goebbels, who unfortunately cannot be here today."
"As rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt has steered the ship of the Services Directive skilfully through many stormy waters."
"I should also like to thank my fellow Members from the other political groups, however, particularly the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Although, of course, our differences of sociopolitical view remain, I believe that we have fulfilled our responsibility to present a tangible solution that is acceptable to the European public."
"I am particularly obliged to Commissioner McCreevy, without whom this process could not have been structured so well, and to the Council Presidencies - particularly the Finnish, but also the Austrian Council Presidency. I would ask the Council to bear in mind that the Austrian Presidency created a precedent when it invited us MEPs to a Council meeting."
"This should not remain an isolated case; the possibility should definitely be left open in other contexts, too."
"I also wish to thank the European Trade Union Confederation for holding such intensive consultations with us and also making it possible to arrive at a compromise on this."
"I was born at the point where the former East and West met - between Vienna and Bratislava - and so I am aware of the fears, but also the hopes, associated with an internal market for services."
"If nationalism and protectionism are now gaining ground once more in many of the transition countries, and also many of the 'old' EU Member States, one of the reasons may be that people are overwhelmed by the speed, sometimes even the brutality, at which this internal market is being established."
"That is why it was so important to find a way to establish this internal market - which is needed - whilst also doing justice to social considerations."
"After all, politics at EU level consists not only in removing the obstacles to an internal market - that is part of the story - but also in creating the political framework conditions for rendering this internal market acceptable to the people."
"For these reasons, my group will give the Directive its wholehearted support."
"Naturally, we have some reservations - which will be presented later - but, on the whole, my group supports this good compromise that has been reached."
"We should have the courage to endorse this compromise today and champion it externally."
"Once again, sincere thanks to Mrs Gebhardt."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I wish to thank my colleagues Malcolm Harbour and Evelyne Gebhardt, and many others, for their excellent levels of cooperation."
"In particular I want to thank Commissioner McCreevy, as, without his rational approach to cooperation, there would certainly have been no progress."
"Services are a crucial source of growth and jobs in the EU."
"During the period 1997-2002 approximately 96% of new jobs were in service sectors."
"It is therefore important that there should be no unnecessary barriers to growth at national level."
"The Services Directive is a step in the right direction."
"I know that there are people in this House who are dissatisfied, because they think that we have not gone far enough, but there are also those who believe that Parliament and the Council took too great a leap."
"This proposal now before us is a compromise; it is what it was possible to accomplish given the situation."
"The European Parliament has been accused of nibbling away at the Commission's original proposal."
"At the same time, however, nobody has bothered to mention the large number of areas to which the directive still applies."
"The Services Directive covers such sectors as the construction industry, business services, fitting and installation, trade and distribution, and travel and leisure services."
"The spectrum is very wide."
"The purpose of this proposal is thus to liberalise services, thereby reducing their cost."
"The demand for various services relies on price, but confidence is just as important."
"If a service provider does things on time and well, confidence grows and so, then, does the market."
"It is not the directive that will determine that: the responsibility lies with the service provider."
"The free mobility of the workforce is just as important as the Services Directive for a viable EU internal market."
"At the time of enlargement to the east, only Sweden, Ireland and the United Kingdom allowed free and immediate access to their job markets to nationals of the new Member States."
"Now that a new round of enlargement is to take place, once again there are Member States which are erecting barriers."
"These new potential barriers are very troublesome, and cause problems for the liberalisation of the internal market."
"They are a step backwards."
"If we are to take a step forwards with the Services Directive, it is to be hoped that progress will be made in the same way as regards the free mobility of labour."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gebhardt, we are disappointed at the refusal of the three largest groups, the majority of this House, to conduct a proper second reading of the Services Directive today."
"Mrs Gebhardt fought to the very end, but this makes it all the harder for us to understand how she can describe as a great triumph for Parliament an outcome she recently said contained some points that were legally imprecise and unclear."
"Admittedly, the Council put us under great pressure by stating from the outset that any amendment of its text would result in the failure of the whole Directive - but this was the same Council that stated at its first reading that it had followed Parliament's text virtually in its entirety."
"Sadly, however, it had not followed our text in its entirety, and a lack of clarity has crept into some points, mainly on issues surrounding social Europe."
"This lack of clarity relates to the definition and exclusion of services in general and services of general economic interest in particular."
"It relates specifically to the exclusion of social services, and it relates to the recognition of the collective agreements negotiated by the social partners."
"These are not trifling matters; they are the fundamental issues that were used by the opponents of the Constitution to obtain a 'no' vote in the French referendum."
"We could have taken the Council at its word when it emphasised time and again after the referendums that the new version of the Services Directive would fully respect social rights."
"Sadly, however, this is not the case."
"It makes a difference whether I give the example of social services or content myself with an incomplete list, which leaves large gaps in the case of some Member States and thus ends up having to be decided by the European Court of Justice."
"It is incomprehensible how this could be accepted in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"After all, the rapporteur for this committee, Mrs Rudi Ubeda, who is incidentally a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, stated in her report on social services that these services differed greatly between Member States and that, consequently, a definition was needed."
"How is it possible to exclude in a way consistent with legal certainty a sector that is not properly defined?"
"Sadly, however, the committee paid no further attention to this issue, but instead merely reaffirmed its reluctance to cause the Council any problems."
"Consequently, in its haste to show obedience, it dispensed with its traditional right to conduct a proper second reading of the Services Directive."
"This is certainly no triumph for Parliament; on the contrary, it is a defeat - one that we shall regret for a long time to come."
"Even the Commission statement does not change this."
"At best, it is binding on the present Commission, but it is not legally binding, since the interpretation of the law rests with the Court of Justice - as Commissioner McCreevy has reaffirmed today."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, in Parliament's relations with the Council, we are familiar with codecision and conciliation."
"Today, with the Services Directive, we can add capitulation to that."
"What other word is there for the incredible decision taken by the majority groups to yield to the Council's urgings by agreeing to withdraw all the amendments examined in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and to adopt the Council's common position without opposition, even though it is indubitably a backward step from their own compromise of 16 February this year?"
"I would remind you that the European Trade Union Confederation felt it necessary to amend this text on certain points that it regarded as being 'of major importance', notably with regard to the 'clearer exclusion of labour law and social services, and clearer respect for fundamental rights'."
"In fact, the Council's text makes the preservation of labour law in the Member States subordinate to compliance with Community law - a vague wording that refers to the rules on competition."
"Some of you are consoling yourselves with Commissioner McCreevy's reassuring statement."
"This really is very odd reasoning."
"Dare I remind you that it was in fact Mr McCreevy who, just a year ago, used Community law to justify preventing a Latvian business from recognising collective agreements in Sweden, in the Waxholm affair that caused such a stir?"
"On the other hand, the Council has restored to the Commission an incredible level of power to monitor - both before and after the fact - the legislation of the Member States; it was precisely this power that Parliament wanted to restrict."
"Mr McCreevy sees this change as a crucial improvement, and that is perfectly understandable, but what does Parliament see in it?"
"Nobody is saying anything."
"Finally, the ambiguities and grey areas in the text of the directive - which I criticised at first reading on behalf of my group because, as I said at the time, they leave the door open for uncontrollable interpretation from the Commission and the Court - have already started to be exploited as we feared they would be."
"For example, the Commission's communication on social services sets out an extremely simplistic vision of these services, which, by the way, Commissioner Špidla was keen to stress would increasingly fall within the scope of Community law on the internal market and competition."
"Another Commission communication, dealing with the posting of workers, attacks regulations in certain Member States with respect to service providers from other EU countries that it regards as disproportionate."
"Here, too, the Commission is leaning on the inexhaustible case-law of the Court."
"Where, then, are the safeguards that the directive was supposed to provide against this slippery slope leading the whole of social life into anything-goes competition?"
"In general, the President-in-Office put it very clearly: 'the Court's interpretation will be needed in many cases'."
"Well, my group will not support this massive deregulation exercise."
"Above and beyond the issue of services, there is, in my view, the issue of the concept of European integration."
"Do we want to use the law to harmonise protective rules and push them upwards, or are we going to accept the harmonisation through the market and competition of standards that will consequently inevitably be dragged downwards?"
"Do we want to promote parliamentary and citizens' democracy, or are we going to allow ourselves to be governed by case-law and interpretative communications?"
"A few weeks away from the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, these are perfectly legitimate questions, and I am willing to bet that many of our fellow citizens will soon be asking them quite forcefully."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the services sector is responsible for almost 70% of the European Union's GDP and is the main source of economic growth."
"There are, however, thousands of administrative obstacles to the development of this sector."
"The main aim of the Services Directive is to cut this red tape, which would then facilitate the provision of cross-border services on the markets of the 25 Member States."
"The European Commission has identified over 90 obstacles which service providers, such as mechanics, accountants and IT specialists, have to overcome in order to carry out their activities in another Member State."
"As a rule, these difficulties are deliberately created by countries which fear competition from entrepreneurs from other states and want to protect their own markets at any price."
"This is usually at the cost of the consumer, who is offered services that are more expensive and of lower quality."
"Even in its watered down form, the Services Directive is a step in the right direction along the long and tortuous road of making the European economy competitive and making life simpler, especially for small businesses."
"The years ahead will show whether it will, as Commissioner McCreevy claims will be the case, become a milestone in terms of removing the obstacles to the provision of services on the internal market."
"We will only know the outcome when the Member States integrate the Directive into national law in a way which really will minimise these obstacles, which are incompatible with the principle of the free provision of services enshrined in the Treaty, and which are damaging to European consumers and entrepreneurs."
"The European Commission should play a significant role in this matter and should act as a guardian to ensure compliance with the Treaties and with European legislation."
"Fortunately, we have managed to avoid further corruption of the Services Directive by rejecting, at the sitting of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, all the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt."
"Further watering down the Services Directive, which was ratified by the Council and is a difficult compromise anyway, would not only be harmful for the free services market, but could also result in the entire project being scrapped and in three years of hard work being wasted."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, what Parliament is endorsing today is a directive for lawyers and judges."
"It is the judges in Luxembourg who will determine what has been decided."
"The rules are very unclear."
"I tried in vain to remove the worst of the imprecision by means of three unambiguous amendments."
"1."
"The Member States shall be able to require compliance with local agreements by all parties delivering services."
"2."
"The Member States shall be able to decide for themselves which services are to be performed under the public aegis, and what is to be decided by the market."
"3."
"The Member States shall also be able to levy VAT and taxes on services delivered from abroad."
"These are three important questions to which I have not received clear answers."
"The June Movement is in favour of there being a common market for services too, and we welcome, in particular, workers and companies from the new Member States, but Danish rates of pay must apply."
"Competition must not be on the basis of lower pay, more relaxed working conditions or lower rates of VAT and taxes."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nine months after it was adopted at first reading, the European Parliament is tying up the Services Directive, known as the Bolkestein directive, by approving the Council's common position with no amendments."
"This is a victory for social democracy, won over to economic ultraliberalism."
"With the exception of non-commercial services of general interest, nothing escapes the liberalisation of services: even social services are not completely excluded from the Gebhardt report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you are deceiving the people."
"This directive will not put an end to social, fiscal and wage dumping."
"Clever, dishonest service providers will continue to exploit national legislation, and to use the weak points in the directive by relying on the sectoral directives."
"For example, more than 100 000 construction workers are posted in France on temporary contracts, most of them undeclared."
"There is lawful social dumping going on with regard to responsibility, because posted workers remain part of the social security system in their countries of origin."
"In such cases, labour law is being flouted legally."
"Finally, we are opposed to the mechanisms to assess national restrictions on the cross-border provision of services, as they represent an unacceptable monitoring of the Member States by the Commission, and an excessive level of Community bureaucracy."
"That is why we will vote against the Gebhardt report."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have managed to turn a proposal that was far too horizontal in scope, far too radical in its drive to deregulate and unrealistic in its enforcement, into a directive that does exactly what it is supposed to do, namely remove obstacles to businesses that wish to establish abroad and to service providers to enable them to carry out cross-border activities, and thus enable everyone, including SMEs, to avail themselves of their fundamental rights under the Treaty."
"Despite the very different starting positions, not only between, but also within, the groups, clearly also between the Member States, and despite many widespread misconceptions about the content and repercussions of the proposal, we managed to produce a balanced and justifiable end product, partly by listening carefully to each other, to the people and by working together in a constructive manner."
"Economically and socially, we are providing a better opening of the internal market for the benefit of services, for more growth and for jobs without affecting consumer and other social protection."
"Institutionally, we have proved that European democracy works and that Parliament is taking its responsibilities seriously."
"Legally, even if the wording leaves something to be desired, we certainly look to add value by affording more legal certainty."
"I therefore hope that we will maintain this course when we vote and that we will manage to back the common position by a very broad majority, for it is, after all, a good reflection of the compromise that we ourselves hammered out."
"I too should like to express my appreciation for all those who, during the course of those two past few years, have managed to work together, not only those with political responsibility in the three institutions, but also the staff."
"Mr President, today, as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am immensely proud of the work and commitment of both our rapporteur and the members of the committee in enabling Europe to finally give the go-ahead to open up the market in services."
"It was the MEPs and Parliament who found the compromise to save the services law from national deadlock and paralysis in Council."
"In the British press, surprisingly, Parliament has been praised for coalescing as 'a serious and effective institution'."
"The article goes on to say that the key to the services law's success has been forged here in Strasbourg."
"I agree with the journalist who says that it is time to pay more attention to the European Parliament."
"I want to thank the Council and the Commission for paying attention to Parliament's right of regulatory scrutiny in the new procedures and accepting our three amendments."
"This has been the single most controversial but also the most important piece of legislation in the EU."
"Despite our ideological and national differences, we MEPs have managed to find a way to open up the market, to boost jobs and growth and give our citizens the trust and confidence to use and access those services across Europe."
"The law has been controversial in cutting red tape and bureaucracy for business, but we need to ensure high quality standards and choice for consumers, while safeguarding employees' conditions and health and safety."
"Parliament listened to people's concerns and fears, so that the freedom to provide services is not the freedom to undermine consumer or employee rights."
"Each Member State must now ensure free access to its territory and it must be equally clear that the right to maintain national rules, to protect public policy, public health, security or the environment, must not mean that legitimate protection turns into negative protectionism."
"It must be justifiable and proportionate and must not discriminate against other operators."
"Let us look to the future."
"The litmus test will be whether we can deliver and open up the market for businesses and give the benefits to our consumers."
"We cannot shout about the benefits if we do not deliver."
"Our work is not yet done."
"We must continue to work together as three institutions to make good on our commitment to deliver."
"Certainly I, as Chair of the Internal Market Committee, stand ready to make good on our commitment to assist the Commission and the Council in making sure we respect the rights of consumers and employees and deliver for business across Europe."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached a historical moment, because we in this House, as a political body, have taken a decision of our own about one of the basic freedoms."
"We will leave the rest for the European Court of Justice to deal with, because last night, we were anxious - this is with reference to gambling - about tackling the really dirty work."
"We will get the judges of the European Court of Justice, who are not elected, to do this instead."
"I am pleased that now, at long last, the politicians, the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe, have taken a decision about the free movement of services."
"I am particularly indebted to Mrs Gebhardt for ensuring that her group has not tabled any amendments."
"I have also noticed that the atmosphere, now that the compromise is on the table, has improved a great deal because this issue was the source of much tension."
"In my view, however, this is not about the tension between Poland and France, between the Netherlands and the Baltic States or whatever."
"This is about Europe, China and India."
"We, as Europeans, must therefore, keep the momentum going where the different peoples are involved."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Pekkarinen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make two comments."
"I would like to emphasise the fact that the eight amendments tabled by our group were adopted by Parliament at first reading by an adequate majority, which clearly demonstrates that the Council's common position does not fully reflect Parliament's text."
"The second comment I would like to make is this: before we start waxing lyrical about the historic importance of this directive, it would be worth exercising some caution."
"I would remind you that this directive will be transposed by all Member States by 2009 at the latest, and that the Commission's initial assessment report will not be presented to the European Parliament until 2010."
"That, therefore, is when we will see what impact this text really has in the various Member States, at the end of the assessment procedure laid down in Article 39 of the directive."
"I would call on those who are promising us a brighter future and talking about millions of new jobs to be cautious: we must not make the people of Europe promises that we might not be able to keep."
"I would like to conclude with a few words on the general philosophy that underlies this proposal: our group supported the free provision of services, and in particular of cross-border services."
"At the same time, however, we have always stressed that we must have every guarantee with regard to working conditions and the prohibition of illegal labour, and that these conditions must be respected throughout the territory of the EU."
"From this point of view, Mr McCreevy, I welcome your statement, but in political terms it only commits the current Commission - and in 2010, there will be a different Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the word go, the Services Directive has been the project of those wanting to see capitalism without any social safeguards prevail in Europe."
"The Directive will goad liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation and also wage and social dumping on an unprecedented scale."
"Companies will be pleased, but for the majority of people it will be a disaster."
"In spite of all the protests and all the opposition, Parliament is to pass this Directive today, and those who stand to gain from it owe particular thanks to those in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament who have done their best to throw dust in people's eyes with lies and deceit."
"The compromise due to be adopted today is not one that keeps alive the remains of a social Europe."
"It is a neoliberal hammer designed to obliterate all social aspects."
"Those who support it have to do so with their eyes open."
"We shall continue to oppose this neoliberal onslaught."
". - (LV) It is customary to believe that new laws improve, reinforce and otherwise contribute to the success of the European Union's activities."
"Such is not the case with the draft directive to be debated today."
"The previous European Commission based the draft directive on the state of origin principle - a principle which the European Court of Justice has developed and which has been consolidated in the case law of international private law."
"The current Commission rushed to place the draft directive, based on the state of origin principle, within the principles of European Union strategic documents, including the Lisbon Strategy."
"This key to the opening of the European services market, however, broke off in Parliament's hands."
"The state of origin principle has disappeared from the directive's text, and the wording of the provisions of its Article 16 resembles the mutual recognition principle - a principle which in practice may prove to be too subjective and unwieldy to open up the services market."
"Today the European Parliament will delegate to the Member States full responsibility to decide whether, when and how the European Union's services market will develop."
"We can only hope that this will, in fact, occur."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the referendum in France, the UMP swore that the Bolkestein directive had been withdrawn, and the socialists said that it had been consigned to the dustbin of history."
"Not only did both parties lie, but they are now making things worse for themselves in at least four respects."
"Firstly, there is the country of origin principle."
"We are giving free rein to the Court of Justice, which is the inventor of this concept in its judgments in the 'Cassis de Dijon' and 'Säger' cases."
"We can hardly imagine that it is going to sacrifice its own creation."
"The second point relates to the protection of employees."
"Labour law, which is a national competence, is being made subordinate to compliance with Community law, with no treaty and no ratification."
"How far are we prepared to go in substituting commercial law for labour law?"
"Thirdly, there is the issue of monitoring service providers."
"We are putting the Member States in an untenable position by preventing them from exercising any control."
"What can they possibly know about the working conditions in a Polish company that they know nothing about?"
"My fourth point relates to the services covered."
"The scope of the directive has once again been extended, and will now affect some 6 000 occupations, and perhaps even more, given how ambiguous the text is."
"In conclusion, I think that, in this compromise that was wanted by all 25 Member States, the Court and the Commission are gaining an enormous amount of power to complete the internal market, without worrying about the social dumping that is crushing our workers and will continue to aggravate unemployment."
"The people have been deceived on the accession of Turkey and duped on the VAT affair, their rejection of a super-State has been scorned, and now they have been betrayed on the Bolkestein directive."
"Quite frankly, how many of us are now able to look the electorate in the eye?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not least in the light of the widespread interests of the system of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those of Padania, we feel that the aims - in relation to the Commission's original project, which was already just as dangerous - of imposing one regulation on all of the Member States of the European Union are still very dangerous, because they lead to cut-throat competition in the services sector, which, let us remember, represents 70% of the GDP produced within the European Union."
"It is reasonable to wonder whether, on such a sensitive issue as this, the remarks made by civil society have really been heard and taken on board, and whether the dangers of social and economic dumping have actually been eliminated from this new, sugar-coated version of the Bolkestein Directive."
"Unfortunately, everywhere you look these days, unscrupulous entrepreneurs are competing unfairly, to the detriment of the system of small and medium-sized enterprises, which, unlike these entrepreneurs, work fully within the law."
"This is the outcome of liberalisation, which both the Commission and the European Court of Justice wanted."
"We are against this bureaucratic centralism of the European Union."
"(HU) Mr President, along with many other MEPs from the new Member States, I did not vote for the Services Directive at first reading last year."
"At this vote, however, I will support it."
"At that time, I did not support it because I wished to send a warning that in the newly unified Europe it is not permissible to disregard the interests of new Member States when passing important new legislation."
"That warning has served its purpose."
"Indeed, that is what helped Council to make progress for instance in the much-debated areas of criminal and labour law that hampered free provision of services."
"I should like to underline that the new text requires each Member State to review those of its current statutes that prevent the free provision of services."
"All these are steps in the right direction."
"In the proceedings since the first reading, the involvement of the new Member States and of MEPs was more actively sought."
"I am confident that the end of the often difficult and bitter debate about the Services Directive will help the Union leave behind that period of crisis, add new impetus to the internal market and give a chance to small and medium-sized enterprises to create more jobs and contribute to the faster economic growth of the Union."
"Yet we also need to learn from this process."
"We have to work harder to restore the trust between old and new Member States."
"To that end, there must be a stop to the scaremongering that the new members' cheaper labour and services will threaten the social model of the older ones."
"This is unfounded, and is a betrayal of the principle of free competition that forms the basis of the Union's economy."
"The new members opened their markets for goods and capital long ago, and that was not always easy to do."
"Now it is the turn of the old members to open their markets to services."
"The Service Directive that is about to be born is a step forward."
"We would have preferred to take a bigger step, but everyone gave up something."
"Now the Services Directive has to meet the tests of practicality and of the European Court of Justice."
"I wish it a lot of success in both."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the hard work and determination of our rapporteur Mrs Gebhardt, and thanks to the mobilisation of the European trades union movement, at first reading Parliament removed the main dangers from the initial version of the Services Directive, the version put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein."
"In particular, Parliament managed to remove from the directive all social services, including social housing, healthcare, audiovisual services, transport and temporary employment agencies."
"Likewise, the directive on the posting of workers and labour law could not be affected, thus removing the main dangers of social dumping, and the country of origin principle was also deleted."
"Nevertheless, two major problems remained: firstly, not all services of general economic interest were removed from the scope, due to opposition from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe; secondly, the new version of Article 16, whilst removing the country of origin principle, was not clear in establishing the country of destination principle."
"These problems have not been solved in the Council's common position, which, although it has indeed incorporated the essence of the conclusions from Parliament's first reading, has taken a backward step on several other points, in particular social services and labour law, as the European Trade Union Confederation has underlined."
"Everyone has acknowledged the need for clarification of these points, and of others, such as the effects on criminal law, the direction taken by the Commission's guidelines and the need for future harmonisation, and you have made a statement to that effect, Commissioner."
"It would, however, have been more logical, given that the codecision procedure has not been completed, to adopt amendments to clarify these elements within the articles themselves."
"Unfortunately, I note that the PPE has neutralised the second reading by rejecting all the amendments proposed by the rapporteur during the debate in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"In a way, this group has deprived the European Parliament of its right of amendment, and I find that deplorable."
"The French Socialist delegation has therefore tabled a number of amendments, because it feels that the compromise is not satisfactory in its current state, and that it leaves the door open to too many uncertainties with regard to the Court's interpretation."
"I think that, when it comes to distinguishing between liberalisation, on the one hand, and social and fundamental rights, on the other, the role of the legislature is to clarify, and not to leave the door open for case-law."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago the founding fathers were already considering the possibility of having the freedom to provide services throughout Europe, in order to create the internal market."
"In the service sector, which makes up a major proportion not only of our economy, but also of our employment and our competitiveness, a revamping and revision were not only logical, but essential."
"I should like to make two comments."
"The first is political in nature, and is that the Bolkestein proposal, which was presented by an old Commissioner to an old Parliament, was unacceptable, and many of us here fought against it."
"Today, following the huge amount of work that has been achieved, we are a very long way away from the Bolkestein proposal."
"My second comment relates to the background: this text reaffirms the principle of the free movement of services, whilst maintaining the prospect of further harmonisation within the Union."
"I am delighted that the current draft incorporates 90% of Parliament's requirements, by excluding from its scope non-economic services of general interest, certain social services and healthcare services."
"To conclude, I would like to stress that the examination of this text has been an excellent example of the democratic exercise of Parliament's powers and has allowed it - whatever the view of the extreme right and left of the House may be - to demonstrate its maturity."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that Parliament has done a huge amount of work on this directive and that this text bears very little relation to the directive proposed by the Commission two years ago."
"However, as we have just heard in this House, the fact that the European Council changed a number of important sentences after first reading means that the second reading does not go far enough, which is a pity."
"Thus employees, our fellow citizens and consumers no longer really see the need for a directive on services."
"It is difficult for them to understand today that liberalisation is taking place without there being anything precise on social services and health services."
"There is still too much vagueness, too many grey areas, in this compromise proposed by the Commission and the European Council."
"(NL) Mr President, Parliament is about to vote on the European Services Directive, probably for the last time."
"It seems like a fait accompli because the largest groups have already given me to believe that they intend to support the compromise and not table any amendments."
"They seem to think the directive in its current form is so perfect that they are prepared to waive their democratic right to submit proposals for improvement."
"My group is less enthusiastic."
"The Services Directive continues to form a threat to the quality of the services and the achievements of workers across Europe."
"The text remains unclear and open to different interpretations."
"In addition, improvements made at previous reading are now at risk of being undermined by, for example, the fact that the Posting of Workers Directive is being cut down to the bone."
"For this reason, my group will be voting against the Gebhardt report."
"Mr President, I have been told by some people that this is one directive that UKIP can vote for."
"It is about free markets."
"It is about helping small companies trade across national boundaries."
"It is going to be good for business."
"Well, we have been here before, haven't we?"
"Because we joined a common market that led to a single market, and what has the result of all that been?"
"Well, it has been regulation, cost and missed opportunities overseas."
"Just last month, there was a poll of a thousand British businesses."
"Sixty per cent of them said that they want the UK to renegotiate our relationship with the European Union to a simple free trade agreement and no more than that."
"But this was not just a cry from a few Poujadists."
"I will quote Michael Spencer, the Chief Executive of ICAP and recently voted the most powerful man in the City of London, who said that people in business are fed up with the volume of costly regulation the EU is producing."
"In the City, people are becoming more and more sceptical about the value we are getting from it all."
"It is clear that British business now recognises that the cost of directive upon directive upon directive produced by institutions like this is now having a negative effect."
"The single market is not fit for the 21st century global economy and I believe that it will be British business that leads us out of it."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, if this directive on services is adopted in its current form, which is a poor compromise, we might cynically observe that we have at least partially complied with the Treaty of Rome."
"Given that the Treaty was signed almost 50 years ago, this is a rather meagre result."
"It is an indictment of politicians that, in the discussions on the directive, fear of international competition and fear over what are referred to as social standards prevailed over visions of a Union prospering from the free movement of people and services."
"It is also an indictment of politicians that they have forgotten that competition is one of the instruments of economic development and that social standards are the fruits, and not the seeds, of prosperity."
"I firmly believe that by removing one of the pillars of the directive, the country of origin principle, a populist and indeed cowardly move, we have thrown away any chance of decisively improving the citizens' standard of living."
"We have thrown away the chances of improving the provision of services, of cutting prices and of creating new jobs."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will, on this occasion, be devoted to a short assessment and a few tributes."
"The European Parliament has joined forces in order to draw up the directive on the internal market in services."
"It bears its hallmark."
"This is a victory for the European Parliament, a victory over European moroseness, a victory over fixed ideas, a victory for the European model, which is all about balance: the balance between necessary reforms and the preservation of the acquis that bring us together."
"The directive actually opens up the internal market in services and makes it compulsory for the Member States to do away with any obstacles to the free provision of services."
"This is a major prospect in terms of growth and employment for all."
"At the same time, the directive preserves existing Community laws, does not permit any breach of social rights, rules out the liberalisation of public services and takes account of the public interest."
"This compromise - as I can testify, insofar as I have followed its development since summer 2004 - stems from the proposals made by my political group and from the agreements concluded within the group between what, at the outset, were differing national and ideological positions."
"The statement that Mr Szájer made just now testifies to this."
"This directive has its origins in dialogue, which is the very substance of our parliamentary life."
"That is why I should like to begin by thanking not only our principal overseer, Mr Harbour, but also Mrs Thyssen, with whom I worked hand in hand, Mr Karas, Mr Szájer and Mrs Handzlik, Mrs Gebhardt, who has mastered the matter from start to finish and who has been so kind as to take me, the inexperienced MEP that I am, into consideration, and Mrs McCarthy and Mr Whitehead, whom I should certainly not like to forget."
"Outside Parliament, my thanks go to Mr McCreevy, who has fulfilled his promises to Parliament since the start, and also to Mr Bartenstein, who has played a decisive role."
"I did nonetheless hear some incredible remarks made just now. Ladies and gentlemen, it is better to let well alone."
"The common position represents 95% of our text."
"Mr President, would we really be exercising our power if we entered into a conciliation procedure, which we know will result in our having no directive?"
"The role of Parliament, our right, is, on the contrary, to shoulder our responsibilities."
"That is why the French members of the UMP are going to vote in favour of the common position, by choosing what is truly important."
"(FI) Mr President, two years ago I voiced my concern in this House that in some countries the debate on the Services Directive has also brought to the surface feelings of xenophobia and a call for economic protectionism, neither of which are a credit to this Community."
"The Prime Minister of Luxembourg recently wondered why we are now more afraid of people coming from the east than of the missiles that were in position there 20 years ago."
"We have nevertheless achieved a compromise, through discussion, and one with which we can live, since this directive will finally open up the market in services, albeit only partially."
"This directive appears to protect highly educated professionals and exposes less well educated professional groups to competition."
"Doctors and pharmacists remain outside its scope, but carpenters and hairdressers are included in it."
"Fear and prejudice, however, will be dispelled with time, because practice will eventually overcome theory."
"Furthermore, in the future the directive will obviously be made more workable and open as far as all the citizens of Europe are concerned."
"We need to learn that we on this continent cannot successfully compete with other continents if we do not even have the courage to compete amongst ourselves."
"- (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to welcome Mrs Gebhardt, who has drafted this elaborate document."
"Some of us have proclaimed it a great achievement that we were able to reach a compromise."
"I partially agree with this."
"Nevertheless, I think that our objective has yet to be achieved."
"Our objective is to liberate the market, since its potential is crucial to the economic growth of the Community and to job creation."
"Today it is stagnant."
"The proposed directive may boost the emergence of new services by laying the legal foundations."
"The good thing is that the directive's second part clearly defines the actions that may not be directed against service providers."
"However, I do not agree with the decision to reduce the type of activities list to such a great extent, as the target countries are still given the opportunity to create barriers to service provision."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberation of the services market presents an opportunity for choice."
"Therefore, we must ensure that high-quality services at competitive prices are available throughout the Community."
"The Services Directive should guarantee that."
"However, this one does not yet do that."
"Mr President, I recognise that this compromise is something of an improvement on the Commission's original proposal."
"I also recognise that it is necessary and desirable to remove the remaining barriers to the cross-border provision of commercial services."
"However, I believe that we should, in the process, provide legal certainty - and I mean 'certainty' - to providers of essential public services and, more importantly, provide reassurances to the many citizens who depend strongly upon locally-provided social services."
"Verbal assurances given in good faith, I fully accept, are not what will be used by judges in the event of court challenges in the future."
"It is the text of a directive that will be important."
"That is why I have signed a number of amendments, such as Amendment 31, which make it absolutely clear that it would be Member States who define services of general interest in their territory."
"I would ask colleagues to accept that this is a reasonable amendment and should be adopted, amongst others."
"Mr President, I believe that the Services Directive is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will adopt in this Parliament."
"I should like to congratulate Commissioner McCreevy, Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour for all their work."
"It is definitely a step in the right direction."
"The directive will make Europe more competitive and thereby create jobs and give better value to its citizens."
"People are saying that we are pulling the wool over the eyes of our citizens."
"On the contrary: if we do not make changes in our economy, as we are doing today, then we really will be pulling the wool over the eyes of our citizens."
"Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that we are living in a globalised world and Europe must become more competitive if it is to compete on a global scale."
"About 50% of all world trade is now in emerging economies and if we want to compete with them and hold on to the European social model, we need a vibrant economy to invest in the sort of services that we feel are important for the citizens of Europe."
"This directive is a step in the right direction; it is the sort of reform we must make at a European level if we want to hold on to the values that we believe are right for our citizens."
"I very much welcome this directive."
"(SV) Mr President, the Council's common position is a victory for reason."
"Competition within the services sector will be intensified, at the same time as the national independence of the Member States is respected."
"That is a good compromise."
"The June List is opposed to national protectionism, bureaucracy and the remnants of the guild system in Europe."
"Such restrictions impede competition, development and growth within the services sector."
"The June List welcomes the fact that the Council, in common with Parliament, chose to reject the country of origin principle."
"It would certainly have facilitated increased competition within some services sectors, but the disadvantages were out of all proportion."
"The country of origin principle would have forced the Member States to give up national self-determination in some of the most important areas of social life."
"It is self-evident that the laws, rules and traditions that apply within a country have come about through a due democratic process and must be observed by all who operate in its territory."
"The June List welcomes, then, the Council's common position on the Services Directive."
"Mr President, the abandonment of the country of origin principle and the reduction in the services covered, particularly the omission of social services and non-economic services, makes this directive a more palatable proposition than when it was last debated."
"However, I retain some concerns, not least the rush to timetable harmonisation of national legislation on the provision of services, with its inevitable avalanche of regulation and the fear that insecure jobs will result from foreign service providers paying low minimum wages, thus creating worse conditions in host nations, particularly if they are allowed to have temporary status and then escape national host controls."
"On one specific point, I welcome the fact that gambling activities will be outside the ambit of this directive."
"Their inclusion would have fed the growth of that destructive industry and added to the misery and social instability which it so often spawns."
"- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year began with demonstrations against the Directive, and is ending with a triumph for parliamentarianism."
"We have not stood in each other's way, we have not allowed ourselves to be used; instead, most of us have surpassed ourselves and taken on responsibility for the European public."
"This European law is a triumph for Parliament and for dialogue, and should encourage all parliaments."
"We are legislators, not governments."
"We have shown leadership and cut the Gordian knot."
"Long may this continue."
"Freedom to provide services is a fundamental right; today's decision represents an important step in dealing with this freedom."
"This decision has also dispelled many prejudices about the EU."
"First of all, the Directive is a triumph for the European system of social market economy, in which the market is not played off against social security."
"We must realise the four freedoms consistently but, equally, we should involve the public to an increasing degree."
"Secondly, we have held dialogue with the social partners."
"We have made ourselves part of the negotiations in the Council."
"In this connection, I am obliged to Minister Bartenstein and Chancellor Schüssel for taking our side."
"This has enabled us to achieve more market, a stronger internal market, and also growth and employment, and to ensure social security."
"I should also like to thank all my fellow Members, however, especially those who refused from the outset to support efforts to achieve a qualified majority at first reading, because a compromise is always harder to champion than an individual position."
"We have simplified many things, provided legal certainty and presented a model of parliamentary work to the public."
"(Applause from the right)"
"(ES) Mr President, I think the speeches so far have made the position quite clear: a large majority of this Parliament is going to vote in favour of the text adopted, and there is therefore no reason to fear that the proposal for a directive will be rejected."
"It will not therefore be necessary to go to a conciliation procedure."
"This is thanks not only to the great work by Mrs Gebhardt, but also to the great work by Commissioner McCreevy."
"I would like to congratulate both of them very warmly."
"I would like to thank Commissioner McCreevy for his statement on behalf of the Commission on the exceptions for employment, social and criminal law, which, as he has said, were necessary because they are laid down in Union law, but which also clarify the situation."
"Despite what some sceptics have said, this represents great progress."
"For example, we cannot say, as some Members have done, that we cannot look to our electors."
"On the contrary."
"On the contrary, my electors are delighted that Parliament has played this role at this time."
"Neither can we criticise the excess of legislation."
"Without legislation, society cannot be organised."
"Those of us with knowledge of what is happening in the developing world, for example - where countries have no legislation - know that legislation is necessary."
"Through the legislation that we have adopted, Parliament, the Commission and the Council are going to provide European society with a system of freedom, in the provision of services, which, at the same time, is going to safeguard the high level of working, social and also environmental conditions that we have at the moment."
"I believe that the three institutions have made a great effort."
"The amendments that are going to be approved in the field of comitology were necessary."
"I am also delighted that both the Commission and the Council have taken them up, and we hope that the subsequent development of this Directive, by means of the comitology procedures and by agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, will enable it to be fine-tuned and improved and enable any difficulties that it may present to be cleared up."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I believe that this is a great day for the European Parliament, for the Council, for the Commission and for all of the citizens of the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, the leap taken today by the Brussels grand coalition, largely excluding its members in the new Member States, went nowhere near far enough."
"It was in the right direction, but simply fell short."
"It is true that the establishment of one-stop shops will help to concentrate administrative formalities, at least."
"Another improvement is that small or medium-sized enterprises can no longer be forced to maintain a permanent establishment in another Member State."
"When we celebrate in 2006 the fact that restrictions on foreign service providers have to be justified and national measures against them proportional, however, we are actually celebrating the achievement of something that should have been taken for granted by 1994 at the latest."
"We have forgotten along the way where and why we started work on the Services Directive - we were aiming to kindle palpable momentum for growth and thus provide real momentum for employment."
"The failure follows a familiar pattern."
"Alliances of employers and inter-branch organisations rail against change, against competition and market opening."
"In a way scarcely seen in any other debate, risks have been exaggerated out of all proportion and opportunities played down."
"The organised scaremongering about Eastern European workers has done its worst, and the losers are the unemployed throughout Europe."
"Even the Commission has to ask itself why it lacked the courage to defend its protégé against the attacks by demagogues."
"It is now called upon to follow implementation in the Member States attentively, so that new burdens are not imposed on SMEs, in particular, through the national back door."
"- (SK) The directive we have in front of us now only contains a fraction of the original text, as almost all areas, including the main principle of country of origin, have been deleted."
"We have cut out medical and social services and services of general interest, as well as all references to the temporary posting of workers."
"These are to be addressed separately on a sectoral basis."
"However, the question remains as to when and if at all."
"An empty directive may do no harm, but at the same time it can do no good."
"This directive, I would say, is completely useless and does not resolve anything in its current watered-down form."
"The country-of-origin principle means that a small business from Bratislava may apply Slovak law when serving a customer in Vienna."
"However, the host Member State will insist on the application of its own legislation if, for example, it is in the interests of public policy, public safety, health protection, environmental protection, etc. This wording of the directive leaves the application of the original principle to the discretion of officials."
"It has been proven that the old Member States benefit from cheap and high-quality labour from the ten new Member States, and our nurses, au-pairs or IT experts have proved their worth."
"However, they are afraid that a nurse providing her services as a small business would generate too much competition and are disguising ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not repeat one by one the thanks Mr Toubon expressed to all MEPs, but they echo my sentiments."
"I believe, as Mr Karas said, that we have seen a great convergence of the positions of all MEPs, and that MEPs have played a positive part in helping to allay the fears on the part of the countries of origin."
"The fact that they have been allayed is at least partly attributable to the opening up of a path towards the completion of the internal market for services."
"These negotiations, on which Parliament exerted particular influence, also demanded a great deal of our staff and, as has already been pointed out, Parliament showed itself to be influential and a driving force, but at the same time conciliatory as an institution."
"Mr Harbour, our shadow rapporteur, described this as a good day for European citizens."
"It only remains to say that the path of reality that this Framework Directive brings to European citizens has yet to be trodden, and the Member States must tread it carefully and constructively, as the Directive lays only the foundations for the future completion of the European internal market for services."
"The country of origin principle has become the principle of freedom to provide services."
"The internal market must be completed but, as the Bruegel institute recently made clear, it also needs to be highlighted even more strongly by Member States, civil society actors, and even the Commission and Parliament, including for the purposes of public understanding."
"This represents another great challenge for us."
"Personally, I consider the criticism levelled by some respected Members of this House that too many tasks would be transferred to the European Court of Justice in the course of the follow-up to be rather petty as, in any case, the main responsibility under a framework directive remains with the Member States."
"I address to the Minister, as Council representative, my appeal for the Council to face up to this main responsibility, in particular."
"(HU) Mr President, it is good to be a member of the European Parliament today."
"It is good, because we can report great results."
"It is a great achievement that after the logjam of the Constitution, and before the closing of the fifth phase of EU enlargement, we will have succeeded in creating the free movement of services, likely with a huge majority."
"Do you remember?"
"A year and a half ago, the case of the Polish plumber was the embodiment of a xenophobia that is condemnable in all its forms."
"A year and a half ago, we saw no hope for an agreement between employer and worker, between old and new Member States, between left and right."
"It is an enormous achievement that today MEPs are categorically rejecting discrimination."
"Today discrimination between old and new Member States is gone."
"It is an enormous achievement that we are creating new opportunities for all 476 million inhabitants of the Union."
"It is an enormous achievement that we are creating a legal opportunity for those who at present are compelled to work in the black-market economy."
"And it is a great achievement that workers with rightful grievances have another option than lawsuits that go on for many years before the European Court of Justice in Luxemburg to validate their rights."
"It is an enormous achievement that employers and employees, small and medium-sized enterprises, big businesses as well as consumers will benefit, and come closer to meeting the Lisbon objectives set by us all."
"It is a considerable achievement that Parliament has succeeded in formulating the political message of the Directive, and similarly, that between the two readings many have decided to switch to supporting the proposal after all."
"If Member States transpose the law properly, ten years from now we will be able to look back with pride and say that we did what our country and what Europe demanded. Thank you for your attention, and congratulations to all participants for their contribution."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is impossible to say everything that needs to be said in the space of a minute, so I shall select what is possible."
"Firstly, I am convinced that the adoption of this directive in its current form can help Europe."
"The directive helps to get rid of the dead wood and to overcome obstacles and barriers that have hindered unification of the services market and the initiative of professional service companies, both inside and outside national borders."
"At the same time, however, the directive provides guarantees and enhances the prospect of a structured, Europe-wide market, where freedom of movement is possible not only for competition, crushed as it is by cost competition and the risk of social dumping, but also for good rules and practices, which are aimed at safeguarding inalienable principles and interests, such as those relating to the guarantee of universal services, of general interests - including in areas of economic importance - of business quality objectives, of environmental protection, of safety and of basic social safeguards."
"To conclude, Mr President, I hope that, in future, we will have not just more Europe, but a better Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, let us be honest and say that the Bolkestein Directive was better, as it truly opened up the services market, and that the objections expressed in this House run contrary to the spirit of solidarity in the European Union."
"However, this very difficult compromise clearly is of some value, and is better than having no directive at all."
"That is a fact."
"Are there any causes for concern?"
"Well, to call a spade a spade, the large number of exceptions are a problem."
"I would hesitate to call this a success, and would also refrain from saying that this is a historic moment."
"Let us wait to see what happens in practice."
"These exceptions may create a situation where the ubiquitous Polish plumber becomes an unwelcome guest."
"To conclude, the Devil is not as black as he is painted, and the Polish plumber is not as terrible as has been suggested, even by some Members of this House."
"(PL) Mr President, the Services Directive is not simply a legislative document about services."
"It is not simply a step towards liberalising services making life far easier for European service providers."
"The services directive is, first and foremost, proof."
"Or proof to all Europeans that we can work in common in a united Europe, and that this brings notable benefits for the average citizen."
"It is proof that together, we can achieve important things in the European Union and that, based on our combined experience, it is possible to achieve a widely accepted compromise."
"Work on the Directive has proved that we can overcome divisions along national, party and historical lines and draft a balanced legislative document for the 450 million-strong consumer market which serves the interests of both service providers and consumers."
"I am satisfied with the current proposal for a compromise, although I had expected a greater degree of openness and I had expected the country of origin principle to be retained."
"Many people criticise the Directive for being too liberal, too social."
"However, in my opinion, thanks to the hundreds of hours of work that went into it and the involvement of many people, the Directive has become a compromise legislative document for a united Europe where, whilst opening up and liberalising the services market, we are also ensuring that consumers and service providers obtain an adequate level of protection."
"In the Member States, including Poland, the Directive provides much hope for better job opportunities, which is something that many service providers and consumers have been eagerly waiting for."
"I am convinced that, as representatives of the citizens of Europe, we have done our duty and we can today vote in favour of the Directive with a clear conscience."
"It is an important step towards the integration of the single market, although a lot of work remains to be done in order to open it up completely."
"It is also a milestone which implements the principles set out in the Treaty of Rome, which we have not managed to implement any sooner, and whose 50th anniversary we will be celebrating next year."
"Work on the Services Directive has been particularly important for the new Member States."
"During the first reading, we saw many examples of national selfishness, protectionism and opportunism, but we were also able to work out a common denominator that serves the interests of all the European Member States."
"(NL) Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that I wish, first of all, to extend warm thanks to Mrs Gebhardt and all those of my fellow Members with whom I have worked on this directive for so many months, because thanks to this cooperation, and thanks also, of course, to the mobilisation by the trade unions and NGOs, we now have before us a Services Directive in which labour law, collective labour agreements, social rights and consumer rights are fully respected."
"We should be pleased with this outcome."
"I am also pleased that quite a number of sensitive areas, namely social services, health services and temping agencies, do not fall within the scope of this directive because they, of course, need stricter rules if they are not simply to be at the mercy of the free provision of services."
"I am grateful for the fact that Parliament has closely followed the Council's common position in this."
"Those Members who have said that there are a number of ambiguities in the Council's common position are, of course, right, Mr President-in-Office, and along with a few fellow Members, I would have wanted to eliminate these by means of a number of amendments."
"I still believe that our job as legislator is about producing clear, intelligible legal texts that are not open to interpretation."
"The content of these texts, seeing as it touches upon subjects such as the autonomy of labour law and the definition of excluded social services, is not unimportant, and I share the rapporteur's sense of regret that there was no willingness at all on the part of the Council to put this right with amendments."
"Whilst I do believe that the legal meaning of the Commission's interpretation is limited, I am very grateful to the Commission for its interpretation nevertheless, because I think, Commissioner, that the interpretation has a very strong political meaning - one of commitment by the Commission, about which my fellow Members and I are sure to remind this Commission and its successors."
"It is up to us, therefore, to provide more legal certainty for social and health services in future legislation."
"(NL) Mr President, some people have called this a birthday present to mark the Union's fiftieth anniversary."
"If I were to get that sort of present from my friends, then I think I would look for new friends."
"Whilst I do not want to take anything away from all the work that has been done, I have voted against for the first time, and I am afraid that I now cannot support the compromise either."
"Unfortunately, feelings of fear, conservatism and protectionism have pervaded the whole of this debate."
"This compromise adds little to what is already enshrined in the Treaty."
"This may, in itself, not be a good enough reason to vote against, but what is is the fact that this directive appears to create grounds of justification for exempting public services from the rules of fair competition."
"I find this a very dangerous precedent and moreover - legal clarity was mentioned a moment ago - the definitions used are remarkable for their legal ambiguity."
"The reason why I see this debate as being pervaded by hypocrisy is that when Western Europe bought the Eastern European businesses in the early 90s, there was no discussion whatsoever."
"Mr President, this is an incredible missed opportunity for Europe."
"(EL) Mr President, the directive we are debating today is a success for Europe, a success for development and a success for the workers."
"It is very important that, after a very long period of debate, the right balance has been struck and thus we have, on the one hand, the opening of the services market and the facilitation of investments by eliminating bureaucratic, legal and technical obstacles and, on the other hand, full respect for workers' rights - as the European trades union accepted in February - and, at the same time of course, exemptions for certain particular sectors."
"The OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says in one of its reports that 2.5 million new jobs which will be created thanks to this directive."
"It would be a pity, while safeguarding workers' rights, not to take advantage of this opportunity."
"We would be failing in our duty towards the citizens, especially the workers."
"The Commission's initial proposal gave rise to objections and misunderstandings."
"It is particularly positive that this procedure is closing with very broad agreement in the European Union."
"We have unanimity in the Council and we have an overwhelming majority of members in the European Parliament who support the Council's common position."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the liberals and the socialists have together all arrived at a common approach and this proves that Europe can still dialogue, compose and arrive at solutions needed for the citizens, specially for the most financially and socially weak."
"I think that we should all be very satisfied that the European Parliament had a particularly important role in this successful procedure."
"(MT) Why has the discussion about this directive turned out to be successful?"
"For two reasons, I would say."
"Firstly, we have not treated workers like numbers; rather, we have placed workers' and other people's rights above all other considerations."
"The second reason is that we have removed obstacles to the movement of persons not by playing workers off against each other, but by attempting to make use of this freedom of movement to enhance workers' rights."
"We have not made it easier to offer services on the worst possible conditions, nor have we encouraged workers to do so."
"This vote should send out a strong signal that there should no longer be any exploitation, nor any attempt to exploit foreign workers by offering poorer conditions."
"Nor should workers in a particular country be pressurised, through this stratagem, into accepting poorer conditions."
"Moreover, workers should be given full information about conditions being offered to other workers."
"I should like to thank Mrs Gebhardt, Mr Harbour and also Commissioner McCreevy for the excellent work that has been done."
"(DA) Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor."
"At last, the preparation of the services directive is coming to an end."
"At last we can let out a sigh of relief after more than 12 years of fun and frolics and at last we can look forward to an internal market in services, which may be one that has had a limb cut off, but it is better than nothing."
"I would like to use my brief speaking time to put the spotlight on the problems involved in having an amputee of a directive."
"Gaming was removed from the scope of the directive."
"What happens, however?"
"The Commission, with Mr McCreevy at the fore, is in the process of investigating the pools monopolies of no less than 10 Member States."
"Health services were likewise excluded from the scope of the directive, yet less than a month ago the Commission put forward an ambitious plan relating to patient mobility."
"In other words, the consequences of having a watered down directive are that we get legislation in dribs and drabs rather than getting clear and precise rules relating to services for all the industries and areas of the EU."
"I find this vexatious, but I will nonetheless vote 'yes' today, because if you cannot get what you want you must want what you get."
"(CS) The directive we are adopting today will, I believe, relieve the service industry of the kind of bureaucracy and discrimination that has resulted from the considerable levels of mistrust between countries and from a lack of confidence in national competitiveness."
"The debate has shown how deep the chasms between countries have grown."
"Today we will build a bridge that represents a hard-won compromise following three years of negotiation between Parliament and the Council."
"I believe we should reject the proposals of the Left, which would undermine the foundations of that bridge."
"So many types of service have been dropped from the directive that it appears to have lost all meaning."
"Yet this is not entirely the case, as it will bring fundamental changes to the rules."
"States will have to repeal all discriminatory service industry rules."
"Integrated contact points will be set up, which will oversee all formalities for long-term and temporary provision of services in another state."
"Authorisation must be transparent and accessible to all."
"Refusing permission without grounds for so doing or failing to respond for several months will no longer be possible."
"If the authorities fail to answer within the deadline, permission will be granted automatically."
"Businesses will be saved time and money because they will not be submitting superfluous documents in the original language or certified copies along with translations."
"Nobody will need to obtain insurance in the country of business or to have unrealistic amounts of capital."
"Appropriate documents for authorising businesses at home will be accepted."
"Mandatory information may also be provided electronically."
"It will be prohibited to force businesses to register or set up an office where services will be provided only temporarily."
"Authorities will begin to cooperate across borders in monitoring activities and systems will be interoperable."
"We could have gone further, but this will make a significant contribution to completing the internal market."
"After years of procrastination, a bridge has finally been built across the chasms of European mistrust."
"This bridge will lead to free services without discrimination, to the provision of hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Europeans and to improvements in the quality of services."
"This is, after all, one of the Union's raisons d'être."
"To conclude, I should like to thank the rapporteurs, especially Mr Harbour."
"(Applause from the right)"
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, under the moniker of Bolkestein, or should that be Frankenstein, even the European trade unions protested against the original proposal for a directive inherited from the Prodi Commission."
"Now, after more than two and a half years of negotiating and searching for a compromise, I can raise my hand in favour of the proposal before us, and I am a former trade unionist."
"Mrs Gebhardt, and those who contributed to achieving the final outcome, must take great credit for the fact that an acceptable directive has emerged from the original mess."
"I should like to say that while I am not satisfied, it could have been worse."
"I am pleased to observe, however, that with everyone's good will, this directive will be a success."
"The proposal that we have adopted is not without its faults but in life - and especially so in political life - one cannot have everything."
"My gratitude for the outcome goes to the European Parliament."
"To many dissatisfied Czechs this may seem like window dressing, yet I remain optimistic."
"- (LT) I believe that today Parliament will demonstrate its maturity in moving the Lisbon reforms forward."
"Mrs Gebhardt and Parliament have already done a great deal of work on this Directive since its first reading."
"We still remember assertions in the press that the whole Directive had been turned upside down."
"Sad, but true."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and the Council have shown their respect for Parliament and, therefore, today we have a text which represents the opinion of more than 90% of its Members."
"We must ensure feedback."
"We are the ones responsible to European citizens for the reliability of common decisions and preservation of a true European compromise."
"Parliament will set a good precedent and give a sign of welcome to European businesses and consumers."
"I urge all Members to approve the directive by a 70% vote; it is time to liberate the potential of the sector, which ensures our wellbeing, from a bureaucratic grip and take a firm, even if a small, step forward."
"Mr President, may I start with an observation as a francophone, which is that when Mrs Le Pen of the French extreme right and Mr Wurtz of the French extreme left spoke, they both drew exactly the same conclusions."
"Perhaps they should get married!"
"Today we have cause for celebration, a little bit of sadness and a little bit of hope."
"The reason for celebration is that we have actually got a services directive, which is indeed a step forward."
"I too would like to congratulate both Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour on the work they have done."
"I think it should be called the Gebhardt-Harbour directive."
"I am also happy that the European Parliament played a very strong role in this, and would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency, Mr Pekkarinen, and especially Mrs Satu Mäkinen, who has redefined what a tough Finnish negotiator can be."
"The reason for my sadness is the following."
"I think the atmosphere in which we conducted the debate on the services directive was a little bit poisoned."
"It showed traces of nationalism and protectionism, and a hint of xenophobia, much as Mr Lehtinen has said."
"We talked about the Bolkestein directive and the Polish plumber etc., and at many times were working to reduce the scope of the directive instead of pushing it forward."
"That may be a little sad, because it meant we had lost a little bit of mutual trust."
"Why hope?"
"The reason for hope is that we can live with this directive."
"I think the key is that the Member States can now start implementing the directive and the European Parliament can follow up this implementation."
"I also hope that the European Court of Justice will interpret this directive in a liberal sense."
"I would like to end by saying that we should re-establish the trust there has been between the Member States, and remember that in 1957, 50 years ago, we defined this Union as being based on four freedoms, which are the free movement of services, goods, money and people."
"(Applause from the centre and from the right)"
"(SV) Mr President, I too want to begin by thanking all those involved and, most particularly, the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, who has done an incredibly good job."
"In my one minute's speaking time, I shall concentrate on labour legislation."
"I did think that the wordings from Parliament's first reading were better."
"I thought that the wordings that Mrs Gebhardt tried to get through in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection were better than what we are seeing today."
"I am completely satisfied, however, with what is said about labour legislation, collective agreements and such like, because there is also a statement from the Commission."
"I heard Mr Wurtz mention the Vaxholm case, and I know that lawyers specialising in labour legislation in Sweden were extremely critical of Mr McGreevy in connection with that case."
"I have spoken with the same lawyers today, and they believe that the Commission statement is quite excellent on the subject of labour legislation."
"I share their view and believe that the statement, combined with the report itself, is sound."
"In conclusion, I want to say that these matters are important and that what we have here are Parliament's proposals."
"Parliament has seen all its important points of view taken into account."
"It is therefore easy to vote in favour of the report today."
"(SK) At this moment we are deciding the fate of one of the most important pieces of legislation to come from the European Parliament."
"Together with MEPs from the new Member States, we did not in all political sincerity view the Bolkestein Directive as a 'scarecrow' but rather as a clear opportunity for the enlarged European Union."
"From the very outset of our term in Parliament, we have actively participated in stormy discussions and explained that services market liberalisation is needed in order to create new jobs, increase the rate of growth in the European Union and fulfil our ambition of becoming the dominant player in global competition."
"We have tried to persuade our colleagues that the Polish plumber is not a threat but a benefit to the European internal market."
"The European Parliament has accepted a compromise that partly liberalises the market but retains protection for it in a number of areas."
"Although this is not an ideal solution, one can be content with the fact that the key principle elaborated by the PPE-DE - the freedom to provide services - ensures a balance between a social and a liberal Europe as regards the opening up of the services sector and, at the same time, provides sensible procedures for small and medium businesses, as well as high quality of services and consumer protection."
"I would like to express my appreciation for the work of Mrs Gebhardt, Mr Harbour and all the shadow rapporteurs, and I am pleased that the Commission and Council have accepted the compromise achieved by the European Parliament in the sensitive areas."
"The good news is that the Council's Common Position Paper is similar to the position reached by the European Parliament in the first reading."
"Ladies and gentlemen, through today's historic vote the European Parliament may become the architect of the EU's common market for services."
"I expect the Member States to behave with a similar sense of responsibility and to implement the Services Directive in their national legislation in less than three years."
"I am sure that the Services Directive will be just the right gift to mark the European Union's anniversary."
"(PL) Mr President, today, after two years of difficult negotiations the Services Directive will be finally adopted by the European Parliament."
"It is a good day, not only for the Polish plumber, but also for European consumers and enterprises."
"The service sector accounts for 70% of the European economy."
"That is why it is so vital to open it up to competition and to give companies the opportunity to freely source and provide services throughout the whole of Europe."
"Of course, the compromise reached is by no means ideal and does not meet all of our expectations."
"During the discussion, there were many misunderstandings and ideological disagreements, there was too much propaganda on the subject of social dumping and too little thought was given to the interest of Europe as a whole."
"Rational fear of competition from other Member States has also meant that rational arguments and elements of economic logic were not given sufficient consideration."
"Meanwhile, the liberalisation of the services market will result in growth in GDP of all the Member States and is a powerful stimulus for the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs."
"Although the draft Directive debated today is not perfect, it is an important step forward and I call for it to be adopted without amendment."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if Europe is to support growth and employment, it needs to expand the market and eliminate the excessive bureaucratic red tape that exists in this sector."
"However, this must not prejudice workers' rights or lead to exploitation or social dumping."
"Despite the fact that, after a hard-fought parliamentary battle, a series of socially important services have been excluded from the original directive, the text on which we are about to vote remains ambiguous and still does not clearly set the boundary between this directive and labour law and national social safeguards."
"Despite this morning's reassurances, it is for these reasons that we call for the directive, when it is actually implemented, to respect national conciliation practices and not to bypass sector-wide collective agreements."
"Above all, we call for the application of the directive to be strictly monitored, so that the rules protecting employee and consumer rights and health and safety at work are not breached."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, back in the last parliamentary term and part of this one, I worked on other directives and initiatives regarding the implementation of the internal market, alongside Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour."
"It is only right that I formally congratulate Mrs Gebhardt this morning, because, in addition to the Supplies and Services Directive, we also worked together on the Professional Qualifications Directive during the last parliamentary term."
"The directive in question, which, as has been pointed out, is a fundamental part of the implementation provided for by the treaties on the internal market, is also, in the end, the outcome of other legislative activities that we have carried out with Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour."
"This fundamentally important directive will certainly bear the name of Mrs Gebhardt, whom I should like to congratulate on the skill with which she has managed, not now but back at the stage of first reading, to bring the directive in question to a successful conclusion in such an important sector as this."
"I am not sure whether it is clear to everyone that the legislation that we are adopting is aimed at harmonising the national systems and not at imposing itself on them: this is a concept that, in my view, should be clear to everyone."
"While we prepare to take another step on the road to completing the internal market, it must be acknowledged and clearly pointed out once again - having heard a name that no longer exists still floating about in this Chamber - that, in comparison with the national self-interests represented by the Council and with the other kinds of self-interest represented by the Commission, the European Parliament is the institution that succeeds in resolving highly significant issues."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the majority in the European Parliament considers that the Bolkenstein directive has not existed since last February."
"The initial proposal has in fact been improved and some of its dangerous provisions have been abolished."
"This was done after a hard battle by the socialists and the left."
"The neoliberal spirit, however, remains in the Council's common position, in that crucial issues about European workers' rights are not clarified."
"In addition, services of general economic interest are not exempted from the scope and, in the article at issue about the principle of the country of origin, the principle of ambiguity prevails."
"The Court of Justice of the European Communities will be called upon to plug the loopholes by creating, as it has done in other sectors, liberal case law which favours undertakings on the pretext of completing the internal market."
"We tabled amendments together with the French and Belgian socialists and we shall support any which can further improve the text."
"However, over and above the texts themselves, which are governed by this deliberate ambiguity, there is reality and this reality is determined by unemployed, poor, disillusioned workers."
"Do not ignore them or, at the very least, do not make fun of them."
"(SV) Mr President, a major step in terms of principle is being taken in the European Parliament today."
"As I see it, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are perhaps those who have been best able to keep the compromise alive."
"I wish to extend a special thank you not only to Mr Harbour, who I think has made a major contribution, but also, of course, to Mrs Gebhardt."
"The European Parliament has conjured broad support out of a political conflict."
"The Services Directive is desired by many."
"I would point out how very strongly the right of establishment features in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Sweden's new government is now trying to simplify the rules in the labour market and make it more profitable to work. Additional impetus is now being given to these efforts by this directive, which makes European markets more accessible."
"Companies will now encounter fewer obstacles in one of the world's largest markets with great opportunities for growth."
"According to some estimates, some 600 000 new jobs will be created."
"For the Swedish labour market, with 70% of jobs in the services sector, this means big improvements."
"What, however, the Services Directive provides is a basis. It is a first step, and not the last."
"Certainly, much more might be wished for, but I believe that the other steps will also be taken when the time is ripe."
"The unduly large number of excluded areas - for example, health - are, of course, still covered by the rules of the Treaty, something of which the Commissioner too is, fortunately, aware."
"The work in this area continues, then."
"I would thank everyone who has contributed."
"I would also thank the Commission for its efforts to improve matters for companies and consumers - efforts that will hopefully benefit people by leading to better quality at lower prices in the case of certain services."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on her enormous tenacity and political wisdom."
"Others have obviously played a key role, but I am afraid that she has carried the greatest burden."
"This outcome is a success, given all the circumstances for citizens as workers, consumers and service providers."
"The outcome demonstrates that it is possible for effective and fair outcomes to be achieved between 25 Member States, despite all our differences."
"Those who ignore that diversity continue to reject this compromise, particularly the kamikaze GUE/NGL Group, which ignores the fact that the principal demand it has been making - the deletion of the country of origin principle - has, in fact, been achieved."
"The Council must now stop playing games with labour rights in Europe."
"Last week's farce on the Working Time Directive was shameful."
"Give us a working time directive that is workable and working and an effective posting of workers directive."
"Unless the Council does that, it will continue to preside over citizens who fear for the quality of their working lives and fear the race to the bottom, and those fears are eating at the heart of Europe."
"Mr President, today is a good day for the European Union."
"The process to reach an agreement on the Services Directive has not been an easy one."
"While no political group in Parliament has got exactly what it wants, we have managed to reach a workable compromise acceptable to the vast majority of Members."
"Most importantly, this Parliament is sending a strong signal today to the Commission and Council to move forward and make this directive a reality as soon as is practically possible."
"For that reason my group has taken the approach not to amend the directive at this stage, in recognition of the fact that it would not be helpful to reopen the debate in Parliament or Council."
"The implementation of the Services Directive will give the sluggish EU economy a much needed kick-start at this stage."
"The services area is crucial to Europe's economic growth and prosperity, contributing nearly 70% of GDP across Europe."
"Businesses and consumers alike should benefit from the creation of a more open common market for services."
"At the moment services account for only 20% of trade between Member States."
"The directive aims to remove many of the barriers to cross-border trade and services and to reduce the red tape that businesses, especially small to medium-sized enterprises, encounter when they try to expand across borders into new EU markets."
"Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises with the capacity to grow have been particularly disadvantaged by the costs attached to administration and legal requirements in the past."
"They can look forward to the benefits of this directive, which dramatically reduces that burden for future cross-border trade."
"This directive is of huge importance to my own country because it is a net exporter or goods and services."
"Irish companies and service providers will now, I hope, take advantage of the simplified environment for providing services across the European Union."
"The Services Directive will facilitate growth, job creation and increased economic activity in the services sector across the EU, while ensuring social and worker protection."
"As Parliament's last speaker in this debate, I wish the Commissioner well in ensuring that this directive becomes a reality without delay."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"For the record, I confirm that the Commission will accept Amendments 40, 41 and 42, which relate to comitology and introduce the regulatory procedure with scrutiny."
"The Commission rejects all other amendments."
"Concerns raised in these amendments have been addressed in the statements I made at the beginning of the debate."
"Various Members have commented on legal certainty and whether or not this directive will lead to a long list of disputes that will need to be settled by the European Court of Justice."
"I do not share this concern."
"There is broad consensus among Member States on this text."
"I recall that no Member State voted against the common position."
"The vast majority of Members of this House indicate that they will support it in the vote that will take place in a short while."
"Given this broad consensus, I do not see why Member States would seek not to respect the directive."
"Everyone agrees that we need to give the services sector a boost."
"This is exactly what this directive will do."
"At yesterday's debate on the Commission's work programme, Mr Harbour and others made a very valid point about implementation and the resources to be attributed to that."
"At the Commission, we will start to focus immediately on the transposition and implementation of this directive."
"Simplifying life for service providers and their customers is hard work."
"Member States have three years to implement the directive."
"They should start immediately, not because I say so but because their economies need this directive, and the Commission will hold the Member States accountable."
"The broad level of consensus that has manifested itself today is the result of a number of important innovations in our approach to lawmaking in the European Union."
"Firstly, Parliament took on its role as co-legislator and, instead of taking the easy option of rejecting a very controversial proposal, MEPs rolled up their sleeves and reached agreement on essential modifications to the text that made it acceptable across the political divide."
"For me this was an important signal of the maturity of this institution."
"Secondly, the Presidency is building on your approach and it worked hard to build on this consensus."
"As well as bringing MEPs to the informal Competitiveness Council, which engaged directly in discussions with ministers, the Presidency organised a series of meetings with the social partners."
"All of this greatly contributed to the agreement that you will vote on later today."
"It is appropriate that it was under the Finnish Presidency that some of these innovations were introduced because that is the motto of the Finnish Presidency."
"Finally, two points. In thanking Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour and everybody else - many MEPs from all sides of this House were involved in achieving the broad consensus that we reached and an enormous amount of hard work was done and great tribute has been paid to the MEPs here - I would also like to note that various Commission officials worked extremely hard to effect the changes and to get from the text Parliament produced at its first reading to the text that went to the Council."
"I want to acknowledge that as well."
"For those of us who occasionally engage in the odd wager - not that this would be something that most Members of this House would want to do! - I do not think that one year ago you would have wagered a lot of money on our reaching the position we are going to reach today."
"That is thanks to a large number of people, both here in Parliament but also in the various Member States and in the Commission."
"I want to pay particular tribute to that."
"Lastly, there has been at least one additional, unplanned benefit for me personally: I have got to know a very large number of Members of Parliament across all groupings over the last two years."
"This would not necessarily have been the case if I had not had to deal with this very controversial Services Directive."
"So I thank you for that."
"(Applause)"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would briefly like to thank you for a very interesting and constructive debate."
"The European Union's common goal is to improve our economy in terms of its productivity and competitiveness, and to increase employment."
"The establishment of a more viable internal market in services is very important if we are to attain these goals."
"I would like to thank you all. I eagerly await the forthcoming vote."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.30 a.m."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"(PT) As far as UNICE (the European employers' association) is concerned, the agreement reached in the Council on the Bolkestein Directive is an 'important' and 'promising' step forward."
"The Directive must therefore be 'correctly and quickly transposed and implemented' so that UNICE and its national Members - in Portugal, the Portuguese Industrial Association (AIP) and the Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) - 'will contribute actively'."
"So say the representatives of the major economic and financial groups. They see this 'step' as a fresh opportunity to exploit the workers and for economic domination."
"The Directive will serve to undermine the national sovereignty of Member States as regards defining, protecting and funding public services and as regards defining standards on how services as a whole should be provided."
"It will also strengthen the power of supranational bodies such as the Commission and the Court of Justice over the Member States."
"The accent will be placed on competition, which will have disastrous consequences for workers' rights and for the services provided to the people."
"This is an unacceptable proposal, which must be rejected."
"Lastly, I should like to highlight the role of the social democrats (the Socialist Group in the European Parliament), who, by means of their 'tactical' chicanery, helped to water down the objectives and the scope of the proposed directive before us. They originally proposed the directive, made (cosmetic) amendments to it, only to reaffirm support for what they previously claimed to have rejected."
"(HU) The Directive is undoubtedly an important step that will make it possible to move beyond the theoretical principles of the Treaty of Rome and provide the practical conditions for the free movement of services."
"It is my hope that by putting into action one of the four freedoms, it will be possible to eliminate the bad practice whereby Member States have prevented, through numerous methods, the implementation of that principle."
"At the same time, in view of the amendments concerning exclusions, it is questionable which areas shall in practice fall outside the Directive on the free movement of services, and whether in its present form it fulfils its original purpose."
"I think Parliament has missed a great opportunity to stand up for a proposal that would effectively promote improved EU competitiveness by creating a unified internal market."
"On the other hand, I find it commendable that the Directive fully respects the rights as regards collective bargaining and the signing, broadening and implementing of collective agreements, as well as the right to strike and to take industrial action in accordance with the regulations of Member States governing industrial relations."
"In sum, I think that although we cannot be completely satisfied with the result, since the list of exclusions and limiting conditions is perhaps too long, the Directive nevertheless covers a wide spectrum of economic activities and will impose a certain discipline on EU members."
"I consider it also of great significance that thanks to the Directive, enterprises will be better informed, more knowledgeable and less dependent."
"(EL) The directive on the liberalisation of services promotes the reactionary ambitions of European capital."
"It strengthens the monopoly of services markets with particularly unfavourable repercussions on the quality, security and cost of services."
"It gives monopolies the facility to enjoy 'low cost' services from service providers in other Member States."
"It takes advantage of the single internal market to reduce the price of labour and exploit it, thereby reaping excessive profits."
"It promotes the liberalisation and the penetration of big business into a series of public services and utilities."
"It throws into doubt rights which have been hard fought for."
"It exerts pressure on the working class in every Member State, by discriminating between workers, in order to reduce employment relations to the lowest common denominator."
"It introduces legislative changes at the expense of the working class and its rights."
"It accompanies reactionary changes to labour law which are already being processed in the wings of the tripartite association between the ΕU governments, the plutocracy and the reconciled trade union forces."
"The Greek Communist Party calls on the working class and the grassroots class to step up their fight against the entire anti-grassroots policy of the ΕU and of the governments of the Member States, to help to change the power ratio at political and trade union level and to make their action more effective, in order to satisfy the modern needs of the working, grassroots family."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.30 a.m. pending voting time, and resumed at 11.45 a.m.)"
"1."
"A new framework strategy for multilingualism (vote)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 20:"
"(ES) Mr President, in the event of paragraph 20 not being rejected, I propose an oral amendment:"
"'Otherwise, lesser-used languages and less-recognised languages, particularly in Western Europe, of the new Member States, will be left behind with their linguistic social space taken over by the more widely spoken languages, especially English.'"
"(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"
"2."
"The European Union's Generalised System of Preferences (vote)"
"Voting time"
"Mr Rack has the floor for a point of order."
"(DE) Mr President, if I have understood correctly, the President should preside over the vote."
"He has more than a dozen deputies."
"If he is really unable to attend, one of these deputies should at least be present."
"No, Mr Rack."
"It was I who was responsible for chairing Voting Time."
"The reason I was slightly late was that I was at the airport receiving the Emir of Qatar, and there was a slight delay on the journey there and back."
"The next item is the vote."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Welcome"
"I would like to welcome Mr Olexander Moroz, President of the Verjovna Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, who is in the gallery, and the delegation accompanying him."
"(Applause)"
"We wish Mr Moroz a happy stay with us and we hope that he will be able to lead the parliamentary work in his country through the difficult situation it is facing at the moment and towards a democratic, prosperous and stable future in which he will always be able to count on our friendship and support."
"I would also like to welcome to the official gallery a delegation from the Algerian Parliament - headed by Mr Abderrezak Bouhara, Vice-President of the National Council - which is currently visiting our Parliament."
"We hope that Mr Bouhara's meetings with members of the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, as well as with other Members of this House, will help to strengthen our many links with the Republic of Algeria and will enable us to make progress in the common quest for peace, prosperity and democracy for the countries located on both shores of the Mediterranean."
"(The formal sitting was opened at 12.05 p.m.)"
"Formal sitting - Qatar"
"Ladies and gentlemen, your Highness, I would like to welcome the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hammad bin Khalifa al-Thani."
"I would also like to point out that we have a visit from the President of the Parliament of Ukraine, who is in the official gallery."
"It is an honour for us to welcome you today, as the first Head of State of a Gulf country to address the European Parliament."
"In fact, this is the first time we have had the pleasure and honour of receiving a Head of State from the extremely important region of the Gulf."
"You have been a pioneer in your region's process of democratisation."
"You have promoted a written Constitution, approved by means of a referendum, which guarantees a whole series of democratic reforms, including, of course, recognition of freedom of expression and opinion, the granting of universal suffrage to all adults, men and women, and the creation of a Parliament that will be elected in elections to be held next year."
"Furthermore, your Highness, you have played an important role on the international stage."
"You and your country."
"A small country with just 200 000 citizens, as well as more than 600 000 immigrants."
"A country that organised the conference in Doha that launched the WTO round that is still taking place."
"It is the only Arab State that is currently a member of the United Nations Security Council."
"It is a pioneer in the granting of financial aid and the sending of troops to the peace-keeping force in Lebanon."
"Its troops are there together with our troops."
"It has provided significant impetus in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict between Palestine and Israel, being one of the very few Arab States with trade relations with Israel."
"You also took an important decision, which has had great worldwide repercussions, ten years ago now, in 1996, when you authorised broadcasting by the television channel, Al-Jazeera, significantly transforming access to news and information in the Arab world."
"That channel now broadcasts in English and contributes to dialogue and understanding amongst civilisations."
"Perhaps we too will one day recognise the importance of a channel in Arabic and English and perhaps we will also one day have a European television channel broadcasting in Arabic."
"Your Highness, we are extremely interested to hear what you have to say to us this morning."
"We wish to hear your views on the development of democracy in Qatar."
"We would also like, however, to hear your ideas about how we can promote peace in Palestine."
"And peace and stability in Iraq."
"And how to reduce the tension with Iran."
"Throughout my term in office - which will come to an end soon - I have insisted on the importance to Europe of our relations with the Arab and Islamic world."
"I believe that this is one of the most important geostrategic challenges facing us Europeans: our relations with the Islamic world, which must go much further than our relations with our immediate neighbours, the countries of the Mediterranean."
"This Parliament is therefore pleased that the negotiations have begun on a trade agreement between our Union, the European Union, and the Member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"Let us hope that these negotiations can conclude shortly so that we can have relations with Qatar and its neighbours with greater strategic and political content."
"This makes your visit to the European Parliament today all the more significant and relevant."
"Your visit, your country's visit, is important to us for many reasons, and furthermore it is taking place on a symbolic day, because, also today, the United Nations working group on the Alliance of Civilisations has just presented its recommendations to the Secretary-General, Mr Annan, in Istanbul."
"This is a good time for you to be here amongst us in Strasbourg, in the heart of Europe, so that your views and the views of the Arab world can bring us closer together and make it possible for us to move forward into the future in a more united fashion than has been possible in the past."
"Thank you for your words, your Highness."
"I am sure that they will have helped to create greater understanding of the views of the Arab world, of the Islamic world, on issues which are of common interest, to both Europe and yourselves."
"It has been an honour for the European Parliament to receive you."
"Thank you very much."
"(Applause)"
"(The formal sitting was closed at 12.30 p.m.)"
"1."
"Services in the internal market (vote)"
"That concludes the vote."
"Voting time (continued)"
"We shall continue with the vote."
"Explanations of vote"
"The next item is the explanations of vote."
"(ES) Mr President, the European Union's fundamental motto is 'United in diversity'."
"Since its origins we have been trying to build a common area, and not just an economic area but, above all, an area of life opportunities and freedom."
"We are doing so amongst people and nations that have many things in common;"
"I am not just referring to the strategic, political and social interests that we share, but also to our values, habits and ways of looking at life."
"We have a common cultural background based on Greek thought, Roman law, Christianity, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Renaissance and even globalisation."
"At the same time, however, there is no question that we still have cultural differences and special identities and, in particular, our own languages."
"This diversity, though it could be seen as just an obstacle, is in fact a source of great wealth and vitality."
"Although it has not been approved, I have therefore voted in favour of the proposal that the European Union Treaty be modified, so that there can be Community legislation in the field of respect and protection for languages, particularly minority languages, as well as the creation of a European Agency for Linguistic Diversity and Multilingualism."
"I have also voted in favour of promoting the learning by all European citizens of at least two other languages in addition to their own, since I believe that that is the best way to bring about mutual understanding, co-existence and unity."
"(DE) Mr President, on the subject of multilingualism, I welcome the adoption of this report by Mr Joan i Marí."
"Indeed, I voted in favour of it, albeit with a number of reservations, which I still have."
"I believe that neither the European Commission nor Members during the vote in this House - the majority, at least - showed sufficient courage on a number of amendments."
"Multilingualism is a precondition for tolerance and acceptance, and, in the interests of understanding within the EU, more must be done in this field."
"It is a fact that Parliament decided the Commission should study the issue of the creation of an agency and present a report to Parliament on this, and it is equally true that the Commission has been found wanting in this regard."
"This omission must be rectified."
"The procedure in this House is that a report is presented before the relevant debates are held and decisions taken."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is good news that the new framework strategy for multilingualism has been adopted."
"The individual Member States will be responsible for implementing this policy."
"Some Member States are currently carrying out changes to their education systems."
"The teaching of foreign languages, as a means of both communication and recognising cultural diversity, forms a substantial part of these changes."
"We must give unequivocal support to the European Indicator of Language Competence if we are to make the best possible use of individual systems of current language knowledge in educational planning."
"The motivation for teaching foreign languages is also increased by the transparency of language examination and certification, which is of benefit to those who have them in their future careers."
"The report represents an important contribution towards strengthening the teaching of foreign languages, improving the competitiveness of workforces and enhancing communication between the citizens and the European institutions."
"This a further reason why I voted in favour of this report."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report."
"Amid all the euphoria about multilingualism, we must not forget the deficits that ever declining results of PISA studies have revealed."
"The number of non-nationals in school classes should be limited to 30% as a matter of course, however, in order to facilitate integration, maintain quality standards and reduce the potential for cultural conflict."
"In my opinion, therefore, sufficient command of the local language before the start of normal education and, if necessary, increased linguistic support, for example in the form of an additional year in kindergarten or pre-school, should become the norm in the EU."
"(FR) Mr President, I would add my reservations to those of my colleague, Mr Mölzer."
"There are some excellent things in this report, in particular the fact that it points out that English teaching does not need to be subsidised by the European Union."
"It includes an extremely ambitious position, which is aimed at making all sixty or so minority languages official languages, but this is somewhat to the detriment of the 21 national languages of the Union, some of which are already, to some extent, under great threat: Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Hungarian and Slovenian are not languages of international communication."
"Even the status of Italian, German and French is of some concern."
"It is somewhat illogical for the report to propose making savings on the grounds that these official EU languages are not necessarily regarded as working languages in all of the delegations, and this so as to release funds for the benefit of regional languages."
"Yesterday, we had the rather regrettable example of the Head of a State that has recently become fully independent, who felt obliged, rather than to speak in his mother tongue, to speak in English, even though he had been a student in Strasbourg!"
"That does not bode very well, in my view, for the development of multilingualism in the European Union."
"I voted for the Joan i Mari report on a new framework strategy for multilingualism, although I have some reservations as regards some proposals and amendments that have been adopted."
"I feel that the European multilingualism strategy should cover the teaching and promotion of 'European world languages', a term that applies to Portuguese, which is the third most widely spoken EU language in the world (behind English and Spanish, and ahead of German, French and Italian)."
"Owing to its uniqueness and to the fact that it is spoken by some 200 million people in eight countries spread over five continents, the Portuguese language should be one of the EU official languages. The report fails to acknowledge this, as it ought to."
"Portuguese is the most durable link between the continents, as it is a means of communication, the raw material used by great poets and writers, and has a dignity born of eight hundred years of history."
"in writing. I will be supporting this report with a degree of reluctance."
"It seems to me that the endless addition of further languages to the cocktail of the EU's official languages is not necessarily of benefit to the efficient working of the institutions."
"I agree that it must be possible for MEPs to speak and listen in their own languages, but that is not necessarily true for Commission or Council officials."
"We now have the anomalous situation whereby Gaelic will be available for those from Scotland, Spanish for those from Gibraltar, but not Welsh for those from Wales."
"Yet, if we are to add new languages, I would plead that amongst these must be the language of one part of my constituency, namely Cornish."
"It is a minority language, but its potential speakers are at least as numerous as those speakers of Maltese, an official language of the Community."
"in writing. (SV) Multilingualism is important for freedom of movement within the European Union."
"We have therefore voted in favour of the report as a whole."
"However, we have voted against certain proposed wordings, including those concerning language legislation for the EU, the setting up of an Agency for Linguistic Diversity and/or Multilingualism and the establishment of an interinstitutional EU working party charged with bringing about an amendment to the EU Treaty with a view to creating a legal basis for the concept, 'respect for linguistic diversity'."
"As always, the European Parliament's tendency to grow like Topsy enters the picture."
"We would point out that the Member States are exclusively responsible for the organisation of teaching and for ensuring that the content of education systems is fully respected."
"Consequently, it is the responsibility of each Member State to make sure that people are given a proper linguistic education."
"in writing. - (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Joan i Mari on his important and timely report on a new framework strategy for multilingualism, to which I lend my full backing."
"I welcome the proposed measures to promote multilingualism in Europe."
"The existence of various languages in Europe is a characteristic that is peculiar to the process of European integration and a key component of European culture."
"The learning of various languages, which is the objective known as 'mother tongue + 2' established in the Lisbon Strategy, should be encouraged with a view to facilitating communication between people from different countries and to fostering acceptance of the differences between them."
"in writing. I voted for this report and warmly welcome measures to protect and enhance the use of minority languages."
"However, encouraging multilingualism should not spill over into the excessive (and unnecessary) provision of interpretation and translation into regional languages."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report before us because multilingualism is a subject that is close to my heart and because I feel that the EU should send out a loud and clear message promoting linguistic diversity in its territory."
"As regards the European Indicator of Language Competence, mentioned in the report, I shall reiterate the arguments I put forward in my written statement on the issue."
"The adoption of an Indicator of Language Competence is needed to redress the lack of verifiable data on the EU citizens' language skills."
"This Indicator must not, however, be restricted to the five most widely spoken languages in the EU."
"Among other factors, we must take into account the profile of other European languages around the world. This is a key aspect of the issue, and one which the EU must incorporate into its policy of openness towards, and cooperation with, the rest of the world."
"For this reason, my vote in favour of Amendment 4 is a way of emphasising the call for the Commission to set out a specific timetable for extending the Indicator to all of the official EU languages, as I proposed in my written statement."
"In the new framework strategy for multilingualism, I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken on board my contribution to the recognition of the strategic importance and global relevance of European world languages."
"Spanish is the mother tongue of 280 million people; Portuguese is the mother tongue of 230 million people, and 125 million have French as their mother tongue."
"These figures and the geographical spread of speakers of these languages are indicative of the importance of European languages with a worldwide profile. These languages enhance our capacity to sustain and strengthen direct relations and contacts with other parts of the world, without the need for an intermediary."
"Turning to another aspect of the issue, I am aware that those opposed to the European promotion of multilingualism cite cost as one of the reasons for eliminating it or replacing it with one working language, or just a few."
"It is undeniable that it costs money."
"It must be remembered, however, despite the financial arguments that are trotted out, that of the costs incurred in the construction of modern Europe, this one is in a very good cause, the promotion of our tradition."
"Multilingualism certainly costs less than war, and is a powerful cultural activity."
"in writing. Multilingualism is an important concept."
"We need to recognise the uniqueness of the European Parliament in having simultaneous interpretation in 21 different languages, soon to be 23."
"However, if we are going to achieve the aim of all EU citizens having competence in their mother tongue plus two other languages, we need support at Member State level."
"In Scotland, fewer people are choosing to study foreign languages at school and university."
"We must reverse that trend."
"I am pleased that all 10-year olds in Scottish schools are learning a foreign language."
"Their efforts should be encouraged and supported."
"The Scottish Executive support for Gaelic medium education should also be commended."
"in writing. - (FR) The desire to make the granting to certain countries of the generalised system of preferences - that is to say, privileged access to the European market for their exports - dependent on those countries' complying with the minimal rules of the International Labour Organisation, is a good thing."
"However, as is usually the case with this type of resolution, I fear that we are still at the stage of pious hopes."
"Despite the clauses demanding respect for human rights and the basic 'social' rights with which the Europe of Brussels peppers its international trade agreements, I do not believe that it has ever punished any violation of these rights or enforced these clauses."
"It agrees to trade with China and has supported its entry into the WTO, despite what we know about the working conditions in that Communist country, about the existence of Laogai camps and forced labour, about the political repression and lack of freedoms, and even about the systematic violation of the right of ownership, by the large-scale counterfeiting and copying that is practised there."
"The problem here is one of credibility, and, on this point, Europe has none."
"in writing. More trade union activists are murdered each year in Colombia than in the rest of the world combined."
"In 2005, 70 trade unionists were killed, while 260 received death threats, 56 were arbitrarily detained, seven survived attacks in which explosives or firearms were used, six were kidnapped, and three disappeared."
"The Commission has taken great pride in touting its credentials in matching GSP benefits with rights standards."
"Even the ILO itself has stated that Colombia is not in full compliance with ILO core labour standards, which should be necessary to afford GSP+ benefits."
"Ratification of an ILO convention is not the same as implementation, as trade unionists in Colombia will readily testify."
"I therefore welcome this resolution and the statement made by Commissioner Mandelson during the debate and urge the Commission to review Colombia's GSP+ status."
"Otherwise a country which murders its trade unionists will continue to appear to be rewarded for doing so."
"in writing. I welcome this vote."
"In far too many countries that get GS preferences there are repeated violations of workers' rights."
"The Commission must through regular and transparent evaluation ensure the implementation of the relevant ILO conventions."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to explain why I voted in favour of the proposed recommendation for a directive on services in the internal market."
"I should first like to say that I am convinced that it is a good thing that after three years of protracted negotiation the European institutions have reached a decision on progress towards liberalising the free movement of services."
"This will lead to the creation of more than half a million new jobs and will support economic growth in our countries."
"Although the directive in its final form does not correspond entirely to my original idea of the liberalisation of services in the EU internal market, it will still bring added value to all stakeholders, and this is why I voted in favour of it."
"It will allow traders and small and medium-sized enterprises easier access to the markets of the other Member States."
"The compromise reached in the Council is a very fragile one, however, and there is no point in putting it at risk."
"For this reason I did not vote for certain amendments relating to sensitive issues, such as compliance with labour or criminal law, the definition of social services and screening obligations."
"These issues will certainly form the subject of future debates."
"(HU) As an MEP from one of the new Member States, I have fought hard for the rights of our businesses and our workers, and have put questions to the Commission on several occasions both orally and in writing concerning the protection and respect of workers' rights."
"In the process, we have often come up against legal, political and economic problems."
"We have frequently been accused of social dumping, of lowering the standards for safety in the workplace and other similar absurdities."
"By now the majority of the issues - including the SoKo Bunda and Pannonia affairs involving Hungarian workers in Germany - have been resolved, court decisions have stopped the German authorities' action and there are even lawsuits for damages underway."
"The acceptance of the Services Directive today is a giant step in the direction of clarifying the various uncertainties."
"It is a compromise, which means no one is really fully satisfied, but it is a good compromise that will advance our cause, namely the achievement of the fundamental freedoms of our Union, the free movement of services."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mrs Gebhardt's report, mainly because I come from a border area, where these difficulties are experienced on a daily basis."
"I therefore believe that these are positive measures, which will specifically benefit border areas."
"I rather regret the years of controversy that have surrounded the draft Services Directive with which we are dealing today and which, in the end, has received very strong support even in this House, support that I feel is well deserved."
"I hope that, in future, pro-active and positive proposals will prevail over controversies."
"- (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the freedom to provide services is one of the four freedoms of the European Union guaranteed by the EEC Treaty."
"Treaty prohibits restricting the establishment of nationals of one Member State in another Member State and creating barriers to the free movement of services."
"Fellow Members, it has been two years since we started working on this document enabling the freedom which has been our fundamental right for as long as 50 years."
"The principle of country of origin (a prerequisite for the free movement of services), services of general interest, healthcare, social and other services have all been excluded from the proposal for a Directive."
"Lithuania was the only country to abstain in the Council's voting for the Directive."
"I believe that it will not be long before we see that implementation of the Directive will not fulfil our expectations."
"Consequently, I oppose this Directive, just as during the first reading."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though many advances have been made in comparison with the initial text presented by the European Commission, the directive on services in the internal market that has been submitted to the vote today differs from the European Parliament's first reading."
"I therefore voted to reject the common position."
"Indeed, services of general economic interest are still part of the scope of the directive, as are some services of general interest."
"The scope of the exclusion of social services of general interest is also far more limited."
"The fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Charter now only feature in a recital."
"Finally, the text remains ambiguous as regards the exclusion of labour law."
"While the written statement presented by the European Commission provides some of the necessary responses to these issues, which I consider to be essential, it does not have any legal value, and, in the event of a legal dispute being brought before the courts, the Court of Justice will be unable to take it into account."
"It would have been different if this statement had come from the Council, as colegislator with Parliament."
"Mr President, the deal brokered here, which has achieved such a large cross-party majority, has shown Parliament at its best."
"We have looked at and reviewed Commission proposals, made sure they are workable and politically acceptable across our countries, and got a solution which I am sure will bring huge benefits to the EU economy."
"I am particularly pleased with the last-minute adjustment that was made to this deal on the issue of comitology."
"It was only a few months ago that we signed an agreement with the Council to give Parliament enhanced rights of scrutiny over the implementing measures that will flow from this directive."
"It was unacceptable for the Council initially to say that the new deal would not apply to this directive."
"Part of the deal was that it would apply to all new legislative measures which empower the Commission subsequently to adopt quasi-legislative implementing measures."
"That has now been accepted, fortunately, as part of the deal, which means that no implementing measures of a quasi-legislative measure flowing from this legislation can come into force if Parliament rejects them."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of adopting the modified version of the draft Services Directive."
"In other words, I was against rejecting it."
"I am generally an optimist, and that is why I think that it will contribute to cutting red tape, increasing economic growth and creating new jobs."
"Let us be honest, however, and admit that the original version of the Directive, put forward by the European Commission three years ago, was much better and could have made a better contribution to achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The current directive has been significantly watered down and it is difficult to describe it as a great success."
"It seems that some old Member States are afraid of the free provision of services and of competition with new Member States, using fear of social dumping as a justification."
"This attitude is difficult to comprehend, as I imagine that we all want Europe to become more competitive and dynamic."
"(DE) Mr President, I am convinced that the proposal for a Services Directive on which we have voted represents the achievement of a good compromise between freedom to provide services on the one hand, and the need to impose restrictions in the interests of workers and of small and medium-sized enterprises on the other."
"Indeed, that is why I have voted in favour of this report."
"It is now up to Member States to monitor compliance with the provisions."
"Only then will we be able to count this Services Directive a complete success."
"I would appeal to the Council Presidency, to the Council - which is now absent - to put pressure on Member States to indeed prepare the appropriate monitoring mechanisms for the implementation of the Services Directive."
"in writing. - (FR) The adoption by the European Parliament of the Services Directive enables general provisions to be established that will make it easier for service providers to exercise their freedom of establishment and that will facilitate the free movement of services, the high quality of which is guaranteed, and also excludes the risk of social dumping contained within the initial concept of the country of origin principle, which has been removed."
"The scope of the directive has been considerably reduced and excludes, in particular, health services, non-commercial public services and certain commercial public services."
"Service activities represent 70% of the European Union's GDP and offer significant growth and employment potential."
"Looking back, I should like to point out that the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, was strongly advised to stop the initial text, which was presented, at the time, by the Prodi Commission."
"This matter shows the growing influence of the European Parliament, for which this is a great political victory, and symbolises the concept of the social market economy as it is expressed in the draft Constitutional Treaty for Europe."
"We must now turn our attention to the Member States, which are responsible for transposing this text into national law in a fair, equitable and sincere manner."
"in writing. I voted, as one of UKIP's MEP's, for most of the amendments put forward by the EUL/NGL and Greens/EFA, because, within the limits of their understanding of the dangers of supra-nationalism, these amendments nevertheless recognised, and sought to obviate, the harm, which a lack of democratic, national control over the provision of services can wreak upon ordinary people and especially upon the less well off."
"in writing. We voted for most of the amendments put forward by the GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups because, within the limits of their understanding of the dangers of supra-nationalism, these amendments nevertheless recognised and sought to obviate the harm which a lack of democratic, national control over the provision of services can wreak upon ordinary people and especially upon the less well off."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the motion to reject the Council common position on services in the internal market."
"The vote at second reading was cast on a backwards-looking text in comparison with the vote at first reading."
"There remain too many uncertainties regarding the application of the country of origin principle."
"The text in no way clarifies the ambiguities that remain concerning the protection of public services and consumers."
"Even more serious is the fact that, even though labour law comes under national powers, the Council has just subordinated respect for labour law to Community decisions, insofar as respect for labour law will now be subject to the judgments of the European Court of Justice."
"The European Union is turning its back here on its initial ambition to create a united European area."
"With the downwards harmonisation of social, environmental and consumer protection rules, the European social model has been jeopardised."
"in writing. - (FR) The French members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have refused, this Wednesday 15 November, to endorse the report on services in the internal market, in other words the Services Directive."
"Indeed, despite the very important advances made by the PSE and the Socialist rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, at first reading - not least the rejection of the country of origin principle - Parliament has not obtained any guarantees from the Commission regarding a draft framework directive on public services."
"With this being the second reading of a text whereby there is no final vote on the complete text, we endorsed the amendment tabled by several groups (the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance) aimed at rejecting the text."
"Furthermore, we tabled several amendments aimed specifically at guaranteeing respect for the freedom of the Member States to define what they mean by social services of general interest."
"As Mr Poignant pointed out on behalf of the French Socialists, 'the definition, formulation, organisation and actual funding of services of general interest, whether economic or otherwise, must remain a duty of the Member States and of their regional and local authorities'."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the amendment aimed at rejecting the Council common position on the Services Directive."
"The directive is unsatisfactory because it introduces more confusion and legal uncertainty and further weakens the amended proposal adopted by the European Parliament at first reading, which I voted against."
"This is particularly the case as regards labour law and the social and public services that have been excluded from the scope of the Services Directive."
"Above all, however, the Council text gives the Commission the power to oversee the application of the directive."
"While the country of origin concept has disappeared from the text in the text amended by the Commission, it has not been replaced by the country of destination or host country concept."
"I find this very harmful, all the more so because it will be the European Court of Justice that settles any disputes that may ensue."
"It is therefore a liberal Services Directive that has been adopted this 15 November."
"Three years of debates will not have made it possible to avoid a conclusion with dangerous consequences for political and social Europe."
"This is a harsh blow to European integration - one that it scarcely needed."
"in writing. - (PT) The adoption of this directive, which has just taken place, is an extremely worrying development. We are bitterly disappointed at the rejection of the proposal to reject the Council common position that our group tabled and to which we put our name."
"What happened today was tantamount to a capitulation, on the part of the two biggest groups in Parliament, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in relation to their positions at first reading last February."
"They did nothing to promote the agreement that they had made and voted for, following the protests and demonstrations in Strasbourg."
"They have now returned to some of the most damaging aspects of the original, notorious Bolkestein Directive."
"What they are seeking is the liberalisation of services, including in the area of public services, thereby caving in to pressure from the large economic and financial groups, which have seen this 'step' as a fresh opportunity to exploit the workers and for economic domination."
"Not only will it undermine the sovereign right of States to define, protect and fund public services, it will also remove their ability to define funding standards and to protect services as a whole."
"In so doing, it will strengthen the power of supranational bodies such as the Commission."
"We believe that each country should continue to have the sovereign right to make decisions on the public services they want, their public property, their form of funding and organisation, and on the rights of workers and end users."
"Despite the significant progress made in relation to the European Commission's initial text, the text on services in the Union that has been proposed today at second reading does not offer guarantees that are sufficient to prevent any risk of the European social model falling apart."
"Certain sensitive social services, such as social housing, family support services and public health services, which were initially excluded from the scope of the future directive at first reading, have thus been reintegrated by the Member States."
"The legal vacuum accompanying, in particular, the abolition of the PPO has not been removed, leaving it to the arbitration of the Court of Justice judges - and not to the legislator - to define the future characteristics of European policy via the case-laws that this situation will most certainly generate."
"It is clear, in this context, that the Commission's written statement, which is aimed at clarifying some of the gaps in the text, such as the exclusion of labour law, does not present any real legal value, and that makes its influence and usefulness particularly uncertain."
"For all these reasons, I voted to reject the proposal for a directive on services."
"in writing. - (FR) If the new version of the Bolkestein Directive had not already suffered from serious shortcomings, particularly that of not being fundamentally different from its predecessor, one reason alone would have prompted us to reject it: the suspicious consensus between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, what is more, their adoption of the compromise drafted at the Council."
"The real revolution would have consisted, among other things, in explicitly stating the priority for a Member State to apply its national law, and particularly its national labour law and its national social, criminal and fiscal laws, in its territory."
"That is to say the country of destination principle, as opposed to the country of origin principle."
"This would not have prevented service providers from another Member State from being able to offer services in another country; this would have simply meant there being fair competition with national operators."
"The revolution would have consisted in agreeing to the Member States' being able to introduce conditions regarding access to certain activities, such as the situation of the labour market, or reasons justifying territorial planning."
"They do not have this possibility."
"After competition with the rest of the world and competition among businesses, Europe is now establishing competition among European workers, whether self-employed or salaried, and thus competition among social systems."
"It is heading for disaster."
"in writing. (SV) The June List welcomes the Services Directive and believes that services companies, irrespective of the country they come from, should not be discriminated against in any EU country."
"The key issue in the debate on the Services Directive has been that of whether the country of origin principle should underpin the directive or whether the host country's legislation should apply in full."
"The country of origin principle affects significant, but strictly limited, areas such as construction, installation activities and consultancy services."
"We welcome competition in these areas but believe that it should take place on conditions that are fair to all the parties."
"We believe that Swedish rules should apply on Swedish territory."
"It is therefore gratifying that, in its common position, the Council rejects the country of origin principle."
"The Council's position is mainly a victory for those views that the June List represents."
"Competition within the services sector will be intensified."
"At the same time, the national independence of the Member States will be respected in that the country of origin principle does not form the basis of the directive."
"It is a good thing that the national monopolies on services will not be affected and that national labour legislation, collective agreements, union rights and legislation on social security remain untouched."
"The Council common position largely takes account of the fundamental amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading."
"The exclusions are clearly explained and relate in particular to fields such as healthcare services and audiovisual services."
"The country of origin principle has been deleted, and labour legislation and social agreements in the countries concerned have been respected."
"Market access for our enterprises has also been facilitated by the dismantling of many arbitrary barriers."
"In addition, Commission opinions have provided greater clarity."
"Consequently, the overall result of the negotiations can be considered a success for Parliament, but also for economic and social policy."
"Of course, every compromise has its weaknesses, and some of the Council's amendments are not quite clear, but it would be wrong to question the overall result - which is on the whole very positive - by reopening the debate in the Council."
"in writing. - (FR) The Services Directive has just been adopted, by a clear majority."
"This is to the European Parliament's credit."
"This is a victory for the European Union."
"Why?"
"Services represent over half of the European economy, and are the main source of jobs."
"The free provision of services features among the founding principles of the Union, and the creation of a genuine internal market in services is key to economic growth in Europe, and thus to the creation of jobs."
"The text adopted today in Strasbourg commits us to this path, while providing the necessary guarantees regarding the safeguarding of public services of general interest and the continuity of our social acquis and of our labour law."
"By excluding the country of origin principle, it prohibits social competition and constitutes an effective barrier to social dumping."
"It does away with the unjustified protectionist obstacles, while permitting the Member States to apply their national rules when the public interest warrants it."
"The scope of the text has also been reduced, with the exclusion of sensitive sectors such as the audiovisual sector, the health sector, part of the social services sector, the gambling sector and even the notary sector."
"This is a good compromise, which will take Europe forward in line with the interests of its population."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted against this directive because I feel that, despite the improvements obtained in the parliamentary debate and under the pressure of the trade unions' and citizens' involvement, it remains profoundly liberal."
"No prospect of genuine harmonisation, aimed at benefiting consumers and workers, is envisaged in return for the fearsome deregulation of the services sector in Europe, which is mainly aimed at benefiting businesses."
"As for public services, while the Commission refuses to make progress on the framework directive on services of general interest, the Services Directive helps to weaken public services, some of which will suffer its effects in the same way as simple commercial services."
"Finally, the 'prohibited requirements and requirements to be evaluated' in Articles 14 and 15 make it impossible or, at least, extremely difficult, to carry out any public regulation in the services sector."
"There will be a maximum price for basic services; a minimum number of employees in order to guarantee the quality of certain sensitive services; territorial planning, for example for the opening of supermarkets; and so many rules that were considered until now to guarantee respect for the general interest and that are now regarded as so many unacceptable barriers to freedom of establishment and to the freedom to do business."
"in writing. I consider that the closed list of services of general interest is too limited and will leave many services in limbo."
"Are they in or out?"
"We have no framework directive on these areas, which are essential in combating poverty and encouraging social cohesion and are of particular importance to women."
"They are key EU policies."
"The Commission statement this morning cannot bind the future Commission which will be holding office when the directive comes into force."
"The statement has no legal standing before the ECJ, which will now be making decisions that Parliament chose to duck."
"We have seen in today's vote that the majority of this House prefers not to make clear statements on labour rights and the protection of public services."
"How will they explain to their councillors at local and regional level that they are weakening their role in determining the provision of services of general interest and safeguarding the public interest?"
"Parliament has achieved positive changes in the original proposal."
"We could have done more."
"in writing. - (FR) Despite a few improvements, despite a few additional sectors being excluded from the scope of application or, rather, of annoyance, of the first version of the Bolkestein Directive, this text, in its new draft, remains fundamentally unacceptable."
"It remains an open door to social dumping and to unfair competition among workers."
"It does not, in fact, resolve any of the problems raised by the original directive."
"It does not exclude public services and does not safeguard the right of the Member States to determine the way in which these services are defined, organised and funded."
"It denies the legitimate, economic, social or other requirements that these very Member States can impose on access to an activity, and only acknowledges the possibility for them to invoke 'overriding requirements of the general interest', a vague concept that the Court in Luxembourg will take it upon itself to interpret in the most restrictive way possible."
"It subordinates respect for the labour law of the Member State in which the service is provided to respect for Community law and, more specifically, for the free provision of services principle laid down in the Treaties, a move that amounts to denying the application of this national law."
"Several million Europeans rejected this ultraliberal Europe, which scorns men and nations and prioritises market laws, financial interests and sacrosanct competition."
"Listen to them before it is too late!"
"I voted in favour of the amendment to reject this directive."
"The directive is a step back in comparison with the vote at first reading because it leaves the application of the country of origin principle open and in no way excludes public services - SGIs, SGEIs - from this 'free competition', with the result that they will become very destabilised."
"The European Commission explains that the text does not clearly establish which law will apply and thus that private international law, which is closely related to the country of origin principle, will apply most of the time."
"The room for manoeuvre that the Member States have to act on the social field will be extremely reduced."
"In spite of the formal progress made, little by little, the liberal reality will impose itself with this text, and our social model will be jeopardised."
"in writing. - (FR) In an attempt to obtain the consent of the people of France during the referendum on the European Constitution, the 'Yes' camp, particularly within the UMP, made them three promises: that the Bolkestein Directive would be withdrawn; that VAT would be lowered for the catering sector; and that the plan for Turkey to join the EU would be abandoned."
"The people of France are finally going to end up with Turkey, the Bolkestein Directive and an unchanged VAT rate."
"The compromise on which we are voting today is a seemingly watered down version of the original text, which includes, as a double whammy, full powers for the Commission and the Court of Justice to re-establish the initial text."
"How can Mr Toubon say that, by adopting this compromise, he hopes to 'avoid the worst'?"
"The worst would therefore mean there being no directive, but that was precisely the promise made to the people of France in 2005 by the UMP and the Head of State!"
"in writing. - (FR) It is without enthusiasm that I am voting today in favour of the Services Directive."
"This text has been far too distorted and manipulated. Crucial provisions such as those on the posting of workers have disappeared, and I regret that."
"We were told that these provisions have been removed in order to prevent social dumping, but there is no truth in that."
"Those provisions would have clarified the ground rules and controls within the European Union regarding businesses and workers."
"Equally, we very much celebrate and welcome the fact that the country of origin principle - which was accompanied with the necessary safeguards - has disappeared."
"Yet, how can we, at the same time, look forward to taking a great step forward for the internal market?"
"What do we offer our businesses and our citizens?"
"Not, at any rate, the clear rules that they need in the internal market."
"Too many lies and fears have marred the debates surrounding this matter, to the detriment of the internal market and the integration of our Europe."
"With this directive, we have missed a great opportunity to integrate ourselves more."
"Let us learn lessons from it for the future and let us not make the same mistakes."
"in writing. I welcome the Gebhardt Report and effectively the adoption of the Services Directive."
"Parliament has played a significant role in allowing freer movement of services across EU borders without undermining social services, trade union rights or environmental laws."
"Parliament will have to monitor the implementation of the Directive closely to ensure that the commitments made in the Chamber by the Commissioner are adhered to."
"in writing. The Services Directive will have a profound impact on the lives of workers and consumers, lowering the standard of service provision and increasing the risks of social dumping."
"It gives exclusive prominence to the freedom to provide services across borders, whereas freedoms such as social rights and collective bargaining are excluded or dismantled."
"The directive puts downward pressure on wages and provides companies with numerous loopholes which they can exploit to pay less than the minimum wage."
"It provides an incentive to service providers to establish themselves in low-wage, low-tax countries, and encourages a race to the bottom in relation to wages and employment conditions."
"Regulatory requirements are an integral part of the functioning of all services, and the need for such requirements increases with the amount of private-sector involvement."
"The directive challenges the right of Member States and local authorities to regulate services."
"Finally, Parliament has capitulated to the Commission and the Council in its refusal to uphold its already inadequate first reading position."
"Unfortunately I was unable to vote on this occasion due to the hospitalisation of my son."
"in writing. - (MT) I voted in favour of this directive for two reasons."
"Firstly, we have not treated people like numbers, at the service of the market, but, rather, we have placed workers' rights above all other considerations."
"The second reason is that we have removed all restrictions on the movement of persons, not by playing workers off against each other and thus having a contest that is won by those who offer their services on the worst conditions, but by showing that we want to use freedom of movement to enhance workers' rights."
"This vote should send out a strong signal that no one should continue to abuse foreign workers by offering worse conditions than those offered to local workers."
"Nor should it be admissible to pressurise local workers into accepting lower wages and conditions through such methods."
"Over and above this, workers should be given full information about conditions being offered to local and foreign workers and should not be left bereft of information."
"Lack of information leads to suspicion and antagonism, just as is happening, for example, at the Malta Drydocks."
"Savings on expenditure should not be achieved by abusing workers' rights, but by raising the quality of services."
"This is what the directive should accomplish."
"The Coalition and the European left as a body voted against the amended Bolkenstein proposal adopted by the European Parliament because it will bring the position of workers under pressure and is a serious blow to social Europe."
"The compromise between the European right and the socialists moderates but does not eliminate the neoliberal logic and huge negative social impact of the proposal."
"With its ambiguities, it leaves the door open to further unfavourable interpretations, by both the Commission and the Court."
"The reworded Commission and Council proposal adopted today by Parliament without any amendments strengthens all these dangerous ambiguities."
"The Court of Justice of the European Communities systematically protects the undertakings that provide services in its case law, using the principle of the country of origin."
"It always rules against the rules of the host country, with the argument that they hamper the activities of the undertakings in question."
"The dangerous relocation of undertakings to countries with minimal social and environmental legislation is strengthened with the adoption of the directive."
"The fight by the European left against social dumping will continue even after the vote on the directive, both at national and at European level, in cooperation with the trade unions and non-governmental organisations."
"in writing. - (FR) I did, of course, vote in favour of the Services Directive."
"The fruit of broad compromises, it is an amended, revised and revisited text that opens up the services market in Europe."
"I voted in favour of this text, as did the vast majority of Parliament - as did almost four-fifths of its Members."
"The opening up of the services market will be positive for our economies; it will help in the fight against illegal labour and will guarantee better social protection for all European workers."
"According to the OECD, the directive is going to create two and a half million jobs in Europe and, until proven otherwise, is going to create jobs; this is still the best social policy there is!"
"Demonisation is the tactic used by those who are deprived of it: it is, I might add, amusing to note that, in the Socialist camp, only a last handful of diehards, including the French-speaking Belgians, are still rejecting this compromise, which has been accepted by everyone, including the trade unions!"
"Parliament and the Council have played their part and proved those who constantly demonise this text wrong."
"This text, in its current form, preserves the best parts of the European social model and recognises the specific nature of services of general interest."
"The colegislators have put an end to the lies and given Europe a chance of growth!"
"in writing. - (FR) In line with my vote on the Services Directive at first reading, I voted to reject the common position."
"Indeed, the Council has not taken up all of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament."
"I had to reject the Council common position because it clearly excludes labour law and social services of general interest."
"That is why I co-signed and voted in favour of three amendments tabled by the French Socialist delegation providing for the clear and total exclusion of labour law and social services of general interest from the scope of the Services Directive."
"Indeed, it is a question of protecting Europeans' fundamental rights."
"These must not be governed by the rules of the internal market."
"Although the Commission statement clarifies its aim on several points, it is not enough because it has no binding force."
"I finally voted in favour of the amendments aimed at completely excluding services of general interest from the scope of this directive."
"in writing. - (PT) It has taken 50 years for the EU to achieve the free movement of services enshrined in the 1957 Treaty of Rome."
"It is now about to become a reality."
"The EU is taking another step in the right direction with the Services Directive, which will facilitate the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services in the EU Member States offered by the internal market."
"Controversial since its beginnings as the Bolkestein Directive, the final text is rather less forthright."
"I believe, however, that this report has struck the right balance between the crucial need to open up the services sector to competition, whilst preserving the European social model."
"I voted for this Directive because I feel that Portugal has much to gain, as it will accordingly derive maximum benefit from the internal market."
"Adopting the directive was the right thing to do if only because a series of administrative and legal obstacles imposed by the national, regional and local authorities have been removed."
"Portuguese companies, and in particular SMEs, will be the main beneficiaries."
"Furthermore, the adoption of the Directive will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy aimed at more growth, more jobs and greater freedom for consumers to choose services."
"Although the Council's common position on the Services Directive, on which we are to vote today, may be an improvement on the original Commission proposal, a few aspects of it still remain unacceptable."
"The document creates legal uncertainty."
"It is, for example, left unclear what legislation applies and to what extent Member States can impose national provisions."
"The possibility for upward harmonisation has not been included."
"Moreover, the review clause leaves the door open to the reintroduction of the country-of-origin principle and to the addition of services currently outside the directive's scope."
"Services of general economic interest fall within the directive's scope and since there is no framework directive for services of general interest, this directive is at risk of forming a horizontal framework for services of general economic interest."
"I also regret the fact that the list of social services that fall outside of the directive's scope has - having originally been indicative - been changed into a limitative list."
"In addition, the absence of any reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is disappointing."
"I am, finally, particularly disgruntled at this House's capitulation in respect of the maximum enforcement of the achievements that were attained at first reading."
"As a result, the future of a democratic and social Europe is being undermined."
"in writing. I welcome the vote today on the Services Directive and support the compromise reached."
"in writing. (PL) The only benefit of the present compromise on the Services Directive is the fact that its adoption will not worsen the basis on which the services market operates."
"That is the only reason why we can support this compromise in today's vote."
"The European Court of Justice will provide the litmus test for this Directive, as it will certainly, be called upon frequently to rule in disputes concerning the Directive's contradictory contents."
"On the one hand, we have the stipulated freedom to provide services."
"On the other hand, this Directive does not apply to the fields of vaguely-defined public and social services and temporary work agencies."
"It has no influence in terms of regulating labour legislation and collective agreements and its scope is limited in terms of the work carried out by posted workers."
"As a result, no real barriers to the provision of services in the EU will be removed when this Services Directive is adopted."
"It is a compromise that has been achieved entirely at the cost of the new Member States, who have a competitive advantage on the European Union market, especially in the services sector."
"None of the social reasons put forward for introducing these above-mentioned exceptions and restrictions fulfil their declared social objectives."
"They are merely evidence of economic chauvinism on the part of the trade unions and other interest groups in the old Member States."
"Hitherto, the debates on the draft have been the greatest example of European hypocrisy that we have witnessed during this term."
"The European Parliament and, with it, the entire European Union, is pretending to introduce the principles of a common market to the services sector."
"In doing so, we are not only fooling ourselves, but our citizens as well."
"in writing. - (FR) I should like to begin by highlighting the effective work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, who has ensured that the adopted text is markedly better than Mr Bolkestein's initial draft."
"Nevertheless, even though her work was remarkable, I voted in favour of the amendment to reject this directive and of the amendments that I co-signed, together with those tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, because the text at second reading does not go as far as the one at first reading."
"Many grey areas remain in the text, and they would have needed to be clarified before we were able to accept such an important text as this, which involves the future of the people of Europe."
"Furthermore, certain services, such as services of general interest, have not been removed from the framework of this directive, and this could lead to wayward paths being taken."
"I feel that the Court of Justice and the Commission have been given too much influence over the control of the Member States and the interpretation of the directive."
"The legislator gives more than its due to the government of the courts."
"That concludes this item."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Situation in Gaza (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Gaza."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is deeply concerned about the violence in Gaza in recent weeks."
"During a military operation by Israel, several people died in Beit Hanoun on 8 November, and in a disastrous barrage of artillery fire almost 20 Palestinians, women and children included, lost their lives as they were leaving the area."
"In addition, several people were injured."
"Military action also caused destruction to the town's infrastructure."
"The European Union profoundly regrets the violence and injury that resulted from these violent acts."
"At the same time, the Palestinians have continued to fire Kassam rockets indiscriminately at Israel, at the cities of Ashkelon and Sderot, for example."
"These strikes have now also resulted in one death, several injuries and material damage."
"The Union has called on Palestinian leaders to do all they can to end these attacks."
"The European Union cannot accept the use of violence."
"Every country has the right to defend itself, but that does not entitle it to use unreasonable force on a large scale or take the sort of action witnessed in Beit Hanoun."
"Israel must adjust the scale of its action to the situation."
"It has to comply with international humanitarian law."
"Security does not just apply to one side, but to everyone in the Middle East region."
"The European Union has called on Israel to cease its military action in Gaza."
"The Union has also urged the Palestinian leadership to halt the rocket strikes that have continued to varying degrees throughout the autumn."
"The purpose of the strikes is probably to increase fear and insecurity, which is obviously wrongly aimed at the civil population."
"The Israelis should no longer be living in a climate of continued fear: they too have a right to peace."
"The Palestinians must stop using violence for political ends."
"The deepening spiral of violence is threatening to destroy any chances of restarting the Middle East peace process."
"Events like those described here only serve to estrange the parties from the opportunities available, especially right now when a peace process aimed at negotiating the establishment of a two-state model is needed."
"The aim is still the creation of a viable Palestinian state, one which exists in peace alongside Israel."
"The European Union hopes that the events in Beit Hanoun will not discourage the parties and the international community or prompt them to abandon the pursuit of lasting and equitable peace."
"The European Union also hopes that the strikes at Beit Hanoun will not discourage the Palestinians from continuing the quest for mutual harmony and the formation of a government of national unity which could fulfil the conditions set by the Quartet."
"The entire international community needs a noteworthy party as its partner."
"The Palestinians have a right to a government that represents the interests of all citizens."
"At the same time, the humanitarian situation among the Palestinians has been a big worry for the European Union."
"The economic and humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories is intolerable."
"The situation would be considerably improved if Israel kept the border posts at Rafah and Karni open and improved Palestinian mobility."
"What is more, the European Union has urged Israel to recognise as income the customs duties and taxes which they have collected and which belong to the Palestinians."
"This could make the Palestinians' economic situation considerably easier."
"The EU itself has tried to help the Palestinians."
"More than EUR 650 million has been given in aid through various channels this year, and that is around 25% more than last year."
"The Temporary International Mechanism has been a functional means of aiding the Palestinians, and we hope that Israel and other parties can also make good use of it."
"The situation in the Middle East is thus not very promising in the light of the events of recent days, but in spite of this we have to continue to believe in a better future."
"The European Union will do all it can to support the peace process."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, thank you for inviting me on this symbolic date, 15 November, which is Palestinian National Day, to speak on the situation in Gaza."
"The escalating violence in Gaza recently culminated in the attack by the Israeli Defence Forces on Beit Hanoun on 8 November, which resulted in the death of 18 Palestinian civilians."
"In response, my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner made a statement saying that she was 'profoundly shocked by this particular event'."
"Our thoughts now go to the Uthamina family in particular, who lost six women and eight children, killed in their sleep, and to all the innocent Palestinians and Israelis who have lost their lives in this spiral of violence."
"After the attack, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner called on all sides to stop violence and give dialogue a chance."
"Palestinian factions should stop firing rockets into Israeli territory."
"Whilst we recognise Israel's right to self defence, this should not come at the price of innocent lives."
"The Beit Hanoun attack is the latest in a series of incursions into the Gaza Strip which started on 28 June."
"Military operations have caused damage to vital infrastructure, especially in Gaza - including the power plant, major roads and bridges, and government buildings - and killed almost 300 Palestinians, mostly civilians."
"In response, the Commission has this year stepped up its assistance to meet increased emergency and humanitarian needs."
"In June 2006, we launched the Temporary International Mechanism, which channels Member State and European Community Budget resources to contribute to relieve the socio-economic crisis in the Palestinian territories."
"This Temporary International Mechanism has supported the delivery of basic services to 1.3 million people living in the Gaza Strip and social allowances to 100 000 vulnerable Palestinians."
"The operation is now increasing its outreach to 150 000 cases."
"The Commission, through ECHO, has allocated EUR 84 million to help vulnerable Palestinian households through the provision of food, water supply and sanitation, healthcare and social protection."
"The European Commission is also providing a EUR 26 million package of food aid."
"Food and cash subsidies are channelled through the UN Relief and Works Agency to Palestinian refugees registered as special hardship cases, while food packages are distributed to non-refugees via the UN World Food Programme."
"The Commission is also a major donor to the UN Relief and Works Agency."
"In 2006 we provided EUR 64 million to its General Fund."
"It manages health, education and other social services for Palestinian refugees."
"In Gaza these services constitute the only element of stability in an insecure environment."
"Our efforts can alleviate the humanitarian crisis for the Palestinians. However, its root cause, which is the lack of hope in a peaceful solution for Israelis and Palestinians, must be tackled urgently."
"There is an urgent need to return to a comprehensive peace process with a clear political perspective."
"The process of reconciliation between Palestinians must be given a chance."
"We should encourage President Abbas to continue efforts to form a national unity government, with a platform reflecting the so-called 'Quartet principles' of non-violence, recognition of international agreements, recognition of Israel as a state and allowing for early engagement."
"This will contribute to restoring hope for a viable and independent state for the Palestinians."
"That is why the General Affairs and External Relation Council, which met on Monday, has welcomed the Commission's proposal to provide additional support to the Palestinians as soon as a national unity government is formed."
"In order to provide this support before the end of the year, we will have to resort to the emergency aid reserve and obtain the agreement of the budget authority."
"The Commission will count on the support of the European Parliament."
"In parallel to EU assistance, Israel should release hundreds of millions of dollars of tax and customs revenues, which it has collected on behalf of the Palestinian Authority and which it has withheld since March in response to the formation of the Hamas-led Government."
"We should all work together so that on the occasion of next year's Palestinian National Day, we can celebrate progress towards the creation of a democratic, viable and sovereign Palestinian State."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East is at once worrying, dangerous and tragic."
"It is worrying because the conflicts have been going on for decades and there is no end in sight."
"It is dangerous because tensions between the opposing parties are constantly escalating, and because external powers - such as Syria and Iran - are increasingly exerting an influence."
"Finally, it is tragic because ordinary people, particularly large numbers of children, are among the victims."
"As we tell all the parties in the Middle East, a military solution is out of the question - we need peace through dialogue and through negotiations."
"We also say that a policy of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' is out of the question, as the situation will only escalate further, with each side responding to an attack by attacking the other with greater force."
"We need to break this cycle of violence."
"We ask this of both the Israeli and Palestinian sides."
"The position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is crystal clear."
"We want to see an Israeli state with secure borders and, equally, a Palestinian state with secure borders."
"The dignity of an Israeli is the same as that of a Palestinian, and we must not apply double standards."
"We want to see an independent, democratic Lebanese state."
"Anyone who calls into question the right to exist of any of these states - there are already Israeli and Lebanese states, and there should be a Palestinian one - threatens to do lasting damage not only to peace in that region but also, the way circumstances are, to world peace."
"The EU and others must now make a contribution to peace."
"I believe that the EU is very glad to be indeed making such a contribution by stationing troops in the region, although we should have liked to see a European armed forces rather than national troops from the individual Member States."
"This is an issue that the EU must consider for the future, however, as a means of making a genuinely European contribution in this regard."
"Nevertheless, the mere fact that troops are stationed there represents progress."
"The development towards our making a genuinely pan-European contribution - including military - must now continue, however."
"It is now the turn of politicians, whose most important assets are confidence and credibility."
"When there is something to criticise, we must do so, irrespective of whether it is the Israelis or the Palestinians who are responsible."
"With regard to decisions of the Security Council - and I say this as someone who is very pro-American - it is unacceptable that all criticism or condemnation of Israel is vetoed by the United States."
"(Applause)"
"I would say in all seriousness that this is not the way to achieve credibility nor, in particular, to build confidence in all the partners concerned."
"I believe that the EU's opportunity lies in its credibility on this issue, because we recognise the right to exist of both the Israeli and Palestinian states and want to see peace in Lebanon."
"If, with the massacre in Beit Hanoun - supposedly owing to a technical error - Israel caused these terrible consequences, an apology is not sufficient. Its policymaking in future must ensure it does not constantly react according to the 'eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth' principle."
"(Applause)"
"I have just been informed that a woman has been killed and a minister's bodyguard has had both legs blown off today by Qassam rockets."
"This has to stop."
"We have to say this to both sides, and we have to be credible."
"We Europeans must not turn a blind eye, but instead must take responsibility."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time Parliament has discussed the situation in Gaza, and it is unlikely to be the last."
"It is the first time, however, that a discussion has revealed the formation of an opinion in this House that will entail a change in the EU's relations with one of its partner countries, namely Israel."
"Mr Poettering's remarks show that we need a discussion across the group divide on what position the EU should take with regard to this development and, above all, to the role of Israel and the Israeli Government in developments in that region."
"I have no expectations of terrorist organisations."
"What do we expect from terrorists?"
"The answer is terror, contempt for mankind, the unspeakable suffering these criminals have caused in the world and continue to cause every day - of which Mr Poettering has just given an example."
"What expectations does a common system of law such as the EU have of such people?"
"The answer is 'none'."
"They are not suitable partners for us. They are not the people on whom we should and can pin our hopes when it comes to building peace."
"Yet we should have expectations of a democratic country based on the rule of law."
"Israel, that wonderful country, the country founded in response to the lowest point in the history of mankind, has a right to our absolute solidarity in the region."
"Anyone who so much as attempts to threaten this state or call into question its right to exist will face opposition from all Europeans."
"There are no limits to our solidarity with Israel."
"Nevertheless, as a democratic country based on the rule of law, Israel must be open to questions."
"It must be possible to ask a democracy built on the same fundamental values as ours how something like Beit Hanoun can be described as a technical incident."
"My expectations of a democratic legal culture are that the parties responsible for this 'technical incident' should be held accountable for their actions."
"(Applause)"
"Regrettably, Parliament's summer recess was interrupted by a technical incident such as this in Cana."
"I am still left wondering who was responsible for that."
"If there is collateral damage from developments in the region, Israel must take care that its legal culture is not among it."
"It goes without saying that Israel has to defend itself and be able to do so, and that we have to lend the country a hand."
"Events in Lebanon serve the interests of Israeli security."
"What Europeans want, for there to be a stable Palestinian state, serves the interests of Israeli security."
"All our endeavours - be they financial or diplomatic, or now military - serve the interests of Israeli security."
"What the EU, a common system of law, cannot accept, however, is meeting lawlessness with lawlessness."
"That is unacceptable."
"What is also unacceptable is for us to stay silent when a party that judges citizens by their ethnic origin, as Mr Liebermann's party does, joins the government of a country such as Israel."
"That is unacceptable."
"(Applause)"
"It is the Israelis' sovereign right to elect a party such as this, but it is also our sovereign right as Members of this House to condemn such a policy."
"No social democrat anywhere in the world has anything in common with Mr Liebermann."
"The only opportunity for a solution in that region is the renunciation of violence."
"Dialogue is the only way."
"The parties must try to look beyond all the violence and all the painful experiences and to talk to each other."
"There have been some good attempts: let us remember the efforts of Yitzhak Rabin, who was Chief of Staff of the Israeli military forces, but still knew that dialogue is the only way of overcoming war and conflict."
"Dialogue is no guarantee of success, but what is certain is that, without it, there is no chance for peace."
"Thus, we expect Israel, in particular, to give priority to political dialogue rather than further militarisation."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I have lost count of the number of times we have debated the Middle East in recent months, but I do know that, since our debate in September, 150 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, 70 in the last week alone."
"The atrocity in Beit Hanoun, where 18 Palestinian civilians were killed, is as indefensible as it is inexplicable."
"In a spiral of violence where there is armed aggression on both sides, it is often hard to tell what is attack and what is retaliation, but there is no doubt in my mind that David Grossman was right when he said last week that the behaviour of Israel's leaders is the conduct of scoundrels."
"My colleague Mr Davies was recently in Gaza."
"He reports as others do that Gaza has become a prison, with daily reports of extrajudicial executions, of lives disrupted and rendered miserable, disproportionate retaliation - especially since Operation Summer Rains, the Qassam rockets have killed 14 civilians over two years."
"The IDF response has killed 126 people in the last month, of whom 63 were not involved in fighting."
"The time is over."
"We cannot wait any longer."
"The international community cannot continue to condemn while waiting to solve the situation."
"It is a disastrous strategy that leaves the stage to others."
"We must relaunch the talks and the negotiations."
"We must waste no time in deploying international and military observers in Gaza."
"We must reinvigorate the commitment of the Quartet, and I hope that the US will reinforce its role by assisting in the negotiations as a test-case of a new multilateralism."
"Palestinians must understand that the use of terror will never earn them the recognition they seek, and Israelis must understand that they are losing recognition by their incessant flouting of international law and disproportionate military action against civil targets."
"At Yitzhak Rabin's memorial service, Mr Grossman spoke of a country hypnotised by insanity, rudeness, violence and racism, of a state squandering its goodwill, squandering its own people, especially its young."
"The same Israel has recently used army bulldozers to destroy the graves of British soldiers killed in Gaza in 1917 and on 31 October sent F-15 fighter planes to dive at French soldiers serving with the UNIFIL force in Lebanon."
"How many enemies do the Israelis want?"
"How long do they believe they can sustain themselves in a state of unresolved conflict?"
"It is time for reasonable people on both sides to come together, perhaps to relaunch the Geneva Process, and it is time for the European Union to do what it can to promote, encourage and support that process."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I was with Mr Davies, Mrs Morgantini and other Members in Gaza two weeks ago on the day that the Israeli army began the siege of Beit Hanoun."
"It was the beginning of a campaign of extrajudicial executions, of massacres and of the destruction of civil property."
"Israel, the occupying power in the Palestinian territories, constantly violates human rights and international humanitarian law with complete impunity."
"The use of excessive and indiscriminate force against civilians and civil property, the destruction of installations supplying electricity and water, the blowing up of public buildings, the restrictions on freedom of movement and the consequences of all these actions for public health, diet, family life and the psychological state of the Palestinian people constitute a blatant collective punishment which is itself a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention."
"Admittedly, there is no excuse for the constant launching of Kassam rockets against Israel, but nothing can justify subjecting a whole people to a draconian punishment like that imposed by Israel."
"In such circumstances, the European Union must stop giving its backing to Israeli policy."
"In particular, it must assume its full responsibilities when it comes to supervising the Rafa crossing point and no longer simply bow to the will of the Israeli Government."
"The EU must use the tools available to it within the framework of the Association Agreement, and in particular the human rights clause, in order to ensure that violations of human rights and humanitarian law do not go unpunished."
"It must demand the reimbursement of taxes collected illegally by the Israelis."
"Dialogue with the future government of national unity must be reinstituted as quickly as possible, and direct aid to the Palestinian institutions must be resumed."
"Finally, the European Union and the Member States must do all they can to have the International Court of Justice's opinion on the illegal construction of the Wall applied."
"A meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council must be called as a matter of urgency."
"Consideration will have to be given to reviewing the Agreement if the violations continue."
"Finally, the European Union must play its full part in organising an international conference to promote peace in the region."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'Why does the political leadership continue to reflect the positions of the radicals and not those of the majority of the electorate?"
"How has that happened?"
"How can we stand by and watch today, as though hypnotised, the flood of madness, brutality, violence and racism in our country? [...]"
"Our political and military leadership lacks substance."
"[Dear Mr Olmert,] for once, really watch the Palestinians, not through the sights of a gun or from behind the closed barriers of a check-point: you will see a population that is no less tortured than ours, that is defeated, oppressed and hopeless."
"Perhaps for that reason, the majority of us have reacted indifferently to the harsh blow dealt to democracy by the ministerial appointment of Avigdor Liebermann, a potential pyromaniac who has been made head of government services, with responsibility for putting out fires.'"
"Those are obviously not my words: I am not an Israeli or a Palestinian."
"They are the words of David Grossmann, who lost a son in a pointless war, a war that was also caused, of course, by the Katyusha rockets, but that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Lebanese and Israeli citizens, including the son of David Grossmann."
"Mrs Wallström said that today, 15 November, is Palestinian National Day."
"What happened on 15 November 1988?"
"The declaration and acceptance on the part of the Palestinians of a Palestinian State based on the 1967 territories: thus recognition of the State of Israel."
"However, there was no such move by the Israeli Government, which has never recognised either the 1967 secure borders - since it continues to build settlements - or the Palestinian State."
"I am tired: in my seven and a half years' term of office in this Parliament, I have heard the timeworn phrase 'two peoples, two States' repeated over and over again."
"Every effort must certainly be made to ensure that there are two peoples and two States that can peacefully coexist."
"But why continue to repeat empty clichés, given that the Palestinian State is not actually being built and that political decision-making, helped as it is by the madness of Palestinian extremists, is not helping the Palestinian State to grow, but, rather, is helping to continually wear away its land?"
"I went to Gaza last week - and I regret that Parliament's official delegation did not go - with 12 MEPs: we saw what it means to live inside there, in that open-air prison; we saw what it means to use weapons that no one yet knows about and that are perhaps tried out on the torn-apart bodies of the young people killed by bombs that were falling and demolishing houses; we saw it, just as you must see it!"
"That is why we can no longer just talk about 'two peoples, two States': we must take decisive action."
"I believe that there is a crucial need for an international peace conference with all of the parties involved."
"We really do need to organise it, though; we need to act!"
"The Palestinians would not need our EUR 650 million if the Israelis paid the taxes that belong to the Palestinians: let us make sure, just as we force others to do - and obviously not through the use of weapons - that Israel fulfils its ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, the international community has taken its eye off the ball in relation to the ongoing crisis in Gaza."
"It has been distracted by other Middle East events such as the war in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran."
"We must all renew our efforts to find and encourage a peace process in Gaza."
"Compromises have to be made by both the Palestinians and the Israelis to end the conflict, which is destroying so many lives on both sides."
"I welcome efforts from Hamas and Fatah to form a unity government in an effort to end the international embargo on Palestine."
"I urge Hamas, under the new Administration, to recognise Israel or accept a viable two-state solution to the Middle East conflict, which I believe is the only way forward."
"I condemn the rocket fire by Palestinian militants from Gaza this morning, which killed an elderly woman and wounded another person in the Israeli town of Sderot."
"I also condemn the deaths of the 18 civilians in the shelling of Beit Hanoun by the Israeli defence forces last week."
"But an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind."
"While I recognise that Israel has the right to defend itself against attack, many of us saw the documentary on Gaza yesterday and listened to our colleagues who had recently visited the region."
"I was shocked by what I heard and saw: the sheer brutality that has been inflicted on Palestinian civilians."
"Both sides have to realise that the only solution is to sit down and talk."
"Dialogue is the only way forward."
"Courageous leadership is needed on both sides."
"We are only too aware in Ireland of the cycle of violence caused by such conflicts."
"We also know only too well the enormous benefits that can accrue to everyone when violence ends and real negotiation and dialogue take place."
"We must all strive to build confidence."
"The EU has increased assistance to the Palestinian people this year and has called for the immediate payment by Israel of withheld tax and customs revenue."
"It also continues to seek the release of the captured Israeli soldier and of Palestinian legislators detained in Israel, as well as the reopening of the Gaza crossing points."
"The EU has an obligation to protect civilian lives."
"At this time, it is in a stronger position to act as an honest broker than Britain or America."
"Reasonable people must stand up and do something about what is going on."
"Evil will continue to prevail if we do nothing."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, seven Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli territory this morning resulted in the sad statistic of one fatality and one seriously injured in the town of Sderot."
"Those carrying out the violence claim that this is revenge action for last week's blood bath in Beit Hanoun, in any event not on behalf of the seriously affected Athamna family from Beit Hanoun."
"Quite the reverse; they underline - and you can see it for yourself in today's Israeli press - that there has been enough blood shed."
"Sadly enough, this Palestinian spirit of reconciliation meets with no response at all from various prominent representatives of Hamas."
"Over the past few days, they have stressed most emphatically that the new Palestinian Government is not required to recognise the Zionist enemy."
"Can the Council and the Commission shed light on this repeated Palestinian political controversy between Fatah and Hamas?"
"At the same time, I should like to know their reaction to the statement made by Mohammed Shabir, who has been proposed as Prime Minister of a Palestinian united Cabinet: 'I shall make my position clear after the appointment'."
"Have you been in contact with him yet?"
"The Quartet is reported to be meeting in Cairo today in order to relaunch the peace process."
"I expect the explosive situation in Gaza will be high on the agenda."
"After all, the Council and the Commission will not be unaware of what the Chief of Shin Bet, Israel's Security Agency, told the Knesset, to the effect that, if the radical political and military tide in Gaza does not turn, Israel will have no choice but to mount a large-scale military operation."
"Shin Bet's Chief, Mr Diskin, also shared that since Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, no fewer than 33 tonnes of military explosives, large quantities of weapons and between USD 50 million and USD 70 million in cash have been smuggled into the Gaza Strip."
"Egypt, in particular, has cried off, although this is in contravention of the specified military agreement with Israel."
"In summary, the European Union must take the Quartet meeting as an opportunity to remind Egypt, and, in fact, the rest of the Arab world, of their responsibilities."
"Gaza should not turn into the much-dreaded Hamasstan."
"(IT) Mr President, I have just come back from Palestine."
"I set off without any prejudices or preconceived ideas, but the situation I found was worse than I had expected: it is a powder keg ready to explode, and it will have a domino effect throughout the area."
"Nine months is the length of time that wages have not been paid because of the blockade on money transfers, with the result that public offices are locked up, schools are closed, and hospitals are only accepting the all too frequent emergencies."
"Eleven thousand is the number of Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails, including 400 children and 41 members of parliament elected in polls that the international community accepted were free and transparent."
"Nineteen, including twelve minors, is the death toll of the clashes of the last few days, which in fact started the day after we left."
"Nine hundred and twelve kilometres is the length of the gigantic wall that is tearing the country apart and separating entire families, for reasons that have little or nothing to do with security."
"Nine hundred thousand olive trees, some of them centuries old, have been destroyed to make this impressive but useless structure."
"Eighty-seven per cent is the poverty rate in Gaza, where all outside links have been cut and importing or exporting goods is impossible."
"One thousand three hundred and fifteen metres is the width of Gaza's militarised border, which can only be crossed on foot, even by the elderly and children, after interminable checks: it is an incredibly grim crossing, like something from another time."
"Even so, as you wander the streets there is still a glimmer of hope in people's tired eyes."
"Europe still has a chance to redeem itself, if we start again from where we left off and pick up the thread that has recently been broken."
"Let us work towards a fair and just solution providing for two peoples and two states: security for the State of Israel, the recognition of which is not up for discussion, and rights for a free and independent Palestine."
"Time is up: either we adopt a strong, incisive initiative now, or otherwise we must accept full responsibility for having been unwilling or unable to do enough."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I believe that we should draw two conclusions from the debate that we are holding this afternoon."
"The first of them has been mentioned by the President of my group, Mr Poettering, who said that we must be consistent with the positions we have taken in the past and, just as we have condemned the indiscriminate attacks against innocent Israelis, we must also condemn this disproportionate attack by Israeli forces, which has caused civilian deaths, particularly amongst women and children."
"Unfortunately, Mr President, in spite of the Prime Minister's apologies and the investigation to be carried out by the Israeli Government, these people will not be brought back to life."
"Mr President, in the formal sitting this morning we were reminded that these problems of recurrent violence in the Middle East can only be resolved by means of a fair and all-encompassing solution."
"I am struck however - and I am glad that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is here - by the regrettable fact - and the Belgian Prime Minister, Mark Eyskens, reminded us of this - that, for every one hundred times that the European Union votes in the United Nations, on sixty occasions each Member State does so in its own way."
"Mr President, the European Union will not be a major player on the international stage if it acts in that way."
"I believe that everybody in this House recognises Israel's legitimate right to defend itself, but it would have been no bad thing for the United Nations to have condemned this tragic event."
"I would therefore call upon the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to work to ensure that, if the European Union wants to be a major player on the international stage, it can speak with one voice, at least on the international stage and, in particular, in the United Nations, where our Member States should not act in the lamentable way they did in relation to these tragic events that we are condemning."
"(FR) Mr President, more than 300 people have been killed in Palestine since June."
"The diplomatic term for this is 'disproportionate response'."
"Wherein lies the disproportion?"
"It lies in the fact that ten Palestinians have been killed for each Israeli during this second intifada, and 100 to one since the Lebanese war."
"There is therefore a lack of proportionality. The fact is, however, that each of these deaths is pointless."
"At present, the highest international bodies - both the UN and the Quartet - appear paralysed in the face of the United States."
"Europe should therefore do what it has done in Lebanon and adopt a position that is strong and unanimous, as is today's joint resolution by Parliament."
"It should therefore use all the political tools at its disposal, including the Association Agreement with Israel, in order to put an end to the violence."
"This violence condemns all Palestinians to death, but it also condemns Israeli democracy."
"It puts an end to democracy in Israel, whose government has just allied itself with a xenophobic partner which supports ideas of ethnic cleansing."
"Let us be at least as brave as those Israelis who invoke justice and international law in writing to us today of their horror at the massacres in question."
"I am thinking in particular of the courageous signatories of the manifesto published by the main Israeli human rights organisations, which are demanding an end to the stranglehold placed on Gaza."
"That is why I call for the blockade on Gaza to be lifted and for aid to Palestine to be resumed, as well as for support to be given to the government of national unity that is about to be formed."
"This would be a victory by moderates against extremists on all sides."
"I am also concerned about the Israelis possibly using new weapons of destruction in this dirty war - weapons whose use has already been suspected in Lebanon - and I call for an international inquiry to be launched in this connection."
"I support the idea of an international peace conference, bringing together all the players in the Middle East including Syria and Iran and, in common with the editorial in the newspaper Haaretz, I call for an international intervention force to be sent to Gaza."
"Finally, I would urge the European Union to seize every opportunity for peace in this explosive situation."
"Death and famine are emphatically not fertile ground for peace."
"We do not bear every responsibility in this crisis, but we do have responsibilities."
"I would venture to say that, by interrupting aid to Palestine prematurely and by putting in place an intermediate mechanism that has taken some time to be implemented, we have helped bring about the prevailing chaos in Palestine."
"To each his particular task, certainly, but we have mistakes to remedy and responsibilities to assume."
"Mr President, I, like many others present today, was with Mrs Morgantini in Gaza just a couple of weeks ago as this latest round in the current crisis was kicking off."
"We witnessed the systematic, deliberate and very sophisticated and effective brutalisation of an entire people."
"Gaza is a prison without hope."
"Any moderate Palestinians are blocked at every turn as they try to develop a systematic Palestinian state that might be successful."
"They are being blocked by the Israelis, and we must place the blame appropriately."
"The only result of all this can be violence forever more, and we can only treat the symptoms for so long."
"We saw well-meaning EU officials - we have heard today about the Temporary International Mechanism - and the EU is indeed doing a number of things to tackle the humanitarian symptoms of this disaster."
"However, as the Commissioner said earlier, the roots of this situation are political and the solution to it must be political."
"The association agreement must be brought onto the table and sanctions considered, or we will be treating the symptoms of a humanitarian disaster forever more."
"We are not without weapons and must use everything we have at our disposal."
"(EL) Mr President, 'Europe', 'peace', 'human rights', 'Palestine', 'Gaza': a vocabulary that we use which is rich in words."
"The reality is full of war, misery and pain and here we keep talking, passing resolutions, and repeating 'human rights' and 'peace'."
"All we do is to keep talking."
"How many crimes and how much death is needed for Europe to stop acting as Pontius Pilate?"
"In Palestine, it is not just people that are dying; hope is also dying and yet I believe that human suffering is not something you get used to."
"The visit by the European Parliament has been postponed for technical reasons, or so they say."
"Someone needs to explain to us what the technical reasons were and who is responsible for them."
"Maybe certain parties did not want us to go?"
"And if we do not react, we shall again be accomplices to the crimes being committed, not today, not yesterday but, to our knowledge, for decades."
"Words need to become deeds at long last."
"Within the frameworks of international law and without there being any intention to hurt the man in the street, sanctions need to be imposed on Israel."
"When, at long last, will the state of Israel be content to return the money it has kept to its rightful owners in Palestine who are dying of starvation?"
"The Palestinians are not terrorists, nor are they begging for charity."
"They are a people fighting against third party interests for their dignity and survival."
"They are a people who, in the face of the hypocrisy of the international community, the occupation and terror, are fighting for their continuing existence."
"(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the most important point with regard to these issues is that people on both sides are suffering at the hands of politics."
"The second point is that, seen in an international context, the Middle East conflict has now reached such proportions that it is at the heart of efforts to safeguard world peace and also of threats to such peace."
"Both of these are reasons why the conflict must be resolved quickly and the Quartet must appear there together in full and make exacting personal demands rather than each member just drawing up papers on its own."
"We must recognise that Israel has left Gaza and that what is happening there is partly an internal conflict between Palestinians, accompanied by terrorism, which is escalating almost into civil war there."
"In addition, Israel as a state has to respond to terrorist organisations that are not the responsibility of any particular state."
"This explains why we have difficulty judging the situation."
"It is no excuse, however, for actions such as the bombardment of civilians and their houses, because Israel, too, has to understand that the only chance for it to enjoy peace and lasting security, as for a viable Palestinian state, consists in breaking the cycle of violence."
"For this reason, Israel must consider whether its strategies are really the right ones to adopt."
"After all, what has Israel gained from the war it waged in Lebanon in revenge for the capture of individual soldiers that ultimately resulted in the pro-Syrian forces taking power over the chain Iran-Syria-Hezbollah in Lebanon?"
"In what way have Israel's interests been served by that war?"
"A kind of responsibility should be seen here, too, and the new consensus government in the Palestinian territories that has come into being recently may represent a means to make a new start, in order to ensure world peace and give the people in the region a future."
"Mr President, Gaza is a prison camp for 1.3 million Palestinians, sealed tight by Israel."
"The occupants are being starved; their health and education infrastructure is being destroyed; their economy is being laid waste; and they are being massacred."
"As many as eighty - not just eighteen - men, women and children were killed last week, most of them civilians simply going about their daily business and trying to get on with life."
"This is all being done by a State which claims to be the only democracy in the region."
"What a shameful expression of democracy."
"Israel is now also pulverising these unfortunate people with experimental weapons."
"We have no word from the Commission or from the Council as to what they are doing about investigating that matter."
"Launching Qassam rockets will not bring freedom for the Palestinian people, and I condemn such launches."
"However, it is also clear that Israeli firepower and Israeli oppression of the Palestinian people will not bring a secure future for Israel either."
"Only negotiations on a two-state solution will bring that security, and I would appeal to all concerned to start those as soon as possible."
"(FR) Mr President, following the massacre in Qana in Lebanon, we have seen a further massacre of civilians, this time in Beit Hanoun."
"The Israeli Government has expressed its deep concern at this new tragedy, describing it as a technical error."
"However, we know already that this acknowledgement will not be enough to prevent the massacre of other innocents in the future."
"In order to put a stop to this interminable escalation, Europe must rouse itself from its inertia and finally take strong initiatives to bring about a sustainable peace quickly."
"Firstly, we must remove our financial stranglehold on the Palestinian territories, a measure one might have thought designed specifically to increase the violence and bring about chaos there."
"Next, a military force needs to be interposed as soon as possible between Israel and Palestine, as was done between Lebanon and Israel with the FINUL."
"If such a force is effective in Lebanon, it will be so in Palestine."
"Above all, we must finally demand that a Palestinian State be created, with safe and recognised borders."
"With the results of the mid-term elections in the United States, a window is perhaps being half-opened today."
"The American administration will, I hope, redefine its policy in the Middle East."
"In the new strategy that is taking shape, Europe must initiate a new dynamic for peace in which it finally embraces its own political role and ceases merely to be a source of funding."
"We must never forget that the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not just a conflict like any other."
"There is an international dimension at stake."
"The moment has come, and there is no time to waste."
"Let us be courageous and assume our responsibilities before it is too late."
"(EL) Mr President, the sortie by black-clad mothers rescuing their children in Beit Hanoun, as shown on the international media, was the chorus of the modern tragedy being lived through by a Palestinian people seeking its liberation."
"However, there can be no liberation for the Palestinian people while the dangerous and deadlocked strategy of the United Nations continues in the area, while the dangerous and deadlocked policy of the civil-military leadership of Israel continues."
"Unfortunately, today we have heard the Commissioner talking as if the European Union were an international non-governmental humanitarian organisation."
"However, the European Union, Commissioner, is a political organisation with international obligations and a duty to defend democratic principles and international humanitarian law."
"The European Union, once again, has demonstrated the huge strategic deficit on the question of Palestine."
"Mr Solana should have been here today to see the results of the decision by the Council of Ministers in February, when they imposed economic sanctions on a Palestinian people which expressed itself democratically in the elections."
"These deadlocks in the European Union are being paid for today, politically and humanitarianly, by the Palestinian people."
"Mr President, the Israeli Government and the army have apologised for the tragic 'technical mistake' that resulted in the killing of 19 innocent civilians, mostly women and children, at Beit Hanoun."
"The issue is not whether that apology is acceptable or not; it is that the use of such powerful force so easily and so frequently is bound to result in 'technical mistakes', particularly when the threshold of consideration for human life is so low."
"Israel and Palestine will never find peace and tranquillity if they carry on being trigger-happy."
"The Palestinians will never succeed with Qassam rockets and suicide bombers."
"The Israelis will always invite more Qassams and more suicide bombers when they respond so disproportionately and so powerfully."
"No side can win unilaterally."
"Unilateralism is dead and buried in Lebanon."
"Thinking positively, let us take stock of Prime Minister Olmert's call to President Abbas for talks without preconditions, progress in the formation of a national unity government between Fatah and Hamas, a government of technocrats - with Prime Minister Haniya abstaining from its leadership - and implicit acceptance by Hamas that they should sit at the same table with Israel."
"It is time for the Quartet to act and for the European Union to cease being a passive member of it."
"Finally, I hope that the result of the American elections will make the American Administration review its policy and role in the Middle East."
"(FR) Mrs Lehtomäki, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, for my part, am delighted with the almost historic consensus obtained by the various political groups within our Parliament - a consensus that enables us to send out a clear political message."
"It is transparently obvious that the strikes by the Israeli army cannot by any stretch of the imagination be referred to as a 'technical error'."
"One gets the feeling that they are, rather, one more collective punishment inflicted on the Palestinians, who are being blamed for the political choices made following the last legislative elections."
"I cannot but lament the similarity between these strikes and the methods used against the civilian populations of Southern Lebanon during the war in the summer of 2006, with cluster bombs being used in both cases."
"Admittedly, the Israeli population is also the target of murderous attacks."
"One is, however, entitled to expect a democratic state like Israel to behave in accordance with international law - something that cannot be demanded of terrorist organisations."
"Faced with this situation, the European Union must assert itself as the driving force of the Quartet and be in favour of reinstating the Road Map."
"The new political order in the United States, the prospect of a government of national unity being formed in Palestine and also, and above all, the voices of protest raised in Israeli society are hopeful factors in terms of the re-launch of the peace process."
"Mr President, last week's incident in Gaza, when an IDF shell mistakenly struck Beit Hanoun causing the death of 19 innocent Palestinians, is clearly tragic."
"The Prime Minister of Israel has apologised and ordered a full investigation."
"Israel, it must be recalled, withdrew from Gaza in good faith, but the Palestinian Authority failed to establish law and order there."
"Instead we have witnessed a degeneration into chaos, internecine warfare and repeated Qassam rockets being deliberately fired at innocent Israeli civilian targets, such as the woman killed today in Sderot, with no apologies from the militants, such as Hamas, and the militias effectively using human shields as Hizbollah did in Lebanon by firing rockets from civilian areas, thus inviting retribution which resulted in the tragedy of Beit Hanoun."
"Furthermore, these Hamas-controlled militias have yet to release kidnapped Corporal Shalit."
"Yesterday it was announced that a new government of national unity has been formed under independent technocrat Mohammad Shbair, but its spokesman, Fawzi Barhoom, denies that Hamas will now recognise Israel and instead disappointingly stated that the new government will recognise the terms of the 'Prisoners' Document', a declaration signed this year by Palestinians held in Israeli jails that implicitly - but not explicitly - recognises Israel by calling for a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza."
"It remains to be seen if this will suffice to dismantle the TIM and resume full PA aid, and reassurances on ending terrorist violence will have to be forthcoming too."
"I will be reluctantly supporting this resolution, but cannot support its call for a multinational UN force to police the occupied territories, as the track record of UNIFIL in Lebanon remains unproven."
"I fear that, as we speak, Hizbollah is busy rearming itself and looking for a pretext to start yet another war against Israel."
"Neither do I call for an immediate cessation by Israel of all military action whilst it is still being attacked, as argued by my Liberal colleague Mr Davies."
"Mr President, when I look at our policy towards the Palestinians I can see our stick but where is our carrot?"
"The Palestinians are losing any faith they had left in a solution and in us as part of the international community."
"We are faced with two peoples who are craving peace and quiet in their lives, and we cannot rely on old rhetoric any longer."
"We all know where the solution lies."
"We need to acknowledge that the two sides are not making it on their own."
"A call for negotiations - no matter how justified - will not be enough this time around."
"I want to ask the Council and the Commission: are you willing to consider bold ideas?"
"Let the Palestinians define their state with the Green Line as its border."
"Let us then recognise it, let us use all our weight to get the Quartet to recognise it as well and let us then force Israel to accept it."
"Only then will steps to increase trust and confidence have any chance to succeed, because there can be no peace without justice."
"I say this as a friend of Israel, convinced, as I am, that we should not just save the future of the Palestinian state, we also need to protect Israel from itself."
"This is our responsibility."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Gaza is the nub of the nub of the problem: it is the nub of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis and of the crisis in the Middle East."
"It has engendered terrorism's major offensive; the failure to solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem has given rise to 9/11, the growing strength of Al Qaeda and the Middle East crisis."
"That is why Europe needs to play a major role and involve countries like Syria, whose role must be seen as separate from that of Iran."
"Of course, none of us means to exonerate Israel for what has been happening in Gaza in recent days - the Israeli armed forces have to accept some of the responsibility - but it would be a serious mistake to point the finger just at Israel for the crisis as a whole."
"We must not forget what is going on, with missiles being launched from Palestinian territory often with the backing of terrorist and extremist organisations, because there are some who do not want to thwart the peace process."
"Europe needs to play a constructive, decisive role to advance the peace process and must defuse any act by either side that might be provocative."
"Its role has to be balanced: it would be a disaster if Europe took sides against Israel and considered that it was to blame for everything that has happened, because we would not resolve the situation like that."
"We have to commit to establishing a Palestinian state and make every effort for Israel to feel secure within its own borders, so that no Israeli family feels forced to send one child to school on one bus and another child on a different bus every morning, because they do not know which of the two will return home."
"We have to stand very firm on that, and make Hamas realise that there is no room for military and terrorist action, and Hezbollah that there is no room for it to play a political role in the peace process."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, thank you to the Members of Parliament for this very valuable debate."
"The Council shares the view so powerfully put forward in this discussion that this is a time for policy."
"It is a time for policy and we have been of the opinion the whole time that this crisis cannot be solved militarily; instead, what is needed is a comprehensive political solution."
"We need a solution that proposes a two-state model and that will require the people in the region, including ordinary people, to accept this goal of coexistence properly, and to commit to it at all levels of society."
"The hope has been powerfully expressed here that the European Union will do what it can."
"On behalf of the Council, I can assure you that the Union and the Presidency will do whatever it can."
"The European Union's potential and strength in a solution to this crisis lies in the fact that the Union is a credible player in the eyes of all parties."
"You cannot find this kind of strength just anywhere."
"For the Union to be able to continue its work and its role as a credible player in a solution to this crisis, it must be able to sustain a united and consistent policy, and the question of how to foster this coherence is a daily challenge."
"We are taking robust action to ensure that the Quartet also has a leading role to play in resolving this crisis, and we will aim to support the Quartet's active involvement."
"It is also vital that, in order to find a comprehensive solution, we are able to persuade the countries in the region to commit to an involvement in this process."
"The next occasion on which the Middle East question will be on the agenda in our multilateral forum of cooperation will certainly be next week at the EU-Russia Summit, and then at the end of November at the Foreign Ministers' meeting of the Barcelona Process at Tampere."
"We will also work hard to get the Quartet to convene in December."
"This is an important issue and a serious, long-term problem right on Europe's doorstep, so we have to pool all our resources to find a comprehensive, long-term and lasting political solution."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, escalating violence in Gaza only increases civilian suffering and fuels extremism."
"As I have said, the Commission has stepped up its assistance for meeting emergency and humanitarian needs."
"That is a useful contribution, but the solution lies elsewhere."
"The only way forward for Israel and the Palestinians is the negotiation of a viable two-state solution."
"The international community - as many of you have already said - has the duty to revive a credible peace process."
"The European Union should play a leading role in that respect and, through its participation in the Quartet, encourage any ideas aimed at furthering peace in that area, including an international conference on the Middle East process."
"In accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolutions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"The European Union must do everything in its power and use every instrument at our disposal, including the EU association agreement with Israel, to end the violence in Gaza."
"The ongoing violence condemns the Palestinians to a slow death and risks setting the whole of the Middle East on fire."
"Death and famine are not fertile ground for peace."
"We need an end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza, resumption of aid to Palestine and support for a government of national unity."
"I fully support the idea of an international peace conference bringing together all the actors in the Middle East, including Syria and Iran."
"We need an international force in Gaza as a matter of urgency."
"Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), cluster bombs and conventional weapons (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the conference for examining the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), which will take place in 2006."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, issues relating to weapons of mass destruction and arms control have in recent years been central to the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy."
"Multilateral action on arms control and disarmament has nevertheless had to face enormous challenges in previous years, and the results achieved have been modest."
"There is an urgent need to alter this trend."
"The Third Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons is currently taking place in Geneva."
"Both this conference and the Sixth Review Conference of the States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention to be held in late November and early December are an opportunity to show that the international community is able effectively to respond to the challenges of arms control and disarmament today."
"The civilian population is all too often the victim of the use of weapons covered under the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons."
"The clearance of explosive remnants of war is an ever-growing burden for the international community."
"The universalisation of Protocol V to the CCW on Explosive Remnants of War and its effective implementation mean that we all have to make an effort."
"The European Union welcomed the entry into force of the Protocol at the Review Conference."
"The Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War was drafted in response to the humanitarian threat caused by unexploded ordnance, including cluster bombs, to civilian populations in the aftermath of a war."
"The recent events in southern Lebanon bring to mind the dangers caused to the civilian population by explosive remnants of war, especially cluster bombs, and the difficulty and expense of clearing them."
"This problem has to be addressed without delay."
"Therefore, the EU has proposed that the work of the CCW Group of Governmental Experts should be continued in 2007."
"The Group's current mandate includes the development of preventative measures to improve the design of certain types of munitions, with a view to minimising their risk to humanity."
"In addition, several EU Member States have individually pledged to start negotiations on a legally binding protocol which would respond to the risks to humanity arising from cluster bombs."
"The EU Member States, however, do not have a shared view on how to deal with the rather restricted area of cluster bombs within the framework of the CCW."
"This morning at the Review Conference, it was agreed that the Union's position on cluster bombs would be endorsed, and the decision was taken to propose the establishment of a think-tank of experts, whose purpose would be to prepare recommendations for future action to deal with cluster bombs within the CCW framework."
"In the course of the five years of negotiations on anti-vehicle landmines, the EU has consistently made mention of the fact that our objective is a legally binding protocol which endorses international humanitarian law and brings added value to it."
"Agreement on the protocol at the Review Conference, however, seems unlikely."
"For more than 30 years now, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention has served as the normative and legal cornerstone of biological disarmament and non-proliferation."
"Today, biosciences are one of the most rapidly evolving branches of science, with infinite potential for both good and bad."
"The BTWC has to be capable of being adjusted to scientific developments and responding to any possible challenges that go with them."
"The Review Conferences are an opportunity for this."
"The European Union has made thorough preparations for the Sixth Review Conference of the BTWC, in accordance with the objectives of the EU Strategy Against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction."
"These objectives include, in particular, making the BTWC apply worldwide, promoting the national implementation of, and compliance with, the Convention at national level, and reinforcement of the Convention."
"In February this year, the Council adopted a common position on the Sixth Review Conference."
"The Union's position is a balance between a realistic and an ambitious approach, nevertheless insisting on a comprehensive review of the Convention and practical improvements for its implementation."
"As an add-on to the common position, the Union has drafted thematic working documents on several topics."
"In addition to joint action, the EU agreed on an Action Plan on the BTWC."
"In it, Member States committed to taking measures to strengthen the Convention, such as an announcement of any confidence-building measures that have been taken."
"These concrete measures will make the main aims of the EU's common position on the Review Conference of the BTWC more plausible."
"The Third Review Conference of the CCW has a good, though not perhaps optimal, chance of success."
"We hope for a successful outcome, however."
"The Sixth Review Conference of the BTWC also stands every chance of a successful outcome."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, weapons of mass destruction are potentially the greatest threat to European security and, in terms of the ability to inflict mass casualties, the weapons of most concern are clearly nuclear and biological."
"While we all carry with us the collective memory of the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there are no equivalent common images for biological weapons."
"Mass death from biological agents, or diseases like the plague, appear by contrast to be part of 'ancient history' or science fiction."
"We must hope that it stays that way, but we cannot be complacent."
"Consider the following."
"Firstly, unlike nuclear weapons, biological weapons are not dependent on limited supplies of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium."
"The rapid development and dissemination of biosciences is bringing weapons capabilities within reach of those who could do us harm."
"The danger that humans, animals or plants might be attacked by biological agents is a real one."
"Secondly, official reports suggest that terrorists are seeking bio-weapons."
"If terrorists were to start biological attacks across Europe, many lives would be at risk and our lifestyle could change dramatically."
"Thirdly, biological weapons have been used in the recent past."
"The anthrax attacks in the United States in late 2001 killed few people but caused significant, wider social and political disruption, and the perpetrators remain at large."
"How protected are we today?"
"All use and possession of biological weapons has been prohibited since the Biological Weapons Convention came into force in 1975."
"However, this Convention is the weakest of the regimes addressing weapons of mass destruction."
"It has no provision for verification of compliance or implementation, and, unlike the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention, there is no central institution with oversight."
"Furthermore, there are fewer parties to the Convention than to either of those two treaties."
"Our security would be enhanced, therefore, if the effectiveness of the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention could be strengthened and its implementation improved."
"State parties should be encouraged to address these weaknesses at the forthcoming review conference later this month."
"Good security starts at home."
"My colleague, Commissioner Frattini, is well aware of the need for action."
"The Commission is examining potential responses through a common framework approach."
"National responses to biological threats are clearly insufficient."
"Alongside the work on strengthening public health and medical surveillance and response, we will be issuing a Green Paper on European bio-preparedness in spring 2007."
"Disaster and disease do not respect borders."
"The issue of bio-threats is one where internal and external policies are inextricably linked."
"Much can be achieved through better international collaboration and coordination."
"We will aim to share best practice on bio-preparedness: by helping to protect others, we will better protect ourselves."
"I would also like to say a few words on a very different type of deadly weapon."
"Unexploded cluster ammunition represents a threat to human security and sustainable development."
"Such munitions kill innocent people every day and 30% of those killed are children."
"They represent major challenges, both politically and to daily life in former war zones."
"A review conference is currently under way."
"It will see Protocol V to the convention, on 'Explosive Remnants of War' - i.e. failed explosive ordnance, ammunition or sub-munitions from cluster bombs, - enter into force."
"The implementation of this protocol, intended to eradicate the threat that such legacies of war pose to populations, will be a welcome step forward."
"The events in Lebanon this summer highlighted the issue, particularly in view of the high failure rate of the cluster sub-munitions employed."
"Helping Lebanon in the difficult task of clearing these deadly remnants of war is important and we have contributed some EUR 5 million to the task."
"We also support the need to focus more attention on strengthening and ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law in this area."
"Commission assistance and cooperation in humanitarian disarmament - that is to say mine action, clearing the explosive remnants of war and fighting the illicit spread of small arms - all have a positive impact on improving human security."
"They contribute to the sustainability of our development policies."
"We are grateful for the support of the European Parliament in these efforts."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, with the Conventional Weapons Convention taking place this week and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention next week, it is important that the EU's voice is heard."
"One main area that concerns me - the Commissioner talked about it - is the use of cluster bombs."
"We have seen the widespread use in recent conflicts: Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, to name but a few."
"Because they are not covered by the 1997 Treaty on Landmines they are used with impunity, but they still have the same devastating effect, with civilians being killed or maimed for years to come."
"According to the report 'Fatal Footprint', published this month by Handicap International, the Israeli defence force delivered at least four million bomblets into Lebanon between July and August this year."
"Worldwide, civilians constitute 98% of all recorded cluster bomb casualties."
"That is one of the reasons I call on the Council and the Commission to endorse the growing movement for change within the international community and the moves by countries, amongst them Belgium and Norway, to establish national legislation to ban cluster munitions from their territories and armed forces."
"I would also like to applaud the Red Cross for its campaign and call for a ban on the use of cluster bombs, for stockpiles to be destroyed and for clearance programmes to be stepped up."
"As far as biological and toxic weapons are concerned, we must put more pressure on the United States Government, which has refused to countenance a legally binding verification protocol."
"That is damaging the future of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and its credibility."
"We must also make sure that a permanent secretariat is set up to oversee the Convention's implementation."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Wallström, ladies and gentlemen, death comes in the aftermath of war, and, rather than these cluster bombs falling from the heavens on their own, we have to be aware that they are dropped by Europe's allies and that those same allies continue to manufacture and export them."
"You say that cluster bombs and unexploded munitions represent a challenge to former war zones, and that is where I have to contradict you; on the contrary, they are not a challenge to former war zones, but rather a challenge to the European Union, which must make sure that none of its Member States produces, exports or uses such weapons, and which must no longer permit its allies to do so in the way that the Americans, or the Israelis in the most recent war, have done."
"It was with this in mind and considering the European Union's inability to take action that we, a fortnight ago, wrote a letter to the Finnish Presidency - and when I say 'we' I mean not 'we Greens' but rather the coordinators of the conservatives, the socialists, the liberals and I myself - with an urgent appeal for a European position in favour of an outright ban to be tabled at this conference, which represents an historic opportunity for the prohibition of cluster munitions."
"You made it plain to this House that you were either unwilling or unable to do so."
"You say you are going to set up a working party; well, I am sure you are familiar with the saying that, setting up a working party is what you do when you do not know what to do next."
"It is also the cynical way to go about things when one bears in mind the fact that, day in and day out, the lives of civilians, police officers and UN troops sent by us to crisis-hit regions are being put at risk by what is left of these weapons."
"I would therefore like, once more, to urge you in strong terms to now seize the initiative and - since you are able to do so - ensure that the national parliaments of the EU's Member States describe these cluster munitions as what they actually are, namely as a form of weaponry worthy of being outlawed and one that Europeans must renounce once and for all, refusing to use them or accept their use in any war whatever."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group is of course in favour of a general, worldwide ban on the production and use of biological weapons and on trade in them, and we hope that the forthcoming Geneva Conference will decide to strengthen the relevant international conventions."
"I am pleased to note that the European Union is in the forefront on these issues, and I hope that the Commission will do everything humanly possible to achieve a worldwide ban on these horrific weapons."
"We have to acknowledge the fact, however, that the main stumbling block to achieving such a ban has a name that we all know: George W. Bush."
"The President of the United States is personally responsible for the US political boycott of the Geneva negotiations."
"He has, in fact, decided to pull out of the talks."
"Instead, the United States has made the build-up of their biological arsenal and the use of white phosphorus and depleted uranium a strong point in their aggressive and unacceptable military policy."
"Similarly, they have neither ratified the Mine Ban Convention nor signed the Third Protocol to the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention (CCWC), and they have also revived the Star Wars programme."
"This attitude by the United States is a threat to world security."
"The European Union needs to overcome its inertia and make putting pressure on the United States a key point in the Geneva negotiations."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki spoke of the European Union's action plan in relation to the Review Conference of the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention."
"Yet again, the European Union falsely assumes the attributes of a political state empowered to determine policy on what are military and defence measures, which are the proper responsibility of sovereign nations."
"The EU has never had to militarily defend its citizens and let us hope that it never has to, for a variety of reasons."
"Meanwhile, countries like mine, Great Britain, which are serious military powers, have to discharge that responsibility."
"Cluster bombs do indeed need greater international regulation, especially in regard to the so-called dumb bombs, which have no self-destruct mechanism."
"Britain is also a leading power in research into defence against biological and toxin weapons, and given the current terrorist threat by fundamentalist Islam, Britain has to maintain its independence and freedom of action in this sphere."
"(NL) Mr President, the manufacture and use of biological weapons used to be the preserve of states."
"These days, progress in biotechnology is such that ever fewer resources are needed to produce dangerous viruses, bacteria and poisons, and the consequence of this is that terrorist organisations, too, can resort to biological warfare."
"In March of this year, Interpol pointed out that there are serious indications that al-Qaeda is preparing to commit acts of biological terrorism."
"The scale of the destruction that could result in that way far outstrips that of the attacks in New York, Madrid and London."
"It is impossible to conclude agreements with terrorists in the same way as states do with one another."
"It is of vital importance that police forces be further trained in order to prevent and control biological terror."
"Some legislation may well need to be adapted in order to make it possible to check sensitive scientific research."
"There is still a need to give attention to the exchange of information between intelligence services within the European Union, but also with our partners in the United States, Russia and in all other nations that want to discharge their responsibilities in the fight against terrorism."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports this draft resolution, because it sees it as a decisive step in the strategy to oppose the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that was adopted by Europe in December 2003, and also because it makes reducing the biological weapons threat a top priority."
"At the same time, another important initiative is that we are calling on all countries that have not yet done so to abide by the legislation banning biological weapons, not least in order to achieve that universality that is an integral and binding part of international law."
"Within this basic framework, there are in any case measures designed to ensure that the Convention is effectively implemented, although in the most recent analysis the United States failed to comply with these measures."
"I should also like to stress the importance of the appeal made in the resolution to finalise a specific Protocol 6 unequivocally banning the manufacture and use of cluster bombs, despicable weapons even used in humanitarian wars to get round the Mine Ban Convention."
"At the same time, Europe needs to show that there is a direct link between trends towards proliferation, which must be strenuously repressed, and the failure to disarm."
"The West will have greater moral authority to oppose the proliferation of any kind of weapon if: 1) the United States stops opposing the adoption of inspection measures and the banning of cluster bombs; and 2) the disarmament process is resumed even within the nuclear club."
"What has happened today is therefore an important step, but it is merely the first on the long road towards a ban on all weapons of mass destruction."
"(ES) Mr President, like so many other instruments that regulate arms at world level, the existence of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is a necessary, though not sufficient, tool in the fight against human irrationality."
"There is therefore only one acceptable option for the sixth review conference which is to begin on 20 November: to strengthen that instrument, particularly with a view to developing genuine verification mechanisms, and to promote its universal application."
"Furthermore, with regard to cluster bombs, I can only vigorously support the call for the Convention on Inhuman Weapons to be provided with a sixth protocol. In my view, it should even be provided with a specific and complete treaty, which unambiguously prohibits the production, storage, transfer and use of this kind of weapon, as in the case of anti-personnel mines."
"In view of the indiscriminate nature of cluster bombs and the enormous impact they have on the civilian population, the use of those weapons must no longer be tolerated in any way."
"The case of Lebanon, which is currently under investigation, is just one example of many that illustrate the reason for this."
"(PT) In recent years we have witnessed the erosion of the most important legal instruments for combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is no exception."
"We are more vulnerable than ever to devastating terrorist attacks."
"The main ideas contained in this resolution, on which notable consensus has been reached across all political groups in Parliament, are decades old and applicable to other conventions, too."
"These ideas can be summed up under three headings: universalisation, application and verification."
"The notorious cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines must be combated."
"These immoral arms must also be outlawed."
