"On the point concerning the importance of research and development, I would like to stress that the R[amp]D Framework Programme has evolved over time and now incorporates specific measures for the benefit of the regions, in particular those with the weakest R[amp]D capacities."
"Likewise, the importance of an integrated EU approach to innovation, mobilising a mix of instruments from R[amp]D to cohesion policy, has been acknowledged."
"Cohesion policy, on the other hand, has substantially increased its investments in R[amp]D and innovation, up to almost EUR 50 billion in 2007-2013, in order to make it possible for all EU regions to have sufficient capacity to access the framework programme on a competitive basis."
"Regarding the issue of new indicators, I wish to underline that the cohesion policy framework was fixed from 2007-2013."
"On 7 June 2007 Commissioner Hübner will present the fourth cohesion report in Parliament's Regional Development Committee."
"Finally, I would like to assure you that I have taken due note of your suggestions, ideas and concerns, which will be forwarded to Commissioner Hübner, who will certainly give them her full attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday 22 May."
"Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - (FR) Cohesion policy, which is going to become the main item in the EU budget, must better combine the Structural Fund measures with the other Community policies, in order to increase the synergies aimed at promoting competitiveness, research and innovation in our regions."
"The structural policies conducted in the outermost regions would have an even greater impact if the Union demonstrated greater flexibility in agreeing to rid itself, as and when necessary, of certain 'Community dogmas' and in respecting the special conditions of the outermost regions, whose territories are cramped, far from the single market and subject to regular natural disasters."
"An analysis of the multiplier effect of the Structural Funds, in terms of how it attracts private investment, must make it possible to increase cooperation between the public and private sectors, for the benefit of sustainable, polycentric and balanced development in the European Union."
"Accordingly, the EU structural policy must stimulate the spirit of initiative, with the aim of developing centres of excellence in the outermost regions. It must do so by relying on sectors that make the most of their skills and know-how, such as waste management, renewable energies, student mobility, research into climate change and crisis management."
"Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EC and Denmark and Greenland (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Joop Post, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other hand C6-0506/2006."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Mr Maat, who started the work on this subject, and the rapporteur, Mr Post, for their excellent work."
"As you know, on 2 June 2006, the Commission, on behalf of the Community and Greenland, initialled a new Fisheries Partnership Agreement after three years of long and complex negotiations."
"The Agreement came into effect as of 1 January 2007 for a period of six years."
"Currently, a provisional application of the Agreement is in force through a Council decision which was adopted on 21 December 2006."
"Before making a short presentation of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Greenland, I would like to outline just a few points relating to the previous agreement, which dated back to 1985 when Greenland had left the Community."
"Shortly after the Fourth Protocol entered into force on 1 January 2001, the Court of Auditors and Parliament strongly criticised the protocols under the Greenland Fisheries Agreement for including 'paper fish', for not including the ship owners' payment and for not being transparent enough."
"As a consequence, the Commission emphasised the need for adjustments during the mid-term review of the Fourth Protocol in order to make a clearer distinction between the value for fish and support for the development of Greenland's fisheries sector."
"The revision of the Fourth Protocol led to a division of funds, under which 25 % of the financial contribution was earmarked for budgetary support to the fisheries sector."
"'Paper fish' were removed, real fish quotas and licence fees were introduced and provisions for an annual scientific review of the quotas were incorporated."
"These important changes were also incorporated into the new agreement."
"On this basis, during negotiations on the new agreement, the Commission has insisted on obtaining quotas for real fish and eliminating 'paper fish', on maintaining and even increasing the shipowners' payment and on having a clear sectoral policy programme for the fisheries sector to be supported by the Community."
"Another outcome of the mid-term review was the Council conclusions of February 2003, in which the Council stated that future cooperation between the Community and Greenland would be based on a two-pillar approach with a broader cooperation arrangement in areas other than fisheries and a fisheries agreement."
"The broader agreement takes the form of a Council decision including a joint declaration and will provide up to EUR 25 million per year to Greenland on the basis of cooperation in areas other than fisheries."
"Therefore, one can conclude that the initialling of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement does not merely represent the closure of the negotiations conducted over the past year, but also the closure of what was initialled back in 2003 with the mid-term review of the Fourth Fisheries Protocol and the Council conclusions of February 2003."
"Turning now to the new agreement, let me outline the following."
"The financial contribution of the previous Protocol was EUR 42.8 million per year, making it one of the biggest bilateral fisheries agreements."
"The value of the new protocol has decreased considerably given the changes to the Community quotas."
"Some have decreased due to the poor state of the stocks, the needs of Greenland's fishing industry and the rate of utilisation by the Community, while others have increased due to the sound state of the stocks and based on the needs of Community industry."
"As a result of these changes to the quotas, the Community's financial contribution is now EUR 15.85 million per year."
"This sum includes a specific sum of EUR 3.26 million to be used for a multiannual fisheries policy programme in Greenland."
"In addition to this contribution, a payment from ship owners of EUR 2 million in the form of licences is also expected."
"With regard to the amendments put forward by Parliament, I would like to stress that the Commission fully shares the concern of the Parliament on each amendment proposed."
"However, with respect to amendments 1-3, we feel that these are already covered in the Protocol itself and we therefore consider them unnecessary."
"Furthermore, in relation to amendments 4 and 6 on the reporting requirements to Parliament, I would like to stress that the Commission already complies with the transmission of this information in line with the current interinstitutional arrangement."
"Moreover, concerning amendment 5 on the Member States' compliance with reporting requirements, it should be stressed that the Commission already examines whether catch reporting is respected."
"In addition, it is stated in the annex and the appendix to the Protocol that vessels must comply with the reporting requirements of the previous fishing year in order to obtain a licence."
"On this basis, therefore, the amendment is not necessary."
"Finally, on amendment 7, I would like to make it clear that, given the previous criticism put forward by both the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament itself of the Commission's financial management of the external fisheries agreements, the Commission finds it hard to understand this amendment, which, in essence, is no different to the mechanism found under the modified Fourth Protocol and does not make it possible for the Commission to manage the under-utilised fishing opportunities in the best possible way."
"Therefore, taking the financial responsibility of the Commission into consideration, the Commission cannot accept this amendment."
"In conclusion, let me thank Parliament and, in particular, the members of the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur for their constructive engagement on this important fight."
"- (NL) Madam President, it is unlikely I will need all of the five minutes allocated to me."
"What the Commissioner said in this introductory speech was clear."
"The main focus of the report, which is largely the work of my predecessor Mr Maat, is the objective of fisheries policy in general - sustainable fishery, in other words - and, although the term 'sustainable' is clear, its meaning is also obvious from what Mr Borg said a moment ago and from what is stipulated in the agreement and the protocol."
"The main objective of the partnership agreement with Greenland is to strengthen relations between it and the EU."
"Cooperation based on mutual trust is called for, now more than ever."
"After all, we have all known for some time that the fishing industry is facing drastic changes in the next few years."
"Due to the reduction in fish stocks and migrating fish stocks - mainly caused by marine warming, cod being a case in point - but also due to the prescribed reduction of catch quotas, the fishing industry will need to operate differently."
"This has been made clear to the sector, and the sector, having itself also come to realise this, is increasingly taking appropriate action."
"To many fishermen, this represents a drastic change in their business operations."
"New business operations must, in future, eventually - by which I mean in the longer term - lead to an improvement in the fish yield, in other words, to sustainable fishing, where the catches from the sea are proportionate to the production and where, moreover, the industry's impact on the marine environment is minimised."
"According to the report, fishermen must become managers of the sea, rather than merely hunting fishing grounds and fish stocks."
"This requires cooperation, not only mutually, and by that I mean among Member States, but also with partners such as Greenland, particularly with a view to improving the production chain in the longer term."
"As rapporteur, I note that the Commission is committed to this, as also is the Commissioner in particular, and I note that our Committee on Fisheries has come to the same conclusion."
"I am grateful to my fellow MEPs for the constructive input and would warmly recommend the report for which Mr Maat did most of the groundwork some time ago."
"That ends my contribution, and I hope that the report will be adopted at the next plenary meeting."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, am glad to see that there are to be clear rules for the two pillars, the one being the fisheries agreement with Greenland and the other the broader cooperation agreement, and would like to say, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, that we are, of course, concerned about whether European taxpayers' money is being spent as properly as we have to want it to be."
"On the one hand, that does mean - and this is where I really do want to give you, Commissioner Borg, a lot of encouragement - that there really do have to be very precise checks on what is caught by the individual vessels, and, on the other, that illegal fishing - on which you have declared war - is avoided come what may."
"The Committee on Budgets takes the view that no more money should be forthcoming unless and until these two states of affairs are brought about, for we have to be careful that, under fisheries agreements too, European funds are indeed expended in the spirit of those agreements, in other words, that there must be no illegal fishing going on and that fish stocks must be protected, for if they are not, there will be no more work for the fishermen of the future."
"It is for that reason that combining economy and ecology here is a smart move."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, it is a great pleasure finally to be able to debate a fisheries agreement with Greenland that begins to respect the minimum rules of financial transparency and non-discrimination between shipowners and Member States."
"We must acknowledge the progress made since previous agreements, including the mid-term modification of 2003, to bring them into line - as the Commissioner has said quite rightly - with the guidelines of the Council of Ministers and the demands of the Court of Auditors and of this Parliament, which focussed essentially on that lack of budgetary transparency, the worst example of which was the institutionalised custom of paying astronomical sums for 'non-existent fisheries' or paper quotas."
"In any event, this Agreement still has too much small print and its content is still too different from other agreements."
"So that we do not have to relive past situations, therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he can commit himself to guaranteeing that we will never again have to hear about paper quotas or see grotesque situations such as that of the fishing of queen crabs - whose quotas, which had been repeatedly requested by Community shipowners, were returned in the end to Greenland unused and having cost a fortune - and whether fishing opportunities not used by the Member States to which they are allocated will be able to be used by those who request them, as happens in the case of the other agreements."
"Having said that, Mr President, it only remains for me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Post, who has had the difficult job of continuing with a report that was begun by another Member, Mr Maat, and who has done a tremendous job."
"Mr President, since I have a few seconds left, I would like once again to protest about the fact that, in this House, fisheries reports are always debated at the end of a night sitting."
"I would ask you, as a Vice-President and a Spaniard, to try to do something to ensure that this does not happen again in the future."
"Mrs Fraga, the advantage of debating at this time is that only women Members speak, because it appears that only women work at this time of night, apart from the rapporteur and the President."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, in one minute I would simply like to say that I am absolutely delighted with what Commissioner Borg has said about this Agreement."
"Just this afternoon I was looking back over my speeches on Greenland in the plenary of Parliament, in 2003 and also in 2002, and I believe that we are getting closer to what we were saying at that time and to what we have been saying since: that we want the Fisheries Agreement with Greenland to be as similar as possible to any other fisheries agreement signed by the Community."
"In this regard, I can only express my pleasure at the fact that there is finally now a balanced distribution of its cost between shipowners and the Community budget."
"I can only express my delight at the fact that the financial payments have been brought into line with the real fishing opportunities offered by Greenland and, of course, I entirely agree with the Commissioner that Amendment 7 should be rejected, because fleets without quotas must be able to take advantage of fisheries opportunities that are not used."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, the ALDE Group welcomes the fisheries partnership agreement with Greenland."
"We take this opportunity to repeat our thanks to the home rule government for the very fruitful discussions on this and other issues that a delegation from the group had with them when it visited Greenland last autumn."
"We are clear that the agreement is a matter of mutual benefit."
"However, we have serious concerns about one aspect of the regulation, namely Article 3(2)."
"This would allow the Commission to reallocate licences between Member States in cases where fishing opportunities have not been fully taken up."
"We understand the Commission's wish to ensure full value for sums expended by the Community, but we do not believe that the same procedure can be used in the case of agreements where access to resources is based on vessels and tonnage."
"The Greenland agreement is based on the purchase of quota."
"It also differs from other agreements in allowing for quota exchanges with Norway, Iceland and the Faeroes for which there is no monetary compensation."
"In addition, the parent regulation for the setting of quota entitlements allows only for Member States to exchange quota with other parties."
"Article 3(2) is therefore of dubious legality."
"It also undermines the principle of relative stability."
"Amendment 7 offers an alternative mechanism to achieve the optimal use of fishing opportunities and one that does not give rise to such problems."
"We hope that the Commission will accept that the grounds for concern are justified and that Parliament will give its support to the amendment."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur."
"In Article 3(2) of the proposal the Commission has suggested that, should quotas be under-utilised, the Commission could reallocate Member States' licences to other Member States."
"This appears to be legally questionable, a point underlined by the Council's Legal Service in a recent working group."
"As uptake is already high, it is also unnecessary and would undermine the principle of relative stability and remove the opportunity for Member States to swap quota with other Member States rather than seeing the Commission reallocate it."
"I want to keep the current mechanism, which brought about much higher rates of utilisation and preserved the respective rights and responsibilities of each party."
"The concept of relative stability is vital to the Scottish fleet and gives our fishermen the historic rights that they have enjoyed for centuries."
"Undermining this amendment puts all of this at risk and ignores the basic differences between southern fisheries agreements, where fishing licences are at stake, and northern agreements, where quota is at stake."
"I urge colleagues to support Amendment 7, which upholds the principle of relative stability and historic fishing rights."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, first of all, thank you all for your comments and for your overall support of the Commission's proposal for a revised agreement with Greenland, which is an important part of the network of fisheries partnership agreements that are currently in place."
"As I have already stated, the review was necessary for two primary reasons."
"First, we needed to ensure value for our money through better and full utilisation of fishing possibilities and second, further to a critical assessment by the Court of Auditors and by this Parliament, the Commission is obliged to inject transparency into the agreement, and we hope to have managed to do so."
"I agree that there will be scrupulous checking of the use of the fishing possibilities under this agreement and the use of the funds provided."
"I would like to stress that, regarding the financial contribution to be paid under the protocol, the Commission cannot guarantee sound financial management without having the legal basis."
"This means, in other words, that there is a need for a transfer mechanism which habilitates the Commission in case of under-utilisation and with due respect to the principle of relative stability and to Article 25 of the basic regulation to transfer in due time unutilised fishing opportunities to ensure their optimum utilisation."
"I would also underline that the new mechanism of the agreement provided in Article 3(2) is specifically to make possible maximum utilisation of fishing possibilities and to eliminate 'paper fish'."
"On the question of relative stability, raised by Ms Attwooll and by Ms Stihler, the temporary transfer of fishing possibilities from one Member State to another by the Commission is not contrary to the principle of relative stability, which, in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, governs the allocation of fishing possibilities amongst Member States."
"Such a transfer will not have any effect on the allocation of fishing possibilities between the Member States in Greenland's waters in the future."
"Each year the allocation will be done on the basis of the allocation keys - that is, on the basis of relative stability."
"The intention behind Article 3(2) is to ensure the highest possible utilisation without affecting relative stability."
"This article exists and is implemented in all other third country agreements with financial compensation."
"The only agreement which does not have this article is the current Greenland agreement."
"As the new FPA is an agreement with financial compensation and involves a significant amount of public funding, it is crucial that the Commission has the legal means to act."
"I would also like to underline that, notwithstanding the improvements that have been achieved under the existing agreement, the rate of utilisation is still not the optimum."
"Taking into account the transfers to Norway, it ranks at around 80 %."
"If one eliminates the transfers to Norway, it will go down to about 65 % utilisation, and I think that we owe it to the public to achieve much better results than that."
"Indeed, this article is subject to discussions in the Council and will be debated in the Council and decided upon, hopefully, on 11 June."
"Admittedly, the wording could be clearer and improved upon, maintaining the principle of relative stability while ensuring the highest utilisation of possibilities."
"So, we will do our utmost to achieve an agreement in the Council whereby we will polish the wording so that, without prejudicing the principle of relative stability, we will ensure the maximum utilisation of the fishing possibilities under this new agreement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday 22 May."

"(ES) Madam President, I do not intend to speak for five minutes."
"I would just like to ask you, given your generosity and knowledge of the region to which I am going to refer, to allow me to speak on a point of order."
"Madam President, I wonder whether the President of this Institution could express his support, if he has not already done so, for the Secretary-General of the United Nations', Mr Ban Ki-moon's, call for a cease to hostilities in Lebanon, which are causing huge loss of life."
"I believe that this is essential and that it would reflect the feelings of every single Member of this Parliament."
"I know that we have a debate on the situation in Palestine this afternoon, but the truth is that, at this very moment, innocent civilians are still dying in Lebanon."
"That is what I am asking for."
"Your request will be passed on to the President, who will certainly also put it to the Conference of Presidents."

"The EU's Aid for trade (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Martin, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the EU's Aid for Trade."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, before turning to the substance of this report, I should like to thank my shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in the preparation of the report and in particular to thank the Commission's Trade DG and Development DG, which, I am pleased to say, have been very keen to engage with Parliament on this particular issue."
"Finally, I should like to thank Pelayo Castro Zuzuarregui, the Parliament official I worked with on this report."
"He is leaving us for a year - we hope it is only for a year! - to work for the Spanish Prime Minister."
"I have worked with him on this report and a number of other reports; I have found it intellectually stimulating to be in his company and I wish him well."
"On the substance, Aid for Trade is a vital tool for linking developing countries to the global economy."
"However, I want to stress at the outset that it is not a substitute for the Doha Development Round, but a complement to it."
"It is clear that liberalising markets is not sufficient in itself to link developing countries into the global economy."
"You just have to look at the experience of the last 40 years: LDCs have seen their share of world trade almost halved from 1.9% to 1%, and this is despite tariff reductions following the Uruguay Round and other tariff reductions and recent efforts such as the European Everything but Arms scheme, which gives duty-free and quota-free access to developing countries."
"Therefore, liberalisation, which I would argue is important, clearly of itself has not been enough to engage the developing countries fully in the global economy."
"I also do not argue - and I want to make this clear - that Aid for Trade is of itself a panacea."
"However, it is quite clear that there is now a growing consensus on the benefits that Aid for Trade might bring."
"The WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December 2005 set out an ambitious work programme for Aid for Trade and called for more assistance to help developing countries into the global economy."
"This followed Mr Barroso's commitment at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles of GBP 1 billion of European Union money and GBP 1 billion of Member States' money to assist in the Aid for Trade budget line."
"While this is all most welcome and sounded quite dramatic at the time of the announcement, we have to realise that the increases are quite modest in substance: the European Union's contribution will increase from a base of around EUR 850 million at the moment to EUR 1 billion, while the Member States - if they deliver - will go from EUR 300 million to a EUR 1 billion."
"Last October the General Affairs Council called for a trade strategy to map out how we fulfil these pledges."
"My report indicates some of the key points I hope we will see in that strategy."
"Firstly, in relation to the scope of Aid for Trade, I want the measurement of the Barroso billion to be against the existing base, which has two categories: one being trade policy and regulation, the other trade development."
"However, I welcome the fact that the WTO task force has added three further categories: trade-related adjustment, trade-related infrastructure and productive capacity."
"These are vital aspects of the Aid for Trade agenda and I hope additional resources can be found to assist developing countries to deal with such matters as the phasing-out of preferences, reductions in government revenue as a result of tariffs being lowered, or help in adjusting to new competitive pressures due to regionalisation, such as EPAs."
"My report argues that Aid for Trade should be demand-led and country-owned."
"In this context, the WTO's enhanced integrated framework should become the key diagnostic tool for developing countries, assisting them to identify where Aid for Trade can bring maximum benefits."
"Within developing countries we must also ensure that the private sector and civil society are engaged with the process."
"While Aid for Trade undoubtedly represents a different approach to general development aid, it should, in my opinion, be based on the same fundamental principles of poverty reduction and sustainable development, and our main point of reference should continue to be the Millennium Development Goals."
"I am pleased that much of what we called for in this report was reflected in the Commission's communication published in April, and, perhaps naively, I like to believe that was part of the intense interaction between the Commission's DGs and the European Parliament."
"I hope that, when the final joint EU trade strategy is adopted over the summer, it will also be reflected in that strategy document."
"I have called in my report today for biannual reporting back to Parliament so that we can check that the Member States and the Commission have delivered on both the quality and quantity of the aid that they are promising."
"All institutions so far have shown a willingness to deliver collectively on what I believe is an important strategy that can make an important, if modest, contribution to linking the poorest countries of the world into the global trading system."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, David Martin, for what I regard as a very rich report on aid for trade."
"I am very glad that he has referred to the Millennium Development Goals, because they represent our guiding idea and targets."
"I agree with him that free trade, whilst a necessary condition for development, is not a magic wand, just as I agree with him that aid for trade, whilst a necessary component of any development strategy, is not a panacea."
"I believe that this report expresses a very strong commitment to the aid for trade agenda which I fully share."
"I have also read the very useful suggestions and guidance regarding the content of the EU joint aid for trade strategy, for which I am very grateful."
"Furthermore, I welcome Parliament's engagement in this process."
"Since 2005, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have developed a clear common vision on the main principles of aid for trade."
"We all agree that trade can be an important catalyst for growth and poverty reduction in developing countries, but the successful integration of developing countries into the world trading system requires more than better market access and strengthening of international rules."
"In this respect the General Affairs Council conclusions of 14 and 15 May this year recall the crucial role of aid for trade."
"The challenge we are now facing is to put these principles into practice in the context of the EU aid for trade strategy on which the Commission and Member States are jointly working."
"This strategy should set out a roadmap to meet our financial pledges, give guidance to improve the effectiveness of our aid, provide a framework on monitoring and reporting of aid for trade, and address the capacity of the Commission and Member States to deliver aid for trade."
"The strategy will be ready in October of this year and will then be presented at the WTO aid for trade review, so this Parliament's report is extremely timely."
"I would like to address some specific concerns raised in the report, and first of all the issue of the broadening of the scope of aid for trade in relation to the EU financial pledges."
"Let me emphasise that the credibility of our pledges is of great importance and make it crystal clear that there will be no changes to the scope of our pledge."
"The EUR 2 billion target remains related to the categories of trade policy and trade development."
"I attach great importance to the wider aid for trade agenda, which includes building productive capacities beyond trade development, infrastructure and adjustment aid."
"For these areas, which are very capital-intensive, we need clear political commitment to do more, but let me stress once again that these efforts will not be counted in relation to our financial pledges."
"Regarding the lack of additional resources for EDF funding to ACP countries, we would be happy to do more, but the Commission does not decide on the budget for the EDF."
"EU Member States do that."
"There are limited exceptions only and these are also approved by Member States and dedicated to very specific purposes such as adjustment arising from the sugar reform."
"Regarding the integrated framework, I am glad to confirm what I announced in Hong Kong."
"The Commission is ready to commit EUR 10 million over the first two years to the multilateral part of the enhanced integrated framework."
"In addition to this, the Commission will complement the multilateral window with substantial bilateral and regional funding to implement activities identified through the integrated framework and prioritised by the respective partner governments."
"We will also provide human resources and capacity in the field to contribute to a better functioning of the integrated framework."
"The issue of adjustment aid is rightly highlighted in the report."
"However, I do not agree that the EPA negotiations deserve a special mention in this context."
"Adjustment aid is relevant in relation to all external trade shocks."
"They may result from trade negotiations but could also be a consequence of unilateral reform as in the case of sugar."
"In any outcome of the EPA negotiations, the implementation of obligations of ACP partners will be phased in over a very long period and this will facilitate adjustment and identify requirements that we need to help meet."
"Finally, we noted your request to look into the IMF's trade integration mechanism as part of the EU aid for trade strategy."
"We think that this is more appropriately addressed in cooperation with other international donors, for example as part of the global aid for trade review at WTO level."
"Let me once again express my deep appreciation for this Parliament's political support for aid for trade, as well as our willingness to cooperate with the European Parliament to make further progress, and I look forward to doing so."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (NL) Mr President, the Commissioner was right to point out how trade and development cooperation are very much intertwined."
"If we want to achieve the Millennium Goals in 2015, aid and trade must - as they indeed can - complement one another."
"The developing countries need our help in order to further develop their regional markets, and the rules of origin must be improved as a matter of priority if they are to do that."
"Europe and developing partners must join forces in a bid to locate a task force for development, one that can flesh out this construction of local markets."
"This task force should be made up of experts in the area of trade and development policy, and could help develop and implement specific trade-enhancing measures."
"We should, in this context, think along the lines of alternative tax revenue, the reinforcement of the production capacity and the standardisation and creation of joint external border control."
"Human resources, in particular, should be developed further."
"Practical support of this kind would be a real help in getting the local markets and mutual trade off the ground."
"With regard to the large infrastructure, we thought the EIB was a better bet."
"This trade-specific aid should not, however, come out of our own pocket; it should not, then, be funded from the existing development budget."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants to see new funds made available for this, because otherwise, fewer funds would be available for achieving the Millennium Goals which are, after all, the chief goal to which the Commissioner, a moment ago, pledged 100% commitment, and in that respect we would like to wish him success."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, for a long time, we supported developing countries in all kinds of areas, except for that of trade."
"Partly as a result of that, countries and their economies have largely remained subsidy-dependent."
"Economic growth proves indispensable to fight poverty effectively."
"The tremendous progress which countries in Asia have made proves this point, Korea being a prime example."
"Little by little, we are finding out that trade offers immense opportunities for the economic growth of poor countries."
"Invariably, developing countries still lack the right infrastructure to be able to operate within the global market."
"This is why these countries need our support, and this is where aid for trade comes in, whose goal is to enable developing countries to function within the international market."
"Thanks to aid for trade, countries can, for example, improve the rules in areas that are related to trade, such as taxes and customs, and seeking to improve the road network and waterways, to fight fraud and corruption, and both enhance production capacity and also diversify."
"After all, many countries depend on one agricultural product only."
"The diversification of products makes for a more stable economy."
"It is also necessary to increase capacity in order to train good negotiators."
"I welcome this aid for trade initiative, because it offers poor countries aid in order to strengthen their economies and increase their independence."
"As has already been mentioned, aid for trade is not a panacea for development, but a necessary tool to allow developing countries to tap into the international market."
"I compliment Mr Martin, the rapporteur, on the report and also thank him for his good cooperation, as a result of which the report that is before us is not only sound in terms of content, but will also enjoy widespread support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in order to render this instrument effective, I would ask the Commission for a sound work programme - one that is both feasible and realistic - and for good cooperation with the Member States."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for the way he has dealt with this report."
"As ever, Mr Martin has been open and willing to engage in compromise with colleagues, producing a report which demonstrates a real consensus in the Committee on International Trade."
"That said, having asked the shadow rapporteurs not to bring forward amendments at the plenary stage in order to preserve the spirit of that consensus, it would have been respectful had the PSE Group kept to that agreement."
"Nevertheless, I think we have done enough to ensure that the consensus will hold through the plenary."
"I was unsurprised by the depth of common ground between us on the crucial issue of the EU's Aid for Trade."
"The G8 summit in Gleneagles where the Commission and EU governments both pledged EUR 1 billion in aid to the world's poorest people was preceded by a hugely popular campaign."
"Through the Make Poverty History marches, the Live Aid concerts and other efforts, millions of people have made their voices heard."
"They are angry, and right to be, about unfair trade rules and highly protected markets that work against those living in poverty and they are passionate about the need for change."
"If we are to build on the phenomenal mobilisation of public opinion, the pressure must continue at every level, domestic and international."
"The key question is whether there is the political will to drive that change."
"Aid for Trade must ensure that the poorest nations have the capacity to benefit from increased trade liberalisation, efficient customs agencies, better infrastructure, tax regimes which do not rely on import and export duties and anti-corruption measures to ensure that the money gets to the people who have earned it."
"Ultimately we will be judged not by how much is promised but by how much is delivered."
"Pledges on aid are always more easily made than kept."
"We are all too familiar with the double counting and relabelling tricks that recycle all pledges as new money."
"The EU's Aid for Trade package has a unique role to play to ensure sustainable development, growth and prosperity in the developing world."
"As such it must be new money over and above existing commitments and trends and it must not come at the cost of monies already earmarked for other crucial development projects such as health and education."
"Whilst Aid for Trade is a long-term driver of development, meeting short-term targets, such as the Millennium Development Goals, must remain central to the EU's international development policy."
"There too we must do better: some USD 50 billion more a year rather than the current commitment over a five-year period."
"If sustained political will is required to deliver Aid for Trade, then political courage is needed to ensure we deliver the MDGs in sub-Saharan Africa."
"Aid works best when it is delivering a common set of objectives agreed between donor and recipient."
"We have to concentrate on finding solutions which best fit a country's needs."
"That means responding to the demands of civil society and the private sector."
"As a Parliament, we have already thrown our weight behind the fair trade movement."
"If we are to help reduce the poverty in which they live, we need mechanisms to ensure the aid reaches the people who need it most."
"This report provides the Commission with some clear and reasonable guidelines to that end."
"It is up to you, Commissioner, to deliver on them."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we, too, wish to thank Mr Martin for the good work he has done, and I would like to begin with a positive political development."
"It is good that the 'General Affairs and Foreign Relations' Council, which is responsible, acknowledged on 15 May that reductions in tariffs made enormous inroads into the state revenues of many developing countries, and it is good that it stressed the need for, and necessity of, compensation payments to address this."
"Had it not done so, we would run the risk of our trade policy possibly bringing about the rapid collapse of any development policy whatever in the countries affected."
"It is absolutely vital that we do something about this, but for that we need additional funding that cannot be set against the development aid funds if we want to achieve the millennium development goals."
"What has to be avoided is the occurrence of a sort of 'displacement effect', with a move away from the combating of poverty and from the millennium goals campaign towards promoting an orientation towards exports."
"That would be a misconceived tendency, one that could be triggered by the injection of these two billion in the absence of deliberate political action on our part to counteract it."
"In terms of development strategy, the stabilisation of local markets takes, as a rule, precedence over the preparation of the most vulnerable and poorest countries to become exporters; what matters is that our policy be consistent."
"'Aid for Trade' must not be allowed to relativise the fight against poverty, and so it follows that additional funds are needed in order to finance it."
"It is in this regard that I would be really interested to know from which Budget lines the money is being taken."
"Moreover, 'aid for trade' must not be allowed to play a part in undermining the stabilisation of local markets, which must be at the heart of any development strategy."
"That is the Commission's task in putting into practice the wide-ranging concept of 'aid for trade' and I appeal to you, Commissioner, to pay particular attention to these aspects."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, allow me to pose the following question."
"Why should there be Aid for Trade?"
"The answer is because trade has an important role to play."
"I should now like to make a few observations."
"For centuries, sound trade has brought people together without detriment to their identity, values or social and political life."
"Europe needs to find equal partners amongst the major players on this stage and most especially amongst the lesser ones."
"Trade must be governed by clear rules that allow both sides to benefit."
"'Free and Fair Trade' is a slogan worth adopting."
"Fair trade cannot take place without the relevant infrastructure, and without agreements such as those reached in the framework of the WTO for example."
"Relevant guidelines applicable to the entire producer-consumer chain must be developed."
"It must be borne in mind that aiding trade also involves supporting our own threatened sectors such as sugar and soft fruit."
"In addition, support should be provided for cross-border exchanges between the Union and its neighbours, for example Ukraine."
"At the global level, the situation concerning exchanges is so diverse that standardisation is required."
"All citizens must be informed about these standards too."
"An aid programme should therefore be developed drawing on Europe's historical experience and the wealth of Europe's supply of goods, services and know-how."
"Funding for this programme should also be made available."
"Funding need not be on a large scale, but it is essential."
"By way of analogy I should like to point out that sound trade can do more than simply raise the standard of living, especially in poor countries, which is the focus of this."
"Sound trade can also lead to more peaceful solutions to global conflicts."
"As I conclude, I would like to mention an anecdotal assessment, namely that Ryanair does more towards bringing about a common Europe than certain European institutions, because it brings people closer together."
"Similarly, 'Fair and Free Trade' does more towards bringing about integration and well being for the people of this Earth than dubious political decisions, especially in poor countries."
"Trade is what makes the world go round."
"Europe should promote the kind of trade described, and it is the Commissioner's duty to ensure that it does so."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will not have escaped anyone in this Chamber and in the economic and productive world of the European Union that an increase in Aid for Trade may help develop the market in a freer and at the same time fairer and better controlled way."
"If the EU wishes to remain the world's top economic power and the area of greatest freedom and least social inequality, while also benefiting from the boost it has always received and continues to receive from Parliament, it must not only help to develop the ability of developing countries to promote foreign trade despite their unfortunately considerable loss of competitiveness on world markets, but it must also increase Aid for Trade in the knowledge that liberalisation and aid are not mutually exclusive initiatives."
"In this context, the not insignificant sum of EUR 2 billion is still not enough."
"We have to clarify the Aid for Trade concept itself by taking on board the conclusions of the WTO Aid for Trade Task Force on fundable projects and by integrating development policies and actual trade policies as much as possible, as envisaged in the integrated framework, not least with a view to reducing poverty."
"(PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said within the European Union about a balanced multilateral system of trade and about enabling developing countries to become involved in trade and benefit as a result."
"This concern has not, however, been accompanied by an improvement in the situation of the least developed countries."
"The opposite is the case."
"Over the last 40 years the participation of these countries in world trade has almost halved, falling from 1.9% to 1%."
"It is also the case that powerful large chain stores have caused the demise of small traders and that income has been transferred away from less developed countries."
"That much is abundantly obvious."
"These facts indicate clearly that globalisation and liberalisation of trade serves to concentrate capital in stronger countries and to increase poverty in less developed ones."
"We have noted a new approach to trade by the European Union in recent years."
"This approach is characterised by a desire to export industrial products at the expense of agricultural ones."
"It is gradually leading to a loss of food security for the Union in general and for the new Member States in particular."
"It is therefore essential for the European Union to adopt a new approach to international trade and for work on the implementation of national strategies for trade development to be undertaken."
"(EL) Mr President, no one doubts that aid for trade is a particularly important initiative."
"It helps to bring about the more complete and effective integration of developing countries, especially the less developed countries, into the multilateral trade system."
"As we have heard, trade is not a panacea for development."
"However, it can strengthen the economic and general development of recipient states."
"The special and differentiated treatment of developing countries within the framework of the WTO is necessary to a degree, especially as regards the less developed countries."
"It should, nonetheless, be pointed out that their assumption of multilateral commitments and their compliance with WTO rules are an incentive for reform which will turn out to be to the benefit of the developing countries themselves."
"The gradual opening up of their markets and an outward-looking economic and trade policy help to strengthen their competitiveness, allowing the transfer of technology and know-how."
"The developing countries do, however, appear to be extremely reticent at multilateral negotiations to heed calls for them to open up their markets."
"For this reason, aid for trade is of decisive importance in encouraging these countries to respond to new obligations and to apply multilateral trade rules, to mitigate the cost of their adapting to reforms and to integrate trade into their development policies more effectively."
"It goes without saying that aid for trade must be accompanied by appropriate internal policies in developing countries, so that they maximise the result."
"The European Union is being called upon to play a leading role in this endeavour, in order to formulate an effective, cohesive and targeted aid for trade agenda."
"To close, I should like to congratulate Commissioner Mandelson for supporting this initiative and for linking the external aspects of competitiveness with internal initiatives for the benefit of the competitiveness of the European economy, which was the subject of our previous debate."
"(LT) First I would like to congratulate the Member States and the Commission for making a commitment to increase the funds allocated for assistance to business to two billion euros by the year 2010."
"This is a serious commitment, and in implementing it a great deal of coordination will be required."
"In order to achieve this goal, a common European Union strategy is essential, which will have to set out the ways in which the stated goal is going to be achieved."
"I also congratulate the Committee on International Trade for its timely report in which the committee presented Parliament's views regarding the complex issue of assistance to business."
"I support the proposal that the Commission present reports to Parliament twice every year."
"These reports should assess progress in the EU's granting of assistance to business."
"Although the commitments I mentioned were made by various countries according to the traditional definition of assistance to business handed down by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, in future there is a need to look more closely at the WTO's conclusions and the suggested widening of this definition to include 'business infrastructure' and 'creative productivity possibilities'; in other words, to do everything possible to ensure that assistance to business is all-encompassing, more flexible and more effective."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is today displaying ambitious commitments where development is concerned."
"I welcome this because there is an urgent need to help developing countries to reduce poverty, to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to benefit from sustainable economic growth."
"Let us therefore hope and pray that these objectives are translated into concrete and effective action."
"In this connection, we can only welcome the commitments made to increase aid for trade."
"I should like to highlight some points that justify the essential nature of this instrument."
"This instrument meets, firstly, the requirement for consistency, which must guide the EU's external actions: by interlinking the various areas of its external action, the European Union corresponds to two principles, those of producing better legislation and of increasing the effectiveness of its aid."
"This instrument also deals with the reality of the multilateral trade system by helping developing countries and the least advanced countries to benefit from the advantages resulting from market access."
"Finally, this instrument helps implement trade agreements."
"One might mention at this point the WTO agreements or the economic partnership agreements."
"Aid for trade thus helps to make international trade an instrument for reducing poverty through economic development."
"Finally, if it is to be effective, aid for trade must meet several urgent needs: it must be accompanied by practical commitments, not least those promoting technical assistance; its implementation must be controlled and monitored and it must strengthen local ownership and results-focused management."
"This is crucial if aid for trade is to enable developing countries to benefit from the advantages resulting from the multilateral trade system and to provide themselves with the means actually to increase their capacities in the trade arena."
"Let us therefore call on all the parties involved not to relax their efforts, so that aid for trade is able to keep its promises."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome and commend all those who have spoken on this subject this morning."
"I do not find myself in disagreement with anyone who has contributed."
"I agree, for example, with Mr Papastamkos, who said it is very important that, when we are pursuing trade and reform policies of our own, we are able to put in place flanking measures properly supported with adequate funds which enable developing countries to adjust to those reforms too."
"I agree with Mrs Saïfi that this has to be a results-driven process, which is why I attach importance to proper reporting as part of an effective aid-for-trade monitoring and reporting pillar, both in respect of what we do in the EU and in relation to the WTO."
"If I might, though, just make two responses: first of all, to those who have questioned whether there is any question of double counting, recycling of money, robbing Peter to pay Paul or robbing Paul to pay Peter (which might be preferable!) - in fact neither is happening."
"Aid for trade, in our view, should never imply less aid for other sectors."
"The increases in aid for trade for both the Commission and the Member States are less than the overall ODA budget increases."
"Therefore, there is no need to reallocate resources from other sectors to meet the aid-for-trade pledges."
"Secondly, one or two Members raised the issue of fair trade."
"In my view, our strategy should confirm full support for any activity which involves the private sector - especially SMEs - and civil society to ensure that aid for trade facilitates the creation and growth of enterprises to compete in international markets, for example, voluntary initiatives such as fair trade, eco-labels and comparable corporate scheme standards."
"The strategy should also address related issues of labour market and social adjustment and the ILO's core labour standards."
"Last of all, I think that Max van den Berg's point about rules of origin, their improvement and simplification is very important."
"It is something on which I have focused and not made, along with my colleagues in the Commission, as much progress to date as I would like to have done, and we need to add speed."
"Lastly, I think Mr Schmidt made some important points about aid for trade and its possible impact on local markets, and I shall certainly reflect on those."
"But I would like to thank David Martin once again for what has been an excellent and welcome report."
"Commissioner Mandelson's speech ends the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"The economic partnership agreements (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on Economic Partnership Agreements."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, this is a particularly important report."
"The Commission, including the Commissioner himself, and I have worked very closely on it."
"This report highlights the complexity of establishing a forward programme for trade relations between the EU and the ACP, two very different and largely unequal groups which share a common goal to strengthen trade as a means of real development."
"Idealistic as this may sound, I have received a great deal of support from both the Commission and the representatives of the ACP regions and, despite the many concerns expressed by NGOs and political groups, they and I, and I am sure the Commission, remain optimistic."
"EPAs have moved very slowly because of the conflicting ideas on a number of issues including regional integration, identification of sensitive products and preparing concrete and detailed proposals for EPA-related support."
"The ACP has been asked to do a great deal and too often the institutional infrastructure and lack of capacity has raised questions as to whether these proposals will contribute to their development in a manner that they want."
"The January 2008 deadline is obviously what makes this year so crucial for EPAs."
"Time is running out."
"Negotiators must press on to reach a mutually beneficial settlement on EPAs that will help ACP countries develop and support international trade relations."
"In the event that some regions need more time, I believe it is incumbent on both parties to seek to ensure that ACP exports to the EU should not be harmed."
"This should be the objective, not discussing the feasibility of another WTO waiver, although I appreciate that the Commission is continuing to focus on reaching the deadlines."
"However, I am anxious to know what provisions have been outlined for these regions which find themselves without an agreement."
"My report makes a number of recommendations: simplified, liberalised and more flexible rules of origin, full duty-free, quota-free market access for the ACP, workable safeguards, dispute settlement and monitoring mechanisms with transparent provisions and a real power to act in the event of changes caused by EPAs having a harmful effect on sectors of ACP economies."
"These are the positive aspects and need to be correctly framed in negotiations."
"We need to know how these mechanisms will work and to build trust and ensure that Europe will be as keen to help implement these mechanisms as the ACP countries."
"We have recognised that, if EPAs are to be successfully concluded, there must be more ACP engagement than has been demonstrated throughout these negotiations."
"Only a true partnership will ensure these agreements are beneficial to all parties."
"The official EPA review due to be completed last December failed to provide a full and comprehensive report of the status of negotiations."
"This is far from encouraging and I am curious as to what precedence this sets in the actual signing of the agreements."
"It is clear that additional resources will be needed to cope with the effects of change ushered in by EPAs."
"The scaling-up of trade facilitation, technical assistance and support to help ACP producers meet EU standards must be sufficiently extensive to offset losses from tariff revenues and help ACP countries take advantage of market access."
"In the first instance this requires greater efforts to ensure that funds already promised are spent in a timely and effective manner."
"The EU must be accountable for all of its development assistance and, together with the ACP, must set clear goals that boost ACP competitiveness and growth."
"EPAs have an essential role to play as instruments for development and, appropriately designed, they represent an opportunity to revitalise ACP-EU trading relations, promote economic diversification and regional integration, and reduce poverty in ACP countries."
"I mentioned in my speech that the EU must be accountable."
"This is taxpayers' money, and democratic accountability is of concern to all of us and is essential."
"We have failed in many respects to help ACP countries; now I believe we have a real chance to do something that will really make a mark, provided we have the goodwill of all of them."
"Unfortunately I have to leave now to go back for personal reasons."
"I have worked very closely with the Commission and the Commissioner."
"I think we have had a very good understanding and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them."
"I hope that we can continue to work in that manner."
"Mr President, I regard this report as very constructive, very realistic and very welcome."
"As I said earlier this year in the Committee on International Trade, Mr Sturdy's is a contribution which helps us look afresh at the challenges we face in these difficult, time-pressured talks."
"Yes, the EPA negotiations have moved slowly - more slowly, frankly, than anyone could possibly justify."
"But at the same time we have to recognise that these agreements are new, innovative and ambitious."
"When change is involved, people inevitably are uncertain and, therefore, want to tread carefully."
"We need to balance our need to complete these negotiations on time with our need to respect others' uncertainties."
"I fully agree with the starting point of the report, that appropriately designed EPAs are an opportunity to revitalise ACP-EU trading relations."
"In fact, I would say that they are our only real opportunity to stop the further slide of ACP trade into the commodity dependence and decreasing diversification that have typified ACP trade over the last quarter of a century."
"We looked for alternatives, and there is no shortage of suggestions and ideas."
"None provides the legally secure trade regime or links to development that EPAs do."
"None tackles the divisions between ACP countries in trade regimes that prevent regional markets emerging and lock countries into a North/South dependency."
"So I am pleased that the report recognises the good faith and ambitious approach that we have taken."
"At the same time it recognises that trade is not the panacea for development."
"Only domestically driven policy reform built on firm foundations of good governance and an enabling environment for business and investment can secure the economic growth and development which the ACP countries seek."
"But I also agree that trade is critical to support and build on this reform and, in so doing, deliver inclusive growth and jobs."
"That is why I am determined that we will take the opportunity that EPAs present to us."
"The development dimension of EPAs is in using market access, not merely granting it."
"It is investment finance, not merely development aid."
"This needs new rules fit for a globalised world, and this is why I am so keen that EPAs address issues such as competition policy, public procurement and trade facilitation."
"But we know our partners' limits and will work with them to phase in change and to identify regionally specific needs and solutions."
"No one is talking about immediate overnight change or imposing rules."
"But we will keep talking."
"To turn away in the face of challenge would be to neglect our duty to give the ACP the economic future they deserve."
"We want to secure sustainable development, not unsustainable poverty."
"The Sturdy report calls for full duty-free, quota-free market access into Europe, and this is what we propose."
"The Commission's market access offer was made in April and proposes full access for all products with transitions for sugar and rice to protect the managed markets that the ACP rely on."
"This delivers on our promises to take the greatest commitments on market access and hand the full flexibility of WTO rules on exclusions and implementation over to the ACP themselves."
"Everyone will be aware of the importance the ACP rightly attach to additional development support in this negotiation."
"This is a point on which Robert Sturdy sets out some very useful proposals."
"Funding is important."
"We must help the ACP grasp the new trading opportunities that EPAs will provide."
"The EPAs will not fail for lack of financial assistance - that I can guarantee."
"As part of this, we have suggested that EPA regional funds be established by each of the negotiating regions in order to build a tailor-made instrument, in line with international standards but owned and run by the ACP with ease of use."
"These funds, which would also be available to channel the support of other donors, could include institutional support to ensure that the capacity to implement the EPAs is there: private sector competitiveness - from access to finance to industrial retooling, to improving SPS standards; and helping out financially in those countries which face a fiscal challenge with the lowering of tariff barriers as revenues are shifted from governments to consumers."
"So our ambition is clear: to build, through EPAs, a trade and development instrument which galvanises investment flows, internal demand, private sector activity and job creation and, in so doing, builds a sustainable fiscal base for ACP governments to operate, to provide basic services and to determine their own economic future free of WTO waivers, concessions and constraints."
"Let me finish on a broader political point."
"There has been criticism, including from Members of this Parliament, of these negotiations, and concerns, particularly from our ACP partners, about the content, in some respects, of the negotiations."
"But we are now making headway in these negotiations."
"There is a positive dynamic to the negotiations."
"We have the real prospect of cementing a deep partnership for development between the EU and the ACP."
"The consequences of failure would be highly damaging to the EU and to the goal of balanced, dynamic growth in the ACP."
"That is why I welcome this report and Parliament's support in delivering these agreements."
"I would like to express again my appreciation for the argument and the proposals and recommendations contained in it."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a preliminary point, I should like to excuse my fellow Member, Mrs Sudre, who has been held up by a meeting with our new Prime Minister of France, Mr Fillon."
"She would have liked to have spoken on the subject of the particular circumstances of the Union's outermost regions, which are particularly dear to her heart."
"I should also like to congratulate my friend, Mr Sturdy, on the scope and quality of his work in this excellent own-initiative report."
"Our Union must conclude economic partnership agreements, or EPAs, with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, or the ACP countries."
"These agreements are designed to strengthen economic growth, regional integration and the fight against poverty in six of the world's major disadvantaged areas."
"In line with the spirit of Cotonou, we need constantly to point out that the EPAs must not amount to mere free trade agreements, under the World Trade Organisation, but must represent a genuine partnership, making it possible to develop a new intervention framework that is conducive to the development of the ACP countries' economies and, therefore, to consolidate peace, not least on the African continent, with a regional integration dynamic."
"Due to their geographical location, near many ACP countries, the overseas communities, whether they belong to the EU or not, must be at the heart of these preferential and reciprocal agreements."
"It is imperative that the particular circumstances of the outermost regions and overseas countries and territories be taken into account as part of these negotiations, on the basis of Article 299(2) and (3) of the Treaty."
"The outermost regions and overseas countries and territories must be involved as far upstream as possible in the negotiations so that market access differentiations can be considered and their respective support arrangements coordinated, for the purposes of integrating them more into their regional environments."
"It is in this connection, ladies and gentlemen, that I encourage you to support the amendments co-signed by Mrs Sudre and Mr Sturdy, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and designed to strike an intelligent balance between the regional integration of these outermost territories and the historical and geopolitical links uniting them with Europe."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mr Sturdy."
"Everyone agrees that trade can help fight poverty."
"Unfortunately, the trade benefits for ACP countries, for which the Cotonou Agreement provides, have little effect in practice; nor, in fact, does the 'Everything but Arms' initiative."
"This is all attributable to the deficient trade situation in the developing regions in question, the high, standardised European import requirements and the rules of origin that have, to this day, not been reviewed or tailored to practical situations."
"It is because of these problems that the ACP countries are not operating within the world economy; if anything, they are moving away from it."
"For this reason, the debate on the economic partnership agreements should not, in the first instance, be about acquiring free-trade agreements, but rather about concluding development contracts."
"What should be central in these development contracts is trade development within the own region, including the institutional framework and personal means that are difficult to establish, along with the Millennium Goals."
"Not until much later can we consider opening the markets for the EU."
"This is, as we see it, where the problem lies."
"Everything seems to be geared towards 1 January 2008, which is, of course, logical, because the deadline expires on 1 January, but meanwhile, the flexibility now on offer in the negotiations is, in actual fact, insufficiently tied to development indicators and much more to vague time indications."
"The idea of 25 years has been floated, although this has not been mentioned explicitly anywhere."
"Is the Commission prepared to link EU access to the markets in question to a development benchmark, so that we are certain that the local markets over there are ready for this?"
"With regard to the regions that ultimately decide against a European Partnership Agreement (EPA) - and we would like to reiterate the negotiations on this subject enjoy our unqualified support - but if it is decided not to conclude an EPA, is the Commission also prepared to make a point of accepting the alternative of a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP+)?"
"We are familiar with the technical discussion, but as we see it, disregarding bananas and sugar - as these have been taken out of the equation in practice, not least by us - this is very much a real alternative to the current trade conditions."
"If the EU is prepared to commit to a rapid reform of the rules of origin - and this is something which the Commissioner confirmed in a different debate a moment ago - then this could well mean that we can make some headway in this respect."
"Turning to the Singapore themes, I think it is wonderful, of course, if regions would like to do something with these at any time."
"There is nothing wrong with that, although we should not impose anything."
"It is of the utmost importance to meet the deadline of the EPA negotiations, as I pointed out before."
"This is why we actually want to focus on development contract thinking, in which respect the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has advised that we should give ourselves room during the negotiations and time, content and money, and conclude a negotiation contract in the true sense of the word."
"If the EPA were to turn out this way, this would be fantastic; if not, it is simply not a good offer."
"I would also urge you to bring the GSP+ to the negotiating table as a real alternative, and talk about it openly in the debates."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the approach he has taken."
"Mr Sturdy's approach in taking the Barbados resolution of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly as a starting point ensured that this report moved forward from a place of compromise."
"As a whole, my group was satisfied with the tone and balance of the point, which is why we have not tabled any amendments."
"However, we remain concerned about a key contradiction within the report and within the conduct of the negotiations themselves: on the one hand, we urge negotiators to intensify efforts to complete the negotiations before the end of this year; yet, on the other hand, we call on the Commission not to exert undue pressure on the ACP countries."
"Both are accurate statements, but surely there can be nothing more pressing than a ticking clock with no acceptable deal on the table and no apparently suitable alternatives coming forward."
"The Commissioner is familiar with the difficulties that deadlines present."
"We are not only dealing with the EPAs negotiations, but in the background we have timetables for regional integration and, of course, the troubled Doha Round."
"The fact that we do not have a WTO agreement has made these negotiations even harder, as the ACP cannot yet predict what they will get - if anything - out of Doha."
"Through all this, however, runs the thread of development."
"To make increased liberalisation a driver of poverty reduction and economic growth, the European Union must integrate its trade and development policies, and nowhere is that more important than with the ACP and EPAs."
"The EU is being accused of putting the year deadline before development."
"To counter such accusations I urge the Commissioner to demonstrate the Commission's flexibility and commitment to the ACP's concerns by undertaking a genuine exploration of development-oriented alternatives to the EPAs and, at the very least, if we do not have a workable agreement by the deadline, according to Cotonou we must provide at least equivalent market access to the ACP on 1 January 2008."
"The European Union has the resources to undertake such an exercise."
"Meanwhile the ACP is struggling on a financial and technical basis."
"We have already spent a great deal of time discussing the EU's aid for trade this morning and the two rapporteurs worked closely to ensure that these two reports went hand in hand."
"The EU's aid for trade programme is crucial to enabling the least-developed countries in the ACP to maximise on the benefits of increased liberalisation, and the Council has already confirmed that a substantial share of the increased trade-related assistance will be devoted to the ACP countries."
"The ACP will continue to require substantial development assistance to address their supply-side constraints to trade beyond the next EDF."
"I would like to see the Commission and the Member States work towards significantly increasing the amount of aid for trade available as demand from ACP States increases through implementation of the EPAs."
"We must, however, acknowledge the moral difficulties of a major donor sitting across the negotiating table from a key recipient of aid for trade."
"The Commission must not manipulate the prospect of aid by linking future development assistance to concessions made by the ACP in EPAs."
"Aid, by its very definition, can be used as a carrot, but it must under no circumstances be used as a stick if the EPAs are not concluded before the end of the 2007 deadline."
"Aid for trade works best when it is delivering a common set of objectives between donor and recipient."
"With the Committee on International Trade and Parliament's delegation to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, the Commissioner has a breadth and depth of parliamentarians with the expertise and willingness to engage with him on EPAs."
"As the clock keeps ticking, I urge the Commissioner to work with them to find a development-oriented solution to EPAs which ultimately fits in with the needs of the ACP."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sturdy's report on Economic Partnership Agreements provides an accurate account of the current state of affairs."
"Despite strong European Union commitment, the present situation is not good."
"Cooperation based on agreements that fail to take account of the global market and of the principles laid down by the WTO does not bode well for partnership agreements within the ACP framework."
"European Union aid to these countries should aim first and foremost to stimulate production that will not represent competition for EU producers."
"It must not, therefore, create a conflict of interests."
"The products concerned may be sold on the European Union's market on the basis of multi-annual agreements."
"I could mention mining products and biofuels by way of an example."
"In addition to humanitarian aid, the main priority for these countries is assistance in job creation."
"Partnership agreements with ACP countries should be in line with the European Union's economic strategy."
"New agreements should be based on principles laid down by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the ACP."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, negotiations are now entering upon a crucial stage, and they must not be allowed to fail, but it is also clear from what we are constantly told that the great pressure of time is proving too much for the weaker ones among our partner countries."
"That is why we need a consciously more flexible way of planning trade beyond the first day of January 2008."
"We should learn from the errors of the Doha round, when there was a date set in stone that was then overshot."
"Given the intermediate results that have been achieved, it will not be difficult to explain that to the World Trade Organisation."
"There has been talk here of alternatives such as the extension and further development of GSP+, and that might be one possible way ahead, one for which we have to prepare ourselves, for it must not come as a surprise."
"We should stop overburdening the negotiations with the rules for investments in the services sector, which makes them all the more difficult and, far from helping us to conclude them speedily, prevents us from concentrating on the essentials."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic partnership agreement negotiations as conducted by the Commission with the backing of the Council are threatening the economic and food sovereignty of the ACP countries and jeopardising any remaining possibility for these countries to consolidate their own productive sectors by increasing the added value of their own production; they are thus leaving them open to the risk of further deindustrialisation."
"The social and environmental impacts of indiscriminately opening up local markets to international investment, which is mainly directed towards natural resources and the produce of the land itself, would exacerbate the lack of any effective economic return for the people of those countries."
"The only ones to benefit would be the large European multinationals."
"On chapters such as the so-called Singapore issues, the trade in services and intellectual property rights, we will, moreover, have even stricter rules than those set by the WTO itself."
"A WTO Plus agreement will push the people of Africa even further into the abyss of poverty."
"The stability of entire rural communities is at risk in Africa, as are thousands of manufacturing jobs."
"Without work, there is nothing left for people to do but migrate, trying their luck on those dilapidated boats that have again invaded Europe's Mediterranean shores in recent days."
"As the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we are calling for the EPA negotiations as they have been set up to be closed and for a new start to be made on different bases, focusing on social justice, solidarity and the self-development of peoples."
"In our view it is inconceivable and illogical that, while the Doha Round talks are stuck, the Commission should not want the EPA negotiations to allow for any departure from the negotiating deadline."
"The whole European Union should instead do all it can within the WTO to gain recognition for a transitional regime, under which a trade preference system benefiting the ACP countries will be maintained until such time as a new agreement is finalised."
"For all these reasons, and for others that I have no time to mention here, my group has decided to vote against the Sturdy report."
"(PL) Thank you, Mr President."
"I take the floor also in my capacity as a member of the permanent delegation of the European Union to the ACP countries."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement, and I endorse its main points."
"Special thanks are due to the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy."
"This is a very good and extensive report, but it contains 53 detailed points."
"It almost amounts to negotiating instructions."
"I would like to highlight the professionalism of the work undertaken, but I am concerned about a certain political aspect that ought to emerge from a European Parliament report."
"I should like to refer to what I believe to be the five most important points regarding the effect we, the European Parliament, can have on the negotiations."
"Firstly, it is essential to clarify the sustainable development aspect of Economic Partnership Agreements."
"It is not currently all that clear to the countries we are negotiating with."
"Secondly, it must be understood that opening the market in the framework of the Economic Partnership Agreements, simply opening up the market, does not by itself improve competitiveness."
"It is very important for our partners in the ACP countries to understand this too."
"Thirdly, we should find ways to encourage reforms in those countries, by way of preferences, incentives, and also through scientific and educational aid and personal exchanges."
"This is all about general civilisational development, which is sometimes even more important than opening the market to products."
"Fourthly, we should protect certain specific and sensitive sectors such as agriculture in those countries."
"We must provide protection for particular social groups."
"Some of these, for example women, may also be threatened in the framework of individual provisions."
"Special preferences must be arranged for medicines and health care related issues."
"My fifth and last point is that integration and regional cooperation out there, on the ground, is fundamental."
"Our European Union also developed primarily on the basis of mutual cooperation and we must emphasise that."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiation of the economic partnership agreements between the Commission and the ACP countries is giving rise to the deepest concerns among these countries and is taking place in a climate that is incompatible with the historical partnership relationship that unites us."
"Europe is perceived as seeking to impose at any price free trade areas on countries that are among the poorest in the world, and under its conditions."
"The relationship of trust with the ACP countries is now at stake."
"We must re-open the negotiations on new foundations so as to address the concerns raised in the ACP countries concerning the impact of the EPAs on the future of their economies, many sectors of which could not withstand the lowering of customs protections or a situation in which they face uncontrolled competition with the European economy."
"The Commission must revert to the principles laid down in the Cotonou Agreement."
"The aim is development, not reciprocity when it comes to opening up markets."
"Such a principle would be at odds with the aim set, given the inequalities in development that will not disappear in 20 years' time."
"Thus, these countries must have the opportunity to choose between an EPA and another form of preferential agreement."
"We must offer those who have not signed an EPA by the end of 2007 market access that is at least equal to the preferences from which they benefit now, with none of them having to find themselves back in a more unfavourable situation at the end of the agreements."
"Furthermore, services and the Singapore issues should not be included in the negotiations."
"The only obligation in terms of compliance with the WTO rules concerns the preferences granted for trade in goods."
"These issues were taken out of the negotiations within the WTO, at the request of the developing countries."
"They should not be re-introduced suddenly for the ACP countries."
"These issues are first and foremost the responsibility of the regional groupings of the ACP countries, whose sovereignty should be respected in this matter."
"The Commission must therefore withdraw them from the negotiations."
"Furthermore, the parliaments of the ACP countries and the European Parliament, together with civil society, must have access to all the elements of the negotiations and must be consulted and involved as they take place."
"Finally, if longer deadlines are needed in order to do a proper job of negotiating good economic partnership agreements, then the Commission must demonstrate flexibility and defend the principle of this before the members of the WTO."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Sturdy has written a balanced report which also accommodates the fair criticism voiced by the ACP partners to the effect that, during the negotiations, the EU does not listen enough to their complaints and is instead far too ready to impose things unilaterally."
"I should like to touch upon an aspect that is often overlooked, namely the regional aspect of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA): reinforcing south-south trade."
"The development goals can only be achieved if the objective of EPAs is to encourage good economic management, promote the regional integration of the ACP economies and attract and hold onto more investments."
"Timely and effective aid for trade is a conditio sine qua non if the trade potential of the ACP regions is to be increased."
"In this connection, I would remind the Commission of its President, Mr Barroso's, pledge to grant the developing countries EUR 1 billion in trade support."
"The fact that the Council agreement on the forthcoming financial perspectives has made insufficient provision for the proposed EUR 190 million needed annually for countries from the sugar protocol is not a good sign."
"After all, keeping one's promise is a matter of elementary credibility, and it could well determine whether the negotiations succeed or fail."
"(SV) There are three key concepts that the Commission needs to bear in mind in the negotiations: to listen, not to compel and not to become stressed."
"We must listen to the ACP countries' demands."
"These negotiations are not conducted on an equal footing."
"You, Mr Mandelson, have hundreds of experts at your disposal."
"The ACP countries, for their part, have just a few."
"We have huge economic power."
"They have only the beginnings of trade and industry."
"We can buy up the whole of their trade and industry."
"They are scarcely able to buy food for the day."
"When conditions differ so greatly, it is important for us to listen to their demands and to try to meet them."
"Economic Partnership Agreements must exist to promote their development, not to increase our profits."
"We must not, therefore, engage in compulsion."
"If they do not wish to open up a market, we must do as is stated in paragraph 17 of the resolution and not force them to do so."
"All trade experts educated in neo-liberal thinking believe that reduced tariffs are always a good thing and that free trade is always better than fair trade, but the reality shows that that is not the case."
"Moreover, it is reality that our negotiating partners inhabit."
"Mistaken liberalisation can lead to people's deaths."
"You can explain what you believe, but allow them to take the decisions."
"If they are wrong, the mistake is theirs."
"It is easier to live with deficiencies for which one is oneself responsible and which one can change than to live in extreme poverty imposed by others."
"Reciprocity is unnecessary."
"Allow them to decide about it for themselves."
"We can live with or without reciprocity, but they can die because of it."
"Finally, we must not become stressed."
"I therefore hope that the House will delete recital F and approve Amendment 4."
"Allow the negotiations to take the time required and, in the meantime, allow the General System of Preferences to remain in place."
"They can then safely continue to sell to us without having a sword of Damocles hanging over them."
"Together with the ACP countries, we 27 EU countries constitute a dominant group within the World Trade Organisation."
"If we wish, we can together say that we need to extend the period of the negotiations or else devise alternatives to economic partnership agreements."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, when the WTO ruled that the customs advantages conferred by the countries of the EU on their former colonies amounted to putting other developing countries at a disadvantage, it was not calling for a new world order."
"I believe, Commissioner, that you are overestimating by far your authority's competence in matters of planning."
"The EPA drafts that you have now slapped down on the table in front of the negotiating parties constitute a manifest over-reaching of your negotiating mandate."
"Treating our own experience in Europe with complete disregard, you seem to want to force through a global patchwork rug of alliances between states founded solely on economic considerations, and so, by not giving your partners even the first chance to find common social and political ground, you are putting European businesses at a massive competitive advantage."
"I, for one, repudiate the idea of forcing our partner countries to accept conditions of the kind that the radical free-market elements have not managed to get accepted even within the EU."
"No pretence is made that your regulations for public contracts are anything other than means towards the wedging open of the market; you may be putting two boxers in a ring, but one of them weighs 100 kg more than the other."
"I call on you, then, to suspend all negotiations on matters over and above customs tariffs and use your power to get the WTO reordered so as to take more account of the demands of development."
"Mr President, I would like to join with those who have congratulated Robert Sturdy on what I think is a good report."
"The report correctly stresses that these are negotiations that are being conducted between unequal partners and it has been a theme of many of the other contributors this morning."
"I think the fact that the Commission and the ACP countries perceive the negotiations from a different standpoint is at the heart of many of the problems."
"If we look at the end of the year deadline, the perception of the Commission is that the deadline is an essential tool for meeting its WTO obligations."
"From the viewpoint of many of the ACP countries on the other hand, the deadline is being used to rush them into agreeing unsuitable agreements, and the Commission, I think, has to do much more to reassure the ACP countries that the deadline is not and will not be used to browbeat the ACP countries into agreements that they cannot otherwise live with."
"On the situation with aid, the Commission says, and Commissioner Mandelson repeated this morning, that the negotiations will not fail for lack of money."
"But it is unfair to expect ACP countries to make long-term decisions on liberalisation and regional integration without having a long-term view of the amount of assistance that would be available to help them put together the regional regulatory frameworks to instigate new methods of collecting government revenues to make up for the loss of the tariff income or to construct a type of infrastructure which we know from our own experience in the EU is so important to developing our regional economy."
"When we move on to the issue of market access, I have heard the Commissioner say in this Chamber that the European Union has no offensive trade objectives with ACP countries."
"But again, when we hear from negotiators, their perception is that the Commission is pushing them very hard to open up our services markets and to make other market-opening offers."
"I say all this in a genuine spirit of belief that the Commission wants a pro-development package with the six regions."
"The Commission believes it is acting in the interests of the ACP countries, but it must understand that negotiations between unequal partners create suspicion in the weaker partner."
"When we talk about deadlines, they see threats, when we are vague on the aid package, they see linkage between the amount of market-opening they are prepared to offer and the size of their aid package."
"If we are to overcome these concerns, then we must bring more openness and transparency to the talks themselves and we must promise that once we conclude the talks, that there will be parliamentary oversight to the finally concluded agreements so that they can be reassured that parliamentarians will be involved in this process from their implementation."
"Mr President, following the progress of the EPA negotiations has been like living in two parallel universes."
"On the one hand, there have been many statements from the ACP side that the process lacks the development focus it is supposed to have."
"The ACP countries insist that they are being put under pressure to negotiate on the Commission's terms and they are particularly concerned that the Commission has failed to give time for proper impact assessments and has dismissed any assessments that were not in line with its own position."
"On the other hand, strangely, the Commission has maintained throughout that no one is complaining or asking for alternatives to EPAs."
"However, the January 2007 review of EPAs by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa was clear."
"This external and independent review concluded that there was a failure of the negotiations to have a development focus and an excessive focus on trade liberalisation alone."
"Given this external UN assessment, I do not see how the Commission can keep on maintaining that the EPA negotiations have a positive dynamic and that everything is rosy."
"Mr President, I trust that the Commission will take note of the concerns that many- indeed, the vast majority of - Members of Parliament have raised this morning."
"The EPA negotiations are clearly at a very critical stage, and this week European Union and ACP ministers meet in Brussels to review progress, at a time when, as others have said, they are under intense pressure to conclude by the end of 2007."
"The reality is, of course, that even where technically they are well prepared, ACP countries still face serious political issues which remain between ACP member states, within governments in the ACP, between governments and private sector, civil society and regional integration organisations."
"David Martin raised some very important points about the level of suspicion and anxiety that exists in ACP countries."
"In the last few weeks I have been in both west and east Africa and, from the Prime Minister of Senegal, to the President of Ghana, to the Tanzanian Minister of Trade, the message was exactly the same: there are too many unresolved issues."
"On aid for trade: is it new money?"
"Is it predictable?"
"When is it going to be on the table?"
"On levels of regional integration, in Tanzania I learnt of the enormous problems there and of the new east Africa configuration which they are planning for and have, I think, written to the Commissioner about."
"Then there are the Singapore issues, which others have mentioned and which are currently causing enormous difficulties in the SADC negotiations."
"Most ACP member states have welcomed duty-free, quota-free access."
"However, it remains the case - and I am not sure that anyone has mentioned this - that a dozen or more EU Member States are expressing concern and objections to the proposal, and some ACP states are concerned about the impact on sugar, bananas and rice."
"Only yesterday, Barbados was saying that the region could benefit only if the EU ensured that they build the technical, productive and infrastructural capacity so that they can maximise the opportunities, particularly for sugar, between 2009 and 2015."
"There is this doomsday scenario that people talk about."
"That is why, if they cannot sign up by the end of this year, the ACP should be provided with a high level of market access using GSP+."
"The assertion I hear that alternatives do not exist is simply not the case and neither is the claim that no ACP region or country has asked for them."
"Recent research by the ODI, the UN and others points to an enhanced GSP as a viable alternative to EPAs and would provide that essential breathing space for negotiations to continue."
"GSP+ would provide more generous access than GSP, which is clearly not an option."
"Most ACP countries could well meet the eligibility criteria and would be provided with a level of market access almost equivalent to Cotonou for current exports, with very few exceptions."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to express my satisfaction with the way in which this debate has been conducted today in this House."
"I wish to do so, among other things, because I believe that it blatantly gives the lie to the allegations that we have been hearing regularly over the last few months, to the effect that only a few madmen from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and a civil society defying the European Commission in principle or out of habit are worried about the staging and the outcome of the economic partnership agreement negotiations."
"That is certainly not the case, as we have heard this morning."
"To put it simply, there is in fact just one question to be asked today within the context of these negotiations, and that question is as follows: is the Commission able to guarantee the ACP countries that, once signed, the agreements will provide them with development conditions that are more favourable than the ones from which they benefit today?"
"If it is, then I personally no longer have many problems with these economic partnership agreements."
"If it is not, which I fear, then we have to reject them as they are presented to us at the moment, and for as long as they unduly favour an approach to human relations that is overly concerned with trade, to the exclusion of everything else and to the detriment of the general interest of the peoples of the ACP countries."
"Improving the living conditions of as many of our contemporaries and future generations as possible, in the North and in the South, is a priority objective that we are entitled to demand on the part of the Commission."
"Accordingly, the Commission has a duty to proceed with the negotiations on these agreements, willingly and with all due transparency."
"In this regard, I refer to the very practical, very correct, remarks made by my colleague, Mr Arif."
"However, the Commission has a duty also to give itself, and to give our partners, the necessary timescales, as several speakers who have taken the floor before me have said."
"It is high time for this demand, which is made by millions of European citizens whom we represent in this House, to be considered with a far more serious and respectful approach than is the case today."
"Commissioner, we are hearing Members talk extensively and insistently this morning - and we regularly hear such talk in this House - about the economy, the opening up of markets and competitiveness."
"These words, let us not forget, are words that we must take for what they are, that is to say, concepts and, at best, instruments, whose only value is their possible contribution to satisfying the general interest, the interest of as many people as possible, not a number - even a growing number - of privileged persons, which can take advantage, both in the North and South, of any old agreement concluded with any old party, but a growing number of men, women and children who, together, represent the great majority of the outcasts of our world and who expect a great deal from a relationship with their European partners which, if not generous, is at least balanced."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, in its latest proposals, the European Union is considering extending the 'everything but arms' concept to all the ACP countries."
"True, this is an advance that will make it possible to ensure that none of these countries loses out after 2007, but it is not a miracle solution that makes the EPAs development agreements."
"For them to become development agreements, we need to go much further: we need to provide for a transitional period that is much longer than the 10 or 12 years that are currently being proposed; we need to put an end to agricultural dumping and respect the principle of food sovereignty; we need to offer genuinely special and individual treatment and enable the ACP countries to protect some of their sectors; we need to put a stop to the pressure on the Singapore issues, in order to uphold the right of all States freely to manage their public services; and, finally, we need to involve civil societies and parliaments more."
"I believe that that is the price to be paid if the EPAs are to serve as a matter of priority the development of Africa, and not just that of Europe."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to respond to this debate on behalf of the Commission because of the importance of this subject: nothing less than future development, alleviation of poverty and opportunities to use the advantages of the international trade system are at stake for the ACP, some of the most poverty-struck countries in the world to whom we owe an absolute obligation."
"The Economic Partnership Agreements are about using trade as a lever for development."
"We have no intention of forcing ACP countries to make commitments against their will."
"We are operating with one constraint, however: EPAs need to be WTO-compliant, thus including trade-opening on both sides for trade in goods and trade in services."
"This of course, and I say this emphatically, does not mean symmetrical trade-opening between the EU and the ACP."
"Obviously, in market-opening towards its partners, the EU will go much beyond what ACP partners will do for the EU."
"In addition, in many areas, we are ready to give serious consideration to transition periods and in some cases very long transition periods - up to 25 years - together with substantial financial aid to help these countries implement their commitments so that EPAs genuinely act as a catalyst for policy reforms in ACP countries."
"Concerning market access, recently the General Affairs Council of our Member States reaffirmed the principle of duty-free, quota-free, access to the ACP but with transition periods for a few sensitive products, notably rice and sugar."
"The same principle applies on bananas but we agreed on additional evaluation, notably to take into account the EU's outermost regions, and that will happen."
"Specifically, in response to what Mr van den Berg said, we are jointly building with ACP regions asymmetric market access schedules which allow continued protection for ACP-sensitive sectors."
"Our duty-free, quota-free offer gives great scope to protect the ACP and to open their markets in a deeply asymmetric manner."
"In addition, flexible safeguards will be in place so that we can take action quickly if problems arise."
"However, a conditional market access schedule would once again put our trading arrangements in a vulnerable position in the WTO, creating further uncertainty for ACP traders and investors."
"Introducing such a conditional approach would therefore not be wise from the point of view of the interests of the ACP countries themselves."
"Some Members have talked about alternatives to EPAs."
"I can say without any hesitation or qualification whatsoever: there are no better development-friendly or superior development instruments available to us that would exceed the ambition and the potential that Economic Partnership Agreements offer."
"To offer GSP as some have suggested, when instead we could negotiate good Economic Partnership Agreements, would indeed be nonsense."
"ACP countries that are not LDCs would end up with worse market access to the European Union than almost any other developing countries in the world."
"Yes, some then go on to propose GSP+ as an alternative, by relaxing entry criteria to GSP+ and expanding its coverage."
"This again is completely unacceptable."
"GSP+ continues the divisions in trade regime between LDCs and non-LDCs that EPAs are seeking to remove and does not promote the use of market access in the way that EPAs do."
"The GSP is open to all countries and many would simply take advantage of relaxed GSP+ criteria, exposing the ACP to direct competition while fundamentally undermining the purpose of GSP+, which is using trade preferences to promote signature of accords on human rights and good working practices."
"So I hope that people will not pursue or entertain the idea of GSP or GSP+ being an acceptable and/or superior alternative to EPAs."
"The best development option by far is to sign EPAs on time."
"Any alternative falls short of this."
"We cannot simply flout WTO rules on the goods trade section of EPAs."
"If it becomes clear that for any region we are really not going to make it, LDCs get Everything but Arms; for non-LDCs that export bananas in particular, the waiver route is probably not politically viable at all."
"For others, things depend on progress in negotiations."
"I would like to conclude by saying that, in contrast to some of those who have spoken here in Parliament this morning, I find the approach of the ACP countries shows considerable realism and understanding of what it is in the ACP's interests to do."
"The ACP countries have voluntarily agreed the route map that we are following in negotiating these agreements."
"It is certainly not in the interests of the ACP for those who present themselves as friends of the ACP to peddle a doomsday scenario, to generate fears and insecurity which can only hold the ACP back from engaging in the negotiations which it is so much in their interest to conclude by the end of the year."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - (DE) I should like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for highlighting the great need for action on the part of the European Union in the negotiation of economic partnership agreements."
"We ought to start by bearing in mind that we have to work at the efficient inclusion of the ACP states in world trade and at equal success in all regional groups, which can happen, inter alia, through trade concessions and technical aid for the producers, so that the losses they sustain through tariff revenues can be compensated for, yet that alone does not give them what they need."
"What they also need in order to actually benefit from easier access to the market is expert instruction and guidance."
"I also believe it is likely to be essential that the underlying administrative procedures be simplified if they are to be able to use the resources available to them in a more efficient way."
"We, being Members of this House, ought, I think, to be aware of the fact that trade with states such as these is also in Europe's interests, and, moreover, we, being citizens of developed states, owe it to the citizens of the ACP countries to do everything in our power to enable them to put down roots in world trade."

"The word 'exclusive' is missing in this instance."

"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on organic production and labelling of organic products is finally going to be put to the vote today, firstly after referral back to committee, and then after an urgent request to the Council, which, I might add, was unanimously rejected by our Parliament last month."
"Unfortunately, the new discussions held over the last two months with the Council have not enabled us to progress further on important points."
"In particular, neither the Commission nor the Council agreed to the dual legal basis that we were demanding."
"The Council did not go back on its decision to permit, by special derogation, additives and veterinary treatments made from GMOs."
"Furthermore, certain chemical substances could also be permitted by derogation."
"With no codecision, we are forced to acknowledge this state of affairs."
"We do, however, deplore the uncommunicative and offhand attitude of the Council over the last few weeks, in spite of the good will of some Member States."
"I just as deeply regret the fact that the majority of the groups refused yesterday to postpone the vote until June, given that the Council itself had postponed its meeting on organic farming."
"I regret that the majority of the groups did not wish to exhaust the means that we have to apply pressure."
"That being said, the Council did nevertheless take up a number of our amendments in its compromise, and regular consultation of all the actors concerned is part of the overall agreement."
"I therefore call on you now to adopt this report."
"You can count on my determination, and on that of my fellow Members from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, closely to monitor this matter over the next few months."

"Explanations of vote"
"We shall now proceed to the explanations of vote."
"We voted for this final agreement because Parliament secured a EUR 40 million increase above the amount provided for in the Council Common Position."
"The budget for LIFE+ now stands at around EUR 1 894 million."
"Part of the LIFE+ budget is earmarked for 'nature and biodiversity' projects."
"Parliament has ensured that at least 50% of budget resources of LIFE+ will be dedicated to project action grants to support the conservation of nature and biodiversity."
"In its common position, the Council had proposed earmarking 40% of the whole budget to such projects."
"Lastly, as mentioned in the final report, Mr Dimas read out a statement during the Conciliation Committee meeting saying that before the review of the Financial Framework, the Commission would carry out a review of committed and planned spending at national and EU level on the management of the Natura 2000 networks."
"This overview will be used with a view to adapting Community instruments, in particular LIFE+, and to ensuring a high level of cofinancing."
"To conclude, the outcome is far more satisfactory than any agreement that could have been concluded at an earlier stage of the legislative procedure."
"I warmly welcome the outcome of this conciliation procedure, with its accent on a centralised approach in which the Commission continues to manage the programme, thereby ensuring value added for Europe as a whole, equal criteria and excellence, and reducing extra spending on setting up national level management bodies."
"I should like to highlight other positive elements such as the EUR 40 million increase in the general budget and the award of 15% in funds for transnational projects."
"I shall therefore be voting in favour of the common project adopted by the Conciliation Committee on LIFE+."
"(DE) Mr President, we have been equipped with yet another instrument fit for combating the trafficking in human beings and their sexual exploitation, in the shape of the Daphne III programme, but the fact of the matter is that, since over 100 000 women in the European Union are victims of people-trafficking and of violence, this sort of programme needs to be properly endowed."
"I am very glad to see that the budget has been topped up by 50 million, bringing it to over EUR 114 million, which will enable us to mount information campaigns in the countries from which those women and children originate who are enticed into the European Union, there to become the victims of sexual violence."
"Such information campaigns enable us to prevent this by informing women and offering them protection from exploitation."
"If that is combined with aid provided under programmes for improving the position of women at risk, then we are, by means of Daphne III, taking a quite vital step in combating violence, people-trafficking and sexual exploitation."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Gröner report on the grounds that it has certainly succeeded in achieving progress in the fight against the violence suffered by women, and there is no doubt about the role that the Daphne programme has played in that."
"It has to be said, though, that violence against women is more widespread in cultures in which patriarchal power still has deep roots and in which hardly anyone regards it as a problem."
"Violations of women's human rights such as genital mutilation and forced marriages are happening among us, too, as a consequence of the waves of immigration over recent years, and I believe we need to do more, in order to address this, than to raise awareness of the problem or make forced marriages punishable in the EU."
"There must also be no acceptance of exceptional court rulings justified by reference to cultural considerations; when criminals are punished, be they from the host community or from Western cultural backgrounds, the same law must apply to Muslim immigrants."
"This is where Justice must be neither blind nor dumb."
"I am voting for the adoption of Mrs Gröner's report on the Council's common position with a view to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 a specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women, and to protect victims and groups at risk (Daphne III programme) as part of the General Programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice'."
"The Daphne programme was set up in 1997."
"It has served to fund over 350 projects providing support for non-governmental organisations and institutions and associations involved in protecting children, young people and women against violence."
"I offer my strong support to the third stage of this project, to which Mrs Gröner's report refers."
"The main aims of Daphne III are supporting the development of the Community's policy relating to public health protection, gender equality, combating domestic violence, protecting children's rights, combating gender violence in situations of conflict and combating human trafficking and sexual exploitation."
"These ambitious aims for 2007-2013 will be supported by a budget of EUR 116 850 000."
"A comparison with the Daphne I budget - EUR 20 000 000 and with the Daphne II budget - EUR 50 000 000 is testament to recognition of the programme's importance and achievements."
"The report also rightly highlights the need to open up the programme for cooperation with non-governmental organisations by ensuring greater transparency, reducing bureaucracy and providing assistance for applicants seeking funding."
"I supported these Amendments to Daphne III, the EU's specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women."
"I am pleased that the third phase of Daphne (2007-2013) has an increased budget of EUR 116.85 million."
"In addition, I am pleased that the bureaucracy will be reduced so that NGOs have easier access to the programme."
"I fully support the work of the rapporteur in combating violence against women."
"The DAPHNE programme helps in tackling this issue across the EU and those who fail to support this report today should be condemned."
"in writing. - (FR) The extension of the Daphne programme for 2007-2013 demonstrates the European Parliament's desire to ensure that this plan, which was implemented in 2000, continues."
"Violence against children, adolescents and women is a tragic social phenomenon."
"Some groups that are particularly vulnerable to violence must be better protected, but we must not forget about domestic violence and female genital mutilation."
"In Réunion, for example, the number of offences against women has doubled in 20 years, and more than a fifth of women have suffered at least one form of violence in a public space during the last 12 months."
"I would therefore like it if the European Commission devoted a European year to this type of violence."
"I welcome the commitment made by the Commission, which has increased the budget to almost EUR 117 million, even though this amount is lower than the one requested by the European Parliament."
"The twofold increase in the resources testifies, however, to a real ambition in the objectives."
"This effort must still be accompanied by transparency in the programme and must make the programme more accessible to civil society, which lacks technical assistance when it comes to preparing draft proposals, particularly in the outermost regions."
"I hope that, in future, assessments are conducted by a committee of experts."
"Instead of some of the more far-reaching proposals suggested to us, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposed a modest revision of Rule 47 (which would be renamed 'Procedure with associated committees')."
"This more modest change would require the chairmen and rapporteurs of the committees concerned to meet and jointly identify areas of the text falling within their executive or joint competences."
"The chair of the committee responsible would have to take account of any such agreement when ruling on the final responsibility for different parts of the text."
"The rule would also allow the parties to agree, if they so wish, on more precise arrangements for their cooperation, which opens the door to possibilities such as a joint working group."
"The rule change also would guarantee that associated committees are represented in any Parliament delegation in a conciliation procedure."
"We abstained from voting on the reports by Mr Corbett and Mr Leinen on enhanced cooperation between committees and practical arrangements for the codecision procedure."
"Admittedly, from a practical point of view, these reports aim at simplifying the work done by this Parliament in its institutional and legal framework."
"However, they are symptomatic of a parliamentary practice where, ultimately, everything is more or less decided in advance, in small committees, by means of the interinstitutional or intergroup compromise, and in the name of effectiveness and rationality."
"They are also symptomatic of a parliament in which the 'large' groups - at least those that are recognised as such - call the shots and in which the individual rights of Members are reduced to their most basic expression, and are even non-existent when it comes to producing legislation."
"By imposing order on its procedures, this Parliament, which already suffers from a lack of national and political representativeness and from a lack of proximity to Europeans, is going to lose once and for all the characteristic that ought to define it: that of being a parliament that is elected by the people, for the people."
"(DE) Mr President, I also voted in favour of the Laperrouze report on the grounds that it is of course better, where water is concerned, to sort things out in advance than to have to spend a great deal of money on repairs later on."
"Being an Austrian, and thus a citizen of a country with very considerable water reserves, I do believe that a sustainable and environmentally conscious water policy means that we must no longer give financial support to intensive agriculture, which brings in its train such problems as over-fertilisation."
"Instead, support should go to those farmers who use traditional methods of cultivation."
"In forestry, too, we can play a part in determining which and how many pollutants get into the groundwater and at what rate, while also helping to protect against flooding."
"I voted in favour of the Laperrouze report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy and amending Directive 2000/60/EC. I feel that the EU should continue to play a fundamental role in protecting the environment."
"These are much needed measures that follow up the proposal contained in the Water Framework Directive and will help to end the chemical pollution of water, which disturbs aquatic ecosystems, causes biodiversity to be lost and makes human beings increasingly exposed to pollutants."
"This fresh proposal for a directive on environmental quality standards in the area of water policy follows on from the Water Framework Directive, adopted in 2000. The proposal sets out environmental quality targets for surface water to be achieved by 2015, albeit without any formal appraisal of the various existing laws or an integrated approach to water policy."
"This is therefore a series of separate measures with some positive aspects."
"I welcome, for example, reference to the need to take account of the scientific and technical data available, the different environmental conditions in the different regions, balanced economic and social development and the polluter pays principle."
"Yet this is presented in a framework of fostering neoliberalism, with the proposed measures playing second fiddle to 'maintaining uniform competitive conditions in the internal market'."
"It also introduces vague concepts such as 'best available techniques', which may be used to make it compulsory to use patented technology and equipment. This will engender dependence, and may serve to deprive workers of production resources given the price of hi-tech equipment."
"Although Parliament has made some improvements on the Commission's text, it rejected most of the proposals tabled by our group, which is why we abstained from the final vote."
"in writing. - (EL) The title about environmental quality standards in the field of water policy does not really correspond to its content, in that it focuses on harmful substances in surface waters and on sediments which come solely from pesticides."
"Other contaminants, such as industrial waste water, urban waste water, landfill leachate, thermal pollution from corresponding sources, the pollution of lakes with air pollutants from incineration units which are brought down with the weather etc., are left out of account."
"However, the chemical pollution of surface waters may cause disruptions to water ecosystems, destroying biodiversity, or contaminants may accumulate in the food chain from poisoned fish."
"Moreover, it is clear that the Commission's intention is to target and blame agriculture as being the sole factor responsible for the chemical contamination of surface waters."
"Moreover, the 'polluter pays' principle does not stop pollution, but it does legalise the inconsiderate actions of industry and other monopolies."
"No specific measures are proposed for controlling the sources of the disposal of 'priority substances', both dangerous and harmless, the concentration limits of which are dealt with in the proposal for a directive."
"Nonetheless, the report does expand the limited content of the directive in order to achieve more effective protection of waters."
"Ultimately, however, both the content and the orientation are a long way from contemporary needs for protection of the social right to high-quality water, which must be complete and not partial and fragmented."
"Water quality is essential to our environment and I am pleased to see that through European action we have witnessed improvements."
"I believe that the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to look at the effectiveness of all Community legislative acts with a direct or indirect impact on water quality is a step in the right direction."
"(DE) Mr President, although the rapporteur, Mrs Marie-Hélène Aubert, has worked very hard at producing a good report, the delegation of the Austrian People's Party in the European Parliament has today voted against it, on the grounds that we still find many things in it that we find highly problematic."
"We still believe that the limit value for GMOs in organic agriculture must be 0.0%, and that imports from third states must meet the same criteria as products from EU Member States and must therefore be subjected to controls."
"Likewise, the labels that we have in the EU must not be used for products from elsewhere, so that consumers may not be misled and that their traceability may be assured."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the motion that the Aubert report on organic production and labelling of organic products be referred back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"As far as I am concerned, it is necessary that the threshold for accidental contamination by GMOs should not be the same as in conventional agriculture, that is to say around 0.9%, for one would thereby be making the de facto admission that contamination can no longer be prevented and that it cannot be guaranteed that a product is GMO-free even if certified 'organic'."
"I supported the proposal in this regard from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, according to which the presence of GMOs in organic products would have to be limited solely to unforeseeable and technically unavoidable amounts to a maximum of 0.1% and that the term 'organic' was not to be used to describe products contaminated accidentally by GMOs in excess of a detectable threshold of 0.1%."
"Finally, I endorse the motion that a different legal basis be found for this matter relating to organic farming."
"Having hitherto been a consultant, the European Parliament intends to become a codecider where problems such as this are concerned, and that will constitute progress."
"We abstained from the final vote in view of what has happened throughout the process."
"On the one hand, we object to the Commission's position. It proposed a regulation authorising the presence of up to 0.9% of GMOs in organic products, among other points with which we disagree."
"We still feel that this is unacceptable, particularly as regards organic farming."
"To tolerate the 0.9% of GMO contamination proposed by the report would mean accepting GMO contamination of organic products."
"This will undeniably have an impact on consumers, and constitutes a serious, unacceptable threat to the survival of the organic food industry."
"Consumers choose to buy organic products because they are produced more sustainably and without pesticides and are completely GMO-free."
"To accept the introduction of GMOs, even in very small quantities, is tantamount to hoodwinking consumers and will have serious consequences for the environment and for people's health in general."
"On the other hand, given that it has been possible to improve the Commission's proposal in plenary - even though the Council has not yet given a positive response and has not accepted the amendment to the legal basis - we abstained from the final vote in the hope that it will be possible for further concessions to be made on the proposals that improve on the initial position."
"I will be voting in favour of Mrs Aubert's report on organic production and labelling of organic products."
"I believe that consumers have the right to clear identification of products they intend to purchase."
"Nevertheless, regulations on labelling have to reflect day-to-day realities."
"We cannot specify requirements that lie beyond our ability to operate in a meaningful way reflecting the best practical means available at the time."
"To do otherwise is to collude in limiting the availability of products many consumers might choose to purchase."
"in writing. - (FR) Organic farming now represents 1.4% of the agricultural production of the 25 Member States and 3.6% of the utilised agricultural area (1.8% of the agricultural land in Brittany)."
"Consumer demand continues to increase, and the arrival on the market of these products, which have all manner of labels and which are produced even outside the EU, presents new problems where control, certification and labelling are concerned."
"Furthermore, the subsidies and standards in this area are very disparate from one country to the next, and this creates distortions of competition for those organic producers who receive the least assistance."
"I therefore welcome the adoption in plenary of the opinion of the European Parliament addressed to the Council calling on it swiftly to adopt the regulation on organic farming."
"This new regulation must make it possible to clarify the Community framework relating to organic food production, which dates back to 1991."
"Parliament requests that the national inspection systems be strengthened so that products can be traced at every stage of production."
"If it is compulsory to use the European logo (for foodstuffs containing 95% organic ingredients) and the 'EU-organic' indication, then it must remain possible to add other private logos."
"Finally, the use of GMOs must be prohibited in organic farming."
"The much-vaunted upgrading of agricultural production and improvements to agricultural products through organic farming risk turning into a colossal scam at the expense of producers and consumers."
"The few multinationals trying to control the global food chain through modified organisms for the sake of their profits have won through and all the political groups of the EU, including PASOK and New Democracy, are to blame."
"The admissible presence of GMOs and the addition of supplements (vitamins etc.) from GMOs to organic foods are the back door for using modified organisms in countries and areas resisting their use, which they recognise as dangerous."
"Setting a limit for admissible levels of modified organisms in organic products, however low it may be today, means it can be increased without control, given that even the European Parliament was not allowed the right of codecision."
"This limit will now be set by the multinationals in line with the natural contamination which will be caused by the permitted coexistence of conventional, genetically modified and organic crops, however many protective measures are taken."
"Thus organic farmers will see their products downgraded, while consumers buying 'organic' products with GMOs will be deceived."
"Unfortunately, our proposals to ban modified organisms in organic food were not accepted; but the fight continues with the workers for healthy crops and healthy food."
"I supported the resolution on organic food products which builds on the report in March to introduce stricter rules governing organic food products."
"I believe that this can increase consumer protection."
"(SV) I am voting in favour of the report because, unlike the Commission's proposal, it retains the option of national labelling. I regret, however, that, in spite of everything, it recommends that EU labelling should be the dominant form of labelling."
"I voted for the report on organic labelling because it still allows for national labelling."
"This means that, although the proposed EU label recognises a diluted version of organic foods, particularly in terms of GMO content, national labelling can still signal the absence of GMOs in organic products in an EU Member State's own market."
"Mr President, I am delighted today to support my group colleague in her report's assertion that organic production and labelling represent a crucial area of EU production in need of protection."
"As the market for organic food grows it is vital that consumers feel safe in the definition of what is and what is not organic."
"We in Scotland have a thriving organic sector and I want to see that flourish."
"A stable labelling and definitions framework will assist that."
"The European Community and Greenland have had fishing relations for a long time, but the 1985 framework agreement expired on 31 December 2006."
"The new protocol in place as of 1 January 2007 for a period of six years lays down the fishing opportunities for Community vessels, the financial contribution, the categories of Community vessels that can operate in the Greenland exclusive economic zone and the conditions under which they can operate there."
"The main objective of the new agreement is to retain and strengthen fishing ties between the Community and Greenland Home Rule following the establishment of a partnership and dialogue framework aimed at improving sustainable fishing policy and at the sensible exploitation of fishing resources in Greenland fishing areas in the interests of both parties."
"Portugal has a particular interest in the fishing sector and is therefore in favour of the conclusion of this new agreement."
"In spite of our vote in favour of the report before us - which approves the proposal for a regulation in question - we are concerned about Article 3(2) of the regulation, which allows the Commission to consider license applications from any Member State when Member States covered by this agreement have not exhausted the fishing opportunities to which they are entitled."
"We feel that in the event of the under-use of fishing opportunities granted to a Member State as part of quotas and licences, the Commission should consult the Member States in question with a view to ensuring the optimum use of fishing opportunities, including the possibility of transferring unused fishing opportunities to other Member States."
"We believe, however, that this possibility should not undermine the principle of relative stability; it should not, in other words, have any influence on the future award of fishing opportunities to Member States in the context of these partnerships."
"As such, we support the amendment clarifying this point."
"As Amendment 7 was not carried, the EPLP was left with no option but to vote against the report."
"This report could jeopardise the historical fishing rights of the Scottish fleet and sets a dangerous precedent for future fishing agreements."
"I am voting for the adoption of the report on practical arrangements for the codecision procedure."
"I should like to begin by thanking Mr Leinen, the rapporteur, for a very well prepared report."
"Every effort should be made to ensure that the European Union functions as efficiently as possible and to simplify the system of interinstitutional cooperation."
"Our aim must be to make decision taking and the development of European legislation by the three Union institutions, namely the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, as transparent as possible for the citizens of Europe."
"The codecision procedure is an important element of the European Union's legislative system."
"It ensures that new EU legislation is adopted in a more democratic manner."
"The proposals for improving this procedure contained in the report are apt and should help to simplify the functioning of this decision-making system."
"Halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 is something that should be supported as a matter of principle."
"Appropriate measures are therefore required."
"Species and ecosystems need space to develop and recover. Accordingly, the maintenance of ecosystems should become a fundamental goal of all EU horizontal and sectoral policies."
"Healthy ecosystems play a vital role in prosperity and well-being in the EU and worldwide. If urban and rural development goes on overlooking nature, our landscape will be dominated by cement and pollution."
"Given that biodiversity is a cornerstone of sustainable development, biodiversity concerns need to be integrated into all areas of policy-making."
"Although there are contradictions in Community policy, the Member States must take up all available opportunities under the CAP, the CFP, cohesion and structural funds, LIFE+ and the Seventh Framework Programme to support biodiversity targets."
"Furthermore, it is imperative that greater consideration be given to financial needs in the 2008-09 Community budget review, during which there should be an assessment of the sufficiency (or otherwise) and availability of EU financing for biodiversity, especially for Natura 2000."
"I voted in favour of the Adamou report because I feel that the loss of biodiversity will have a serious impact on the future of the EU. Furthermore, the Action Plan before us will prove to be a vital tool for implementing the measures needed to halt the problem by 2010, although I do feel that this deadline will be decidedly difficult to meet."
"I agree that the consequences of climate change will be such that ecosystem services and the specific roles played by the CAP and the CFP should be taken into account, given their importance in meeting targets and in ensuring the long-term existence of biodiversity."
"in writing. - (EL) The EU's interest in halting the loss of biodiversity is superficial and hypocritical, because it does not take substantial measures or provide the necessary funding."
"At the same time that it appears to be fighting for biodiversity, its basic priority is to promote GMOs."
"The report quite rightly refers to the dangers from genetically modified fish."
"It does not refer to the huge threat from resistant, genetically-modified plants which shrink plant biodiversity and harbour dangers to public health."
"There is already a plethora of data about the mass disappearance of species; the rates of loss are 100-1000 times higher than natural levels, with tragic consequences for the genetic flow between populations of flora and fauna."
"The main causes of the loss of biodiversity cited are climate change, environmental pollution, intensive farming methods and inappropriate management of forests and water resources."
"These, however, are the result of the plundering exploitation of nature by the monopolies for the sake of their profits."
"Even the 'polluter pays' principle acquits the polluter, legalising the downgrading of the environment and making it the subject of haggling, for the benefit of the profits of capital."
"Basically, the responsibility of governments and of the EU is being passed to the citizens, by strengthening education and raising awareness."
"The people must acknowledge that the anti-environmental policy of the EU and of the governments of the Member States is to blame and must condemn and overturn it."
"Mr President, I am pleased that this important report gained the majority it did, because the gradual loss of biodiversity should concern us all."
"The implications of the moves to biofuels should in particular be kept to the forefront of our attention."
"While nobody would deny that we need to move away from fossil fuels, the knock-on effects of major shifts in production to monocultivation of (often GM) biofuels could have long-term effects that are even more detrimental, and this report does well to keep this issue on our agenda."
"The fact that 52% of freshwater fish species are threatened with extinction whilst cod and other fish stocks are at worryingly low levels should be a wake-up call for action."
"I agree with the rapporteur that biodiversity loss is as important as climate change and that Member States must show greater political will to prevent the loss of biodiversity."
"I am also pleased to see that the amendment condemning deep-sea bottom-trawling and other unsustainable fishing practices was carried."
"(PL) Mr President, the creation of a single market within our community, a very extensive market and one that has gradually enlarged, has brought benefits to all its participants."
"The aforementioned enlargement was preceded by the creation of a single market, the introduction of new legislation and by a whole process of adjustments."
"In short, conditions were approximated, thus ensuring genuine competition."
"Opening the market is a condition of globalisation."
"For this to be beneficial to everyone, however, a process that involves not only negotiation but also adjustment, including educational and information activities for interested social groups must precede opening."
"The creation of a global market must be founded on similar principles to the ones we adopted when creating the European market."
"The experience was a good one."
"Setting standards and conditions to be met by the interested parties is particularly important. These include environmental standards, conditions relating to work and pay, and the principles of innovation."
"A so-called road map should be drawn up for this process, laying down the various stages and allowing for development."
"Full monitoring by the interested parties should also be arranged."
"in writing. - (FR) This report commits the European Union and its trade partners to the path towards triumphant liberalism, liberalism that goes against the tenets of European trade policy."
"I regret that the MEPs are renouncing what they have defended until now: a trade policy that consisted in subordinating the trade agreements to social and environmental requirements by respecting the sovereignty of developing countries when it came to the management of a number of sectors vital to their development (public services, investment, public contracts and competition rules)."
"This vote has replaced this policy with a strategy aimed at the wide-ranging liberalisation of services and of investment in developing countries, one that will meet the expectations of European manufacturers, to the detriment of economic development needs."
"The principle of free trade must be a tool used to promote development, not an objective in its own right."
"I deplore the fact that the Singapore issues, which had been excluded from the Doha multilateral negotiations, have been re-introduced by the MEPs in this report as priorities for future bilateral negotiations."
"I voted in favour of the Caspary report because, although it is not perfect, I feel that most of the socialists' objectives were met, which were as follows: preference for multilateralism and the conclusion of the Doha Round, special treatment for countries with development problems, mutual recognition of standards, compliance with social and environmental minimum standards, the fight against current dumping, protection of intellectual property, the adoption of codes of conduct and best practice by European firms and increased involvement for Parliament."
"I warmly welcome an active and constructive role for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in bilateral negotiations with emerging economies such as Korea, India, China and Russia, in which wide-ranging, well-balanced reciprocity is required."
"At the same time, support for the least developed countries must, as a matter of urgency, be stepped up and the conditions created for enabling them to play an active role in world trade."
"The final text, in my view, dealt adequately with these issues and offered much-needed opposition to the unilateral review of trade defence instruments."
"(PT) I voted in favour of the Caspary report because, although it is not perfect, I feel that most of the socialists' objectives were met, which were as follows: preference for multilateralism and the conclusion of the Doha Round, special treatment for countries with development problems, mutual recognition of standards, compliance with social and environmental minimum standards, the fight against current dumping, protection of intellectual property, the adoption of codes of conduct and best practice by European firms and increased involvement for Parliament."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I warmly welcome an active and constructive role for our group in bilateral negotiations with emerging economies such as Korea, India, China and Russia, in which wide-ranging and well-balanced reciprocity is required."
"At the same time, support for the least developed countries must, as a matter of urgency, be stepped up and the conditions created for enabling them to play an active role in world trade."
"The final text, in my view, dealt adequately with these issues, and offered much-needed opposition to the unilateral review of trade defence instruments. I should also like to highlight the fact that the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs enjoyed a willingness to compromise."
"On reading the new report by this House on the benefits of globalisation - 'benefits' despite the growing number of unfair practices damaging European businesses, the relocations and unemployment - I thought of the new President of the French Republic."
"In his electoral speech on Europe, he spoke of necessary 'protection'."
"He even dared to use the term 'Community preference'!"
"I do not know what Mr Sarkozy has been doing over the last five years, but he has certainly not been reading the reports by this Parliament, or the records of the Council or the speeches by Mr Mandelson and his predecessor."
"They never mention 'preference', except when it comes to encouraging an even greater liberalisation of our markets."
"They never mention protection, even though the EU's trade defence instruments are manifestly inadequate and randomly used."
"They mention only the pursuit of globalisation and risk management."
"Yet, the European Union manages absolutely nothing, and especially not the millions of unemployed, the devastated industrial sectors and the near-devastated agricultural sector."
"In Mr Sarkozy's eyes, these losses are included among the acceptable risks."
"I ask the question: is Mr Sarkozy deceiving his public on these issues, or is he himself being deceived?"
"Free trade and global liberalisation are presented here as panaceas, alongside the sacred cows of price stability, increased competition and tax cuts that facilitate the exploitation of workers."
"I should also like to highlight the fact that the report states that 'bilateral and regional FTAs' are a 'sub-optimal' solution and as such should be launched only when necessary 'to improve the competitive position of EU exporters on crucial foreign markets'."
"They 'should be WTO-compatible, comprehensive, ambitious' and should ensure far-reaching liberalisation of services and investment, going beyond both existing multilateral commitments and those expected to result from a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda'."
"In other words, with the WTO negotiations deadlocked, the order has come to press ahead whenever and wherever possible with the liberalisation of trade, to the delight and the profit of the large economic and financial groups in the EU."
"What the report fails to mention are the disastrous consequences of capitalist liberalisation - with its 'structural reforms', the end of customs duties and the imposition of so-called 'intellectual property rights' - such as the glaring increase in inequality across the world, rising unemployment, unstable work, poverty and the appalling impact on the environment and biodiversity."
"We therefore voted against the report."
"While this report had some negative elements, such as its call for a delay of the Trade Defence Instrument Review and the unprecise nature of the language on liberalisation (which has opened up the possibility that certain aspects of liberalisation may be negotiated upon which were controversial at the WTO level), I felt on balance it was a report to be supported."
"The introduction at Committee stage of paragraphs on the need for Core Labour and Environmental Standards to be integrated into the EU's trade deals, and of additional references to development considerations, made the report more rounded."
"While it could have gone further in its considerations of development issues, it is my view that during the current generation of bilateral trade deals the targeted countries (South Korea, India and ASEAN - given that in ASEAN there will be special and differential treatment to take account of developing countries) will be well placed to defend their interests during negotiations."
"In a globalised world, the concerns raised in this report are extremely important."
"Although I do not agree with some of the points made, I can see in this list of problems and potential solutions an approach that is, in essence, a realistic one. To my mind, this is one of the most important aspects."
"The debate on the external competitiveness of the EU, or on the EU and the global economy, must be based on realism."
"It is an extremely dangerous mistake to foster the illusion that it is possible to seal the borders, to impose rules identical to our own throughout the world and to ignore the social impact of competition."
"I feel therefore that the right strategy is to derive maximum benefit from this new reality, whilst keeping to a minimum its detrimental effects. That means investing in both the cutting edge and the traditional and in what is specific and non-transferable as opposed to what is attracted by the living standards in the European area."
"The fashionable idea that the Eurocentric world (or simply a world in which Europe is economically and strategically important) died with the advent of the global economy is not a cast-iron truth, it is an opinion that may be contradicted by the facts; and facts are shaped by political will."
"I support this report and the idea of adapting the EU's trade policy to future challenges."
"Europe's leading position in the world market enables us to prepare for change in such a way that we can respond to globalisation without abandoning our interests or the social model."
"The increased liberalisation of trade must be accompanied by better use of defence instruments to combat unfair trade practices."
"Without wishing to call for protectionism, which would not reduce the effects of globalisation, it is vital for Europe to adopt a strong stance on scrupulous compliance with its international trade agreements."
"We cannot allow our competitors to use state aid policies for exports, to implement artificial currency devaluation and to violate basic environmental rules."
"It is also unacceptable for these countries to use child labour and forced labour and not to honour workers' rights."
"The opening up of international trade and market access must be global and reciprocal."
"Furthermore, the inclusion of minimum social and environmental standards in our trade agreements must be safeguarded."
"The European project must always be based on solidarity, on respect for human rights and on sustainable development."
"I support the call to reject this proposal, thus making the review unnecessary."

"It is with great pleasure that I welcome the Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Romano Prodi, to the European Parliament today to discuss with us the future of Europe."
"Italy, one of the founding Member States, has always been in the forefront in guiding the process of European integration, and Italy is also playing a decisive role at this moment, when we are seeking a solution to the stalemate reached in the process of European integration - a solution that everyone can accept."
"In particular, I should like to thank the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, for the fruitful collaboration that we have established in order to make a success of revising the Treaties."
"The President of Parliament knows that when he speaks he has not only the support of Parliament, but also that of Italy, and that gives him greater strength."
"(DE) Prime Minister, my dear Mr Prodi, in Rome, your country's capital city, there took place in March of this year a series of celebrations in honour of the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, when we were able to rejoice in looking back on 50 years of stability, prosperity and progress that our citizens have enjoyed."
"Now, though, is also the time to look forward into the future together."
"Today, the European Union faces great challenges and must, in order to master them, summon up the will to take the necessary steps and implement reforms that will guide us along the way to a secure future."
"You, Mr Prodi, in your time as President of the Commission, played a part in shaping the history of the European Union at an important juncture in time."
"The Commission under your chairmanship, represented in the Convention by Commissioners Vittorino and Barnier, played an active part in the work on the future of the European Union and watched over the birth of the constitutional treaty right up to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The German Presidency of the Council is currently working hard to find a solution satisfactory not only to all those countries that rejected the Treaty, but also to the eighteen Member States, constituting the majority by population of the European Union, that have already ratified it."
"As this process moves forward, the European Parliament unreservedly endorses the substance of the constitutional treaty, not least because it represents a compromise achieved after lengthy negotiations."
"We realise, though, that finding a solution will call for hard work on the part of all of us, and so we strongly support the efforts on the part of the German Presidency of the Council, especially those undertaken by the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, towards a renewed consensus among all 27 Member States."
"Were our response, however, to end up making the European Union less democratic, to limit its ability to take decisions, and to make it less transparent, that would be to misinterpret what those citizens who, in the referendums in France and the Netherlands, expressed their misgivings, actually wanted, and so this House will not be satisfied with a result that is not in the interests of the European Union and of its citizens."
"I am persuaded, Prime Minister, that, with goodwill, it is possible not only to draw closer to one another, but also to achieve a result."
"(IT) Prime Minister, the floor is yours."
"Prime Minister of Italy. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads for the future of Europe and of European integration, and it is in that knowledge, and not without emotion, that I address you today."
"I am most grateful to the President, Hans Gert Poettering, for this opportunity."
"Between now and the 2009 elections, Europe will be playing for its own future."
"In a month's time, the European Council will decide on launching an Intergovernmental Conference, at the end of which we must be able to say that we are equal to the commitments that we all adopted together in Berlin on 25 March this year."
"It is a question of deciding what Europe needs - what we all need - in order to address the challenges that the world imposes on us."
"This sounds like an abstract issue, but in fact it is highly concrete."
"We ought to have realised by now that the ability of us Europeans to interpret the globalised world and to take the opportunities it offers depends on how we are able to make our joint institutions operate."
"I must say straight away that, quite frankly, I do not agree with those who continue to contrast the need to produce results with the need to strengthen Europe's institutions."
"It is precisely in order to get more results that I have always hoped and fought for stronger and more effective joint institutions."
"This time we are not starting from scratch."
"In other words, we do not have to reinvent the wheel."
"In October 2004, all the European countries signed a treaty and 18 countries have actually ratified it."
"Over these last two years, it has been the arguments of those who are hesitant that have been heard most of all."
"The time has now come to listen to those who have ratified the 2004 treaty, those who have worked hard, including with their own citizens, to stay on that path."
"They had embarked on that path a few years previously at Laeken, where it had unfolded from a fundamental and irrefutable starting point: that Europe could not achieve ambitious results without equally ambitious reforms."
"Well, I am convinced that that remains a valid point."
"We must therefore start again from October 2004, putting aside the struggles and pauses for reflection of these last two years and thinking seriously and responsibly about our future and that of our children."
"It is not simply a matter of agreeing on the new rules that we need."
"There are other equally urgent requirements, without which Europe will be unable to function."
"These include a budget worthy of the name, and genuine policies for tackling the major challenges that modern life is throwing at us: energy, climate change, the North-South divide, and so on."
"To be successful in this, we have to hold faith with a principle that lies at the basis of our existence as the European Union, a principle so fundamental that it defines the very ethics of our being together."
"It is the principle whereby, in furthering European integration, it is essential always to make an effort to understand the arguments of the other side and in some way to take them on board."
"We have always made this effort, and we shall continue to do so."
"However, we also expect the other side to be just as understanding."
"We expect them equally to take on board our aspirations, which in this case, as you all know very well, are to work towards ever closer union."
"Bearing this principle in mind, we shall make every effort to help the German and Portuguese Presidencies to preserve as much as possible of our ambition for union, while also taking the other side's arguments into account as much as possible."
"Having established that, I must now say what in my view we cannot allow the June European Council and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference to do."
"First of all, we must remember that, this time, keeping to the timetable is directly associated with a question of democracy."
"In 2009, Europe's voters will need to know what kind of Europe they are being asked to vote on."
"What role will the European Parliament have?"
"What will its duties be?"
"Will there be a stable Council Presidency, and a European Foreign Minister?"
"How will the Commission be formed?"
"And so forth."
"The Intergovernmental Conference therefore needs to be given a precise and selective mandate, with a clear indication of the few significant sticking points for negotiation and, above all, how to resolve them."
"Only by doing that will we succeed in honouring our promise to formulate the new rules by 2009."
"If it were given an open mandate, the Conference would be unlikely to reach a conclusion by the end of 2007, and the time needed to process the new agreement at national level would mean that the process could not be completed by early 2009."
"In short, it would automatically result in an impasse."
"Allow me to make an observation at this point."
"This is something that suddenly occurred to me the other day after rereading the 2004 Constitutional Treaty - I would ask you all to have another look at it, now that some time has passed and it is possible to be more objective."
"Well, the document produced in 2004 is good, really good, and it has a broad, Europe-wide reach."
"Above all, its first part puts across in a clear and intelligible manner the meaning and the vision of the great common enterprise on which we have embarked."
"We should therefore think twice before we shelve it and set off down the path of plugging new elements into the existing treaties, whether wholly or in part."
"We would also be throwing out all its existing simplicity and legibility, at the cost of the people's understanding and, hence, of their support for the European project."
"Most of all, however, we would be throwing out a text that provides a consistent view of Europe, a text that is able to combine the ideals held by many of us with the practical need, which everyone recognises, to endow our Union with more solid rules and sufficient resources to meet its new challenges."
"The way the negotiations have gone so far makes me think that, unfortunately, we shall have to meddle with the 2004 text again."
"Yet I would like to put it on record in front of you all here today that I am convinced that in doing so we will be depriving ourselves of something very important."
"For those of us who believe in the European project, that would be an enormous sacrifice, and a very high price to pay for all those who have ratified it and made a democratic investment in doing so."
"We need to remember that."
"That is why we cannot accept any disfigurement of the existing institutional package."
"Strengthening our common foreign and security policy by appointing a foreign minister, having a stable Council Presidency, extending qualified majority voting, overturning the three-pillar structure, and providing the Union with a legal personality are all, for us, essential points that need to be safeguarded."
"I should like here to warn against certain appeals for 'realism', which are typical on the eve of a major European Council and unfailingly seek to achieve a watered-down compromise."
"I would point out, however, that if the major global challenges can only be addressed at a European level, then the people who want a Europe that is equal to such challenges are the ones who are being genuinely realistic, and not the people who do not want that."
"Internally, I would mention upholding the European social model and creating a genuine area of freedom, security and justice."
"How can anyone fail to see that this is a vital complement for a European citizenship that identifies with more than just the economic dimension?"
"Externally, I would mention wars, the fight against international terrorism, and the global challenges of energy and climate change (hydrogen)."
"How can anyone deny that the only way to make our choices and our values prevail on the international stage is by being able to express a foreign policy worthy of the name and communicating it to the world with one voice?"
"As regards the structure of the European Union, you must not believe that it is merely a theoretical issue."
"The complexity of the Union is one of the main reasons for the gap between it and the people."
"How can anyone not see the advantages, then, of overturning the pillar structure, especially in terms of clarity and understanding on the part of the people?"
"The 2004 Constitutional Treaty provides convincing solutions for these points."
"Do we really want to sacrifice them for the sake of a watered-down approach that resorts to the lowest common denominator?"
"Do we really want to risk making the system even more complex by refusing to make in-depth changes and confining ourselves to merely touching it up here and there?"
"Do we really want to continue proceeding 'with our face masked', to use Jacques Delors' expression, for fear of revealing the real Europe to our citizens?"
"Therefore, my dear Members of this Parliament, representatives of Europe's citizens, let us try not to lend support to the negative rhetoric on Europe."
"Let us not go on concealing it from our fellow citizens."
"Let us show them this Europe, instead, and show it proudly."
"Let everyone see what it has done for us in terms of peace and prosperity; let us explain how vital it is for our lives."
"Let us tell our fellow citizens once and for all that in a world that is now a system of continents it makes no sense for a country and its citizens to live outside a political and economic aggregation that is internally strong and externally respected."
"Italy will therefore make every effort in these negotiations to secure a worthy compromise."
"I am convinced that we can succeed and that, all together, we must succeed."
"Of course, if it proves impossible for all 27 countries to agree, then there will be the problem of how to proceed."
"That dilemma can only be resolved if we go back to that fundamental principle that I mentioned at the beginning of my address: the very ethics of the Union require that nobody should block other people's aspirations too much or for too long."
"That is why Italy, a country that has always believed deeply in Europe, realises that it now has a further duty: it must imagine - or start imagining - how to enable countries that are willing to do so to make real progress in furthering European unity."
"I do not think that all countries necessarily have to proceed together at the same speed."
"I hope they will, and I shall try to make that happen."
"I realise, however, that it is not always possible."
"Even now, though, some of Europe's most significant political decisions, such as the euro and the creation of the Schengen area, have been put into practice by just some of the Member States."
"They have not been aimed against any State; they have not excluded the others; instead, the door has been left open."
"Furthermore, these decisions have been respected by those that at the time did not feel ready to move in a certain direction right away."
"I therefore hope that this same constructive approach will also hold good in future and that it will prevail over any attempt to use a veto."
"Italy, as you well know, has always thought that being pro-European is the best way to be far-sighted."
"Today, however, being far-sighted does not only mean drawing up ambitious plans for the future of European integration."
"It also means addressing the issue of allowing those peoples who want to do so to realise their ambitions of union at the pace and in the manner that are best suited to them."
"If nobody ever takes the trouble to consider such an eventuality, we run the risk that the European project will run aground and that the ideals of all those who over the years have believed passionately in it will be frustrated."
"Even countries like mine, which have invested unreservedly in the integration of Europe for 50 years, might eventually run out of enthusiasm."
"I therefore want to conclude with a two-fold message."
"Italy will give the German and, later, the Portuguese Presidency the utmost support to ensure that the European Council of 21 and 22 June and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference are a success with which all the Member States can identify."
"At the same time, Italy is well aware that a compromise is not an end in itself, and that therefore, if we are not convinced by such a compromise, we will not subscribe to it."
"A fast-track group of countries might then prove to be the best way to advance along the road to an ever closer Union, on condition that the door is always left open to any country that might want to join them at a later date."
"Allow me finally to make a strong appeal to the members of our parliaments, the direct representatives of the citizens. Above all, I address the Members of this Parliament, who represent the people of Europe."
"You have an irreplaceable role in making the citizens understand what is at stake."
"We will only be able to create the conditions for successful constitutional talks if the work of our governments is supported by your work."
"We have to realise that we must not fail, or the result will be decline: the decline of an advanced idea of Europe, of a Europe that is able to be a leading player in the world thanks to its underlying values."
"In short, we would risk once again becoming a little western appendage of Asia, a fate to which we would be consigned not only by geography, but also by future history. Thank you."
"Mr Prodi, we thank you warmly for this persuasive European intervention, which I hope everyone has been able to hear."
"Mr President, Mr Gloser, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing a speeding-up of the process of European integration, whether in terms of the relaunch of the institutions, of the new dynamic inspired by Mrs Merkel on climate change and energy or of the implementation of a common immigration policy."
"Europe is making progress."
"Europe is demonstrating that it represents a level of decision making that is not just necessary and effective, but also legitimate."
"Mr Prodi, you have shared with us your vision, your notion of European affairs."
"Through you, I should like to pay tribute to the historic, and more prevailing than ever, commitment of the Italian people towards European integration."
"After a long period of uncertainty, the relaunch of the institutions is taking shape."
"The German Presidency is right to make this one of its priorities."
"If Europe is in a position to make effective and democratic decisions, we will be able usefully to decide on common policies."
"To move quickly and to enable Europe to make progress were the commitments made by the UMP candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy, and such is the mandate given to the new President of the French Republic by the people of France."
"This dynamic, which is driven by a Member State that rejected the draft Treaty, already has the support of several other EU Member States and must be turned to good account if progress is to be made."
"The time for asking questions has passed."
"What we need now is action and flexibility."
"We are only four weeks away from the crucial European Council of 21 and 22 June, which must result in a new Treaty being drafted by the end of the year."
"The ratification of the Treaty by the 27 will be able to take place before the 2009 European elections."
"Action goes hand in hand with flexibility because, as you have said, bridges must be built between the 18 countries that said 'Yes', the two that said 'No' and those that have not yet given their opinion."
"Each country will have to make an effort to form links with the others and to educate its public."
"Success will only come if we stop relying on semantic issues and concentrate on what is truly important: double majority voting, the extension of qualified majority voting, the principle of subsidiarity and the sharing out of powers between the Union and the Member States, a stable presidency, common representation on the international stage and also the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"As far as the MEPs from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are concerned, what Europe needs is to form a political force and to become an autonomous actor on the international stage."
"Europe needs an economic and commercial identity so as to ensure that our partners comply with the same rules as us, in the fiscal, environmental and social spheres."
"Europe must ensure that, even within Europe itself, there is no unfair competition among the Member States, particularly in the area of taxation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the right track; what must prevail is the idea of responsibility and of the general interest on the part of political leaders and of public opinion."
"While we remain firm in terms of our ideals and principles, they will be well served only if pragmatism prevails over dogmatism and if the good faith is stronger than the bad faith and the lax attitudes."
"Mr President, I should like briefly to mention the recent EU-Russia Summit in Samara."
"Many commentators regarded the Summit as a failure for Europe."
"As far as my group is concerned, the opposite is true, and Europe emerged the winner of this Summit."
"It was the winner, not against Russia - which is a partner whom we respect - but in terms of affirming our convictions and ideals."
"We are satisfied because, on the Kosovo Status process, on energy and also on the issue of Estonia's sovereignty, our leaders hoisted the European flag and expressed themselves strongly and intelligibly."
"Mr Prodi, I shall conclude by saying how essential the Euro-Mediterranean dimension is to our parliamentary group."
"It is in the Mediterranean that our European adventure will succeed or fail."
"Nothing is so strategic to us, as Europeans, as investing in our relations with the Mediterranean basin, focusing on the development of a region that is endowed with such considerable human resources, and working towards the establishment of peace and stability in the Middle East."
"Thank you, Mr Daul, not least for keeping to your speaking time so excessively strictly."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, Prime Minister Prodi, for that encouraging speech, to which I, as chairman of my group, have nothing further to add, for you have expressed what my group thinks, and we thank you for speaking in such plain terms."
"We have no fear of you bringing the same clarity to the negotiations."
"The reason why we do not fear that prospect is that there will then be at least one strong head of government at the Intergovernmental Conference, one who is not prepared to agree to a compromise at any price, for a compromise that would surrender the substance of what we put into the Constitution would be no compromise at all, but rather a setback for the work of European integration, and so thank you for your clear affirmation."
"(Applause)"
"My colleague Mr Nyrup Rasmussen had the opportunity to sit at the table in Nice, at which he helped negotiate the Treaty of Nice, and I have had frequent occasion to discuss this with him."
"When the fifteen Heads of Government who were at Nice left the chamber, they all described the result as inadequate, on the grounds that it was one of those minimal compromises that get reached in order to prevent even more Heads of Government nodding off."
"That was why the Convention was summoned; it was summoned because those who had sat at the table in Nice said that this was not enough for the purpose of the enlargement that would come about, but it is coming, and, if we want to make a success of it, a new basis will be needed."
"So it was that they, reluctantly, agreed to our demand for a convention, knowing as they did that what the 15 had hammered out would not be enough for 27."
"At the Convention, a constitution was adopted, with people saying that the text was OK, and so they would vote for it."
"It was a good constitution, but it then got thrown out and we were thrown back on the Treaty of Nice."
"I would ask, though, whether what was true in the year 2000 - namely that Nice would not be enough for enlargement - has become false in 2007."
"Nice is indeed not enough for the purposes of enlargement, but enlargement has already happened, and on the basis of an inadequate treaty."
"It is those who seek its destruction who want to leave the European Union in this state, those who want, whatever the cost, to prevent a new Treaty, and there must be no quarter given to them."
"(Applause)"
"There are those who say that, while Nice may not be enough, it is still too much for them."
"Today I have heard a Head of Government say that there can be no compromise with people such as they."
"Those who want to go back to the days before Nice would be best advised to stay away from the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Now is the time for some straight talking."
"Eighteen of the Member States of the European Union have already ratified this constitutional treaty, two of them - Spain and Luxembourg - by means of a referendum."
"Why, in fact, do we put up with a state of affairs in which the only ones that get talked about are France and the Netherlands?"
"Why is it not being said that this Treaty has received the support of two peoples, with, it might be added, more Europeans having cast a 'yes' vote for the Constitution than cast a 'no' vote against it?"
"That is another truth about European democracy that should be spoken out loud now."
"The European Union exemplifies peace at home, social stability, the combination of economic growth and social stability and of the export of values as a basis for policy in the international sphere."
"There is much in the existing foundational treaties that needs to be changed if this model of success is to survive."
"In his novel, 'The Leopard' the Italian author Tomasi di Lampedusa has Tancredi, the nephew of the Prince of Salina, tell his uncle, in splendid words, that 'everything must change if everything is to stay as it is'."
"If Europe wants to remain as successful as it is, it must change the treaties that underpin it, and if you fight like a leopard, then you will find us fighting alongside you."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of my group I should like to welcome Mr Prodi back to Parliament."
"Prime Minister, 50 years after the Treaty of Rome was signed, you have returned Italy to its rightful place at the heart of Europe, and at the heart of the European project."
"With President Napolitano you have turned the osservato speciale into a partner speciale."
"Your cabinet, with names like Bonino, Amato and Padoa-Schioppa, fills my colleagues and me with confidence."
"We hear some criticisms of your first year in government, but we recall the faint hearts who made similarly dismissive remarks about your first year at the Commission."
"They were proven wrong."
"Enlargement, the euro: these are the jewels in Europe's crown, so we will judge a government on its results, not on first appearances."
"It was Italy which, while others hesitated, led the European Union force into Lebanon, and Italy which pressed for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty."
"You showed the world that Europe can have the vision and the capacity to act in unison for the good of all."
"We must seize that vision, for Europe's future strength lies not in insulating itself against injustices, but in confronting the forces of pain and misery and destruction in the world beyond our borders."
"On our own continent we have healed the hurts of nations."
"Our interest now, indeed perhaps our survival, depends on exporting in the next 50 years the domestic achievements of the last."
"Global challenges like climate change, population growth and nuclear proliferation highlight what you have called 'the inadequacy of unilateralism'."
"The world needs global mechanisms to create consensus on these matters."
"And the model?"
"None is better than our Community method, tried and tested over 50 years."
"And yet, even as Europe comes of age on the international stage, some are seeking to divide us from within."
"What should we say to the eurosceptics who say that the European Union is no longer fit for service, or that the European dream is menaced by globalisation, or that integration threatens national identity?"
"They listen, but they do not hear."
"Mr Prodi, you wisely followed the advice of Cavour, who told us that he had discovered how to deceive diplomats."
"He said, 'I tell them the truth, and they never believe me'."
"As you told us in Berlin, marking Europe's 50th birthday:"
"(IT) 'To create we need common sense, patience, faith, and also a grain of folly.'"
"A grain of folly, of self-belief, as well as grit and determination are indeed needed to face the future."
"For now is not the time for apathy or egocentrism."
"Our leaders must be bold: more Europe, not less, is the key to competitiveness; more Europe, not less, is the key to security; more Europe, not less Europe, is the key to a just world."
"That is why it is vital to reach an institutional settlement at next month's intergovernmental conference."
"Only stronger institutions can build a stronger Europe."
"Mr Prodi, it was Leonardo da Vinci, your compatriot, who taught us:"
"(IT) 'He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind'."
"Thank you for holding true to your vision."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we urgently need to adopt the new treaty."
"This urgency goes hand in hand with the need to simplify the Union and make it easier for its citizens to understand."
"To belittle the difficulties that exist and which are the cause of the doubts which have until now prevented us from reaching agreement, however, is certainly not the way forward."
"The Italian Prime Minister, formerly the President of the Commission, must be aware that vague and imprecise proposals lead to vague and inconclusive answers, which is precisely the opposite of what citizens want."
"This is the philosophy of the possible, that starts out along a thousand paths but does not complete any of them, especially when the paths are the same ones that for over ten years we have seen put forward and then abandoned."
"The crisis is clear and is not a trivial matter, and we therefore need appropriate solutions ever more quickly."
"The German Chancellor's efforts and the statements made by President Sarkozy have therefore given us Europhiles hope once more."
"We seek to achieve what is feasible, not what is impossible!"
"We believe that compromise, when it is lofty and honourable, forms the foundation of politics."
"When people say 'no compromises' it is because compromises have already been made that are of little importance and little moral value."
"If there is a clear crisis, then projects that cannot be achieved rapidly should be abandoned and, instead, what can be immediately agreed upon should be consolidated: greater practicality from our institutions; more use made of subsidiarity; a common policy for our borders; terrorism; giving a boost to the economy and competitiveness through completing the infrastructure needed without further indecision, particularly with regard to mobility; a common energy policy; defence of the social contract; clear rules that prevent unfair competition with a stronger position adopted by the Union within the WTO; and harmonisation of criminal legislation on violent crimes against children."
"Citizens cannot have faith in heads of government who in Strasbourg describe Europe in simple terms and in their own countries do not carry out the projects that Europe has adopted."
"Strasbourg is calling for a common foreign policy, instead of us all acting solo, as happened in Afghanistan."
"A lack of security at the borders due to a confused and contradictory policy on immigration lessens the trust of citizens."
"The first ones to feel the effects of this are legal immigrants."
"High-speed rail links, which have been approved in all the Community bodies, have been blocked by differences within the Italian Government and likewise growth is at a standstill."
"Mr President, I believe that when people say to us 'the important role of the MEPs' we should also try to remember in all countries, including our own, that up until now the members of the European Convention, the Italian members, have never been asked to have an exchange of ideas and to make their contributions."
"This is also significant."
"Fewer words and more action!"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to welcome you, Prime Minister Prodi, to this Chamber, partly because, recently, there have unfortunately not been so many speeches of resolute commitment to a top-level solution to the constitutional crisis."
"We fear, for example, that tomorrow the Dutch Prime Minister will be here singing from a completely different song-book."
"Understanding the arguments of others is all well and good, but experience teaches us that it is nearly always the arguments of the opposition that win."
"We know that in the end even the most pro-European governments such as yours gradually yield to the arguments of those who see the true shape of a European Government in the intergovernmental aspect and in the power relations between states."
"This is what happened in Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice."
"You said that your government would not accept lowest common denominator compromises, and we hope this is true, because very often past examples have not been very edifying."
"The Greens do not like blackmail, conflict or splits."
"We would be delighted with a harmonious, innovative and truly sustainable and united Europe, and the 27-member Europe is a major achievement."
"Let us be clear, however: the blackmail so far has come solely from those wishing to stand in the way of a solution to the constitutional crisis, and this is a fact that we cannot let pass unremarked."
"Even the majority within this Parliament has in recent months and years refrained from making any proposals of a slightly daring nature, preferring to wait for an initiative from the governments."
"We believe that there are two or three conditions that could permit us, Mr Prodi, to escape from this stalemate and we truly hope that the Italian Government will resolutely agree with us on this issue."
"There needs to be a strong alliance among the 18 countries that have ratified the Constitution, as well as this Parliament, the Commission and some national parliaments, to resist the trend to dismantle the Constitutional Treaty."
"You made a list of some issues and I would like to add at least two more: firstly, the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and secondly, the issue of recasting the revision clause."
"We can no longer go forward like this, with a treaty that has been adopted unanimously and leaving the European Parliament out."
"The second condition is that you governments must have the courage to speak to the general public about the choices that must be made and the divisions that exist among you on the future of Europe, and to seek their support."
"Do not hide yourselves in mysterious secret negotiations."
"Do not exclude this Parliament from the reform of the European Constitution during the intergovernmental conference that is currently being prepared, not least because experience shows that the winners in secret intergovernmental negotiations are the others."
"We, and I am finishing now, Mr President, are not afraid of debate on the central issue, even if we do not like it."
"Indeed, we think that it is only if we face certain governments and certain peoples with a choice of staying in or leaving that they will in the end decide to stand with us."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to make three brief comments."
"The first does not concern Mr Prodi directly, but rather the famous twelve questions put by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to the Heads of State or Government."
"One of them is worded as follows, and I quote: 'What do you think of the proposal (...) to change the terminology without changing the legal substance, for example, regarding the name of the Treaty?'"
"How do you expect any citizen, upon reading that, not to say to himself that the European leaders are taking him for a complete fool, to put it mildly?"
"More fundamentally, Mr Prodi emphasised just now that European electors have to know what the role of the European Parliament will be, if there will or will not be a stable Presidency of the European Council and a European foreign minister, and how the Commission will be constituted."
"All of these issues are indeed important."
"But do you not hear other, much stronger and more significant questions being asked around you, questions to which none of you ever reply?"
"For example, even neo-liberal economists are asking where, in the current world context, a policy of unbridled free trade associated with free movement of capital and total freedom to relocate production facilities as well as total freedom of movement for foreign investors, including the most predatory ones, is in danger of leading us to."
"What changes do you propose to the Community acquis in this regard?"
"Other voices, and not the least important ones, are being raised against the tax wars that the Member States are waging, or in favour of a change to the statutes of the European Central Bank or yet again in favour of a controlled industrial policy in key sectors of the modern economy, outside the rules of free competition."
"What kind of break with the status quo do you consider desirable or acceptable from this point of view?"
"Does Europe have to be about the marketplace or about politics in relation to the market?"
"To what extent does democracy end where the reign of the open market economy or free competition begins?"
"These questions are on the table."
"What do you think about them?"
"One last word to Mr Barroso, who is not here today, but who expressed his delight at what he considers the victory of the 'yes' vote during the French elections."
"This is a delusion."
"There is no doubt that the new French President supports the 'yes' vote."
"That is why he, like you, feared a new referendum."
"But the commitments he had to make on Europe in order to make acceptable his refusal to re-consult the citizens say a lot about the persisting depth of anti-liberal ambitions in that country."
"We will be able to remind him in particular of the keynote speech he made on this issue on 21 February right here in Strasbourg, entitled 'I want Europe to change'."
"The real question is this: other than institutional innovations, what changes are you ready for?"
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, once again back in this Chamber and in his usual rousing style, Mr Prodi has confirmed his belief in a United States of Europe and the fact that we should speak with one voice on the world stage."
"Mr Prodi, whilst I may disagree with those views, I have at least to compliment your honesty in saying things in the way that you do."
"I am surprised you had to time to come, given that in Italy you have had 38 Prime Ministers in the last 60 years and it looks as though you may well be on the verge of the 39th."
"We are indeed very privileged that you have come along today."
"When you tell us that security is so important - this 'drive towards closer cooperation' as you call it - particularly on the day when the British police announced that charges are to be laid in the case of the former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was recently murdered in London, I wonder whether we really want your style of justice, given that Mario Scaramella, who tried to warn Mr Litvinenko of what was going to happen to him, has now languished in an Italian jail for six months."
"The charges against him keep changing and he has not actually faced a court."
"If you are suggesting we give up common law and habeas corpus for that sort of European system, my answer to you is no, thank you very much indeed."
"Let us have a real debate, Mr President."
"Mr Schulz: 16 countries have approved the European Constitution, not 18, so please can we have some truth, some honesty and some openness and please can we not push on and totally ignore the French and Dutch referendum results."
"Mr Prodi did not even refer to that in his speech."
"People have said no."
"Tens of millions of Europeans are saying 'Give us, the people, a say in our future'."
"Stop behaving like a bulldozer, stop sweeping aside public opinion."
"By all means have your Treaty, but let the people decide on their future."
"Do not impose it upon them."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, Prime Minister, the Eurocrats of the Commission and of the Council must have breathed a huge sigh of relief on the evening of 22 April: for them, either Royal or Sarkozy, the UMP or the Socialist Party, were a guarantee that the European Constitution, which had been rejected en masse by two countries in 2005, was going to be put back on track, flying in the face of democracy."
"Both of them were ideal candidates, and potential Presidents."
"So was Mr Bayrou."
"Sarkozy and Royal both gave the impression of believing, like yourselves, that the French only rejected the policies of Brussels, when they also rejected the institutional elements, which are now intended to be reintroduced via the backdoor, namely the single Foreign Minister - the single minister who, had he existed, would have taken us all into the Iraq war - the pseudo-elected President, the Commission reduced to civil servants from certain countries, and the communitisation of all policies, which denies the States any right to veto - in short, the bureaucratic and omnipotent European Superstate."
"For you, it was better that Sarkozy should have been elected, rather than Royal, since the former wants the Constitution to be ratified by Parliament, while the latter intended to take some account of the popular will."
"Following the appointment of a socialist Minister and a socialist Secretary of State for European affairs, and before there had hardly been time to transfer power from the old to the new President of the Republic, Mr Sarkozy rushed to Berlin to confirm that ratification would be by Parliament, that he was committed to a European Superstate and that he wished to be nothing more than the governor of a European province."
"The German Chancellor may rest assured: thanks to Mr Sarkozy, her Presidency of Europe will be a success!"
"In June she will be able to present a roadmap relaunching the constitutional process and signing the death warrant for the nations and the sovereignty of the peoples."
"Elected as he was by 53% of the French people, Mr Sarkozy is already betraying the aspirations of many of them, namely the 55% of citizens, from the right and from the left, who voted 'no' in May 2005."
"(Having been interrupted, the speaker addressed Mr Schulz, 'What is the matter, Mr Schulz, are you ill?', then corrected himself, 'Ah yes, it is you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, go ahead and teach the little children!')"
"Mr Le Pen, the thing about votes is that sometimes they go one way and sometimes they go the other, as you, of course, are best qualified to relate."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitution was supposed to strengthen the Union as a player on the world stage, but what has actually happened?"
"What appeared was an incomprehensible document, the adoption of which was not an issue for the social engineers who created it."
"The citizens of two countries have given a resounding 'no'."
"The document is also iniquitous, and has for a number of years been diverting the attention of politicians from more pressing problems."
"It introduces unnecessary conflict within the Union and confirms the suspicion that the Union is a petty concern; not geographically speaking, but in terms of the outlook of its leaders, who are incapable of accepting the failure of this project and of proposing a different one to the public."
"Heads of State prefer to tiptoe around the subject rather than to admit openly that in Rome three years ago they signed a document which public opinion has since rejected."
"This is a blind alley and we must find a different way forward."
"It is not the future of Europe as a global player that will be put in jeopardy by the failure to adopt the Constitution."
"What does jeopardise it is the remoteness of politicians from real life and the pointless discussions over a dead text."
"The citizens of the Member States understand less and less the language of the European institutions and their representatives."
"Our global partners, moreover, will seek to exploit the EU's lack of unity and the vanity of its leaders."
"I firmly believe that the EU needs to reform its institutions and that it needs a new unifying document that would clearly demarcate the scope of authority of the Union and the Member States."
"We need a Treaty that is concise, comprehensible and fair, and thus acceptable to our citizens, as well as being, most importantly, a Treaty that is something other that just an amended or trimmed down version of the rejected Constitution."
"I believe that policies on pensions, tax, health, social matters, culture, justice and nuclear energy should remain in the hands of the Member States."
"Other policy areas must be subject to discussion."
"Some of us, in both political and normal life, have experienced failure, and this has now happened to the champions of the European Constitution."
"They should overcome their stubbornness and admit defeat."
"They should also begin negotiations over a new Treaty at the earliest opportunity."
"I expect a realistic approach of this kind from the June summit and from the German and Portuguese Presidencies."
"Only this way will we increase trust in the European project, both among EU citizens and on the wider global economic and political stage."
"Prime Minister of Italy."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you very much for this debate, which like all debates in this Parliament has been concise, constructive and frank."
"It has highlighted a huge range of positions regarding the future of the European Union."
"If we listen to some of the final speakers, some positions are irreconcilable."
"This problem certainly needs to be tackled, debated and taken forward in an open and democratic way, as always happens and always has happened within this Parliament."
"It is precisely this fact that prompted me to make my initial speech; it is precisely in order to regulate this great diversity and breadth of opinions that we have to have rules that allow us to run the European Union, as we have all had."
"We are forgetting the long road travelled in organising the Constitutional Treaty; we are forgetting the 18 months of the Convention, the debates, the involvement of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament."
"We are forgetting that it was not a closed debate."
"We arrived, however, at a result; I quote the words of Cristiana Muscardini: 'but we need to pay attention to the fact that in politics it is necessary to reach a compromise, a lofty compromise'."
"Well, the draft Constitution was already a compromise!"
"As President of the European Commission, I regretted the fact that some great advances were missing from that treaty."
"We wanted that compromise, because we realised, with the pragmatism of politics, that one cannot have everything!"
"We realised that our idea of Europe was even stronger, but that, at that time, this was what was permitted by historical circumstances."
"It was signed by all the countries in the Union, including the UK, on the responsibility of the governments of the Union."
"Now people are saying that the treaty was created in a small room far from the wishes of the people."
"It was created by the representatives of the people!"
"It was signed by the governments elected by the people!"
"That is what happened!"
"Clearly we can still search for compromise, because throughout our lives we have always sought compromise, but we cannot allow compromise to frustrate and nullify the European project."
"That is the ultimate limit that we gave ourselves and it is for that reason that I made a speech in which I sketched out the fundamental points which we cannot abandon: they are the will of the people, the issue of the pillars and the issue of the Minister of Foreign Affairs."
"How can it be that we are ashamed of calling the person who represents us the Minister of Foreign Affairs?"
"Call this person the Secretary of State, if you wish, using the English terminology."
"What are we afraid of?"
"Do we not realise how much not having a Minister of Foreign Affairs has cost us over the years?"
"Do we not realise what we have been unable to do in the Middle East and all the neighbouring areas, and how we have let the political situation deteriorate, through our own divisions?"
"Is this the sort of irresponsibility with which we are going to face history?"
"Look, what is going to be at stake in the next few days is this final aspect of our political unity, the ultimate aspect of our ability to represent Europe in the world."
"If we cannot understand that now, when will we be able to?"
"It is only a couple of years or so ago since I left that seat in the Commission!"
"So, in view of the power relations in the world - China, India, Asia - the problem has been that Europe has not been able to speak to these great peoples and has not been able to speak as an equal to the United States, or to convince it!"
"Is that not enough of a burden on our future?"
"Do we want to continue to count for nothing for another whole generation?"
"That is the question that I put to you ahead of the Intergovernmental Conference and the European Council."
"I ask no other questions."
"I put forward Europe's sense of responsibility to history, to our lives and to those of our children."
"Thank you very much, Mr Prodi; the mind of this House is expressed in its applause."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after months of difficulty the initiative by Chancellor Merkel and the election of Nicolas Sarkozy to the presidency of the French Republic have offered Europe new hope."
"Despite further resistance, there is now a real possibility of coming up with a new treaty that enshrines the rules of an institution as totally unique as the European Union."
"It is clear, unfortunately, that the text resulting from the work that was so well directed by the Italian Presidency under Silvio Berlusconi and which was signed in Rome, can no longer enter into force."
"If, however, we want Europe to carry out the role it deserves on the international stage, we must save the substance of the treaty."
"I am thinking of the principle of decisions taken by a majority on certain important issues, of a single voice on foreign policy, and of the duration of the Presidency."
"Adopting a reduced text would only be a first step forwards."
"Certainly, in striving for perfection we may lose the opportunity to achieve something that is within our grasp, but it is important to continue along the road we have embarked on and to make a decision before the European elections in 2009."
"I hope, thinking about tomorrow, that in its new term this Parliament may also have a constitutional role, as suggested by many, among them Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and Mr Brunetta."
"The 27-member Europe, however, does not only need institutional rules in order to function better."
"It needs to identify with the values which make up its true basis, the foundation on which to construct a Union that in the future will not dissolve when faced with difficulties."
"It would be a mistake not to ensure that freedom, solidarity, subsidiarity and the central role of the individual are the cornerstones of the Community institutions."
"It would be a serious error to renounce our identity, our Judaeo-Christian roots and a social model based on a family composed of father, mother and children."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tajani is putting forward arguments that have nothing to do with today's discussion, while we have on the other hand heard clear, strong and determined words from Prime Minister Prodi, which put Italy at the head of European integration and give more strength to the European Parliament, which is always in the forefront of the battle for constitutional reform of the Union."
"These words were very clear on a crucial point: we must start again from the draft Constitution ratified by the 18 countries, and not from Nice."
"We need to give a fixed mandate, not an open-ended one, to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We cannot dismiss a draft Constitution that has been accepted by the vast majority of citizens and that gives precise answers, not vagueness, Mrs Muscardini!"
"Mr Prodi listed these precise answers in his introduction and in his reply."
"Without a Constitution, my dear Mr Wurtz, the European Union is weaker and the risk of it deteriorating into a mere free trade area is greater."
"That is why sometimes I do not understand certain very radical positions taken by the left!"
"The speech given by Prime Minister Prodi has given Parliament and all of us more courage and strength, and we will go through the next stage with greater determination and tenacity."
"(PL) Thank you, Mr President."
"I should like to begin by saying how delighted I am that Prime Minister Prodi is someone who is not tired of Europe."
"A philosopher once said that tiredness was the most serious threat to Europe."
"I should like to recall that when Mr Prodi was President of the European Commission he undertook the difficult task of enlarging the European Union."
"He saw enlargement through despite the negative views expressed frequently by the media and public opinion or at least by certain sectors of the latter."
"Mr Prodi succeeded because he believed in the future of Europe."
"I would like this same conviction to underpin current reflection on the future of Europe."
"There are many in this Chamber who share my view that the European Union is now in need of wise institutional reform."
"The question arises, however, as to the extent to which the Community method, referred to by Mr Prodi as the mechanism driving Europe forward, is invoked in the activities of the European Council."
"That is to say, what role does it play in the activities of the government representatives?"
"Mr Prodi was wearing a certain hat at the European Commission, but he has donned a very different one at the European Council."
"To the outside observer it sometimes appears that national egotism is the one and only criterion used by the Council, not reflection on the basis of categories of common interest."
"I believe this is a particularly important matter."
"Parliament understands what it means to be a community, and that spirit is also present in the European Commission."
"What can be done to ensure that the European Council will also be guided by it?"
"(IT) Mr Prodi, I am making my speech on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group which, I would like to remind Mr Prodi, represents the fourth-largest political group in the European Parliament."
"I would like to re-emphasise something: Europe is very close to our hearts!"
"Mr Fini, the chairman of the party that I represent, was one of those in the Convention who contributed enthusiastically to the current draft Constitution."
"More generally, we Italians have a long and uninterrupted European tradition, and therefore cannot but support the appeal made a few months ago in this very Chamber by Mr Napolitano, President of the Italian Republic, who called for the Constitution to be adopted as soon as possible."
"One of the reasons why this Constitution is necessary is so that we can have a common foreign policy."
"Mr Prodi, you were right in pointing to the common foreign policy that we so sorely miss, especially at this time of international crisis."
"I would like to take the opportunity, on this point, to thank all those throughout the world who are working on peace-keeping missions, particularly in Afghanistan, Lebanon and Palestine, starting with the approximately 8 000 Italians."
"These are important missions, strongly supported by all the Italian political parties, even though, to be truthful, Mr Prodi, there are some embarrassing exceptions in your governing majority."
"I would like to go back to the Constitution, to express a regret and a wish."
"The regret is that it has not been possible to mention Europe's Christian roots in the text; the wish is that the goal of swift adoption of the Constitution will be achieved."
"I am convinced that Italy, as usual, will play its part well."
"(DE) Mr President, how often, over recent months, have I asked myself, 'where is Romano Prodi?"
"Where are the governments who will defend the Constitution?'"
"Today, Prime Minister, I have found you once more;"
"I have found Romano Prodi on the barricades."
"I may have found him late in the day, but I have found him all the same."
"I found him speaking up for consensus, stepping out from the ranks of the governments who, day in and day out, exchange their historic responsibility for Europe for petty cash."
"Since you, Prime Minister, said that we have to respect the arguments of others, I would like to ask you which others you mean."
"If you mean the members of the public, including those who voted 'no', then I am unperturbed."
"We know what they want; they want more democracy, more transparency, more social responsibility, a better Europe, a more convincing constitution."
"Or do you, by 'others', mean the governments who misuse the crisis around the ratification process to abuse us with their old demands, their old claims to power, with all the things we, in the Convention, extracted from those who deliberately deflect public dissatisfaction onto Europe in order to retain their power over a Europe without European democracy, without a social dimension, and without a shared role in the world - those whose interest is in the struggles of reactionaries for power, pitting the Europe of the corridors of power against the Europe of citizens?"
"You spoke of our need for compromises, and that, too, throws up a very pertinent question."
"The compromise that shines out of the twelve questions is compromise as a historic lie about Europe, for what also needs to be done, Prime Minister - and I am particularly grateful to you for making it visible - is to retain not only the substance, but also the spirit of the Constitution."
"If we decide that laws are no longer to be called laws, but rather regulations, we are denying people the historic legitimacy to which they have a claim, for these things remain, as far as their substance is concerned, laws."
"Denial of the primacy of European law is false, for it continues to have a subterranean existence and the foreign minister is still what we wanted him to be."
"No, indeed, the compromise can be neither a bluff nor a lie."
"It is for the spirit of the Constitution, too, that we have to fight."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) My dear Mr Prodi, precisely because I have the same passion as you for Europe, I am convinced that in order to relaunch the constitutional process we need a new impulse of energy based on democracy and rights."
"I am increasingly convinced that the intergovernmental approach is not the solution to the problems, but is a part of them and is liable to lead us into a mini-Treaty or even a two-speed Europe."
"It is the citizens and MEPs that must now take the lead, with a new constitutional mandate entrusted to a European Parliament that has these functions, with the aims of a new text and a European referendum; we need to change the text and the context."
"We need to have, at the centre, clear enforceable rights that define European citizenship."
"These are the right to work and rights at work that confirm that, for Europe, stable, high-quality jobs are the norm, and not the highly precarious jobs that are being developed with 'flexicurity'!"
"We need a guaranteed right to the environment, which requires innovative policies, based on cooperation, and multi-faceted visions such as those that should lead to ratification of a post-Kyoto agreement, instead of merely the philosophy of commercial competition."
"We need a right to peace, born of the rejection of war, and an EU policy actively based on these values and practices, as its own foreign policy."
"We need a new Europe, the only one possible, which is becoming increasingly necessary."
"We can build it based on the people, together with the MEPs."
"(FR) Mr President, almost two years ago to the day, the French 'no' vote sentenced the European Constitution to death."
"This was then confirmed by the Netherlands, and by the United Kingdom, and then by the Czech Republic and Poland."
"There was also the scant enthusiasm of the only two countries to have said 'yes' by referendum, Luxembourg and Spain."
"In Spain, just 32% of the registered voters supported the text."
"In short, the constitutional process broke down and then came to a standstill, and we owe that breakdown mainly to France."
"From that point on, everything became clear to us, the French sovereigntists, on behalf of whom I am speaking in this House: it was France that needed to be circumvented, it was the French who needed to be tricked!"
"And that was done by means of an immense ruse."
"When it came to the presidential elections, two candidates were pre-selected at the outset, so that, when one of them was elected and newly legitimised, they would say yes where the French wanted to say no."
"That explains Mr Sarkozy's outrageous gesture of rushing to see Mrs Merkel on the very day of his inauguration."
"There must be no doubt about the illegitimacy of this 'yes' dragged out of France by means of this presidential manoeuvring."
"I am well aware that everyone in the silent, bustling little aquarium of the Brussels oligarchies will get together in order to concoct a new text, and that it will certainly not be called a constitution, but an institutional reform, which amounts to the same thing."
"The 'no' supporters are not dead, however."
"Mr Barroso should be under no illusions, and nor should you, Mr Prodi: sooner or later, France will speak out again, because France, despite all opposition, is attached to its freedoms."
"And those freedoms - national freedoms - will triumph in the end, despite all your feeble machinations."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Prodi, you more than anyone are familiar with how the European institutions work."
"As a former President of the Commission, you are therefore well placed to fathom why the European citizens are increasingly turning their backs on present-day Europe."
"Bureaucracy, overregulation, no ounce of respect for the principle of subsidiarity, political correctness, no respect for Europe's Christian heritage, and the obsessive desire to admit Islamic Turkey to the EU have meant that these days, most Europeans equate the European ideal of the founding fathers with an intrusive super state that no longer listens to what the people want."
"In recent years, we have seen some striking examples of the deliberate deafness of official Europe."
"In France and the Netherlands, in democratic referendums, the people said 'no' to the European super state."
"Despite this, the German Presidency simply carries on down the path already chosen."
"For Angela Merkel, and I am afraid for you as a Member of the European Council, the will of the people does not count."
"All opinion polls show that whilst the Europeans want to be on friendly terms with the Turks, they do not want a non-European and Islamic country to join our Union."
"Again, the pre-determined path is simply followed."
"Do not harbour any illusions, though."
"This refusal to listen to the needs and complaints of Europeans will backfire at the next opportunity, and official Europe should not come and complain to us if the citizens again vote 'incorrectly' at some stage in the future."
"I should like to finish off by saying to Mr Prodi that the government of my country brought itself into disrepute last week by refusing, for commercial reasons, to allow the Dalai Lama to visit Belgium."
"Nobody wants to offend China."
"It is very unfortunate that the rule in these situations seems to be that of Erst das Fressen und dann die Moral."
"I therefore hope that, within the European Council, you will speak up to focus on the attitude of your government which, although it likes to wax lyrical about human rights, when the chips are down, lets its own economic interests prevail, and also to denounce Belgium in this matter."
"If Europe is serious about defending human rights, it should also have the courage to denounce the hypocrisy of some Member States."
"Since you have referred to me personally, Mr Dillen, I would remind you that I stated my position to the plenary yesterday."
"I will not allow anyone to prevent talks between the Dalai Lama and the President of the European Parliament."
"A letter has been sent;"
"I expect it to be answered and will have more to say on the subject at an appropriate moment."
"(SK) Prime Minister Prodi, allow me to welcome you here."
"You are a politician with a wealth of experience when it comes to both running a country and running the European Commission, where you served as president."
"I would like to emphasise that for the European Union to succeed in the future, it is essential to adopt a Constitutional Treaty."
"Recently, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome."
"This anniversary reminds us that much has changed in the intervening years and that there are treaties still in force that need to be amended."
"The European Community at that time consisted of six countries, and it was primarily an economic grouping."
"Today, the European Union is made up of 27 Member States, of which 12 are post-communist countries."
"The shape of the present-day European Union is substantially different from the one it had in 1957."
"The Treaties, dating back 50 years, are non-transparent, written in complicated language and could even be described as obsolete."
"It appears essential to adopt a new Constitutional Treaty and new clear rules of the game."
"It is necessary to realise that the reforms proposed in the Constitutional Treaty, such as legal personality, fundamental human rights embodied in binding provisions, the office of General Prosecutor, reforms of institutions and the legislative process represent changes which can move the European Union forward."
"It is high time to end the reflection period and inaugurate a period of action."
"Prime Minister Prodi, I would like to thank you for the trust you placed in Slovakia at a time when she was embarking on what you described as a long journey."
"Slovakia is a young new Member State of the European Union, and she trusts you in the same manner as she trusts Italy and the EU to amend the rules of game."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, today we are once again debating constitutions and institutions when the citizens of Europe are really more interested in jobs, prosperity, the environment and global poverty."
"It is a myth that the European Union is in a crisis or paralysed and incapable of taking decisions, and this is the pretext that some governments are using to demand that the Constitution should be back on the table."
"I know that you, Prime Minister, believe this as well."
"It is not a constitutional crisis."
"Even the British Government has said that the EU is able to take decisions based on current treaties, and the period of reflection following the French and Dutch 'no' votes should, in my view, have been used to take a long, hard look at the reasons for the rejection of the constitution."
"Instead, the discussions now seem solely focused on what parts of it can be kept at all costs."
"As someone who believes in my nation's membership of the European Union and the potential for good that Europe possesses, I am saddened by this debate."
"I have always believed there was a need to simplify and make more transparent the decision-making processes and institutions of Europe, as the Laeken Declaration envisaged."
"The enlargement of the EU may indeed require some amendments to existing treaties or new treaties from time to time, but I cannot accept that this Constitution is required, nor is it desirable at this moment."
"There is no doubt that the British people will demand a referendum on any new treaty that might propose additional powers for the EU, and my party would support that."
"We will watch with great interest the actions of the British Government in the weeks to come."
"Mr Blair will attend the Brussels Summit on the very eve of his retirement and he must not commit his successor in his absence."
"Gordon Brown should insist that he attend the summit alongside Tony Blair and take full responsibility for whatever his Government signs up to."
"I hope that this kind of realism will guide Mr Brown's actions in the difficult times that lie immediately ahead."
"Thank you, Mr Kirkhope."
"My information is that the British Prime Minister has close contact with Gordon Brown!"
"(DE) Mr President, it is very good to see you, Prime Minister Prodi, in this House, not only, of course, because of your Prime Ministerial position, but also because you are someone who has done a great deal for Europe."
"Mr Prodi, you spoke about foreign policy, and I am very grateful to you for that."
"There are many in this House who are currently saying that we need to present a united front in our dealings with Russia."
"There are others - and there are many of them - who say that we must not be dominated by America. We need a strong Europe."
"We all agree that India, China and Brazil are getting stronger and stronger, and wonder whether we can secure our interests there."
"There is the Middle East problem, which we are about to debate, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is already in her seat."
"How, then, is there to be European input in all these areas when we do not have a common foreign and security policy, and how are we supposed to have one of those if there is not, in future, one person who can, beyond all doubt, deal with all these foreign issues and be responsible for them?"
"It is on this issue in particular, Prime Minister, that I urge you to stand firm."
"I agree with you entirely that not every treaty is a good one."
"What we need is one that goes beyond the minimum required and really moves Europe forward."
"Prime Minister, I wish you all the best."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there was a slogan in 1968: 'Be realistic."
"Demand the impossible.'"
"Today we would have to say, 'Be realistic."
"Demand what is necessary in order not to sink this European project of which you are all the temporary custodians.'"
"If in 2009 the European Parliament were to present itself for re-election without a convincing institutional reply, Europe as a whole would be faced with an irreparable crisis of legitimacy, while, in fact, citizens ought to be able today to choose on the basis of a clear model such as you have set out."
"Parliament has given its views on this issue on many occasions and it is now the Council's turn to speak."
"Prime Minister Prodi knows that today he represents not only his own country but all those Europhiles who have not given up on greater integration."
"In conclusion, I would like to remind you of one thing: those who do not agree today should withdraw; the others can go forward freely."
"Let us remember that Europe was created by a leading group of countries but it is not necessarily true that tomorrow it can be relaunched using the same method."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister Prodi comes before us as a former President of the European Commission with an entirely negative balance sheet: enlargement, the euro, China, reform; it looks like the balance sheet of the Industrial Reconstruction Institute!"
"Today, for instance, seeing that you are so enthusiastic about the super-federalist European Constitution, you did not have the courage to talk about the institutional changes in our country."
"When is there going to be a decision to allow the federalism that the North has been asking for for so long?"
"This is a question of freedom, and also of political consistency!"
"Mr Schulz compared you to the Leopard."
"That sounds like a gaffe but actually his aim was perfect."
"Only a great Leopard like you could govern with political parties that have the symbol of the hammer and sickle when you have presided over enlargement involving countries which have freed themselves from communism, and you actually manage to govern while representing only a third of our country."
"Look: from up above, Luigi Sturzo and Alcide De Gasperi are watching us and perhaps feeling ashamed of those representatives in our country who have forgotten the founding fathers' commitment to a Europe of the people and of the regions, not of lobby groups."
"Your spiritual horizons, Mr Prodi, are those of Goldman Sachs, not of bell towers and cathedrals, as ours are."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Prodi, our ambition is to continue with European integration."
"True, we have misfired."
"By voting 'no' to the Constitutional Treaty, many French people believed that they were resisting a liberal Europe and thus hoped that that would help us to move towards a social and ecological Europe."
"Well, now we know that quite the opposite has happened."
"The 'no's have condemned our institutions to deadlock, and I share Prime Minister Prodi's view that we must not throw the baby out with the bath water."
"Europe needs a constitution, and the compromise achieved by the Convention must be adopted and improved."
"So if, by a mini-treaty, as presented by the new French President, we mean the constitutional compromise and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it will be a yes, a yes to a Foreign Minister."
"What weight will that Minister carry, however, Mr Prodi, without a genuine European foreign policy?"
"Yes, Mr Prodi, the treaty still needs to be improved."
"If it had to be a third-rate treaty that is ratified on the sly, that would be unacceptable."
"The future of Europe is a matter for the people of Europe."
"I therefore say 'yes' to a European referendum being held simultaneously in the 27 countries, and why not during the next European elections?"
"I say 'yes', so that Europe can tackle the present-day challenges - I am thinking in particular of climate change - that will radically transform our lives."
"I am convinced that our fellow citizens understand these challenges and will be able to move this tremendous European project forward."
"(IT) Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the process of adopting the European Constitution cannot be reduced to a set of amendments to the existing treaties but must contain important social aspects that are at the moment not present."
"Europe must be able to meet the great challenges which pose a threat to the rights of citizens, the quality of life, health and the very future of its people."
"Faced with phenomena such as relocations, the scarcity of water resources, the world's hunger for energy and climate change, individual states are helpless and unable to formulate winning strategies."
"It is only through action agreed at continental level, or better still at planetary level, that we can hope for success where we cannot afford failure."
"It is important for Europe to be at the forefront in the world, both from the political point of view, as a benchmark for socially inclusive policies and a policy of acceptance that can be a model for other parts of the world, and in terms of technological choices and future planning, particularly in the sustainable energy sector."
"Five members of the main political groups present in the European Parliament have signed a written statement on the need for Europe to take a new approach to the economy, based on hydrogen: a real industrial, technological and social revolution that can be sustainable in the long term."
"You referred to this and I believe that this is one of the examples where Europe can and must play the principal role on the world stage."
"To conclude, there is no need for a compromise at all costs, but we need to tackle the real problems affecting millions of citizens."
"Only in this way will the dream of a united Europe be able to speak to the hearts of Europeans."
"(EL) Mr President, it is high time we stopped writing obituaries for the European Constitution; it is dead and buried."
"We need to get out into society and see what Europe needs:"
"one hundred million Europeans are living below the poverty line;"
"crime is rife in all the capitals of Europe;"
"illegal immigration is the order of the day."
"Of course, human rights are being seriously tried with visible and hidden cameras."
"Mr Prodi, you were President of the Commission for five years."
"Tell me, where are the eastern borders of Europe?"
"Just yesterday, two fully armed submarines were west of the island of Samos close to Mykonos."
"What will happen tomorrow morning?"
"The spark of war from Turkey is clearly visible."
"You must therefore take initiatives for the future of Europe, because otherwise the same fate will befall this unified Europe as befell the Holy Alliance two centuries ago."
"We do not want to set up a super state."
"What we want to do is to be able to safeguard democracy and to safeguard the prosperity of the people, with which capital and the Central Bank play fast and loose. This must be Europe's objective: the citizen, not capital must increase its power."
"(HU) The critics of the European Union very often charge the European Union with being too strong and with intervening in too many things."
"It is my conviction that exactly the opposite is true."
"We, who recently joined the European Union, see that a stronger, more effective Europe is needed, a Europe which has at its disposal the tools for fulfilling its tasks."
"For this purpose we need a common energy policy, a common migration policy, a common struggle against terrorism and harmonisation of environmental protection."
"We need all this in order to defend the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union as well as to gain citizens' support for all of these goals."
"Many look upon this constitution as if it were the end in itself."
"In reality we need to sort things out, and the Constitutional Treaty is in fact nothing but an instrument for realising these objectives."
"We will be able to regain the support of the citizens of Europe for the constitutional project if Europe is able to achieve these common goals."
"In order to do so, of course, it is also very important for us openly to recognise Europe's common roots based on Christianity, and for this to be mentioned in the European constitution."
"It is important for us to acknowledge Europe's common values in terms of rights and freedoms, in terms of the defence of minority rights."
"We need to gain the support of Europe's citizens for this constitutional treaty, albeit not as a final goal but as an instrument with which we, together, can reach the goals set out fifty years ago."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, anyone who heard the American President saying at the press conference after the summit with the European Union that 'we have had a nice meeting with these people from the European Union' would wonder whether he was thinking about Mr Barroso, Chancellor Angela Merkel, or who?"
"Anyone who saw or heard the American President could be in no doubt that we need one voice for the European Union, and that is why we thank you for your clarity in your speech today."
"Anyone who has been to the Middle East is also in no doubt that we need one voice for the European Union."
"That is why, Prime Minister Prodi, it is one thing to speak in the European Parliament - we all know that, as this is not the most difficult place to argue for a better treaty - but it is another to speak in the IGC, when the hard stuff comes and it is face to face."
"I know you are a strong and firm Prime Minister."
"We respect you."
"Stand firm, Prime Minister, and we will stand firm with you, on behalf of the European Socialists and progressives all around Europe."
"I think you will have a strong majority behind you standing firm together with you for the benefit of European people in the future."
"And that was the experience of a former prime minister who is now an MEP."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of Europe is in its roots, and for us radicals these are represented by the Ventotene manifesto, which set out the need to achieve peace, democracy and prosperity by going beyond the dimensions of the nation state."
"Reforming Europe today means offering this project also to the peoples on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean, and affirming, for them too, the individual right to democracy through the accession of democratic states, starting with Turkey, but also with the prospect of Israel, Morocco and others."
"You spoke of being in the forefront, but for us only a refusal to close the doors of Europe will constitute being in the forefront."
"To make another point: we propose that whatever reform is to be made be subject to a referendum of the people of Europe as such."
"I am not speaking of national referendums, but a single referendum placed before the citizens of the European motherland, as against the neo-Gaullist Europe of national motherlands."
"To conclude, let us welcome an example of how we can, as a Union, be strong when we have faith in ourselves: the tabling of the resolution on the moratorium on capital punishment before the General Assembly taking place at the United Nations."
"Mr President, beware of the sabotage that some people are still attempting to wreak now."
"For example, look at the official communication by the General Affairs and External Relations Council, and the Council's departments."
"After the last General Affairs and External Relations Council this means that sabotage is being attempted, Mr President, and we should try to prevent it."
"(PL) Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, we clearly do need an efficient and well-ordered European Union that is democratic and close to its citizens."
"The Union must also be imbued with a spirit of solidarity and based on a Constitutional Treaty."
"It should be the kind of Union Mr Prodi has described to us today, and I am grateful to him for that."
"I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the solidarity the European Union recently displayed towards my country, Poland, through the implementation of its Eastern policy."
"The people of Poland are aware of this and value it."
"The people of Poland understand that they must of course reciprocate, and display the same solidarity over issues of importance to Europe as a whole."
"This is because 68% of my fellow-countrymen are pleased with membership of the Union and want more Europe."
"Over 60% of Poles are in favour of a Constitutional Treaty."
"I therefore call on you, Mr Prodi, to ensure that the European Council also listens to the views of European Union citizens at the forthcoming summit."
"After all, this splendid edifice known as the European Union is being created for those very citizens, not for the governments."
"Our thanks go to the Prime Minister of Italy, whose convictions, it is evident, are shared by the great majority in this House."
"Over the coming weeks, we will need to put those convictions into practice, and we wish you, Prime Minister, much success, especially at the summit meeting in Brussels on 21 and 22 June, a month to the day from now."
"The debate is closed."
"(Applause)"
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - As elected politicians, we must listen to the people - all the people."
"Some, such as Mr Farage, want to listen only to some of the people, those who voted 'No' in France and the Netherlands."
"Others want to listen only to those who said 'Yes' in the 18 countries which have ratified the Constitutional Treaty."
"Fortunately, a majority in this House and of the governments of the Member States want to listen to all, to bridge the divergence of views and find a solution capable of being ratified by all 27 Member States."
"Of course, the European Parliament, which approved the constitutional treaty by a large majority, wants to salvage as many as possible of the reforms contained in the constitutional treaty."
"It is perfectly natural that Parliament should want to sacrifice as little of the treaty as possible, but it must also be as much as is necessary to secure agreement by every country."
"in writing. - (HU) What does Europe mean to us?"
"A community without borders, which rests upon peace, freedom and democracy, strives to promote the prosperity of its citizens and brings about solidarity among the Member States."
"We are facing great challenges!"
"We must delineate an appropriate plan of action for Europe that will determine the framework and policy in which it will operate, and will shape the Europe in which we would like to live and thrive in the future."
"It is important for us to preserve and pass on to future generations the unity which we have succeeded through sustained effort in achieving over the decades."
"I consider it important to preserve the uniqueness and diverse heritage of all 27 members of the European Union, but I must emphasise that there are countless goals which we cannot achieve individually, but only together."
"In light of this, it is our duty to set aside our historical injuries and to place our Union on a renewed foundation."
"Our interest is in a strong European Union, which takes effective action in face of the many challenges which we must meet today, such as terrorism, organised crime, illegal immigration, climate change and energy policy."
"For this reason, it is indispensable to have an institutional system that works effectively."
"To this end we must reach a consensus, so that we can advance the pursuit of our common cause, since in the absence of a new fundamental treaty (Constitution), the EU can be no more than a declining western extension of the Asian continent."
"We have the opportunity for a solution, and I hope that we will be able to take advantage of it."
"We cannot stop the constitutional process, because this might lead to serious crisis in the European Union, to the devaluation of European values and to Europe falling behind in a global perspective."
"The person of Romano Prodi and the recent past we have spent together stand as guarantees that the preservation of these values, and cooperation in an enlarged, 27-member Europe are indeed possible."
"For the moment, the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe find it impossible to imagine a European future in which national identity might dissolve into a common European statehood."
"These countries have only just regained their national identities, through historic steps, from the Soviet Union's great red melting pot, and thus their citizens want to be Europeans in a way that does not endanger their national identity or their newly created democratic institutions."
"Moreover, for this very reason the Central and Eastern European countries need a strong Europe, since they consider that their further development and the protection of their national interests are most likely to be guaranteed if they are together, within a flexible Europe."
"This is why we cannot accept the Constitutional Treaty becoming a political and legal zombie."
"At the same time, in order to move forward, we are perfectly open to making the necessary modifications."
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Situation in Palestine (debate)"
"The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(Parliament approved the minutes)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Palestine."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, recent days have seen a disturbing increase in violence in the Middle East, where conflict between Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip has cost over 50 people their lives."
"It is also from the Gaza Strip that over 150 Kassam missiles have been fired at Israeli towns over the past week, killing one Israeli woman yesterday evening."
"Israeli military action has already cost the lives of over 30 Palestinians, and the situation threatens to escalate still further."
"The cease fire in the Gaza Strip, agreed by the Palestinians and the Israelis in November is becoming visibly more fragile, and the inter-Palestinian reconciliation achieved in Mecca with Saudi help is at risk."
"The Mecca agreement had its part to play in bringing rule by Hamas alone to an end."
"Since 18 March, Palestine has been ruled by a new government of national unity, enjoying the support and confidence of 83 out of 86 members of parliament - an overwhelming majority including all those belonging to Hamas and Fatah."
"There is still, however, broad consensus in the international community to the effect that the Palestinian Government has not yet quite passed its decisive test, in that it, too, does not completely meet the Quartet's three criteria."
"Despite this, the European Union has maintained its humanitarian aid for the Palestinians."
"I want to press home the point that the EUR 300 million given by the European Union amounts to more than that given in all previous years."
"The Quartet's criteria do however, remain the basis on which a decision on any complete normalisation of our relations with the Palestinians will be taken: they require recognition of the State of Israel's right to exist and of the existing agreements between Israel and the PLO, as well as a general renunciation of violence, which, in particular, has to date been significantly lacking."
"Particularly at the present time, we expect the Palestinian Government to take effective action to end the bombardment and to release the captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit."
"The European Union has also seized the opportunity presented by the end of sole Hamas rule to make a fresh start in Middle East policy, and the foreign ministers have resumed contact with the Cabinet members who accept the Quartet criteria."
"It follows that President Abbas deserves our full support."
"The EU is in close contact with Mr Fayyad, the minister of finance, and is helping him establish transparent institutions and machinery in the financial sphere, for we all want to see the country's financial and economic position improve, and the release by Israel of the customs and tax repayments it has retained - which the European Union has called for on repeated occasions - would help to achieve that."
"For some months now, the Presidency has been pushing for the revival of the Middle East Quartet and for greater involvement of the Arab partners who take a constructive line."
"Having enjoyed initial successes, our particular concern is now that the momentum achieved be maintained, and what this means for us is that we have to apply ourselves with still greater dedication to helping to get all interested parties to make a determined contribution to the Middle Eastern peace process."
"The bilateral meetings between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert have as yet yielded no tangible successes, and something must be done about this."
"There must be marked improvements in access and mobility for the Palestinians, and the Israelis must at last get round to doing what they have undertaken to do."
"I note a failure on the part of the Palestinians to actually make the renunciation of violence happen, and also a lack of commitment to the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit."
"The Arab League has reinforced the peace initiative of March 2002, and this has been due primarily to the commitment by the Saudis."
"The last Council meeting on 14 May saw an initial, and successful, meeting of the Arab League with the European Union, which occurred at our invitation; the League has also had further talks with the Quartet and with Israel as well, and, while this involvement cannot be a substitute for bilateral negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, the peace initiative can create a favourable environment for them, although this will require further support by the European Union in particular, and our Presidency is working to bring about another meeting of the Quartet within the next few days."
"However sceptical we may be, we must not, despite the slowness of the progress made, sink into a state of resignation."
"Over recent months, the European Union has become more aware of the role into which it has grown."
"We are willing to do justice to the greater responsibility which consequently devolves upon us."
"Madam President, unfortunately this debate today comes at a very tense moment when the situation in the whole region is deteriorating both in Lebanon and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as well as in Israel."
"The events of the last three days in Lebanon, with significant loss of life in such a short time - almost 100 dead - are a startling reminder of the need to work on a regional solution to this conflict."
"As you know, Javier Solana is in Beirut today at this very difficult moment and we hope that a better situation can be brought about."
"I urge our friends in Lebanon, from all the parties and political factions, to act as they have done so far, to call for calm and to refrain from actions which could provoke a major internal conflict."
"Once again national unity is also at stake."
"The Commission noted that all the factions, the majority and the opposition as well as Palestinian organisations, condemned Fatah al-Islam and I hope that all political leaders will continue to give proof of their maturity, that ability to envisage a better future, and will prevent the conflict from again evolving into an intra-Lebanese fight."
"What is most important now is to find a solution to de-escalate the situation in Tripoli and to avoid the eruption of other hot spots in the rest of the country."
"The population in the camps also has to be helped."
"Ambulances and humanitarian convoys must gain access to the camps."
"In the end we all know that there has to be a regional solution."
"In the context of this whole situation we can only call on all sides - in Lebanon and in the Palestinian Territory - to refrain from violence and prevent further escalation."
"I turn now in particular to the Occupied Palestinian Territory."
"Like the President-in-Office, I too am deeply concerned about last week's interfactional clashes in Gaza which resulted in 55 dead and 280 injured."
"Regrettably it seems that Gaza is at risk of sliding into civil war."
"Factions should stop hostilities immediately and reconcile their differences within the national unity government."
"I also deplore the resumption of the Qassam rocket attacks from Gaza on the Israeli city of Sderot, which yesterday caused the death of an Israeli woman."
"Israeli-led air strikes in retaliation then caused the death of 35 Palestinians, so this vicious cycle has started again."
"Therefore it is important that the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians be restored and extended to the West Bank."
"During my recent meeting with the Palestinian Foreign Affairs Minister, Ziad Abu Amr, we discussed the fragile situation of the national unity government, especially as concerns security, but also the budget."
"The first decisions taken by the government seem to point in the right direction."
"Mr Abu Amr mentioned that his government considers itself the cabinet of President Abbas."
"This government has a different programme from its predecessor and I felt encouraged after this meeting."
"I think that it deserves our clear support."
"President Abbas has requested all our backing, as his political survival may depend on its success."
"I hope that this very difficult violent situation can be contained."
"In the meantime, Finance Minister Salam Fayad, whom I met after the formation of the government, faces the incredible challenge of repairing the Palestinian public finances after one year of institutional decay and a sharp decrease in revenues."
"Against all odds he has made considerable progress and the technical conditions for receiving direct funding have almost been put in place."
"As you know, the Palestinian Authority has three main sources of funding: internal taxes, taxes and customs revenues on imported products, and foreign aid."
"Internal taxes have dwindled as a result of the economic slowdown."
"Since last year's election, Israel has also withheld the taxes and customs revenues on imported products."
"This is the major cause of the Palestinian Authority's financial difficulties."
"Furthermore, foreign aid cannot flow easily as a result of the US-imposed restrictions on financial transactions with the Palestinian Authority Government"
"We are helping to solve these financial problems in three ways."
"First, our Temporary International Mechanism has become a core source for funding for allowances, fuel costs and core supplies."
"Since the formation of the national unity government we manage this TIM in close cooperation with Salam Fayad's Ministry of Finance."
"Since the establishment of the TIM last June, we have already transferred over EUR 300 million through this mechanism."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its support in making more budgetary resources available so that the TIM can continue to deliver."
"A second way in which we are helping is to work with our US partners to facilitate the transfer of foreign aid to the Palestinians, in particular the Arab funds pledged in Riyadh at the recent Arab summit."
"Last but not least, we have urged Israel on multiple occasions to resume the transfer of Palestinian tax and customs revenues."
"We are using all the instruments we have, whether economic or political, but the survival of this government does not depend only on us."
"Only the resumption of all financial flows to the Palestinian Authority can deliver a durable solution to their financial crisis."
"And the Palestinians have to play their role and decide once and for all to end their fighting and focus on peace."
"We still think that, despite the distress we are witnessing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Lebanon, we should profit from an important window of opportunity in the peace process in case it shuts down again, so it is very important that the German initiative is successful."
"It is crucial that the Arab League relaunches its Peace Initiative."
"As you know, there has been a determined diplomatic follow-up at the highest level in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament."
"I myself have had several meetings with the Follow-Up Committee in Sharm el Sheikh, in Riyadh, and also more recently at the GAERC meeting in Brussels."
"Secretary-General Amr Moussa and others have underlined the urgency which is more evident than ever today and he has asked for our help in bringing the parties to the table."
"On the Israeli side, I am encouraged that Foreign Minister Livni has been to Cairo and is now expecting a follow-up visit by her Jordanian and Egyptian counterparts in the coming weeks."
"She has also shown willingness to engage more than in the past and she will also be invited by the German Presidency to the next GAERC meeting."
"At the same time I also endorse the efforts of Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice to bring the parties together and start discussing the political horizon for the Palestinians."
"I hope that will be possible even though events are not going well at this moment."
"The energy and efforts invested by Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others must also be recognised."
"Next week the Quartet will meet."
"I hope that this meeting will respond to the efforts of the Arab League, which could relaunch the progress on all tracks of the peace process, but I am also realistic and I understand what the German Presidency has said, that we should at least uphold the situation."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, we are facing an extremely difficult situation."
"As the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner have stressed, this is a serious political crisis, with internal confrontations and battles between the two factions making up the Government of National Unity, in which so many hopes had been placed; an extremely serious economic, social and humanitarian crisis, and the figures are devastating: more than 66% of the Palestinian population below the poverty line; more than 50% with no food safety; more than one million people unable to receive a stable income for the last year; a hundred dead over the last three days in Lebanon; huge numbers of dead in the Gaza Strip."
"I believe that, faced with this situation, the European Union must emerge from its lethargy and take a step in the right direction."
"If one thing is being done right, then credit for that must be given to the European Commission, which, amidst countless difficulties, is making its contribution to the humanitarian and social disaster befalling the region, but I believe we must go further."
"The Commissioner has reminded us that the High Representative, Javier Solana, is currently in the region."
"We must have the courage and strength to try to move beyond fine words, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and the European Union must try to bring a little common sense to this barbaric situation in the region."
"There is a vicious circle of violence; Kassam missiles are fired, there are Israeli reprisals and suicide attacks are announced ..."
"We are facing a totally suicidal spiral of violence."
"We must try to impose a little order, we must put faith in the efforts of the High Representative, mobilise the European Union's diplomatic forces as much as possible, and the Commission must back all of the economic and humanitarian assistance that is being provided."
"I would like to draw the attention of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to an issue that I believe to be crucial; that in order to restore direct aid to the Palestinian National Authority, the Quartet stated that not only was the composition of the government decisive, but also the actions that the government was carrying out."
"Could the Presidency-in-Office of the Council explain its views in this regard and tell us how we can escape from this vicious circle of hate, violence and destruction?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Madam President, Mr Gloser, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, death and violence have returned to Gaza, Lebanon and Israel."
"As the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we stress the urgent need for a substantive change in the European Union's policy in the Middle East, with full restoration of financial aid to the Palestinian institutions and people."
"The conflicts of recent days are the product of exasperation and the stalemate in the political situation, as well as demonstrating and confirming the fact that Israel will not build its own security on the death of Palestine and Palestinians."
"European democracy's double standards towards the government of national unity must cease, as the political continuity of that government is the only hope for regaining control of the situation."
"The decision, however, to suspend financial aid to the institutions seems even more absurd since the formation of the government of national unity."
"The fact that the Council and the Commission have decided not to meet ministerial representatives of Hamas and the independents does nothing for the stability of that executive body, which is currently the only form of political expression open to the Palestinian people."
"The Mecca agreement, even if it is not an uncritical repetition of the Quartet's four points, is obviously a step in the right direction, in the sense of mutual recognition and the cessation of violence."
"On this basis we must work to ensure that the situation develops in a positive direction."
"Another reason is, as the Commissioner pointed out, that Abu Amr, the Foreign Affairs Minister, who last week was here with us in Brussels, gave us an enormous amount of reassurance on this aspect."
"We join with the grief and condemnation over the launch of missiles on Sderot and also the fact that people were killed and injured there, but at the same time we wish to call upon the Palestinian and Israeli authorities to cease disproportionate, excessive and illegal retaliation against Palestinian political and civilian figures."
"A perverse dynamic has been set back in motion and we Europeans must try to help stop it."
"I would like to remind you that the 78 people who died within a few days in Lebanon speak volumes about another poisoned fruit of the unresolved Arab-Israeli conflict, and that is the fact that in Lebanon open conflict may break out again with the 400 000 Palestinian refugees present in that country."
"We have already experienced that nightmare, so let us seek to prevent it, just as last July we put a stop to the war and Israel's aggression towards Lebanon."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the President-in-Office said that the new unity government in Palestine had not quite passed the litmus test."
"Well, the Israelis have not quite stopped building their security wall, stealing Palestinian land and water."
"The Israelis have not quite released the 10 000 prisoners, many of them held without charge or trial."
"The Israelis have not quite stopped holding checkpoints - 589 according to the Commission's latest figures - which impose an economic embargo upon the Palestinians."
"The Israelis have not quite paid back the money - which may amount to about one thousand million euros now - that they have withheld from the Palestinians' own revenue over the past year."
"They have not quite stopped the partition and separation by way of identity cards, which my own party leader, Paddy Ashdown - our former representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina - described just last Saturday as racism dressed up as administration."
"I say these things to the President-in-Office because we are seen as a European Union that practises double standards: we are seen to ignore every Israeli illegality, but to expect Palestinians to behave like saints."
"When the Commissioner says that we are using all the instruments at our disposal to get the Israelis to observe international agreements and obey the law, I do not think that can possibly be the case."
"There are many tools at our disposal that we are not even trying to exercise."
"Therefore, what does the Palestinian unity government have to do now?"
"Just two weeks ago our delegation heard Prime Minister Haniyeh not only convince us in a way that satisfied us all that the unity government was determined to meet the Quartet's three principles, and believed it was doing so, but also that it would meet with members of the Quartet without reservation or precondition at any time to try to sort out these differences."
"I urge the President-in-Office to take up that offer."
"Note also the comments just yesterday of the Norwegian Foreign Minister when he asked what would happen if we do not support this government."
"There would be only chaos and crisis if we do not give it our support."
"Therefore, President-in-Office, the good news in your speech is that you are seeking an urgent meeting to review the situation yet again."
"That is a positive step forward."
"All I can say is that we have often accused the Palestinians of missing opportunities; we have often accused the Israelis of missing opportunities."
"This is an opportunity that we ourselves must not miss."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East poses a significant and ongoing challenge not only for the countries of the region, but also for the wider world."
"We warn against a partisan emotional approach to this decades-old conflict."
"Despite all the simplification and the temptation to make facile assessments on the basis of television news clips, this is not a black or white situation."
"It may be fashionable in certain circles to label Israel as the aggressor and the oppressor, but this belief is untrue and unsound."
"The spread of radical attitudes and the votes cast for radical Hamas-style groups indicate the almost non-existent possibilities for dialogue in this area."
"Another major difficulty that is not often mentioned is the deep divisions and bitter infighting leading to armed conflict within the Palestinian political class and Palestinian society."
"Certain experts have drawn attention to the Palestinian Authority's education system."
"As stated by those who attended the conference organised last week by Mr Van Orden at the European Parliament, the system reinforces negative and antagonistic stereotypes relating the Jihad Holy War and structural opposition to Israel and actual hatred of that country."
"In the interests of objectivity, it has to be said also that since Hamas' victory in the elections held in the Palestinian Authority, Israel has been implementing a rather controversial plan whereby it is refusing to transfer Palestinian tax revenue to the Authority."
"This must have a serious impact on relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority."
"The European Union should react in a realistic and rational fashion."
"It must not behave like a short sighted benevolent uncle handing out large amounts of pocket money but failing to ascertain the use to which it is being put."
"The Union must not become a hostage to any of the parties to the conflict either."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I have to say I am still in a bit of a state of shock over the words of the representative of the Council."
"I do not understand how he can say that the new unity government does not fulfil the criteria of the Quartet."
"Our delegation has just come back from the region and all of us unanimously agreed that they had."
"Yes, there are still some Qassam rockets which of course are to be condemned."
"But do you really think that, by refusing to fully engage with the government, the EU is helping bring that back under control?"
"Do you really think it has got nothing to do with the economic and political stranglehold in which Israel holds Gaza?"
"You mention the detention of soldier Shalit - and of course he should be released - but you did not even mention the 41 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council who are still detained by Israel; you did not even mention the detention of 10 000 Palestinian political prisoners held by Israel, many without trial."
"So, let us have some balance in this debate."
"By refusing to fully recognise the new unity government and by channelling aid via a temporary international mechanism rather than through the Palestinian Authority, the EU is actively undermining the authority and the apparatus of Palestine's democratic institutions."
"And, even worse than that, our position is actually encouraging those elements both inside and outside Palestine which want this government to fail."
"Every day that goes by when we refuse to engage fully with this government is another day for the extremists to say, 'Look: democracy is not working."
"We did everything the international community demanded - democratic elections, a new unity government, fulfilling the Quartet demands, and still we face a political and economic boycott."
"So, why on earth are we helping to bring about a democratically-elected government which is doing its best to keep the peace?'"
"Is that really what we want?"
"Do not imagine that the alternative will be a slightly different government whose colours we like slightly better."
"The alternative will be chaos and violence on an unimaginable scale, the whole region will become destabilised and there will be even more rapid growth of extremism across the Middle East."
"Because, while the Council adopts a wait-and-see policy to review how the new government performs, each day it waits it puts the very outcome it wants to see in ever greater jeopardy."
"There is a very real danger that in a few years' time we will look back at this moment and think, 'Why on earth did we not support democracy in Palestine when we had the chance?'"
"So to the Council I say please tell us again what the Palestinian Government has to do, and to the Commission I ask, when will you suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement?"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the European Union is not uninvolved in the unspeakable events taking place in Palestine today."
"That is because it failed to act decisively at the appropriate time and in the right direction."
"Twenty days ago, Parliament's delegation for our relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council made an official visit to Palestine."
"Our visit was made at an historic moment in Palestine, following the swearing in of a new government that was the product of free and democratic elections, a government which, even though it had the support of 60% of the electoral body, when it was challenged by the United States and the European Union, did not hesitate to share power with other political forces in order to form a national unity government under the unquestioned leader of the Palestinian Authority, Abu Mazen, in faithful obedience to the calls of the Arab League Council."
"It was to this government, therefore, that represents the entire Palestinian people, that Parliament's delegation clearly tabled vital issues relating to the question of peace in the Middle East and, as my honourable friends have said, we received clear answers:"
"They told us that they recognise the right of Israel to exist within the 1967 borders."
"All it has to do is to recognise our right to create our own state next to Israel."
"They reject violence."
"They acknowledge all the agreements made between Israel and the PLO."
"Their immediate priorities include the release of Mr Johnston."
"They are working to get Saleet released within the framework of an exchange of prisoners."
"They told us, however, that in order to be able to achieve their goals, they need our help."
"The political and economic embargo needs to be lifted immediately."
"That is why I conclude with one call to Israel and one call to the Palestinians:"
"Israel should stop targeting missiles at its enemies and free all the elected representatives of the Palestinians;"
"the Palestinians should stop making rocket attacks on Israeli territory."
"I also call on the Council and the Commission to immediately recognise President Abbas's new democratically elected national unity government and to put an immediate end to its policy of selectively approaching certain members of that government."
"Stop the political and economic embargo immediately."
"Get dynamically involved in a creative dialogue with the entire national unity government."
"Support this government so that it can negotiate for peace."
"Otherwise chaos will ensue and the European Union will bear its share of the responsibility for it."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Madam President, sadly, the situation in Palestine confirms what the sovereigntists have been saying on the subject of the Middle East conflict for a very long time now, namely that it would be wrong to believe that this conflict can be summed up as a straightforward confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis, and even less between Muslims and Jews."
"The true division, which is becoming increasingly wide, is between, on the one side, the advocates of conciliation, which not only several Israeli statesmen - and I cannot omit to mention the glorious name of Yitzhak Rabin - but also Palestinian statesmen, such as Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas, have shown themselves to be, and, on the other side, the fanatics, both Muslim fanatics and fanatics of the Greater Israel, whose connivances are, moreover, perfectly clear, since we know that Palestinian extremist movements have been backed, and even funded, by certain Israeli radicals."
"There are therefore two camps: on the one hand, the camp that wishes to seek a political solution and, ultimately, peace, and on the other, the camp that seeks confrontation, hate and endless war."
"Regrettably, despite the fine words, the United States is playing along with the hawks, the Israeli extremists and the Muslim fundamentalists, while Europe, by which I mean the main European States, have remained silent throughout this time."
"The only European voice that showed any unity was that of the Venice declaration, in June 1980, in which the Europeans stated that they were in favour of the creation of a Palestinian State."
"Our divisions have increased, however, and Europe can now once again speak with one voice only when it has nothing to say."
"The time has come to restore the sovereignty of the States of Europe, so that they can once again play their role freely in that part of the world, where much of their future is at stake."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, anyone who has followed the events in the Middle East in recent days can do no other than be dispirited."
"Last Wednesday in the Conference of Presidents of our Parliament, I had the honour of attending a meeting with Amr Moussa, Secretary-General of the Arab League, and the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian Authority."
"What this made evident to me was their genuine will to work on a peace plan for the region, but a number of things - how shall I put it - structural problems are left pending."
"Hamas, the most important Palestinian government party, remains unyielding in its explicit refusal to recognise Israel and still refuses to renounce and condemn terrorism and violence."
"It is anybody's guess how the peace talks, in those circumstances, can lead to success."
"In fact, in the last few days, the violence between the different Palestinian camps has also flared up, with even a foiled bomb attack on President Mahmoud Abbas."
"There is no doubt in my mind that Israel has the right to defend itself against violence and terror, by military means if necessary."
"Israel should be warned, though, against actions directed at Palestinian members of parliament and a fortiori at the Palestinian Prime Minister, although some have voiced an interest in choosing this path, for, were they to do so, they would be crossing a dangerous line, and making a subsequent, and even greater escalation of violence, inevitable."
"- Madam President, the misery and suffering in Palestine is truly awful and, while the fact that it is largely self-inflicted does not lessen its impact, it undermines those who always want to blame Israel for every tragedy in the region."
"Today, of course, the usual suspects in this debate, like Mr Davies and Ms Lucas, on their habitual hobbyhorses, have done their biased best to unreasonably shift all the blame onto Israel."
"What we are witnessing is a veritable civil war in Palestine between Fatah and Hamas, and the particularly aggressive actions of Hamas show us that the pursuit of democracy and a democratic mandate has done nothing to tame or to temper their adherence to terror."
"It is this undiluted attachment to terror that makes Hamas so unfit to govern."
"Likewise, their continuing aggression towards Israel, with their sustained rocket campaign, wholly justifies the defensive response of Tel Aviv."
"I fear that, as long as Fatah and Hamas can tout both gun and ballot, democracy and the peace that it can bring will not prevail in this troubled and failed entity that is Gaza."
"Any international initiative that fails to address the removal of the gun from both sides in Palestine will flounder and fail."
"Madam President, once again we are discussing this tragic situation in Palestine."
"Let me say at the outset that all of us condemn terrorism wherever it occurs."
"I should say that the suicide bombers who attacked London a couple of years ago all came from my constituency."
"However, they were motivated by events in the Middle East - by Iraq and by Palestine - and therefore it is proper that we should not only consider the events in the Middle East as they affect the people there but also people in our own territories."
"I used to say that Israel was the only democracy in the Middle East."
"But two years ago I chaired our delegation for the elections of President Abbas, which were much welcomed by the international community."
"However, when he came here a few months ago he said that if we, the international community, would not support him, there would be chaos and civil war in his country."
"Last year I chaired the Election Observation Mission for the elections to the parliament in Palestine, and then the European Union turned its back on those results."
"We seem to be paralysed by the roadmap."
"However, in my view the situation has now got to the point where the EU simply has to change its approach."
"Palestine is collapsing economically, politically and socially."
"We are risking another Algeria, where, when the West turned its back on the results of the elections in 1992, the result was 200 000 dead."
"I believe the time has now come for the EU, if it cannot recognise the government of national unity, at least under the terms of a draft resolution some of us discussed last week, it should cooperate comprehensively with that government."
"Secondly, it is surely high time that the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs had a working party - not just on the United Nations or the Balkans or the five external financing instruments: let us have a working party on the Middle East."
"(FR) Madam President, let us imagine a city that is regularly plunged into darkness."
"Let us imagine a city with no police."
"Let us imagine a situation in which State employees have not been paid for a year and a half."
"Let us imagine hospitals with no drugs and schools with no educational supplies."
"Let us imagine a sealed-off city, left to its own devices, with no administration in operation."
"And let us imagine that money is circulating there, and weapons."
"Remember that one night of power cuts in New York led to looting and crime, in the world's largest democracy."
"So what can we expect today in Palestine?"
"Our irresponsible policy has led to the collapse of the administrations that we had set up, to the weakening of the power in place, to increased poverty, to the re-emergence of diseases that had disappeared - even the World Bank agrees on this - and this, despite the laudable efforts of the Commission."
"We have now just climbed a step further into misery: the Palestinians are killing each other!"
"This situation was predictable though, ladies and gentlemen."
"Rather than seeking unity between the two great Palestinian factions, whose legitimacy was based on fair elections, rather than backing their unity from the outset, we decided to play the game of sanctions, thus dividing them."
"While President Abbas risked his life and staked everything on ensuring the creation of a government of national unity, based on a political platform inspired by the principles of the Quartet and respecting the peace commitments that had previously been made, we stood by and waited."
"We have not been able to take advantage of this glint of light and of the hopes raised in Mecca."
"Today, Javier Solana, who is on a visit to the region, has quite rightly stated: 'We must support Palestinian unity'."
"But we will not support that unity by sending money and weapons to one of the parties!"
"There is only one way to do that, as you all know: politics."
"That is why, together with some of my colleagues, I shall say this to you: we must urgently recognise the government of national unity!"
"Its authority must be established, and we must help it to establish that authority and to ensure the subsistence of its population."
"He who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind: I am not the first person to say that."
"If we refuse to work with moderate Islamists, however, we will just be stuck with the radicals and the extremists, and it is not just in Palestine that they will make their voices heard!"
"(DE) Madam President, the situation is indeed a tragic one."
"Groups of Hamas radicals are day by day bombarding Sderot with Qassam rockets, and these attacks, far from being random, are the fifth breach of the cease-fire so far."
"What is evident is that the attempt is again being made to distract attention from the in-fighting between the Palestinians themselves, that is to say between Hamas and Fatah, with fighting in which 55 Palestinians have died, killed by Palestinian hands."
"It seemed to them that the time was ripe for attention to be diverted to their common foe, Israel, and how did Israel respond?"
"It responded with the mailed fist."
"This Israeli Government, whose approval ratings lie around the 3% mark, is doing Hamas a favour by trying to wipe out the source of the attacks by military means, leading to more Palestinian victims, whose deaths we lament."
"Hamas has again won itself time and can put off to another day the political concessions that have to be made."
"Yet again, we appear to be paralysed."
"Concessions were, after all, made in Mecca; they may not, to be sure, have been sufficient, but, despite the weaknesses of Mecca, these concessions amounted to a major step in the direction of peace."
"That agreement has now been stricken to the heart by this resumption of violence."
"I do believe, then, that it is for the time being right and proper that the European Union should insist on compliance with all the Quartet's conditions and with what was agreed at Mecca before it resumes making payments to the unity government."
"This does not run counter to Mr McMillan-Scott's call for pragmatic and all-round cooperation to be sought where it really is for the people's benefit."
"We should not, nevertheless, abandon this vital tool before it is time to do so."
"I would encourage the Council, the Commission and the Arab League to make the effort to press ahead, and would very much like to see them achieve success as soon as possible."
"(PL) Madam President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the European Union managed to retain its credibility at the recent summit in Samara."
"Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, and Mrs Merkel, the President of the Council, had no hesitation in making pertinent and forthright comments on the unfair treatment meted out to Poland, a Member State of the European Union, over the meat issue."
"Mr Barroso and Mrs Merkel also commented in the same vein about human rights in Russia."
"The question arises as to why the Union does not go further and highlight the fate of Palestinians in Israel, or that of Cyprus, which has been under Turkish occupation since 1974."
"Major injustices are being still perpetrated on the Union's doorstep in the 21st century, and we continue to do too little to help overcome them."
"Did people not die in Palestine before the creation of the state of Israel?"
"How much longer will the Israeli army of occupation remain in the Palestinian Territories?"
"Do the Palestinians not have a right to their own state?"
"The Jewish people were denied their own state for so long - how can they deprive others of that right?"
"The Palestinians' response to the ongoing occupation is to launch attacks on Israel."
"In comparison to the actions of the Israeli forces, those perpetrated by the Palestinians are amateur efforts."
"It should be for Israel to make the initial move towards facilitating the creation of a Palestinian State."
"That would be the first step towards reducing violence in the region and promoting coexistence."
"It is the European Union's duty to be the guardian of freedom in the world, especially now that the United States has relinquished that role and sided with Israel."
"Perhaps the events of September 11 would not have taken place if the United States had persevered in its previous role of impartial guardian of law and justice the world over."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, having said, in our last debate, which followed the Hamas victory, that Europe must never again allow the existence of Israel to be jeopardised, it is with all the greater anguish and sadness that I return from travelling through Palestine."
"What I mean by that is that, though I wanted to visit Palestine, it was nowhere to be found; what I found instead was a military hinterland, dismembered, divided, a land in which members of families are cut off from one another and from their places of work, in which towns are deprived of water and settlements of fertile land."
"All I can say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, is that nobody can live under such circumstances."
"The Israeli Government's occupation regime is not making the country more secure; it is putting it in jeopardy by turning Palestine into a seedbed of despair, hatred and violence."
"I can tell you, Commissioner, that the situation has got worse; it will, indeed, get worse still, and nobody can or should be surprised at that."
"Politicians always find the analysis of military measures difficult, but one fundamental conviction derived from my trip that I would like to share with you is that this occupation regime also serves other purposes: quite obviously, and undeniably, the protection of illegal settlements and the links between them."
"It also serves to keep the country's water resources in Israeli hands, to put in place a system of land acquisition whereby Israel's borders may be set still wider."
"That cannot be a means to peace."
"As I said earlier, no longer must anybody put at risk Israel's right to exist, and so, critical as one may be of it, and whatever demands we might make for the sake of peace in Israel, what I want to say today is that we need to demand that this regime of occupation be abandoned and that help be given in establishing a viable Palestinian state."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Palestinians are continuing to die and so many have already died; again they are being collectively punished."
"The army's response is to a group of terrorists, who should indeed be confronted, but once again it is the Palestinian people that is paying."
"It is our duty and our responsibility to recognise our failure as international communities, political parties and movements: after forty years the Israeli military occupation continues and the wall is stealing water and land from the future Palestinian State."
"The tragedy that is unfolding has been predicted many times."
"Since 1980 we have been talking about two peoples and two States: one State exists, but the other does not."
"The Palestinian people is deprived of freedom, humiliated, expropriated, and hostage to extremist groups that have taken the people and also the leadership hostage."
"It is not enough!"
"It is really not enough to promise that we will give more economic aid."
"The solution is a political one: stop the military occupation and the expansion of settlements, recognise the Palestinian Government of national unity, and work to achieve Palestinian unity and not division."
"We must show that the European Union believes in international legality and says so to Israel, which is continually infringing it."
"The country is in fact, day by day, as David Grossman says, losing its very morality."
"We must act quickly!"
"Act quickly, because the Palestinians and Israelis and Lebanese are paying the price of our incapacity and of our double standards."
"We should recognise the government and also perhaps place an international United Nations force in Gaza and the West Bank."
"In my view this is vital."
"(EL) Madam President, we are still living with the consequences of a mistake made in 1947."
"If there had been no unilateral recognition of Israel and the state of Palestine had been recognised back then, we would have saved a great deal of bloodshed."
"One statistics office has concluded that all the blood shed in the area could have saved one million children with blood transfusions."
"All these tragedies which happened with the twin towers, in London, in Madrid and elsewhere are the result of this policy in 1947, which we are continuing today."
"Why go into interminable details?"
"Will we have the strength tomorrow to recognise the state of Palestine?"
"That would be some sort of progress."
"We are blowing the final whistle when the score is 90 - 10."
"When the umpire blows his final whistle when the score is 50 - 50, he leaves the pitch with his head held high."
"When he blows his final whistle when the score is 60 - 40, the game is over, but when he blows his final whistle when the score is 90 - 10, all hell breaks out both on the terraces and on the pitch."
"We therefore are responsible for this hell, because we blew our final whistle when the score was 90 - 10."
"The world is going to the dogs and we hear references in Parliament to Iran's nuclear weapons every day."
"No one has ever spoken about Israel's nuclear weapons and that is wrong."
"If we want to be fair, if we want to believe our citizens and for them to trust us, we must administer justice and there will only be justice with the recognition of the state of Palestine."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the Berlin Wall may have fallen, the Soviet Empire may belong in the past, the world has become globalised, but there is at least one thing that is unchanging, a place where history has come to a standstill, which is Palestine, the Palestine that is becoming mankind's black hole: Gaza, the camps, rockets, intifadas, attacks, one land for two peoples, a long war that has been going on for sixty years now."
"It is also a great jungle of myths, with esplanades, tombs, patriarchs, temples, mosques, monotheism and cynicism, a cynicism shared, moreover, by the hardliners on both sides."
"On the Israeli side, there is technology, force, the elimination of Arafat, of Fatah, economic strangulation, the prisoners, in short, everything, but most definitely not negotiations, Iran over Iraq, Shi'ism over Baathism, and, on the Palestinian side, the hardliners clearly have demographics on their side in the long term."
"In the meantime, three generations have already been sacrificed, and what do we do?"
"Well, we make statements, visits, humanitarian missions - do we not, Mr Solana?"
"That is all!"
"The fact is, this conflict is the descendant of the European conflicts of 1914-1918 and 1939-45, and we are not doing what we should be doing, we are indulging in Pharisaism."
"We know, however, that we should go further than emergency meetings, that we should stop the embargos, that we should invest, that we need a European Camp David, with all of the parties - not only Israel, Palestine and its government of unity, but also Syria, Iran and Lebanon - and we know that we must state the two rights, the right of the Israeli State to exist in perpetuity, of course, but also the right of the Palestinian State to exist, to be recognised."
"Madam President, the recent downward spiral of internecine violence between armed secular Fatah and Islamist Hamas militias in Gaza is of grave concern, as we now see the consequences of a weakened Israeli leadership post-Lebanese war and a weakened Palestinian President Abbas having to deal with the religious fundamentalists within Hamas, who won the elections last year."
"The Hamas members of the unity government are clearly not able to break away from their intransigent positions based on theocratic obscurantist views that the State of Israel can never be explicitly recognised, that terrorist violence is justified and that they are not bound by previous agreements signed by the late Chairman Arafat."
"So clearly this Palestinian Authority unity government does not fulfil the Quartet criteria and the EU cannot lift the ban on Hamas as a terrorist organisation or directly fund the Palestinian Authority at present, relying instead on the TIM for delivery of humanitarian aid which now totals over EUR 500 million yearly and has actually risen during the last three years."
"There is increasing acceptance amongst Arabs, as evidenced by the recent proposals from the Arab League, of the desirability of a negotiated solution."
"The Israelis all recognise the damage to Israel's economy and society of the continuing violence after the recent spate of over 100 Qassam missiles launched by Hamas at civilian areas."
"In fact there was one fatality last week which constitutes, in my view, a war crime under international law."
"Only the extremists, it seems, are afraid of peace."
"Whatever the origins of the Middle East conflict, there is increasing recognition amongst Arab States that Israel is here to stay, whilst Jews around the world can see that Israel's long-term security is best served by recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have their own secure state also."
"But the Palestinian Authority must first be able to secure law and order on its territory, which it is failing signally to do right now."
"Securing the release of the BBC reporter Alan Johnston and the kidnapped soldier, Corporal Shalit, would be a great start and create a climate conducive to restarting the vital roadmap for peace talks."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise for the fact I have to leave as soon as I have finished speaking, as I have to go and chair something."
"I know that is impolite, but I would ask you to understand and bear with me."
"It is not, of course, a matter of doubt that Israel is entitled to defend itself against the Kassam missiles, for firing them at civilian facilities and persons is a crime."
"It is a provocation to Israel, but also to the government currently in power in Palestine."
"One might even say that that is the main object of the exercise - and what is the European Union doing about it?"
"I regret to have to tell Mr Gloser that the answer he has given - on behalf of the Council presidency, of course - is quite utterly unsatisfactory, no less so than the one given at the last debate."
"We are doing nothing to strengthen the hand of those forces that alone are capable of taking action against these terrorists."
"Our statements will change nothing, nor, alas, will Israel's retaliatory military actions, justified though they may be in individual cases, if the European Union does not give this government a chance."
"I say 'government', for it is cynical to decide which individual ministers one will meet with and which one to avoid;"
"I did mention last time round that the President of the Council was having meetings with the Israeli foreign minister, but, when it came to meeting his Palestinian counterpart, claimed that she was not in the habit of meeting foreign ministers."
"That way of going about things is not really going to produce results."
"While I have no desire to make life difficult for the Commissioner for Foreign Relations, she did in fact talk in terms of supporting the government rather than individual ministers, and while the pair of them say we have to support Abbas, they are not actually doing so by denying their backing to his government and failing to enable it to take action against terrorism and those who engage in it."
"That is the problem; if Europe does not commit itself to doing that all these talks will avail us nothing, since peace can be established only from within, and there will be peace only if there are, in Palestine, strong forces that can enforce their will by reason of their getting support - be it political, moral or financial - from the European Union in their fight against the terrorists."
"That will help both Palestine and Israel."
"Let me say once again that, if you want to help Israel, you have to give this government a chance."
"Nothing else is worthy of being taken seriously."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Presidency and the Commission for being present."
"Clearly, the time available permits me to make just a few observations."
"Palestine is a serious and urgent issue, and we must seek to correct the current downward spiral of events."
"The government of national unity is our sole interlocutor, and we must take note of this in a realistic way and seek to gain time with a gesture of hope towards Palestine."
"We could also put in a peacekeeping force and have the courage, as the European Union, to be joint guarantor of the security of Israel and Palestine."
"This must be based on a policy of opening up to the Arab world, starting with the whole of the Mediterranean, and thus not isolating this conflict from the general problem of the relationship between Islam and the West."
"I have a dream: that a reformed United Nations Organisation will have its headquarters in Jerusalem, so that this kind of hope can actually be created."
"We can work at this;"
"I believe that we will be able to achieve it!"
"Madam President, the Hamas Charter is a sacred text with three Islamic seals."
"Unlike the secular PLO, Hamas does not recognise the concept of peace."
"The PLO may want a two-state solution, but Hamas wants to eliminate Israel."
"What does the Hamas Charter say?"
"In Article 7 it mentions an Islamic world order and the destruction of all Jews."
"Articles 22 and 28 say that the Jewish people created the French and Russian Revolutions, the First and Second World Wars, but also the United Nations, drugs and alcohol abuse, and control of the mass media."
"Stopping the conflict with Israel is high treason and perpetrators will be cursed, according to Article 32."
"Cooperation with Hamas would make the EU morally responsible for a peace process leading to the elimination of Israel."
"We must help the Palestinians, but not by facilitating the Hamas agenda."
"(NL) Madam President, in early February, the German newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, featured an extremely gloomy report on the EU's police mission in the Palestinian regions."
"Its outgoing leader, a Briton by the name of MacGyver, did not mince his words when he said 'We are working here in a quagmire of deceit and corruption'."
"Months later, an escalation of rivalry between Fatah and Hamas only made matters worse."
"The necessary question arises as to how meaningful the Council and Commission deem the continuation of the EU mission to set up a civil police force on the West Bank and in Gaza."
"You will hardly want to shoulder some of the responsibility for the far-reaching lawlessness in that area."
"Meanwhile, the news agency Reuters announced yesterday that the European Union will be extending its border mission in Rafah by a year under the revealing, unchanged motto 'The Palestinians are responsible for the border'."
"Their police are sure to put something in the way of the smugglers of arms, drugs, money and people, according to Palestinian insiders, such as the one who spoke to me."
"I would ask the Council and Commission the same question: are you prepared to face up to your responsibility in this, and do so in a spirit of humility?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I ask your understanding for the fact that I am able, at the moment, to make only a few brief comments, as I have a meeting with your Committee on Foreign Affairs at 6.00 p.m., when I will be reviewing and evaluating the last meeting of the General Affairs and Foreign Relations Council."
"While I can understand all the things you have said, not least that which has been said on the basis of your own travels and discussions, I would ask you also to take note of the fact that it was the European Union, notably the previous and current presidencies, that actually did something about reviving the Middle East Quartet and getting some sort of process in motion, without which process the Saudi Arabian initiative would not have happened, and so I would ask you to take a nuanced view and bear in mind that certain things cannot be attributed to the immobility of certain funds."
"This is, after all, an intra-Palestinian conflict."
"We have of course - as I made clear in the statement on behalf of the presidency - spelled out in our talks with Israel that the funds rightly due to the Palestinians, in the shape of customs duties and taxes, must be returned to them if various infrastructure measures are to be guaranteed."
"The Commissioner has, on repeated occasions, and not least to the Council, commented on how the European Union has been providing support over recent months."
"The public may occasionally have got the impression that we are paying too little or nothing at all, but the opposite is in fact the case, for the European Union has, and during a very critical period, transferred more funds than it had done under other conditions previously."
"To Mr Davis, I would like to say that we do not want the Palestinians, on the grounds of their expecting everything, to have to be seen as some sort of saints, but one thing that did become clear from the Mecca conference when attempts were being made to put together a government of national unity, was that the conditions on which the Middle East quartet has always insisted must be met, those being the right of Israel to exist, the renunciation of violence and also the discharge of the obligations entered into by the previous government."
"Certain things are moving, but there is as yet no clarity as to whether the government is committed to those things."
"There is absolutely no reason for us to put up some sort of wall; the government of national unity could well take this step, and the conditions could be established."
"We are not, after all, treating this as a marginal issue; every time it meets, the Council considers how progress can be made."
"As I have already said, the presidency is trying to arrange, in the immediate future, a meeting of the Middle East quartet, since we know just how much depends on that."
"The High Representative, who is currently in Beirut, many kilometres to the north, knows that this is not just about Palestine and Israel, but also about the issue of Lebanon's security and its right to self-determination."
"I would like to urge that we should go beyond just talking and try to get some initiatives off the ground to the end not only that there may be a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians, but also that financial aid be given and that we may - as I have just again looked up - ask Israel to facilitate freedom of movement for the Palestinians, so that they may no longer be penned in in the way that they currently are, in a situation with which nobody can be satisfied."
"I crave the House's indulgence, but I really must now leave your debate."
"(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for staying here with us today."
"Unlike many MEPs, I have been to Palestine more than once."
"In line with what everyone here wished, Israel has left Gaza, and handed it over to a free, democratically elected government."
"Gaza is therefore not some military outpost, it is a country devastated by the extremism, fundamentalism, terrorism, corruption and cynicism of the Palestinian warlords themselves."
"Ladies and gentlemen, are we naïve enough to think that throwing more hundreds of millions of euros without clear guidelines will stop Jund Al-Islam or Mohamed Dahlan from further acts of violence?"
"Do we honestly believe that legalising warlords and terrorists like Khaled Mashal or Dahlan will bring peace to the region?"
"Fortunately, the Council and the Commission have taken a firm, clear stance, and I wish to thank them for that."
"I am grateful that on this tricky matter, they have adopted the right position."
"We should reject violence and pay tribute to the victims of Gaza and the West Bank."
"We must state clearly our opposition to Hamas using its power in the Palestinian Government to attack Israel to further its appallingly extremist interests."
"I wish to warn against working with Hamas, including Members of the government, as this is clearly proscribed, or with new Al-Qaeda organisations such as Fatah Al-Islam and Jund Al-Islam."
"We call on the Palestinian Government not only to recognise the exchange of letters between Rabin and Arafat but also to stop lying about fulfilling the key condition of recognising Israel."
"We call on the Palestinian Government and on all Arab politicians, in particular the Saudis and Egyptians, to acknowledge all of their political and human responsibilities and to take part immediately in peace negotiations involving full recognition of the State of Israel within duly recognised international borders."
"We call on Fatah to begin negotiations with Hamas without delay on the sharing of power within the President's Office."
"It is only by adopting the right position and having a clearly-stated standpoint that we will be able genuinely to provide humanitarian aid and, most importantly, to support the emergence of a viable, democratic Palestinian state."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, as previous speakers have mentioned, Parliament was in Palestine at the beginning of the month."
"That was a very tense time, but now, two weeks on, that tension has increased and unfortunately the citizens of the region are expecting less and less of the EU."
"In spite of the various sources of tension, Parliament sought to be there on the ground."
"It was indeed there, and today, despite the increased tension, Mr Solana is also in the region."
"We saw human tragedy, which you described, Commissioner, and which you of course acknowledge. We also saw a wall 852 km in length, which, with a view to combating violence and to keeping Israelis safe from Arab attacks, has invaded 25% of West Bank territory and has annexed territory that is central to any peace agreement based on the 1967 plan."
"It is a wall that imprisons people in their own homes, that stops children from getting to school and that stops farmers from cultivating their land."
"It is a wall that has turned Gaza into the best-known open prison in the world."
"It is a prison which, according to a decision by the Israeli police at the beginning of 2006, no one - or should that be nothing - is to enter or leave."
"In this context, we all look on bemused and deny any involvement."
"Today we hope that Mr Solana's eyes and heart can convey some hope to these people on our behalf."
"When we were there we passed on the message and recognised the government called for by the Quartet, and we are effectively calling today for that to continue to be the case. Let us hope that the Council and the Commission honour this commitment, that they meet their obligations and that they are ready to work with everyone."
"What the EU is actually ready to do must be spelled out in the clearest terms."
"Let us show the world once again that peace can only be achieved by extending our hand to those who need it and by eliminating their despair."
"(FI) Madam President, first I wish to say that, hearing this debate, I have felt that the overall picture is somewhat limited."
"Any educated member of the public following it might think that very many Members of the European Parliament had very limited knowledge about the history of the Palestinian and Israeli region."
"How did the state of Israel come about?"
"What was the Balfour Declaration and so on?"
"What was the UN resolution at the time?"
"What was the basis for the partition?"
"It is shameful of us parliamentarians if we do not first do our homework but instead come and speak very emotionally about things we do not necessarily know about."
"That is why it is fitting to stop and consider what the issue actually is in this region, and take an overall view of it instead of just hinting at it momentarily."
"We Europeans must support democracy and not terrorism."
"Our values are human rights, freedom of thought and the rule of law."
"We have to keep to them."
"Moreover, if they are our values we cannot recognise the 'national unity government', which is a terrorist organisation led by Hamas."
"We cannot acknowledge them: as Europeans we have to adhere to our democratic values."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following our visit to the West Bank and Gaza in early May, I can do no more than conclude that we are further away from a structural solution than ever, despite the agreement that was struck 40 years ago."
"A huge number of illegal settlements are being set up on the West Bank."
"We can only watch as the number of check points increases rather than decreases."
"In Gaza, 87% of the people are living below the poverty line."
"There are still 41 Palestinian members of parliament behind bars and the subject of refugees returning is not being touched upon at all."
"The wall is indeed growing into the world's largest, something in which Israel can surely take pride."
"Despite this, the Palestinians are also entitled to self-determination and a dignified existence, and they are prepared to bring sacrifices and compromise."
"They have shown explicitly and on several occasions that they want peace and prosperity for their people."
"Do the international community and the European Union still actually want this, though?"
"I wonder about this sometimes, not least when I hear the Commissioner say today that, following talks with the minister, she heard the request made of the government of national unity to give its support and that Abbas has made the same request."
"So why do you not recognise the government?"
"What are you really waiting for?"
"When will you finally give the Palestinian Authority direct support?"
"I heard the presidency talk about the Quartet requirements, but we should not wait for a new Quartet meeting."
"The European Union could take the lead in this."
"We need to talk to the government as a whole."
"Finally, Commissioner, you claim that all instruments are being used to force Israel to redirect those taxes to the Palestinians."
"I cannot think what the instruments were to which you were referring and I should like to hear more about them, for I believe there is no time to lose now."
"(FR) Mr President, today we once again have to deal with the dreadful situation in the Middle East."
"Since 6 May, thirty-six Palestinians, including eleven civilians, have died in Israeli raids on Gaza."
"On the other side, 146 rockets have been fired at the Israeli town of Sderot, wounding six people."
"The Palestinians are fighting amongst themselves."
"In Lebanon, the 3 000 refugees in the Nahr Al-Bared camp are paying the price for the fighting between the Lebanese army and the extremists of Fatah-al-Islam."
"In this regard, let us state clearly that there is never any justification for killing civilian populations."
"More generally, we must call for a radical change to Europe's policy on the Middle East."
"It is no longer acceptable to refuse to support politically and financially, and with no exclusions, a Palestinian Government of national unity that we have advocated passionately and that, if we are to believe the Palestinian Foreign Minister, whom we received recently, firstly, respects political pluralism, secondly, does not question the existence of the Israeli State, thirdly, calls for the recognition of a Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, and fourthly, renews its commitment to the UN and Arab resolutions, particularly on the refugee issue."
"Let us think clearly, the peace initiative drawn up at the Riyadh Summit has no chance of succeeding unless we Europeans work towards lifting the political and economic siege being suffered by the Palestinian Government."
"Fifteen months of blockade, 70% of the population living below the poverty line and 50% unemployment provide an ideal breeding ground for fundamentalism and terrorism but do not provide a government with the best conditions for restoring law and order."
"Since we are calling upon the Palestinian Government to fulfil its responsibilities, we must fulfil ours."
"Mr President, as a child I was happy to believe that all people were equal."
"Growing into a young man I was very upset to realise how wrong I was: that there were in fact two kinds of people - those whose lives matter and those whose lives do not matter."
"Then, I became involved in politics and I was taught that what was really important was not what is right but what brings in votes."
"Today, as an MEP, I have finally formed the opinion - simplistic and cynical as it may sound to some - that there are indeed two kinds of people: those liked by the American Government and those who are not."
"Based on this view, the Palestinian people can be humiliated, starved, imprisoned without trial, tortured, executed, etc. and it does not really matter, because the Bush Administration and their obedient servants, e.g. the 'Blairinos' of this world, consider Palestinians to be subhuman."
"Therefore, why waste our time debating Palestine when we know that nothing significant will come of it?"
"If we really care about the issue, then we should address our efforts towards the planet's Grand Master, Mr Bush, and try to convince him that Palestinians are in fact human."
"If we succeed, which I very much doubt, then perhaps we can contribute constructively towards solving the Palestinian problem."
"(PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all long for peace in the Middle East."
"Nonetheless, the suggestion that the European Union should resume provision of its entire package of financial aid directly to the government of the Palestinian Authority is decidedly premature."
"Holding democratic elections in a country is not enough to justify the award of European aid."
"The European Union certainly does refuse to allow expenditure of its taxpayers' money in a number of democratic countries."
"I believe there are two fundamental reasons for disallowing expenditure."
"The first is if the country concerned simply does not require our aid."
"The second is if the country concerned does not recognise or does not implement fundamental principles that are crucial for the European Union."
"It is this second reason that applies to Palestine."
"Essentially, the disagreement over financing does not centre on Israel or Palestine; it centres on our own principles."
"The potential beneficiary is refusing to recognise the donor's right to implement certain basic principles."
"We should not be spending time debating when to use the terms terrorism or fight for freedom."
"What we should instead be debating is whether it is possible to support an organisation whose programme centres on promoting the use of force against others."
"Can we support those who really do not want peace?"
"The answer to the question as to whether we should finance authorities that do not want peace is obvious, or so it would seem."
"We should not."
"The reasons why we should deny support have nothing to do with the chaos in the Palestinian Authority, or with the uncertainty about how long the national unity government is likely to be able to govern."
"They have nothing to do with how long that government will be able to exercise genuine power."
"They have nothing to do either with the fact that 50 Palestinians were killed last week in clashes between Hamas and Fatah, nor do they have anything to do with the fact that children's television broadcasts by the Al-Aksa station call on Palestinian children to help destroy Israel and take part in the war."
"The main reason why we should deny aid is that we must be true to our own principles, values and past."
"It should be clearly stated that the choice between victory and martyrdom offered by Prime Minister Hanieh is flawed and detrimental to the national interests of the Palestinian people."
"Mr President, I was mildly encouraged by what the Commissioner had to say and, frankly, thoroughly depressed by what the Council had to say."
"It seems incredible that the Council fails to recognise that the creation of a government of national unity in Palestine was a major political risk both for Fatah and Hamas."
"The platform of unity government is a platform of negotiations and trying to reach peace, something the Council failed to acknowledge."
"I believe - and I think the majority in this House now believes - that the time has come to stop all restrictions on our dealings with the Palestinian Authority."
"The Commissioner has said today that the conditions for renewing direct aid have almost been met."
"Commissioner, let us not wait for protection."
"I plead with you to go to the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting and ask them to recognise the Palestinian Authority's government of national unity."
"If the Palestinian Government fails to keep its promise, of course we can then end our negotiations and our involvement with them, but let us give them a chance."
"Failure to cooperate with the Palestinian Government does nothing to end the cycle of violence or tackle the grave humanitarian crisis that so many of my colleagues have spoken eloquently about this afternoon."
"Failure to cooperate with the Palestinian Government also does nothing to encourage Israel to end its financial and military assaults on Palestine."
"Even today, the Deputy Defence Minister of Israel warned that his country could single out the leader of Hamas, the current Palestinian Prime Minister, for extrajudicial killing."
"Does anyone really believe that actions such as this would help the peace process?"
"Mr President, after the tragic failure of the Bush administration to push for an Israel/Palestine peace deal in the last five years, the Arab peace initiative is a rare bright spot."
"The release of Corporal Shalit and Alan Johnston and the 40 Palestinian legislators would create much-needed goodwill."
"The fact that the EU and the US are maintaining links with Palestinian Foreign and Finance Ministers shows that there is no boycott, no failure to engage and the hundreds of millions of euros of humanitarian aid mean our back is not turned to the peoples' plight."
"However, it is very difficult to conceive of resuming budgetary support to the PA when the unity government has not, despite some claims to the contrary, fulfilled the Quartet demands."
"Even if we do not attribute to Prime Minister Haniyeh the continuing statements of Hamas spokesmen vowing to destroy Israel, we cannot ignore his invocation of God or martyrdom to rally Palestinians just last night."
"Colleagues who wished to argue pragmatically that the unity government is the best deal on offer should stick to that justification for supping with them and not try to persuade us that something has happened which has not."
"Mr President, our message to every Israeli, every Palestinian, every member of Hamas or Fatah must be: In the name of your god and for the sake of your children, pull back!"
"Today we have the Israeli spokesman threatening to kill the elected Prime Minister of Palestine; we have the Hamas threats to seek vengeance; we have Fatah and Hamas in and out of conflict with each other; the killing of a Palestinian family on a Gaza beach leading to the capturing of the soldier Shalit, which led to attack and counterattack, tit for tat and on it goes."
"Stop; think; talk."
"Release soldier Shalit, release Alan Johnston and release the speaker and the 40 members of the elected Palestinian Parliament."
"And to the EU I say, engage with both the Palestinian Government and with the Israeli Government."
"Secondly, one says, let us find ways of ending the causes of violence, and the biggest cause is poverty."
"Palestinian poverty has rocketed and poverty comes from withheld taxes, from unpaid employees, from trade and banking embargoes."
"It is time for all that to end before it ends in more violence."
"It is time to stop and remove illegal settlements."
"It is time to stop and remove that gruesome, cruel, immoral wall, and it is time, Commissioner, to publish the document compiled by the heads of mission in Jerusalem and Ramallah, who reported on East Jerusalem and whose summary was that Israel's activities in Jerusalem are in violation both of its roadmap obligations and of international law."
"Let us have that out in the open; let us talk, and let us then persuade everybody to think about their children's future, stop the violence and work for peace."
"(Applause)"
"(CS) Violence and unrest continue in the Palestinian territories."
"The world's press agencies bring daily news of the numbers of injured and dead."
"Despite repeated ceasefire declarations between Fatah and Hamas, the armed conflict between the two factions goes on."
"The shelling of the town of Sderot from the Gaza Strip and retaliation from the Israeli side also continues."
"Palestinian health workers and teachers have gone on strike, and Palestinian policemen and other public service workers have not been paid."
"As has been said on a number of occasions, poverty is rising fast."
"Over 80% of Palestinians on the Gaza Strip live on less than USD 2 per day."
"The bottom line is that Palestine and Israel need our help because they will not be able to escape the cycle of violence on their own."
"I count myself among those MEPs who are calling for broader and deeper EU support."
"I should therefore like to call on the Commission, once again, to do all it can to mobilise international assistance as rapidly and as effectively as possible."
"I feel that if this does not happen, the probability will increase of Palestinian self-rule collapsing completely and of all-out civil war being unleashed, with incalculable consequences not only for Palestine but also for the whole of the Middle East."
"The same can be said, too, of Lebanon."
"Mr President, it has been a very passionate discussion and I completely understand why because, as I said before, we all feel a great frustration."
"But you have to understand that, over the last 10 years, the European Union has really tried to play an important role for the peace process - not in order to enhance the conflict but in order to make peace, or help to make peace."
"In the end it is always the two parties that have to be ready, but we try to push them."
"We were then quite happy to be an important and influential member of the Quartet."
"However, we can only be a facilitator of this peace."
"That means we have to look to both sides."
"We cannot just go to one side, and therefore we feel that we embraced the three Quartet principles as important basic principles."
"It really is the Council, not the Commission, that can recognise the Government - there are 27 Member States."
"I understand if you ask me to do so, but it is not me who can take this decision."
"I know there is one instrument which you have indirectly mentioned: the cancellation or suspension of the association agreement with Israel; but do you really think this would make a difference?"
"I do not think it would."
"We would no longer be a facilitator of this process, so it would be the wrong instrument at this moment."
"What we have as an instrument is a continuous political dialogue where all the parties work with all the parties, but it is true that there are other members of the Quartet too, for instance the United States of America, as has been mentioned."
"It is very important that we feel that there is also a push from that side too."
"Over the last months, we have seen a much greater effort on the part of the USA, particularly from Condoleezza Rice."
"We have all welcomed that and have tried to move forward."
"The German Presidency, in particular Mrs Merkel, but also Foreign Minister Steinmeier, have really tried to move forward."
"A political solution can never be brought about by violence."
"Unfortunately, we now have violence again."
"I can promise - and this is within the Commission's competence - that we will further engage with the National Unity Government, as we have started to do."
"But as we have said our policy is a gradual engagement and we cannot do everything."
"Even Salam Fayad said to me when I first met him after the formation of the Government that I would need some time to clean up the mess in the Finance Ministry - and this is still not completely done."
"Therefore, we are nearly there, the technical conditions would be ready, but you also know that the Council has to give us some political backing."
"I want you to understand these things."
"I think the situation is very dramatic, and I hope that the Council understands that we have to engage in order to help this National Unity Government achieve the right platform to continue with the peace process and with the talks on the political horizon."
"We know that it is a complicated situation, and that is why I said that I see at least some positive hope in the fact that Foreign Minister Livni will attend the next Council meeting after the very positive meeting we had with the Arab League, but on the ground I agree that the situation is very difficult, and, besides all this, it is also those factions and those different radical groups that are outside the Government that would like to jeopardise the whole process."
"It is a vicious circle and I agree that we have to try to break it up."
"An honourable Member mentioned that we have extended our mission monitoring the Rafah border crossing."
"We did that because we think that opening up freedom of movement of goods and people is so important."
"I myself have been working on that with Prime Minister Olmert."
"I remember my last visit there when I took it up in order really to go into the details."
"But there are security concerns."
"Unfortunately, there are suicide bombers coming over the borders, a lot of funds are being smuggled, so you always have the two sides of this conflict, but we think that it is important to have prolonged this mission at the Rafah crossing because only with the European Union is there a chance of there being an opening."
"We are engaging."
"We are also working with the Finance Minister, not only on the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM), but also on institution building and technical assistance, helping them particularly on the question of customs, revenue collection and on auditing."
"This has been asked for by Salam Fayad, so we are working with them."
"I said we will also look at what we can then perhaps fund through the TIM as regards their particular desires, so not only those things that we have been funding up till now in order to help the population to survive, but to go further."
"This is what I can offer you in this delicate and difficult situation."
"We have to go on pushing and bringing the different parties together."
"I hope that the time window is still open."
"Commission Question Time"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0018/2007)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Commission."
"Part One"
"Subject: The negative consequences of the EU biofuels targets"
"83% of the world's biofuels are produced in Indonesia and Malaysia."
"In part a response to the EU's growing demand for biofuels, both Indonesia and Malaysia are deforesting large areas of land often high conservation rainforest for oil palm plantations."
"Is the Commission aware that, according to a recent UN report, 98% of these forests could be gone by 2022?"
"Is the Commission aware of the effects that deforestation has on native wildlife, for example, that many orang-utans end up in rehabilitation centres with little hope of being released back into the wild?"
"According to a Dutch pressure group, as much as 50% of space for new plantations is cleared by draining and burning peat land, releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide."
"How can the Commission reconcile the EU's target to cut emissions by 20% by 2020 with the possible increase of Indonesia and Malaysia's carbon emissions (Indonesia has been ranked the world's third largest producer of CO2 by the same pressure group)?"
"What plans does the Commission have to introduce eco labelling of 'sustainable' palm oils?"
"Will the Commission consider a ban on the import of biofuels into the EU?"
"The Commission fully shares the Honourable Member's concern about deforestation and peat land draining in South-East Asia."
"It is aware of the link with the fast-growing demand for palm oil."
"Production of palm oil is growing at about 9 % per year; more than 80 % of the production comes from Malaysia and Indonesia."
"In deciding how to tackle this problem, it is essential to have a clear picture of the supply of and demand for palm oil."
"About 1% of the world's biofuels came from Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil in 2006."
"The main use of palm oil today is in food and other non-energy sectors."
"Only 1% of palm oil production from Indonesia and Malaysia was used for biofuel production in 2006."
"However, demand for bioenergy is likely to rise in the future, and not only in the European Union, and that leads to increased production of palm oil for biofuels."
"Having said that, the Commission is aware that, if nothing is done, the increasing demand for biofuel, linked to the proposed Community biofuel target for 2020, could create additional environmental pressures, which would be contrary to the sustainable approach supported by Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Today, no mandatory certification exists that will guarantee that tropical rainforests or peat lands in South East Asia are not suffering from the production of palm oil, regardless of its use."
"Within the framework of its legislative proposal, the Commission will therefore include a biofuel sustainability scheme designed to ensure that the biofuel sector plays its part in tackling this issue."
"The Commission is currently working on the design of this scheme."
"It aims to include measures to deter the conversion of both tropical forests and peat lands for biofuel production, as well as measures to deter the use of production methods that are inefficient in greenhouse gas terms."
"These measures will apply to domestically produced biofuels as well as imported biofuels."
"In view of the above, any attempt to deal comprehensively with the impact of oil palm cultivation on the environment would need to take into account oil palm production for all end users."
"The Commission, the Council and Parliament have all expressed support for a balanced approach to biofuels in which domestic production and imports will both contribute to meeting the huge requirement, but production will be carried out on a sustainable basis."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for that reply."
"Do you accept that the objective of the biofuels policy of the European Union is to reduce global emissions, not just European Union emissions?"
"My concern and the concern that lies behind this question is that if we only measure the emissions from biofuels in Europe and not the emissions involved in the production and shipping of those biofuels, we might not actually be contributing to the reduction in global emissions."
"I am pleased to hear what the Commissioner said about the sustainability scheme."
"Will the Commission look at how we can distinguish between good and bad biofuels from the point of view of emissions?"
"I definitely agree that our global scheme is to fight global emissions of CO2 and for this reason we are certainly looking at the carbon footprint of biofuels use."
"At the same time, if the biofuels produced in one region would have to be transported to another region, we cannot artificially forbid this."
"For this reason, our scheme should include that the best biofuels are the more rewarded with the support and in this way it is a part of the scheme that will not encourage transporting palm oil to supply our market."
"Additionally, I believe it is extremely important to understand that we need to work in parallel towards a way of protecting peat lands and rainforests."
"Because, whatever we do, we perhaps will be sustainable."
"There will be other regions that will just go for palm oil."
"So, in the negotiations which are to start in Bali, we need to work towards a scheme for protecting the rainforests, as well as looking at how to encourage the planting of more forests on the Earth, not for palm oil for our transport, but for less CO2 emissions from transport as a whole."
"(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to ask how an increase in the production of biofuel might affect the food market."
"The American maize used to produce biofuel is significantly more expensive than grain."
"In the long term, as we transit to such renewable energy sources, will we then have crises in the food production market?"
"It is a justified question."
"There is a lot of land in the European Union that is not being used."
"Therefore much of this land could be used for producing biomass, not only for biofuels but also for producing heat, for cooling or for producing electricity."
"A number of countries have a situation that is sustainable; they produce 12 % of their electricity from biomass."
"At the same time, they also produce biofuels."
"So there is potential for using that land."
"If I look at the second generation of biofuels, there is land that could be used for producing biofuels."
"The Commission has calculated that the European Union could cover 14% of its needs, even if we do not import biofuels from other parts of the world."
"Concerning the increase in the price of food products, this is influenced by many elements."
"You mentioned the example of maize."
"The price of corn is decided on the global market and it has been highly affected by the severe drought in Australia and the potential growth in the United States."
"There is some correlation if the farmer is given the choice of using his land for producing either biofuels or basic foodstuffs."
"But I believe the market will respond appropriately and, if our sustainability scheme that will encourage the production of biofuels with fewer CO2 emissions is put in place, there will be a balance in this market."
"I have never said that we will be able to replace all the oil we use with biofuels."
"There is potential both in the European Union and globally, but it will never replace all the oil we use."
"At this stage I would say that it is not a question of food prices or the use of biofuels, because globally biofuels are used on a very small scale and they definitely have not had any impact at this stage on the price of foodstuffs."
"(DE) Commissioner, you quite rightly said that it makes perfectly good sense to now use fallow land for the cultivation of plants from which fuel can be produced."
"This currently makes for a problem as regards the production of barley for brewing purposes, since the subsidies for the production of biofuels make the cultivation of other crops a more attractive proposition for farmers, so, back home, we have had problems that affect our own economy, in cultivating the crops necessary for the brewing of beer, which is not the least important of economic sectors."
"One might well ask which is the more important - food or energy?"
"In the days when we still had our own supplies of crude oil and natural gas, the situation was quite different; now we have to import everything."
"Even though we know that global demand for crude oil and natural gas is on the rise, we still aspire to maintain the same standard of comfort, and consequently, some of our efforts have to be devoted to the production of energy."
"As I have said, we currently have so much in the way of reserves and options, that we have to make the fullest possible use of the latter."
"We must, however, also be smart enough not to do something for which we will have to pay a high price later on."
"The schemes we are devising constitute a first step."
"We have every chance of organising them in such a way that no great problems ensue for the food industry."
"Subject: Energy agreement between EU Member States and Russia"
"The Commission's publication of the energy package in January 2007 brought fresh impetus to the efforts being made by some Member States regarding the supply of energy resources from Russia through the conclusion of bilateral or trilateral agreements with that country."
"Russia, Greece and Bulgaria have signed an agreement on an oil pipeline linking the Black Sea and the Aegean."
"Construction work is to start at the end of 2007, and the pipeline is to be completed in 2011."
"Hungary is to build the gas pipeline 'Blue Stream' in cooperation with the Russian Gazprom. The pipeline is to start in Turkey and pass through Bulgaria and Romania."
"This gas pipeline will follow the same course as the Nabucco pipeline planned by the EU."
"A new agreement with Russia is entitled 'Agreement on the diversification of gas supply'."
"What is the Commission's view of such a diversification of energy supply where the supplier is the same Gazprom?"
"What impact might such agreements have on the implementation of the EU's common energy policy?"
"These are issues that we have discussed previously: how to supply the European Union with sufficient energy resources."
"As you know today 50% of our energy supplies are covered by imports and we know that in the future the percentage will be even higher."
"It could be 65%, with more than 80% of gas being imported and even more oil, with over 90% being imported."
"For this reason we will continue to work with all traditional suppliers."
"For gas it is Russia which today provides 27.5% of our supplies."
"Oil is supplied by Norway at 14% and Algeria at 12.5%."
"For this reason, we are interested in strengthening ties with traditional suppliers and obtaining more supply routes."
"Supply routes that deliver gas and oil are exposed to danger."
"I would mention a recent explosion in the Ukrainian gas pipeline system."
"That certainly had an impact on transport but, because there were other ways of delivering gas, it did not affect the EU internal market."
"However, it is very clear that having more supply routes is more beneficial for consumers."
"EU dependency on Russia should not be over-emphasised because it is clear that, with Russia having the biggest gas resources as well as being one of the countries with the biggest oil resources, it is natural that supplies from Russia are topping our import list."
"The Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline is in my opinion a very important project because it bypasses the Turkish Straits."
"In this way, it reduces first of all the possibility of an environmental disaster and secondly it is an additional supply route to channel oil that is produced north of the Caspian to European markets."
"So, for this reason, this project also got support from the Commission because it is an additional supply route and it does not increase our dependence on Russia."
"At the same time it is very important to diversify; first because relying on one supplier gives the monopoly supplier a chance to dictate the price but also because it gives an opportunity to influence consumer choices."
"For this reason the European Union has actively diversified its supply."
"One of the areas where we have been getting supplies this year is the Caspian Sea and Shah-Deniz in Azerbaijan, where we have established very good cooperation from the countries surrounding Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey."
"Nabucco will be the next project that will be implemented."
"Nabucco is a more ambitious project."
"It will take a bit more time but we are well on track to obtaining supplies from this source through the fourth potential gas supply corridor."
"At the same time we are also diversifying oil supplies because a project has also been announced from Samsun to Ceyhan, an additional oil supply project that again will bring oil from the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea region towards the European Union."
"We are encouraging cooperation with these countries around the world because, even if there are three big suppliers to the gas market - Russia, Iran and Qatar - there are other suppliers who could increase supplies."
"Norway will increase supplies to the European Union in the next few years by close to 50%."
"The same is happening with Algeria, which will provide additional supplies and more and more LNG terminals are coming on-stream."
"For this reason, I believe that we should continue to work with Russia."
"We should continue to buy energy resources because, for Russia, the EU is the best possible market because it is the closest market and mutual ties have existed for some time, but for security of supply it is important to diversify."
"Additionally, I would like to stress two further elements because it is never the case that you can rely only on imports."
"It is important to develop energy sources inside the European Union, to be extremely energy-efficient and to build internal energy infrastructure whether it be pipelines or electricity transmission lines."
"The European Union is very active in all these areas, even if we always recognise that each country decides on its own energy mix."
"But, through the instruments of the internal market and through the instruments given us by European legislation, we are encouraging the use of local resources and being very energy-efficient."
"(LT) I thank our Commission colleague for the answer and the hopes expressed that we will nevertheless find other, alternative sources of energy."
"As I said in my question, and in regard to the current situation, it is evident that no matter what agreements are in place, at the other end of the pipeline, be it a petroleum pipeline or a gas pipeline, there is Russia."
"Russia has stopped delivering petroleum to Lithuania, and it is doing the same to Latvia."
"Therefore, we cannot put much trust in this source of supply."
"Nevertheless, I would ask that we all make a united effort in seeking to quickly implement projects for other, alternative sources of energy."
"Well, I always advise Member States to be active."
"I hope that they hear what you are saying and what I am saying because it is always important for Member States to cooperate among themselves and look for alternatives."
"Theoretically, if there is a need, the Baltic States could use one additional energy terminal."
"But it is the governments that should decide how to diversify and how to cooperate and how to get interconnection."
"I am very glad that we have managed to interconnect the Baltic countries' market with Finland."
"Now the big task is to achieve interconnection with Poland and in the future with the other Nordic countries."
"This would also eliminate the risk of a possible disruption of supply from one direction affecting the whole country."
"(DE) Commissioner, I would be interested to know how the financial support for the Trans-European Networks (TENs) is to be secured; is there a planned date for when money will actually be forthcoming for these TEN pipelines - Nabucco or Bluestream, for example - and could you envisage a timetable being prepared in time for the 2008 review?"
"The Commission can offer only partial support in this area, since there are fewer resources available to us for it in the Budget."
"We do, of course, support those companies and enterprises that are able to invest money in it, for investment in energy transport is economically of very considerable interest."
"What I can say right now is that the timetable for Nabucco has been decided on and that the date of 2012 has been set."
"The Commission has already given financial support to a limited extent, but political support is important too."
"Over the coming months, the coordinator of the project will be announced, and this will of course be done in collaboration with your House."
"It is my belief that the adoption of the energy package will enable us to get back to this issue when the Budget perspective is debated;"
"I also take the view that it is necessary to set aside more funds for the trans-European energy networks in views of the directions involved that may well be strategically important, but are not as profitable for the business sector."
"It is for that reason that we need more money, but we still have time to analyse all these things and prepare a proposal."
"Thank you for your answers, Commissioner, they are really impressive."
"I would like to ask you whether the Commission has noticed that Russia has never created difficulties as regards supplying 'old' EU Member States with oil and gas, whereas with Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary and other new EU Member States, there have been many difficulties."
"What do you think about these first- and second-class forms of treatment?"
"There are two explanations for this."
"First of all, sometimes new Member States' policies have not been very clear as regards diversification; at least some of the new Member States have not tried to encourage as much diversification as could be possible, thereby becoming more dependent on one supplier, Russia."
"Secondly, I do not think that Russia does this on purpose; it is just because those countries are the first in line whenever supplies are disrupted and, as they are more exposed than older Member States in terms of diversification of supply, they are affected more."
"Member States should do much more and invest more in the diversification of the energy mix, of supply routes and of suppliers."
"Furthermore, when the infrastructure is affected, those countries are the first to have a problem because the historical networks were constructed precisely to connect Russia, as a supplier, with those countries, as consumers."
"That is why this perception exists, but I would repeat that diversification is the key to avoiding this state of affairs, and every country should embark on diversification in order to minimise any problem that may arise in the transport of supplies."
"I believe also that the suppliers would then take more care to deliver in the best possible time and to repair the networks as soon as possible if any leaks occur."
"Part Two"
"Subject: Hate websites"
"What views does the Commission have on the proliferation of so called hate websites? Particularly those that promote and incite hatred, that is, racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Roma websites including websites which indicate names and contact details of activists that then may be targeted."
"Is the Commission aware of parliamentary activity in the UK and elsewhere to tackle such websites?"
"Does the Commission propose any similar action?"
"Racist and xenophobic violence and hate speech are a very sad reality all around Europe."
"According to the 2006 annual report of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the majority of Member States have recorded an increase in racist violence and other racist crimes over the past few years."
"The Commission has always rejected and condemned in the strongest possible terms all manifestations and expressions of racism, regardless of their source and form of manifestation."
"A measure to fight racist speech is perfectly compatible with freedom of expression if - and only if - it respects Article 10(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I would be the first to admit that defining the border between safeguarding freedom of expression and defining racist speech as a penal crime is not an easy task and that it requires careful consideration."
"However, I am convinced that there is no contradiction in simultaneously protecting people against racist speech and making sure that freedom of expression remains one of the key pillars upon which our societies are founded."
"This is the spirit in which the Council reached a political agreement on 20 April 2007 on a framework decision aimed at ensuring that racism and xenophobia are punishable in all Member States by effective, proportionate criminal penalties."
"This framework decision requires Member States to criminalise intentional conduct, such as public incitement to violence or hate towards a group of people or persons belonging to a group defined on the basis of race."
"Incitement to violence or hatred will also have to be made punishable throughout the EU if committed by public dissemination or distribution of pictures."
"Distribution in this context means disseminating action by any means of transmission, including through websites."
"I am not aware of any parliamentary action in the UK or in other Member States to tackle those websites."
"However, the framework decision is expected to lead to the adoption of new legislation, at least in certain Member States, to address racist crimes, including those committed via the internet."
"Commissioner, your answer clearly reflects the efforts that you put into the framework decision on racist crimes and you are clearly saying that that this kind of cybercrime has hit websites which, if they were in the printed word, would be deeply offensive to everyone in this House."
"Now that they are on the web they are equally as offensive."
"Do you feel the framework decision will do the job adequately or do you feel that the cybercrime communication, which again is current, may be a way forward or do you believe it is just a question of asking Member States to implement adequate laws which will cope with an accelerating rise in the most offensive sites which excite racial hatred and violence based on difference?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view this framework decision is adequate."
"We have adopted it after five years of political debate and in my view we now need to be vigilant with regard to the Member States to see that they transpose it fully and swiftly, and, above all, that these rules are successfully applied in practice."
"Today the Commission has adopted a general communication on cybercrime which stresses the need for a European network linking all the police authorities to ascertain whether the Internet, that extraordinary and positive revolution, is being used by criminals, as unfortunately does happen."
"We have, in fact, seen that racist crimes and incitement to violence are on the increase in Europe."
"(DE) Commissioner, another aspect of this issue - and one that I think must not be overlooked - is the plethora of websites run by fundamentalist Muslims for the purposes of anti-Western propaganda, which incite people to fight against the Western world and its ideals."
"Is the Commission aware of these activities, and are measures in place to counteract them?"
"This aspect will be at the heart of the discussion that will take place in two days' time, this very week, within the G8, where the European Union and the other partners will precisely deal with this issue of incitement to violence and terrorism on the Internet."
"The approach that I am proposing to explore is to criminalise the behaviour of people who are guilty specifically of incitement to carry out criminal terrorist activities and who exploit the Internet for that purpose."
"My proposal will be presented to the Council of Ministers in a few months' time."
"(DE) Mr Vice-President of the Commission, my question has to do with the Internet and, indirectly, with terrorism, against which the directive on data retention was intended to be a measure."
"Is it the case that it cannot apply to pay-as-you-go mobile phones, to webmail operators such as Hotmail, or to private servers?"
"That amounts to quite a lot of cover of which terrorist networks, among others, can avail themselves in order to avoid detection."
"What, then, does the directive on the retention of data actually provide by way of added value?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the added value of this directive is that it permits the recording of a telephone call: not its content, but just the fact that a telephone call was made from a certain place, at a certain time, from a certain telephone."
"This, as we all know, has been useful in detecting the specific movements of certain criminals and certain terrorism suspects."
"Obviously, with the use of technology we ought to succeed in detecting even those using more advanced technologies, such as private providers or SIM cards that have not been officially registered."
"This, however, is a technological issue."
"In today's communication on cybercrime I am proposing a European conference with the private sector and with industry to be held in November in Brussels, at which we will see how things stand on this very point of security technology to protect the proper use of the Internet."
"Subject: EU-wide hotline for victims of forced prostitution"
"Following pressure from the European Parliament back in June 2006, the EU Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security spoke of plans to establish an EU-wide (multilingual) hotline for victims of forced prostitution."
"The aim of the hotline would be to provide first assistance for the victims of trafficking, enabling victims to talk to an impartial listener, an important channel for encouraging victims to seek advice and support."
"The difficulty in getting all telephone companies in the then 25-Member bloc to agree was cited as an obstacle in the setting-up of such a hotline."
"What measures is the Commission currently taking to turn this hotline into reality and what progress, if any, has been made in bringing the telephone companies on board this plan?"
"As you know the Commission and I personally are committed to fully implementing the European action plan against trafficking in human beings which I proposed here at the beginning of 2006 and which this Parliament endorsed."
"This action covers the protection of victims of trafficking."
"Its implementation requires close cooperation between Member States, institutions and civil society organisations."
"The action plan should be regarded as a long-term programme which will guide continuous EU action in the near future and in any case far beyond summer 2007."
"I consider free telephone helplines as a valuable mechanism, offering advice to victims in need."
"They are particularly useful to spread confidence."
"I am committed to setting up without any delay a hotline for victims and those vulnerable to trafficking, covering all Member States in the European Union."
"You may know perhaps that on 15 February 2007 we adopted, as a Commission, a decision which requires Member States to reserve a range of six-digit national telephone numbers for single freephone numbers all beginning with 116 for services with social values."
"One of the many subjects to be covered could be telephone hotlines for victims of trafficking in human beings."
"The above decision has already reserved the number 116000 for hotlines to report missing children."
"I will discuss the latter project in more detail at a Conference on an International Day for Missing Children which will be held in Brussels on 25 May, and at the Conference on the Rights of the Child, to be held in Berlin on 4 June 2007."
"'116' numbers can be compared with the emergency number 112 in that they will give access to national or local organisations providing the service in question in the Member State in which the call was placed."
"We have launched a public consultation for identifying other services which would benefit from single European freephone numbers."
"This consultation was open for proposals until 20 May."
"This is expected to lead to other numbers being reserved for other services later in the year."
"Making them operational, allowing for citizens to be able to call these numbers, will then be the task of Member States, their telecom regulatory authorities and telephone operators."
"The reservation of a common number and the creation of a network of hotlines is the first practical step to support victims."
"In addition to setting up a network of hotlines we seek to improve the assistance to victims of trafficking by other means too."
"My firm commitment to the issue is confirmed by the fact that the 2007 budget establishing a specific programme to fight against crime foresees four projects in the field of prevention and fight against crime in specific areas, including trafficking."
"We are also supporting the creation of a European anti-trafficking day, which aims to increase the visibility of the problem connected with trafficking."
"The initiative will take place on 18 October this year."
"We are highly committed to raising awareness and reinforcing policy means in order to provide quality services for those in need of assistance."
"Thank you for that very comprehensive answer, Commissioner, but you give your opinion on whether you feel that the EU's efforts to tackle forced prostitution during the World Cup in Germany were successful, and what lessons can be learnt from this experience for future international sporting events held in Europe, such as the 2012 Olympic Games which are to be held in London?"
"I can tell you that we have carried out an assessment of the results of police cooperation during the football world cup in Germany, the conclusions of which we will publish, and there will then be a debate in which, in my view, the European Parliament should be fully involved."
"We believe the experience of the world cup in Germany was a case of positive education."
"We probably succeeded in preventing the transportation to European territory of thousands of young girls destined for prostitution."
"There was cooperation between 12 European Union Member States."
"Germany and the German police did an excellent job."
"We have offered the conclusions which we are going to make public as a contribution to other future sporting events in Europe."
"I can tell you that there is an interesting amount of attention from the Chinese People's Republic in relation to the conduct of the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008."
"In other words, it is an experiment that has been judged useful as a model."
"(DE) Commissioner, I think that is an excellent initiative to take, but how are the victims to be made aware that they can use this number?"
"Has the Commission made provision for the funds needed to disseminate this information?"
"How do you propose to ensure that it actually works in practice?"
"The victims, who may, for example, be young women from Russia, are, in the main, young women from Russia who do not speak any of the EU's languages."
"How will you ensure in practice that these hotlines actually work, for there are generally very considerable timelags, and that people do not get put into a queue and perhaps have to wait all of half an hour before their call is answered?"
"We have certainly tackled and examined this operational problem: the first number, which is 116000, will be for children."
"We will advertise it everywhere: in schools, airports, stations, and through publications that will explain in very simple terms that there is a number and that the person answering the number will not speak just the language of the country where the telephone call is made."
"We are gradually extending the possibility, laid down in the contract with the contractors that will provide the service, that as a minimum all the official languages of the European Union will be spoken."
"Obviously we must also think about languages such as Russian."
"For now, as a first stage, the contract will be awarded before the summer holidays, so that this telephone number can actually be used, and we will launch a massive publicity campaign."
"We will do the same thing when the other numbers, apart from 116000, are allocated with specified priorities, which will certainly include victims of forced prostitution."
"(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, you have truly presented a thorough crime-fighting programme, and you mentioned some special telephone hotlines."
"I would like to ask whether the abundance of those lines might cause some confusion."
"For example, will the victims of illegal trafficking in humans be able to dial 112 and ask for help?"
"This special number, 116000 for example, will replace all the national hotlines, so there will be only one number."
"In my country there is now one number and in France there is another one."
"In the near future there will be only the number 116000 for missing children, and so on."
"All these special European numbers will replace national numbers, of course."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I have to object to the way the questions are being handled."
"Members take the time to draft questions, submit them six to eight weeks in advance, and then you do not take those questions because you give the floor to other Members who wander in, look at the list and may have a fleeting interest in the question."
"You have taken up time with two questioners or people who have not taken the time to question the Commissioner properly."
"I object to that on the basis that I have taken the time to draft proper questions and I would like an answer from the Commissioner so that I can also follow up with the press on those issues."
"In future Members will not want to table questions if this is the way you intend to conduct Question Time."
"Mrs McCarthy, your question is relevant, but I am merely complying with the Rules of Procedure."
"As Mr Tarabella is not present, Question No 38 lapses."
"Subject: Access to communication for people with disabilities"
"What is the Commission now doing, and what steps will it take, to enable people with disabilities to gain access more easily to communication tools, in particular broadband Internet, cost-price text messages and video calls for the deaf, subtitling of television programmes, starting with public information and party-political/election broadcasts, and free digital signatures?"
"In answer to the Honourable Member's question, I should like to say that the European Union's strategy in terms of people with disabilities has been laid down in the Disability Action Plan of 2003-2010, where access to ICT is a priority."
"You might also know that one of the pillars of the i2010 Action Plan is inclusion."
"On that basis, the Commission adopted a communication on e-accessibility in 2005 and a communication on e-inclusion is in preparation for the end of 2007 and in this text there will be a proposal for new actions when appropriate."
"We are not only working on concrete actions in that way, we are also encouraging our research efforts in the direction of developing new methodologies and new services for the disabled."
"We also have the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme - the CIP - which supports our ICT policy with pilot projects and so on and so forth."
"Several actions are proposed on e-accessibility and on something that will become very important in the future - ICT for the elderly."
"Very often they are the people, because there are people with disabilities and very often the elderly have those disabilities too and they represent a very high future percentage of our population."
"That is why ICT for the elderly for ambient living will become one of the strong elements of our future policies, not only in theory but also in research and in practical implementation."
"We are also supporting standardisation on e-accessibility."
"For instance, we have taken an initiative to harmonise at EU level the accessibility requirements for public procurement in the ICT domain through an EU standard, because we believe that common standards can facilitate the development of accessible ICT products by the industry, leading to more uptake which also means to lower prices."
"Therefore the one is linked to the other."
"There are also some vertical issues."
"In June 2006 we will propose strengthening the right of disabled users to access emergency services and introducing a Community mechanism to address e-accessibility issues."
"We will have an opportunity to discuss those problems with Parliament when together we will try to find a solution for the universal service."
"There will be a public consultation on the scope by the end of 2007 or the beginning of 2008 - I do not know yet exactly when - but that will be the time for Parliament and our main stakeholders to come forward with proposals to see what we are going to do with the universal service."
"A very concrete problem should be solved the day after tomorrow, because then the Council is going to accept the European Parliament's amendment at its meeting concerning the Audiovisual Media Services Directive."
"Parliament introduced an amendment on subtitling, improving accessibility for people with disabilities to audiovisual media services."
"I hope the Council will accept this and then the new policy will go also in this direction."
"The question of digital signatures will gain in importance as secure electronic communications are developing between commercial and public service providers and users."
"The Commission will look at this issue in the follow-up to the European Electronic Signatures Directive and the e-government Action Plan, also bearing in mind people with disabilities."
"I can just tell you in a very personal way that the various presidencies of the European Union have all held a congress or an exhibition - something official and public - to show how the results of the research have been put into practice."
"I have always thought that this was a very good example to be taken up in our e-government activities, which are there to be proposed by the Commission and the European Union, but they have to be implemented by local governments most of all and by regional and national governments."
"I have seen the enthusiasm with which regional and local governments in particular have taken up the results of our work to provide practical help for the disabled people living in their region."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Reding for her very detailed and systematic reply regarding the policies in force."
"I would particularly like to thank her for the connection she made, in the terms that I myself intended to use, regarding the close link between technologies to help disabled persons and those that can help the elderly."
"In view of the European demographic trend, with a population that is, on average, growing increasingly older, the technological revolution can provide answers of huge social significance."
"The last point that I wanted to make to you is that, for persons who are completely immobile and only able to speak perhaps by moving their eyes, technologies such as these are not merely a concern or an aid, but are a means of achieving a fundamental civil right, that of freedom of expression."
"There are many technologies and many techniques that can be utilised in order to help in this respect."
"I really believe that the ageing of the population will first need a response from us on the societal level, but this response on the societal level is also an opportunity for the European industry, because if our industry gets the societal response from the policymakers, from those who are responsible in areas, in regions, in countries and at European level, then they can start to market systems, services and items for the elderly."
"I believe that this will not only help our society but also our economy."
"So this is a turning point."
"It is also a question of growth and jobs, because, if we get it right, we can export systems on the societal level, as well as commercial items and services, outside of Europe."
"So I really believe that all those elements are working closely together for the betterment of our society and of our economy."
"Subject: Separation on electronic communications markets"
"Speaking in Brussels, Commissioner Reding recently stressed the need for a 'European way of separation' of infrastructures and services in the EU telecommunications sector so as to ensure genuine competition with regard to fixed infrastructures."
"She recommends 'the legal separation of the network infrastructures from the service layers' as a basic tool for use by national legislators while not excluding full functional separation regarding the electronic communications markets."
"Can the Commission further specify what is meant by 'the European way'."
"Does it consider that the Greek telecommunications body fits into the category in which full separation would be possible in practice?"
"The honourable Member asked me what I mean by the expression 'our European way of separation'."
"We currently have a framework for telecoms that provide regulatory tools or remedies to the NRAs in cases where markets are not competitive, and in its review of the framework the Commission will be looking at ways of strengthening the single market for telecom services."
"One possible innovation is to work more closely on remedies, because remedies are sometimes either not applied or not applied swiftly, which is the same problem."
"We have also analysed that one possible tool as a remedy could be functional separation, which means separating the network business of a dominant market player from the part of the business that provides a service to the end customers."
"This functional separation can provide the right incentive to providers of network services not to discriminate between customers for wholesale services."
"This can in turn mean that the conditions for real competition in the telecom markets are improved."
"So we are not speaking here about forcing dominant players to sell off part of their businesses, as has happened in other parts of the world - for example in the United States with AT[amp]T. We would not like to go in that direction, and that is why I am talking about 'the European way'."
"It would then be for each national regulator to assess the condition in its own Member State before considering such a remedy."
"This has already been done in Britain with Openreach, so that is one example which we have in that case."
"The honourable Member also asked about Greece."
"In the case of Greece it would then be the Greek regulator, on the basis of national law in line with the updated EU framework, to take account of competitive conditions and all other relevant factors in the Greek market, and then to propose - or not - such a remedy if he thought it to be necessary and in the interests of the Greek market."
"(EL) I thank the Commissioner for her reply."
"However, I have a feeling that in practice, we have 27 different regulatory systems in the European Union."
"As far as electronic communications are concerned, we are a long way from talking about a real internal market."
"You are certainly making a huge effort in this sector."
"This regulatory uncertainty or, to put it another way, the high level of fragmentation is causing uncertainty for investment, it is causing uncertainty in competition, uncertainty in innovation and, of course, it is creating few jobs."
"My question is: can we talk about a European telecommunications industry without pan-European regulatory cohesion?"
"The honourable Member is absolutely right."
"For the time being we do not have a European market for telecoms."
"I think that has to be changed, because the only way for Europe to stay strong in matters of telecommunications - and Europe is strong, we are really one of the leading forces on the world market in this - is to get rid of 27 sometimes conflicting regulatory systems and come to one system which makes sense and which will also permit cross-border services and investments to take place, and enable us to have big European players which will work across several countries."
"So we are now working towards opening the market for international roaming."
"Parliament is going to decide on that tomorrow, and that is always a sign to show where we want to go in the future."
"I will certainly come forward with a proposal for the reform of the e-communications package in order to get this European market to function, not to get rid of the national regulators - I think that we still need them because they know their market best - but in order to get not harmonisation, but logic in the remedies which they propose and which have to be applied swiftly so that there is a level playing field between the different markets and so that the cross-border activities of the industries can take place without being blocked by a lack of market opening in other markets."
"Subject: European framework for the safer use of mobile telephones by adolescents and children"
"The entry into force of the European Framework for the safer use of mobile telephones by adolescents and children, adopted on 6 February by leading EU undertakings in this sector, is welcomed as a first major step towards the protection of juveniles from certain dangers arising from the use of mobile telephones."
"It has been suggested that this approach should be included in the Commission communication Towards an EU Strategy on Rights of the Child final)."
"What are considered to be suitable measures to ensure that the European Framework is effectively implemented at national level and can be monitored by parents, teachers and those responsible for the supervision of juveniles?"
"Given that the European Framework is based on a code of self-regulation by European companies, how will the Commission help to ensure its proper implementation in the Member States and assist in the evaluation of its effectiveness?"
"What will be the responsibilities of the national regulatory authorities in drafting codes of self-regulation by February 2008 at the latest and monitoring their implementation?"
"Does the Commission consider the future adoption of a Community legislative measure binding on the Member States and on companies to be advisable, given that self-regulation alone cannot be sufficient?"
"I think that, if I have heard correctly, this question has already been partially answered by my colleague Mr Frattini who also spoke on this subject."
"The fact that he partially answered this question clearly shows that it is the Commission as a whole that is worried about the development of our society and the Commission as a whole that takes measures to move ahead in this area."
"On 6 February this year, 15 leading European mobile operators and content providers united to sign a European framework for safer mobile use by younger teenagers."
"That is a voluntary agreement; it is a memorandum of understanding whereby the mobile industry, together with the GSM Association of Europe, agrees to monitor, publish and translate codes on their website, both those which already exist and those which will be adopted."
"These self-regulatory codes will then, for instance, help parents or grandparents or educators to understand what the problems for children using third-generation mobile phones might be."
"This agreement came out of the discussion in a high-level group that I convened, which included children's organisations, consumer organisations and bodies for content classification, as well as regulatory bodies."
"The memorandum of understanding sets out a number of principles and requires signatories to work towards implementation through self-regulation at national level."
"When we signed this together and we held a press conference, I said that I had confidence in the signatories."
"I will give them one year, until February or March next year, in order to implement that."
"Then we will come back to the subject and we will see if they have implemented it."
"If they implement it - fine - then maybe we will have discussions about possible corrections or future projects."
"If our expectations are not met, the Commission will then consider the introduction of specific measures."
"(EL) I thank the Commissioner for her reply."
"No one here doubts the Commission's role on this important issue."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner two questions, rather to facilitate the debate."
"I think that this is a voluntary memorandum, as she herself said, and that the sector is expected to self-regulate."
"I would therefore say that the Commission should in essence know what it will be evaluating after February 2008."
"In other words, will it urge the Member States to proceed with certain common codes so that they can monitor this issue?"
"Will the best practices of each Member State be codified and analysed?"
"Finally, what is the communications policy vis-à-vis parents who have no knowledge of this sector and what Community programmes can be used to inform them?"
"Thanks to the preparatory work it has done, the Commission has brought the mobile operators to take this initiative because the mobile operators understood very well that the Commission would not stand still and not do anything."
"We had seen in our recent surveys that there are many children who use mobile phones - in fact the majority of children over 12 years old."
"Most of all, camera phones and the location services can be a problem; for instance in the UK 10% of respondents say they had an unpleasant image taken of them, 17% of the kids feared that the image was posted online and forwarded to others, and 14% had experienced cyber-bulling."
"In Save the Children Finland's survey, 30% of 7 to 15 year olds had experienced bullying through their mobile phones."
"So we know that there is a problem, but this does not mean that we have to push the parents now into saying 'no more mobile phones for our kids'."
"That would be the wrong reaction."
"That is why it is so important that for instance the access for control for adult content should be available and that there be awareness-raising campaigns for parents and grandparents - who often buy mobile phones for their grandchildren - and for the children themselves."
"It is important that the classification of commercial content according to national standards of decency and appropriateness is taking place, and that, as Commissioner Frattini has explained, the fight against illegal content on mobiles is really carried out."
"We decided no later than today in the Commission to establish this fight against illegal content."
"What we are speaking about here is not the illegal content as such, it is the dangers which can occur for children, and here the awareness-raising campaigns are the most important."
"We will monitor what is happening in that field, and we will monitor what the signatories of this memorandum of understanding have agreed upon."
"I have the European framework for safer mobile use by younger teenagers and children with me;"
"I can hand it over to the Member and then she can see if this is taking place in her country, for instance, and I would be very grateful if she would inform me about that."
"Subject: Situation in Vojvodina"
"In the past few years there have repeatedly been brutal attacks on members of minorities in Vojvodina; Serbian refugees have systematically been settled in villages inhabited by minorities in order to outnumber them; and EU funds, such as for training teachers in the minority languages, have not reached those for whom they were intended."
"Have these irregularities been ended, and how does the Commission assess developments in Vojvodina in general?"
"The Commission has been monitoring the situation in Vojvodina very closely."
"We have urged the authorities to tackle inter-ethnic incidents promptly."
"We have encouraged the authorities to promote good inter-ethnic relations and to preserve Vojvodina's multi-ethnic and multicultural model."
"As noted in the November 2006 progress report on Serbia, the inter-ethnic situation in Vojvodina has improved."
"There has been a decrease in the number of incidents."
"No significant incident has been reported in the first few months of 2007."
"The authorities have taken a number of measures concerning the official use of minority languages and scripts as well as the representation of minorities in the judiciary and police."
"Improvements have also been recorded concerning education."
"The importation of Albanian- and Hungarian-language text books for use in Vojvodina has been approved."
"A Hungarian-language teacher-training faculty has been set up in Subotica, which has been operational since October last year."
"These measures obviously need to be further developed and complemented."
"We have noted, however, that there has been no progress in the adoption of new legislation on the national councils for the minority groups, and problems persist in the area of information in minority languages."
"Therefore, we have requested that the Serbian authorities take further effective action on these matters."
"(DE) There are two questions I should like to put to you, Commissioner."
"The first is to ascertain how things stand as regards the systematic resettlements of Serbian refugees from Bosnia and Kosovo, which, regrettably, are altering the ethnic composition of areas such as the Hungarian community of Temerin in the vicinity of Novi Sad."
"Secondly, I should like to know what is happening as regards the teacher training establishments that are supposed to be being set up, with EU funds, for the Romanians, Slovaks and Ruthenes, but which process seems to have come to a standstill."
"Have they now been set up?"
"As regards Mr Posselt's supplementary question concerning EU assistance to Vojvodina and its relation to minority rights, while it is not possible to extrapolate exactly the total amount of aid given to the autonomous province of Vojvodina, the territory has received significant EU assistance, which has been directed to those needs to which Mr Posselt referred."
"We have based our economic assistance on the following considerations: history, i.e. post-war reconstruction, notably as regards the Sloboda Bridge; geography, through integrated border management; and the economy."
"Vojvodina is a relatively wealthy area compared with other areas of Serbia."
"Therefore, even though it occupies 25 % of the area of the republic and has 20 % of the population, Vojvodina has absorbed 36 % of the credit line that the EU has earmarked for SMEs."
"All in all, it is clear that we are using this economic assistance for the purposes to which Mr Posselt referred, and I can assure him that this money is well used for the protection of minorities and their rights."
"(DE) You rightly pointed out, Commissioner, that a great deal of EU grant money is spent on protecting minorities and on matters of special concern to the EU."
"Might it not also be possible - or is it perhaps not necessary - to ensure that political pressure is also brought to bear on Serbia to get it to prevent certain abuses from being committed in accordance with its policies or to change those policies in such a way that we do not need to spend EU money on repairing the damage later on?"
"I agree with the Honourable Member that we have to use political methods in parallel with economic assistance."
"That is what we have been doing as regards Vojvodina."
"We have raised these issues with the Serbian Government."
"Now, as the country has a new democratic government which is reform- and Europe-oriented, I expect that we have an even better chance of making our voice heard and ensuring that our concerns are taken into account in Serbia as regards Vojvodina's position."
"The new Constitution of Serbia contains detailed provisions concerning human rights and the protection of minorities."
"However, it contains some ambiguities in relation to the scope of territorial decentralisation."
"The new Serbian Parliament will have a key role in implementing the Constitution soundly, especially in enhancing the protection of minorities, as well as establishing forms of local self-government that are in line with European standards."
"In this respect it is certainly positive that, thanks to the revision of the electoral law, ethnic minority parties now have several seats in the new Serbian Parliament."
"(HU) Since I was born right next to Vojvodina, I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner to certain aspects of the real situation."
"One of these is the question whether or not it is a problem that the indigenous Hungarian minority in Vojvodina are in practice still considered war criminals."
"The law of Antigone is not honoured there, that is, they are not allowed to bury their dead or even to remember them."
"Or is it not a problem that there is no equity anywhere in the areas of employment, in privatisation, in state institutions, or education?"
"And it would be good if he would once again respond to Mr Bernd Posselt's question about where things stand with regard to forced settlements."
"In fact, I would be pleased to offer Mr Olli Rehn a complete list of all the latest incidents which occurred only recently."
"Concerning the position of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, we have, as I said in our progress reports, analysed its situation very carefully."
"We have also discussed the issue with the Serbian authorities, who have underlined that they are committed to increasing the participation of people from national minorities in the police and judiciary, but they claim that there is often a lack of interest from qualified candidates."
"In my view, it is important that we continue this political pressure or political encouragement."
"At the same time, once we solve the problems that have caused internally displaced persons to migrate, then we have better chances of avoiding the kinds of problems to which you referred."
"I am of course referring in particular to the issue of the Kosovo status talks."
"There must be a well-managed status settlement, and I am confident that, once we have that, there will be no destabilising effects on ethnically mixed areas such as Vojvodina."
"That is why we urge all those concerned to show a sense of responsibility."
"The Commission's firm view is that no parallel can be drawn between Kosovo and Vojvodina."
"Subject: Implementation by Turkey of the Convention on the Law of the Sea"
"In its answer to Question, the Commission states that 'the Convention on the Law of the Sea is indeed part of the Community acquis, which Turkey is expected to take over and enforce at the moment of its accession to the European Union'."
"In a previous answer to a related question the Commission stated that 'the Commission expects Turkey to adopt and fully implement the acquis by the time of its accession to the European Union'."
"Why did the Commission change its position within the space of six months?"
"Is Turkey required to adopt and implement the above Convention 'at the moment of its accession to the European Union' or 'to adopt and fully implement the acquis by the time of its accession to the Europe Union'?"
"Can the Commission explain the legal basis of its position?"
"The Commission has not changed its position at all as regards Turkey's acquis communautaire obligations."
"There is no contradiction between the two answers the honourable Member refers to, which, on the contrary, reflect the very same approach."
"Like all other candidate countries, Turkey is expected to implement and enforce the acquis communautaire by the time of accession, that is, at the latest at the time it joins the European Union."
"(EL) Commissioner, there have been numerous unfortunate occurrences with Turkey recently."
"The Turkish army openly interferes in political developments."
"The Republic of Cyprus receives threats because, in application of the Convention on the Law of the Sea, it and neighbouring countries are promoting the exploitation of its exclusive economic zone. 160 Kurdish candidates, including Leila Zana, have been excluded from the forthcoming elections."
"Do these actions respect the acquis communautaire?"
"Perhaps the time has come for the Commission to speak a clearer and stricter language to the Turkish leadership?"
"The questions raised by the Honourable Member are extremely important, but they are somewhat beyond the scope of this particular question."
"Unfortunately, time will not allow me to respond in detail."
"However, I would like to underline that it is important that we are both fair and firm with Turkey in order to break the negative spiral in relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"By 'fair and firm' I mean that we have to be fair by keeping our word, sticking to the commitment that, if Turkey meets all the conditions of EU accession, it can join the Union."
"At the same time as being fair and credible we can be firm and rigorous, and we can expect Turkey to carry out reforms and respect citizens' rights so that, for instance, the Kurdish question can be addressed or women's rights, trade union rights and freedom of expression can be enhanced in Turkey thanks to the credible prospect of EU accession."
"So we have to be fair and firm at the same time with Turkey."
"Subject: Political crisis in Turkey and prospects of accession"
"In the last few days, in connection with the appointment of the President of the Republic, Turkey has fallen into a deep political crisis which gives rise to serious doubts about the functioning of its democratic institutions."
"The country's Constitutional Court has annulled the first round of the elections, a decision vigorously contested by the government."
"The Prime Minister has stated that the parliamentary system has been brought to a halt and he is calling for early elections, while the General Army Staff has issued a warning that it will intervene to prevent the election of the Islamist, Abdullah Gül, to the office of President."
"What are the Commission's views on this situation in a candidate country for accession to the EU?"
"The Commissioner responsible for enlargement, Mr Olli Rehn, has stated that the armed forces should respect the independent role of the democratic process, that the EU is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and the sovereignty of political forces vis-à-vis the military, stressing that any country seeking accession to the EU must respect those principles, which are the key elements of the Copenhagen criteria."
"Does the Commission believe that such interventions by the military are consistent with the requirements of the Community acquis and what impact could they have on the country's accession procedure?"
"Can any further response from the Commission be expected if developments are not compatible with the democratic principles of the EU?"
"The Turkish Government respected the ruling of the Constitutional Court and took the measures to implement it."
"This was important for the political stability of the country, regardless of the events that led to the ruling."
"To this end of political stability, the majority party submitted to the Grand National Assembly a proposal to hold early general elections."
"Subsequently, the Grand National Assembly agreed by a broad majority that the early parliamentary elections would be held on 22 July 2007."
"The Commission expects that the parliamentary, and subsequent presidential, elections will be carried out democratically in an atmosphere of responsible debate and political stability."
"As regards the role of the military, I have often said that I have a high regard for the Turkish armed forces in the fulfilment of their duties of defending their country and contributing to international peace, but, as I stated after the statement by the Chief of Staff at the end of April, the military must leave the remit of democratic decision-making to the democratically-elected bodies of Turkey."
"It should be self-evident that if any country wants to join the European Union it should respect all democratic principles, including ensuring democratic leadership of civil military relations, and, in my view, this is fully compatible with secular democracy, or democratic secularism, which is anchored in the Turkish Constitution."
"Once the new Parliament is elected and a new government takes office, it will be crucial for Turkey to revitalise and relaunch fully the legislative work and implementation of the reforms that enhance the rule of law and fundamental freedoms in the country."
"(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"You have indeed been forced yet again to repeat what you have said to Turkey on numerous occasions, as you yourself remarked, about the stand it must maintain as a candidate member of the European Union."
"I wanted to ask if this crisis has not revealed something more, if it has not revealed a weakness."
"Did you not use other means to approach the political and military players?"
"Because I assume that your admonitions have been directed repeatedly and publicly during your contacts."
"I wanted in my question to clarify if you have intervened to a greater degree given the seriousness of the crisis and of the information that it has brought to light."
"Thank you for this very important question, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou."
"In fact, I talk a lot with the Turkish Government - some people in Europe think that it is too much!"
"But in times of the political or constitutional crises which Turkey has undergone and, to my mind, is going through during this crisis phase, it is particularly important that we maintain a channel of communication and discuss intensively with the Turkish Government and with all the relevant players in Turkish society in order to make clear what the expectations of the European Union are, if and when Turkey wants to become a member of the European Union."
"Of course, democratic leadership of civil and military relations is one of these cornerstones."
"As the Commission stated very clearly in early May - after my statement concerning the political intervention of the Turkish military in the tense situation - that the European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the supremacy of democratic, civilian power over the military."
"If a country wants to become a member of the Union, it needs to respect these principles."
"This is the core of the Copenhagen criteria for EU accession."
"This has been made very clear to the Turkish Government and those involved in politics in Turkey, as well as through the Turkish media to the Turkish citizens."
"I do not think that a higher volume helps."
"Instead we need clarity and precision and, concerning our statement, it cannot get any clearer than our statement of 2 May."
"(EL) Commissioner, I am not one of those who want Turkey to be an uncontrolled force in the area."
"On the other hand, I wonder what constitutional court in a democratic country, not just in Europe but anywhere in the world, would have ruled that a quorum of two-thirds is needed in order to elect the president of the republic."
"This would allow the opposition in any country to control the election of the president of the republic."
"The Commission said in its statement that it respects the rule of law and its rules and does not wish to intervene in Turkey."
"But is there rule of law?"
"I do not think that the Commission's statement was balanced."
"Thank you for this follow-up question, Mr Hatzidakis, and for your own question, in which you called the Commission statement 'excessively indulgent'."
"You also called for a more explicit message."
"I must say that, as a Commissioner, as I said before, I do not believe in high-volume or megaphone diplomacy."
"I believe in clarity, precision and consistency."
"In this regard I think we do not disagree with the honourable Member, because, as I said before, we have repeatedly underlined the importance of the supremacy of democratic civilian power over the military."
"At the same time it is also important that we keep the accession negotiations alive and we make practical progress with them, because what the nationalists really want in Turkey is to cut the accession negotiations."
"I do not want to give this present to the nationalists of Turkey."
"It is much better to strive towards the EU accession of Turkey, keep the accession process alive and move towards the shared objective, because that is the way for Turkey to become a more European, more democratic country, where the rule of law and fundamental freedoms are respected."
"As regards your reference to the Constitutional Court, I understand the reasoning of your question and we have also taken note of the ruling which was issued by the Constitutional Court."
"I would like to quote what was said on 2 May by the College of Commissioners when we discussed this matter and we made our position clear to the Turkish Government and Turkish public."
"We said, 'regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling, this legal decision by the Constitutional Court should now be respected by all parties, because the respect of state institutions is essential to ensure political stability'."
"That is rather clear language."
"We also stated that, 'under these circumstances, the European Commission welcomes the announcement of holding new parliamentary elections soon in order to ensure political stability and democratic development in Turkey'."
"Again, it cannot get any clearer than that."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Composition of the delegation to EUROLAT: see Minutes"
"Action taken on Parliament's positions and resolutions: see Minutes"
"Estonia (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statement on Estonia."
"Mr President, I welcome this discussion on the recent dispute between Russia and Estonia."
"Let me state right away that this is not a human rights issue."
"The moving of the bronze soldier statue in Tallinn and the exhumation of the soldiers' graves were carried out with full respect for Estonia's international obligations, notably under the Geneva Convention with regard to war graves."
"However, I am aware of the sensitivity of this matter, which touches on the interpretation of history."
"While there have been concerns in Russia about this, we made it clear to Russia at the last summit that these concerns should be addressed through dialogue rather than through 'megaphone diplomacy'."
"We regret that the demonstrations that took place in Estonia turned into looting and riots."
"There is the right to demonstrate, which emanates clearly from freedom of expression."
"However, the fact that it led to a siege in front of the Estonian Embassy in Moscow was unacceptable."
"We have made clear our views about this and a demarche was conducted in Moscow immediately to remind Russia of its obligations under the Vienna Conventions."
"We are concerned about cyber-attacks against official Estonian internet sites."
"These need to be properly investigated and the perpetrators must be brought to justice."
"We remind Russia of our joint commitment to cooperate in fighting cybercrime both in the context of the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice and by acceding to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime."
"Today the Commission adopted a communication on cybercrimes and we will certainly work on its implementation."
"We are also following closely the situation regarding trade between Russia and Estonia."
"There have been calls in Russia for trade boycotts of Estonian goods and services and restrictions on transport operations."
"At one point restrictions were imposed on trucks crossing the bridge over the Narva River and oil shipments through Estonia were reduced."
"Our latest information is that expert talks took place today concerning the bridge and that oil shipments through Estonia have resumed."
"We shall continue to monitor the situation."
"I hope that this issue has now passed its climax and that emotions will subside."
"We discussed it at the EU-Russia summit in Samara and it was also raised at the press conference."
"President Putin even acknowledged that there might have been some overreaction on the Russian side and he regretted that the Estonian Ambassador had to leave Moscow."
"I fully support the Presidency in calling for a 'dispassionate dialogue on the matter', addressing the problems 'in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect'."
"The Samara summit took place at a critical time in EU-Russia relations."
"The discussions were open and frank and the media reports have, of course, highlighted the areas of disagreement between us."
"I think it was highly important that we had this frank discussion: we have to talk to each other because Russia is and remains a strategic partner and an important neighbour."
"At the same time, we also have to talk frankly to them."
"The EU side placed considerable emphasis, as Mr Barroso in particular knows, on the importance of the respect for democracy and human rights, notably in the run-up to elections."
"The detention of Garry Kasparov at Moscow airport, preventing him from attending a demonstration in Samara to coincide with the summit, was particularly regrettable and was very clearly addressed."
"However, let me stress that there are also a number of positive issues to note from the summit."
"I would say that the picture of the summit was mixed."
"First and most importantly, Russia was left in no doubt of the importance we attach to EU solidarity in our relations with Russia."
"Secondly, the summit confirmed that the EU and Russia see eye-to-eye on the underlying necessity of constructing a strong EU-Russia strategic partnership in the future."
"Thirdly, both the EU and Russia recognise that our economic and trading links in particular are larger and more intense than ever."
"Indeed, Russia is our third trading partner and we are their number one trading partner."
"We are working together for Russia's accession to the WTO this year, which will also see the signature of the Siberian overflight agreement, most probably in November."
"Fourthly, the summit also registered that, despite our difficulties, cooperation is proceeding well in many areas covered by the four common space roadmaps agreed in 2005."
"For instance the agreement on facilitation of visas and readmission will come into force on 1 June 2007."
"In the field of education, we have the European studies centre in Moscow, where there are hundreds of students who study European law."
"Europe attracts great attention from the students."
"There are questions such as the early alert system for energy, which Russia agreed to in principle and which we now have to work on, and finally a sort of dialogue on the investment climate and on investment in general."
"Therefore, as I have said, I do not think the picture is black and white: there is a full spectrum of different colours, from warm to cold shades."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I fully agree with the Commissioner's statement that we do not have to look at the picture in black and white, but unfortunately the black and white situation was forced on us and was forced on one Member State by its big neighbour."
"However, I would like to congratulate both the Commission and the Presidency for their convincing demonstration of solidarity in Samara."
"I think the clear statement by the President of the Commission to the Russian President that Estonia or Poland are considered as equally important members of the Union as Portugal or Germany should be considered a key message."
"I think the most important thing in the current situation was to make our counterparts understand what solidarity means for the Union, which is based on common values."
"As the motion for a resolution on Estonia states, attacks targeted at one of the smallest Member States are considered a test case for the solidarity of the EU as a whole, and all the major political groups have agreed on the text of the joint motion for a resolution on Estonia."
"I think there are some issues which you need to address collectively in future."
"It is inadmissible to interfere brutally in the internal affairs of any State, especially a small one."
"There is a crucial difference between two former totalitarian states."
"New democratic Germany made it the basic principle of its foreign policy never to threaten any of its neighbours, and this has contributed to a very significant extent to a positive change in post-war Europe."
"I think we need to act together to help Russia take a similar stand regarding its past imperialist deeds and help it to come to similar conclusions."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to make two preliminary observations."
"I agree entirely with the Commissioner when he talks about a strategic partnership and the value of one, and states that we must continue the dialogue with Russia and must see what we can get out of it on the basis of our own principles and values."
"Secondly, I am a Dutchman."
"I was not born in Eastern Europe."
"I grew up in freedom and have always lived in it."
"I think it is extremely important for me as a representative of what we could call an 'old' Member State to comment on what has happened to Estonia and the way in which Russia has treated it."
"It is also important to note that things related to the past are always sensitive, for us as much as for others."
"One has to tread carefully."
"I am a historian myself, and I know how dangerous it is if too much history is injected in politics."
"Although I always counsel in favour of exercising a certain level of self-restraint, my group has still expressed its solidarity with Estonia, and this must also be the basis for the European attitude in the conflict that has come about between Estonia and Russia."
"The fact that this conflict affects not only Russia, but the entire European Union was hammered home by the Commission President, Mr Barroso, in Samara."
"The European Union has not attempted to trivialise the conflict."
"Russia's reaction was inappropriate and unacceptable."
"European governments and members of parliament have tried to interfere in the domestic affairs of an EU Member State, and this is outrageous."
"Add to this the fact that the Russian authorities have done nothing to protect the functioning of the Estonian embassy in Moscow, as a result of which the conflict ended up, to all intents and purposes, being a diplomatic crisis."
"As I see it - and this is also worded well in the resolution - the Russian authorities, but perhaps we too, would do well to replace the hostile rhetoric by an attempt to contribute to a dialogue, not least between the communities in the countries in question, namely Estonia and Latvia, and not to drive things to a head, because this dialogue is also needed to create relations within those countries that match European values."
"I hope that the message of dialogue, the message of talking about the future, not only about the past, will also be put across in Moscow."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ET) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to touch on two topics in recent Estonian-Russian relations, firstly the cyber war and secondly the disinformation that has been engaged in by President Putin."
"Firstly, even after all of the declarations of support Estonia has received, Russia has not taken any steps to end the systematic cyber attacks on Estonia's official information and communication channels and on the web pages of the Estonian Government."
"The propaganda attacks on the Internet and via mobile messages include calls to violence and armed resistance."
"These messages are even distributed on television and through other media."
"Estonia is particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks, since it has an e-cabinet and e-government and this year had the first e-elections."
"The cyber attacks taking place in Estonia should serve as a warning to the whole of Europe."
"In the 21st century this danger threatens all countries."
"We must seriously consider how to protect ourselves, and we must do this together."
"This is the first 'cyber war' in history, and it is clearly aimed at hindering the functioning of a sovereign state of the European Union."
"Secondly, at an official press conference in Samara, at which the press of the whole world was represented, the Russian President said the following words, and I quote: 'It was not just that demonstrators were dispersed in Tallinn."
"A demonstrator was killed there."
"Moreover, it is not even the fact that an accident happened that is the issue,' Putin claimed, 'We are concerned by something else, by the fact that the person in question did not receive any help when he was injured.'"
"According to Putin, Ganin died in the presence of the police."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is intentional disinformation."
"Indeed, 20-year-old Dmitri Ganin was fatally injured in the course of the rioting, but criminal proceedings were initiated in connection with Dmitri's death, and these showed that his death was not connected with the police activity in keeping the peace in Tallinn."
"At approximately midnight on 27 April, the police found Dmitri, who had suffered a stab wound, and called an ambulance for him at 12.26 a.m."
"The ambulance set off one minute later and reached the scene at 12.32 a.m., that is to say five minutes later."
"Dmitri was hospitalised at 12.51 a.m."
"He was operated on, and he died in the hospital at 2.00 a.m."
"I emphasise once again: the ambulance arrived five minutes after being called by the police, and thus Dmitri did not die in the presence of the police, but instead in hospital."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the recent tensions with Russia over trade discrimination against Poland and Russia's interference in the internal affairs of independent Estonia provided what is probably the best possible demonstration of the actual mechanisms and forces underpinning European cooperation in the area of foreign policy."
"It was our moral duty to show solidarity with Estonia, but such solidarity is also in our best political interests."
"Recent incidents between the Union and Russia amounted to a substantial investment in the future of the European Union, one that is far more significant than further institutional changes."
"The European Union has come into its own, as a result of the far-sighted attitude adopted by the President of the Commission and the President of the Council."
"I am sure I speak for many citizens of Poland and Central Europe when I say to Mr Barroso and Mrs Merkel: thank you from the bottom of our hearts!"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to distinguish between the Russian-speaking people in Estonia and Russian policy."
"The Russian-speaking people in Estonia have the same civil and human rights as us, but the problems and differences of opinion do not entitle Russia to interfere in Estonia's affairs, such as demanding that the Estonian Government should resign."
"No one believes that the authorities in Moscow could not have prevented the disruption and the violence against the Estonian Ambassador and the embassy staff there when, just as the Commissioner said, opposition activists were stopped from travelling to the demonstration at Samara."
"The row over the statue has brought to light two different interpretations of history."
"It is true that the Red Army had a major role in liberating Europe from Nazism, but it is also true that the same army after the war became an army of occupation in Estonia and in many other countries."
"The events have shown clearly how poorly the Russian-speaking population has integrated into Estonian society."
"It is the Estonian Government's and society's job, and I know that it is not always an easy one, to find a constructive way to resolve these problems."
"The police have an obligation to keep order, but accusations that the police have acted disproportionately harshly need to be investigated impartially and openly."
"Russia seems to find it hard to understand that Estonia and the other Baltic countries are actually sovereign states."
"We have to show Estonia solidarity."
"The Member States of the European Union must help Estonia to find out who or what started the attacks on Estonian authority websites."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left naturally regrets the disproportionate reactions in Russia, and we naturally demand that Russia fulfil its international commitments under the Vienna Convention."
"That being said, the following must also be stated: no party is served by an escalation of the conflict, as may result from certain actions or simplistic resolutions and statements."
"Bridge-building and dialogue between parties is better than the setting up of walls and barriers."
"It is also indisputable that the discrimination and restriction of civil rights to which the Russian-speaking population of Estonia is exposed constitute the biggest breeding ground for conflicts."
"Responsibility for the conflict we are now discussing also resides with the Estonian Government, which does not respect the Russian-speaking population's civil rights."
"It is responsible for the fact that, before the monument was moved, no dialogue was conducted with the residents of Tallinn and for the fact that no account was taken of the monument's significance for a huge number of people as an important memorial to all those who lost their lives in the fight against Nazism and Fascism."
"Other regrettable factors are the escalation of the conflict, which was a reaction to the Estonian authorities not allowing peaceful demonstrations, and the further escalation, which was a consequence of the action taken by the Estonian police against the demonstrators."
"The Estonian action of removing an anti-Nazi memorial and the remains of soldiers who died in the war against Hitler's troops is seen as a provocation against all those who think that the fight against Nazism should be remembered in the future."
"No one is entitled to re-write history, and political views should not prevent serious analysis, and understanding, of how conflicts arise."
"It is only through such analysis and understanding that we shall be able to resolve conflicts in the future."
"Mr President, I cannot agree with the last speaker in her interpretation of moving a war memorial to a military cemetery."
"It seems to me that this is entirely the correct procedure."
"It is the right of the Estonian Government to make that decision, and this was used as a pretext, not, Commissioner, as you said, for a dispute between Russia and Estonia, but for a dispute between Russia and the EU."
"Commission President Barroso made the point extremely eloquently at Samara that we express our total solidarity with Estonia - as well as with Poland, with the Czech Republic and, indeed, with my own country, whose Ambassador has also been harassed by Nashi, an organisation from which President Putin does very little to dissociate himself."
"We are told constantly that we have to de-escalate the situation, which we did not create."
"In your reply, Commissioner, I wonder whether you can dwell on the WTO negotiations to which you referred."
"Is it possible that we can continue to negotiate entry with a country which apparently appears to be implicated in the disruption of electronic communications - as Mr Savi has just explained - with the banking system, with our own security?"
"Surely a very clear message has to be sent to President Putin that of course we want to continue these negotiations, but we cannot do so until the cyber-attacks cease."
"(ET) Permit me to express my warm and heartfelt thanks to the representatives of the Commission and of all of the Member States in this House for expressing their countries' solidarity with, and support for, Estonia."
"I will not dwell on the events that took place in Tallinn, which are spelled out in detail in the resolution, but I would like to emphasise the manner in which Russia has misrepresented the entire course of events for propaganda purposes."
"As my fellow Member, Mr Savi, has already noted regarding the death of the only young man to lose his life, would-be eyewitnesses spread in Tallinn the very next morning a version of the story according to which he had died in front of the Drama Theatre from blows inflicted by police truncheons."
"Since the location was identified incorrectly and the death was in fact caused by a stab wound, the Moscow version gradually dropped the reference to police blame, and President Putin claimed to the leaders of the European Union gathered in Samara that an ambulance had deliberately not come to assist the victim."
"I directly checked the facts on Sunday evening, when I spoke to the Minister of the Interior, who said that the ambulance had arrived at the scene within five minutes."
"Thus, this lie has twice been refuted in this House, yet I have once again had to emphasise the facts, because tomorrow spurious films are likely be in circulation here in this building."
"A completely new issue, however, is the cyber war, which has received considerable coverage in the global media. (the speech was interrupted)"
"Mr President, I would like to bring to your attention the historical background of the recent riots and violent demonstrations in Estonia."
"The European Union should understand that during the 50 years of Soviet occupation the Communist regime committed multiple crimes against the populations of the Baltic States."
"It moved hundreds of thousands of working migrants to the territories of these occupied, former sovereign states, which were members of the League of Nations, and created a real threat that Estonians and Latvians might become minorities in their own countries."
"Following immense pressure from the international community, including the European institutions, Estonia and Latvia agreed to integrate those hundreds of thousands of non-citizens into their societies."
"However, integration is a two-way process, and the recent developments in Estonia show that there are reverse tendencies."
"The sentiments of Soviet times have been replaced by Russia's new imperialistic approach."
"Especially alarming is the fact that the younger generation, on which the most hopes for integration and loyalty have been placed, was at the centre of the recent violent events in Estonia, and this must give us some food for thought."
"(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, events in Estonia have starkly illuminated various issues that are important for Europe:"
"1) Russia has not given up its designs on the Baltic States, but is attempting to use the 'divide and rule' principle."
"2) We must remind Russia of the need to acknowledge the fact of the occupation of the Baltic States, since a different interpretation of history will lead inevitably to similar conflicts in the future."
"3) Like Finland in 1939, the little country of Estonia did not quail in the face of attacks from the 'bear next door', retained its dignity, succeeded and gained the support of the countries of Europe."
"4) Russia only understands a strong and determined stance."
"Making concessions is seen as a sign of weakness, and so I would like to thank the Commission and Chancellor Merkel of Germany, the state with the Presidency, for their understanding of events and their solidarity in speaking to Russia with one European voice, and I would also like to express my conviction that this tactic will bring us all success in the future."
"Mr President, I have listened with great attention to the Commissioner's contribution, but I do not agree that the issue is just a dispute between Russia and Estonia."
"Moreover, I wonder how the inter-ethnic conflict, the relations between minorities and majorities, one of the crucial points of which is a different approach to history, now becomes a matter of relations between the European Union and Russia."
"I represent the Russian-speaking minority in Latvia and I have said on many occasions that we do not want to be hostages to geo-political games."
"Unfortunately, Russian speakers in Estonia as well as in Latvia were so-called prisoners of the first Cold War by being denied their citizens' rights - by being denied their language as an official language in the countries where they were a substantial minority."
"Now, unfortunately, we might be the hostages of the new Cold War and we see appeals in this House to the behaviour which is very like the Cold War."
"There cannot be solidarity when there is violation of human rights."
"A number of international organisations just report on violations of human rights during the recent events in Estonia."
"(EL) The conflict between Estonia and Russia is not a bronze statue; it has to do with the insulting rewriting of history."
"It is an insult to the memory of the million of unknown soldiers who gave their lives in order to crush fascism."
"The debate in the European Parliament during the last part-session in Brussels and the approval of the resolution expressing solidarity with the Estonian Government is a conscious policy to support the rewriting of history and the revival of fascism in the Baltic and other states."
"We have repeatedly condemned with facts known to everyone that a methodical effort was made in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania after 1991 to restore the collaborators of the SS and German fascism."
"At the same time, they started demolishing monuments to the Red Army."
"In July 2004, the monument to the Estonian anti-fascist Lembit Pärn was demolished and a monument was erected to the Waffen-SS commander Alfons Rebane."
"In Latvia, the Salaspils concentration camp, where 100 000 adults and 4 000 children were murdered, was named a 'reformatory and labour camp' by the government."
"In Romania, the collaborator with Nazi Germany, Prime Minister Ion Antonescu, was acquitted on charges of war crimes."
"Waffen-SS murderers and torturers are given pensions and looked on as freedom fighters in the Baltic States."
"The Council is silent in the face of all these accusations and questions by the members of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament."
"It does not surprise us."
"Fascism is the pure child of capitalism."
"We do not agree with Putin."
"However, we do wonder, when you wipe out over 20 million dead, why you are so insulting and call for respect for international conventions."
"You are rewriting history, but the facts do not change."
"It is an historic truth that it was the Red Army, with the communists, the Soviet Union, at the vanguard that crushed fascism in eastern and central Europe and raised the red flag with the hammer and sickle on the Reichstag."
"It was and still is the permanent nightmare that will always mark the defeat for those who dreamed of global sovereignty ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Russia regrettably will not wake up to the new geopolitical reality that the so-called 'near-abroad', where it exercised total power for most of the last century, from the Caucuses to Ukraine, is no longer a reality."
"The Baltic States are now also proud, independent EU Member States and it is right and proper that the EU and NATO, which they have joined, should show total solidarity when Russia attempts to bully the smallest of them - Estonia - over what is entirely a sovereign internal matter of that newly independent republic."
"Many might question the political wisdom of moving the statue of a so-called Soviet liberator."
"However, I, fortunately, come from a country that has never experienced the brutal Stalinist invasion and annexation that these countries have."
"One must appreciate that most Estonians do not see the Soviets as liberators but as tyrants, who extinguished the independence and freedom they enjoyed in the inter-war period."
"The relocation of the statue and fallen Russian soldiers was conducted according to international law and it in no way justified the Duma resolutions calling for the resignation of the Estonian Government; the subsequent violent demonstrations; the cyber-attacks on Estonia's sophisticated system of e-government; the outrageous use of Nashi, an extreme nationalist organisation, to harass the Estonian Embassy - in violation of the Vienna Conventions, and on the back of a similar strategy adopted against the British Ambassador, Anthony Brenton, who attended the Kasparov rally last year."
"If it wants good relations after the summit with the EU as a whole and if it wants to negotiate a new PCA, Russia must appreciate that it has to respect all the EU Member States equally."
"The cosy bilateral days of former Chancellor Schröder, now richly rewarded by President Putin with a cushy job after his retirement, are well and truly over."
"The new EU leaders, such as Sarkozy and Merkel, are going to get much tougher with Russia in future."
"(Applause)"
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your clear message that Russia must not treat Estonia as its province or constituent republic."
"The Bronze Soldier was just a pretext."
"If there had not been that, something else would have been found, possibly elsewhere."
"This was an attempt to create a rift not only within Estonia, but also within the European Union; an attempt by Russia to create instability that would justify greater interference and help direct attention away from its own removed monuments."
"As former Minister of Population and Ethnic Affairs, I confirm that this was not an ethnic conflict, that is to say one between Estonians and Russians."
"Although in many respects we have different views of history and its symbols, I confirm to you that those few thousand youths who rioted do not represent the Russian minority in Estonia."
"Those who came onto the streets shouted 'Rossiya, Rossiya'."
"We are proud of our Russians who see Estonia as their home, and we will try to do everything we can to restore peace."
"We cannot change the past, and it is unlikely that we could change the attitude towards it, but we can shape a common vision of the future."
"A large part of the population has today adopted the position 'different past, common future'."
"(SV) The riots following the removal of the bronze soldier in Tallinn were a shock for all those who have made efforts to integrate the Russian-speaking population into Estonian society and to strengthen the bonds between the population groups in Estonia."
"Estonia now needs the maximum amount of support and solidarity from the EU and its Member States in order to move on from this setback, harmonise the relationship between the country's language groups and stabilise the whole society."
"Estonia must not be exposed to undue pressure and interference from Russia."
"That is important for the whole of the European Union."
"Estonia has proud traditions and all the prerequisites of success."
"As long ago as 1920, the Russian-speaking minority was given a strong position by Estonia's first constitution."
"An important step now would be to set up an Estonian TV channel broadcasting in Russian."
"At present, too many Russian-speaking Estonians are exposed to one-sided information from Russia."
"(PL) Mr President, let us take a broader view of this issue."
"The recent EU-Russia summit in Samara resulted in a change in our mutual relationship, as the existence of solidarity within the Union became apparent to the new Member States. Thanks are due to the President of the Council and the President of the Commission for this."
"It may be deemed disappointing that no progress was achieved in the talks."
"Nonetheless, the Samara summit should be regarded in a positive light. This is because the development of relations between the Union and Russia is conditional on Russia's respect for the sovereignty of individual Member States of the Union and on Russia abandoning tactics that involve exerting political pressure through economic instruments or the use of information technology."
"Unfortunately, the Russian authorities have failed to take this on board."
"The cyber-attacks on Estonia have not ceased, and the embargo on Polish meat is still in place."
"The trail left by Alexander Litvinienko's murderers leads to Moscow."
"All the Union can do is to maintain pressure."
"We cannot attempt to understand contemporary Russia without considering its attitude to the past."
"As a prerequisite for long-lasting and constructive relationship with Russia, the Union needs to develop a common vision of that past."
"With that in mind, it would be helpful to create some kind of 'Truth and Reconciliation Charter'."
"(SV) I think that what has happened in Tallinn since April of this year is eminently clear to everyone."
"I am uncertain, however, as to whether everyone understands its significance."
"The previous debates in Parliament on this subject indicate that not everyone understands why certain people have reacted so violently."
"Allow me, therefore, to explain."
"As early as at the time of his appointment as President, Mr Putin indicated that he would do everything he could to restore to Russia its former military strength and the power that he believes is Russia's due."
"If I remember correctly, only one newspaper - a French one - directly picked up on the signals from Russia."
"Other media remained unaware of them."
"Those of us who speak Russian and who have experience of living close to, or under the thumb of, Russia did, however, understand."
"Over the years, it has, however, become ever clearer that Russia is developing in the wrong direction when it comes to human rights, media independence and political freedom."
"Otto von Habsburg, one of Europe's most respected political figures, described it as the route back to the time of Stalin."
"He is now 95 years old. He has a perspective on things, and he remembers."
"Others appear to have forgotten, however."
"In the European Parliament, too, there are Members who appear to have forgotten the trials that had to be endured by the Eastern European countries on their way to freedom, independence and autonomy."
"All the threats and boycotts, the interference in other countries' internal affairs and the blackmail involving withheld energy supplies appear to have been forgotten."
"A number of these events took place quite recently and are happening right now in some of the countries I would designate as the new Europe."
"Some people from the old Europe appear, however, to have forgotten their historic lesson: that it is only through conducting a common foreign policy, showing solidarity and speaking with one voice that we can preserve peace."
"This is not about the monument in Tallinn."
"The debate is not about Estonia."
"It is about Europe and about Europe's sovereignty and independence."
"(LV) Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, first of all I would like to thank Mr Barroso for saying in Samara that a problem that any Member State has with Russia, even the very smallest state, is also a problem that the European Union has with Russia."
"That was fine support for the Member States, the new Member States, and especially Estonia, but even for those politicians who have now lost their rose-coloured spectacles regarding relations with Russia it is vital to understand that attempts will continue to take place to demonstrate that for Russia there still exists the real old Europe and the territories close to its borderland, which, in Russia's view, have temporarily, under the influence of various events, accidentally become part of the European Union."
"At the same time there will be new tests of the strength of the European Union's unity, and tests of new virtual weapons, which in modern society can do enormous harm."
"So the question is whether the European Union will wait until it runs into more problems with one of the European Union's ex-Soviet bloc Member States, or whether it will be able to urge upon Russia the requirements that any state must fulfil if it wants to become a democratic and prospective member of a partnership."
"Thank you."
". - (LV) Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, it is particularly important for Europe not only to display solidarity but also to acknowledge the true reasons for the conflicts that occurred in Estonia."
"Europe absolutely must understand that in Estonia there was a clash between Western democracy and the old Soviet totalitarian ideologies."
"In recognising this, Europe must unfalteringly reject the historical interpretations of the totalitarian USSR era."
"Europe must promote the removal of USSR symbols that offend the inhabitants of nations that were enslaved by the USSR."
"Europe must participate in the renewal of historical truth in the occupied Baltic States and elsewhere in eastern Europe."
"This might be a precondition for the reconciliation of representatives of differing ideologies and for future integration in the former Soviet-occupied territories."
"This is also a joint problem for the whole of Europe."
"I would like in particular to stress that the European Parliament ought from now on to be an active participant in achieving these goals of truth and the rule of law."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, this discussion has clearly shown that the key word is 'solidarity'."
"I should like to thank a number of Members for their words of thanks."
"Mr Barroso in particular could not have been clearer on this issue."
"Many of you know what he said."
"His meaning was that aggression against one Member State - in this case Estonia - represents aggression against the whole European Union."
"This was a very strong statement and it also showed that divide et impera politics cannot work if Europe speaks with one voice."
"These were the main issues and main lessons of these proceedings."
"These questions took some considerable time in the discussions in our meeting."
"We emphasised again and again that we are working as an EU of 27 Member States and that solidarity will be maintained."
"On WTO accession, both sides at Samara recognised that our economic and trading links are larger and more intensive than ever and it was encouraging to hear from the Russian side that they intend to accelerate the process of their accession to the WTO."
"It is encouraging because it is in our interests to bind Russia into a rules-based system where it can then be held to account."
"This is very important."
"On cyber-attacks, it is now up to the Council to work on the Commission communication where we have added a specific paragraph on cyber-terrorism."
"I can see there is generally much agreement in this House on how important it is to work on this question of solidarity."
"(Applause)"

"Roaming on public mobile networks (vote)"
"- Report: Rübig"
"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, on a point of order, in line with the Rules of Procedure, I would like to declare a pecuniary interest in the Rübig report."
"I will not be taking part in the voting on the items in question."
"That is very proper."
"Most of us have mobile phones!"
"Mr President, I also rise under Rule 166 to declare a pecuniary interest."
"As a Member of the European Parliament and a frequent user of mobile phones, I stand to gain a great deal from this legislation."
"Therefore I disqualify myself from voting."
"I trust many of my colleagues will join me!"
"(Laughter)"
"Well that is noted!"
"Mr President, following the logic of the last two speakers, will you enquire whether there may perhaps be a solitary Member of the European Parliament who does not possess a mobile phone?"
"Then that Member can determine whether or not we adopt this legislation!"
"(Laughter and applause)"
"I think we can move on now."
"- After the adoption of the legislative resolution:"
"President. Congratulations to Mr Rübig and to the mobile phone users of Europe!"
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, my thanks go to the House for its assent and in particular to the Council for having agreed that the Regulation will be put into effect on 27 June at the latest, while what I have to say to those Members who abstained is that we are reducing the cost to the taxpayer."

"Excise duty on alcohol (vote)"
"- Report: Lulling"
"- After the rejection of the Commission proposal:"
"I should like to request that the document be referred back to committee, because now we have contradictory voting outcomes."
"Because the Commission has not made any proposals, it will automatically be referred back to committee."
"That will happen anyway."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I proposed to my group and to many of my fellow Members who supported me that they reject the report, because the line that I had proposed has not been followed and because I have the impression that, in view of the close outcome of the vote, certain Members of this House did not know what they were voting for."
"(Protests)"
"Sorry, were unaware of the significance of their votes."
"Furthermore, Mr President, given that the Commission is keeping quiet - even though Commissioner Kovács spoke twice last night while I, the rapporteur, was not allowed to respond to him - I really must highlight its powerlessness."
"We made a proposal in order to break the deadlock."
"Unfortunately, we have not been supported, Mr President."
"Therefore, there is no report by Parliament on this proposal, and the Commission and the Council can persist in maintaining the status quo and persevere in their state of deadlock."
"(Applause)"
"There will of course be a debate when the matter comes back before the House."

"Composition of the delegation to EUROLAT (vote)"

"The exclusion of health services from the Services Directive (vote)"
"- Report: Vergnaud"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I am taking the floor simply to point out to the House that there has been an error."
"Indeed, as the same sentence appears in three different paragraphs, Parliament's services have rightly deleted paragraphs 47 and 53 from the report, since this sentence appears in its entirety in paragraph 51."
"I simply wished to inform my fellow Members of this matter."

"- Report: Sturdy"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 23:"
"(NL) Mr President, the last sentence of Amendment 23 now reads 'calls on the EU to set up the compensation mechanisms required to avert consequences of this sort'."
"This has met with opposition, for it seems to imply that we, the EU, should carry all financial consequences."
"In order to avoid this misinterpretation, I would suggest an oral amendment according to which it would read 'calls on the EU to help to set up the compensation mechanisms required to avert consequences of this sort'."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"10."
"Common Foreign and Security Policy 2005 (vote)"
"- Report: Brok"
"- After the vote:"

"11."
"Decent work (vote)"
"- Report: Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou"
"That concludes the vote."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"(DE) Mr President, while I do endorse Mr Mauro's report, I do regret the absence from it, as also from the Commission draft, of any reference to Community grants being tied to measures for protection against noise from rail and road traffic."
"However much development work might need to be done, the people living nearby also need to be considered, and not only their health but also their acceptance of the work."
"I therefore urge that the rules on protection against noise for rail vehicles be amended as soon as possible to make reference to lower maximum levels and to promote noise abatement measures in exactly the same way as they promote the extension of trans-European networks."
"(DE) Mr President, I have voted against the Mauro report on the grounds that the amount of traffic in Europe is increasing enormously and that overcrowded roads and permanent traffic jams presage the collapse of the transport system."
"Although it was many years ago that we decided what projects would form the Trans-European Transport networks, we are lagging far behind when it comes to putting them in place, so that what should be Europe's masterpiece is still more like a piece of patchwork."
"We must also do something about making rail travel more appealing, and I believe that should be done not only for transnational traffic, but also, and to an increasing extent, for local travel."
"Although the proposal for a regulation on the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks provides for an increase in the current level of Community cofinancing, it falls short of what the original proposal as regards both the transport and energy networks, due to the detrimental agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"There is a further fundamental issue at stake here."
"The 'trans-European networks' are implemented with Community and Member State funding - in other words, clearly public funding - with the aim of completing the internal market, as explained in point 1 of the Council common position: 'strong and integrated energy and transport networks are the cornerstone of the European internal market and that better use of the existing networks and the completion of missing links will make it possible to increase effectiveness and competitiveness.'"
"In other words, the completion of the internal market lies at the heart of these projects, with the opening up of the markets and with key sectors in the economy of a country being handed over to private interests, once, of course, public investment has been made."
"Given the importance of these sectors to the development of any country, we argue that they should be kept in the public sector and are thus opposed to its privatisation."
"in writing."
"Mr President, my group wanted to see our amendments incorporated to this report which would have increased the powers of Parliament over future budgets on trans-European Energy and Transport networks, though they were unsuccessful."
"However, it remains important that this area of investment remain under close parliamentary scrutiny as it represents such a clear instance of 'EU added value'."
"The EU has broken down barriers across Europe for many years, yet so many infrastructural barriers remain in energy and must be addressed."
"Scotland in particular has much to contribute to Europe's energy needs but we need the necessary connections to do so, and I will be exploring all ways to lever EU funding into connections to maximise Scotland's green energy potential."
"(HU) I believe this has been one of the most important votes, at least from our citizens' point of view."
"Ordinary citizens know little about EU legalities."
"They are more interested in finding out what EU membership means in their daily life."
"When borders crumble, when one can cross from one country to another without a passport, the question arises: why must we pay extra punitive charges for getting in touch by telephone across borders?"
"I think the best thing would have been for Parliament to decide to abolish completely all roaming charges and declare that all mobile rates within the European Union shall be identical."
"However, I admit this would have been difficult to implement as a first step, and therefore welcome the fact that at least we have come to the gradual reduction of roaming fees."
"10 million people live in Hungary and 9.5 million of them use mobile telephones."
"In my opinion, it was extremely important to vote for this."
"(CS) I voted against the proposals on roaming calls, for the following reasons."
"Firstly, these measures are not economic but rather political in nature. They are an expression of protectionism and the new form of European commercialism."
"Secondly, they go against the principle of supply and demand."
"Thirdly, although I do not expect the mobile operators to make up for the shortfall by raising prices on the domestic market, they will presumably cut investment in development and almost certainly break the cycle of falling domestic prices."
"The most worrying aspect for the EU is that investors will lose confidence, as they will see that the regulatory body is moving the goalposts in the middle of the game."
"in writing. It makes a pleasant change to welcome a piece of EU legislation."
"The enforced reduction in mobile roaming charges is good for consumers across Europe."
"Though still high at 35p per minute to make a call and 17p per minute to receive a call, they are set to fall further over the next three years."
"Now reductions must be obtained on texting and email connections."
"in writing. UKIP MEPs, like all MEPs in Parliament, have a vested interest in reduced mobile roaming charges."
"Therefore, UKIP MEPs will not vote on the Rübig report."
"UKIP believes it is morally wrong for MEPs to vote on an issue which could lead to personal enrichment."
"Moreover, we never approve of EU regulation."
"in writing. I warmly welcome the new deal on mobile roaming charges."
"Labour MEPs have been campaigning for two years to introduce these measures which represent a genuine triumph for European consumers and could not have been achieved without the EU."
"For too long mobile phone companies have been charging outrageous sums to people using their phones elsewhere in the EU."
"It is a shame that Conservative MEPs sided with the mobile phone industry to oppose consumer protection, making the case for higher charges to be levied."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Rübig report on roaming on public mobile networks within the Community because the positions upheld in this report are going to make it possible significantly to improve the situation of European consumers."
"Many European citizens, including the inhabitants of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais border area, frequently travel abroad, for professional and personal reasons, and the tariffs currently in force when they make or receive calls on their mobiles are excessive and unjustifiable."
"The Rübig report remedies a situation that penalises mobility."
"I am therefore in favour of the fixed tariffs in this report: the costs per minute that have been adopted are totally satisfactory and much lower than those currently applied."
"We would, however, have preferred even lower tariffs, which could have provided a better incentive for people to move about Europe."
"In addition to significantly reduced tariffs, the requirement for transparency that has been requested is an important principle."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament also sought greater transparency concerning the cost of calls and secured a result whereby, from now on, European citizens will be able to know how much a call received or sent from abroad will cost them."
"I voted in favour of the Rübig report on roaming on public mobile networks in the Community. I feel that the preliminary agreement between Parliament and the Presidency of the Council on the text of the regulation, which MEPs from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament played a key role in formulating, represents a significant victory for the consumer."
"I feel that these measures will prove vital for the future of the information society. They will enable us to save billions of euros and better to serve the consumers' interests."
"The reduction in roaming rates will make it possible to break down the remaining barriers in the internal market, thereby strengthening European competitiveness."
"This regulation states that its ultimate aim is to 'create a smooth-running European internal market in telecommunications.' This, as the report says, is because 'self-regulation does not work'."
"It is interesting to note, in this case, the acknowledgement that the market does not work. Hence the need to regulate prices."
"They therefore propose both wholesale and retail price regulation, including the creation of a regulated retail price - Eurotariff - which all operators will be obliged to offer, in order to achieve a significant reduction in the price of roaming."
"Even so, the possibility remains of huge profit margins for the large operators in the sector."
"That being said, there are advantages for consumers: cheaper international calls, without this cost being transferred to national markets, and the freedom to choose the most favourable operator and tariff."
"This is another example of the 'market' clearly not protecting users and consumers, and this is why regulation is needed."
"It is high time the Commission and the Member States acknowledged this in other areas and brought benefit to consumers."
"There are times - extremely rare times in this House - when the Members are asked to vote on a text that is genuinely useful for Europeans and when, for once, Europe provides real added value."
"Such was the case a few years ago for cross-border credit transfers in the euro zone: European legislation stipulated that the cost of cross-border transfers be the same as that of national transfers."
"This was merely very logical and very normal, since the single currency had just been brought in."
"It is the case today for the regulation on mobile telephone roaming charges."
"Though imperfect, like all compromises, this text will nevertheless make it possible to monitor more effectively the prohibitive tariffs set by operators on Community international communications."
"Furthermore, the revision clause, which will be laid down in 18 months' time, will, we hope, be an opportunity to go further in terms of protecting consumers."
"in writing. (SV) The report contains many practical proposals with a view to improving the situation for consumers."
"The June List welcomes these proposals which, when it comes to consumer information and easily accessible price information, are to people's advantage."
"Roaming fees certainly seem absurdly high at present."
"Before a decision is made on political measures, however, it must be made clear what market failure is behind this unsatisfactory state of affairs."
"Is it a question of insufficient competition through what is known as implicit collusion?"
"In that case, it would be quite wrong to introduce price regulation, as this would do nothing at all to solve the problem."
"To propose treatment without a prior diagnosis would be absurd."
"Researchers in this area should investigate what market failure we are facing before populist measures are taken."
"In the long run it is free competition rather than price regulation that will most benefit consumers."
"To allow politicians to set prices instead of the market is almost never a constructive long-term solution."
"In my opinion, the proposal will also hit that part of the population that, for economic or other reasons, seldom travels abroad."
"in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of the report on the proposal relating to the Regulation of the European Parliament and Council concerning roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community and amending Directive 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications - C6-02442006 -"
"Mr Rübig correctly pointed out the need to find solutions that would allow EU citizens to use mobile phones to contact home while abroad."
"There is no single market for mobile telephony at the moment, and this is a barrier to the daily use of telephones abroad."
"I agree with the formula which sets maximum wholesale and retail rates."
"It is very important to reduce the unreasonably high levels of roaming tariffs, to explain to users how to activate new tariffs and to inform them of the date the above legislation takes effect."
"Another positive initiative is that any customer who does not choose any particular tariff within three months of the Regulation becoming effective will automatically enjoy the regulated EU tariff, and the fact that mobile phone operators will have to inform their customers of the roaming charges for outgoing and incoming calls for their particular tariffs."
"in writing. - (FR) It was with a heavy heart that I voted in favour of the report on roaming on public mobile networks because it goes against my most important political convictions."
"Indeed, I regard any tariff-fixing by the legislator as undue intervention in the market economy and as a vestige of another era that ought not to be revived."
"The application of the Eurotariff thus set will create big problems for operators from the small Member States, who will have difficulty in funding the investments needed to apply the new roaming conditions."
"The long-term effects of this regulation could even end in an increase in national communications tariffs, which would be counterproductive and disastrous for the proper functioning of the national economies."
"I support transparent price setting and a reduction in roaming charges in a spirit of free competition, but this reduction must not be achieved by means of retail price fixing and at the expense of national communications tariffs."
"I am also pleased that the 'opt-in' principle has been safeguarded in this compromise, even though an 'opt-in' with no conditions or time limits would have been preferable."
"This regulation has a mere three-year lifespan: what a consolation!"
"in writing. (SV) The report contains many practical proposals with a view to improving the situation for consumers."
"The June List welcomes these proposals which, when it comes to consumer information and easily accessible price information, are to people's advantage."
"Roaming fees certainly seem absurdly high at present."
"Before a decision is made on political measures, however, it must be made clear what market failure is behind this unsatisfactory state of affairs."
"Is it a question of insufficient competition through what is known as implicit collusion?"
"In that case, it would be quite wrong to introduce price regulation, as this would do nothing at all to solve the problem."
"To propose treatment without a prior diagnosis would be absurd."
"Researchers in this area should investigate what market failure we are facing before populist measures are taken."
"In the long run it is free competition rather than price regulation that will most benefit consumers."
"To allow politicians to set prices instead of the market is almost never a constructive long-term solution."
"in writing. I supported this first-reading compromise agreement."
"This is an important victory which will benefit consumers, who will be able to enjoy cheaper roaming costs by this summer."
"in writing. I voted for the report on the proposal for a regulation on roaming on public mobile networks, which will lead to a reduction in prices for millions of roaming customers."
"The initiative will help an enormous number of consumers who are affected by the roaming charges that are unjustifiably high."
"The regulation will ensure that prices paid for international roaming when travelling within the European Union will not be unjustifiably higher than the charges for calls paid within the user's country."
"Consumers will benefit from lower prices for making calls in the visited country, back home or to any other EU Member State."
"Consumers will also make considerable savings when receiving calls."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left voted in favour of the Rübig report on roaming because, following pressure from the European Parliament, a satisfactory compromise was achieved for the benefit of European consumers."
"Of course a great many steps still need to be taken in the direction of transparent charges and extending the scope of and further reducing the uncontrolled charges made by mobile telephone companies."
"The procedure also needs to be speeded up before the Telecommunications Council, so that the regulation can be adopted as quickly as possible and consumers can benefit from the regulations already introduced this summer."
"This regulation must set an example."
"Regulatory frameworks need to be created in other sectors where the rules of the free market have proven to be inadequate and cartels reign supreme."
"Current roaming prices penalise users travelling between different Member States and constitute an obstacle to a genuine single market."
"In view of the cross-border nature of the contractual relations involved in these services, the Member States have shown they are scarcely capable of tackling this issue. Although the solution ought ideally to lie in the sector regulating itself, this again has proved impossible."
"Europe's consumers deserve fairer, more transparent treatment. A Europe-wide regulatory amendment is therefore called for, one that stops abuse, creates transparency, ensures balance in the market, enables greater ease of movement and communication, and fosters greater economic dynamism."
"Although the limits on the price of calls fall well short of what Parliament initially called for, I feel this is a first step in the right direction. It also introduces the kind of clarity and predictability that the market has been missing."
"I hope that the operators do not react to the loss of revenue with an unjustified increase in the price of national calls, but instead take the opportunity to raise revenue by increasing the number of customers and by improving the services they provide both nationally and internationally."
"in writing. - (FR) By endorsing the regulation on mobile telephone roaming charges this lunchtime, the European Parliament has just adopted legislation that was awaited by millions of consumers: workers or tourists, exasperated by the exorbitant costs of cross-border calls made or received on the GSM and who have gained the support of the European Commission, as the author of this legislative proposal."
"Furthermore, although my liberal philosophy does not sit well with interventionism on market prices, I am above all opposed to the laissez-faire, lax approach and to cartels being formed in a given economic sector."
"This European law is a significant advance when it comes to protecting consumers, who are going to see their bills slashed by as much as 70%."
"A further advance is the freedom of choice given to operators to offer clients an option between the regulated tariff and a fixed tariff that will also cover SMSs and MMSs."
"I have one regret, however: this reduction in roaming charges will not be operational for the summer season."
"Europeans will find consolation in this desire clearly expressed by the three European institutions to try to win them back and to fulfil the first task: to make laws that change their everyday lives for the better."
"in writing. (SV) I abstained from voting on the roaming issue today."
"Anyone who has ever been abroad knows how expensive it is to make and receive calls, but there are dangers in the EU setting price ceilings."
"I would have been able to accept regulation at wholesaler level governing, for example, the relationship between Telia and a company in Spain, but I do not approve of setting a ceiling on prices for the consumer."
"It would not be a ceiling but a floor."
"If the ceiling is set at 49%, it is obviously that percentage that the companies will deduct."
"Companies' profits would decline as they would previously have had revenue that could be used for competing in the national arena."
"If profits disappeared, this might lead to companies having to increase their national prices."
"The EU would then, instead, have weakened the vulnerable consumer whom it had always maintained it wanted to protect."
"The mobile market is a relatively new market. In Sweden, the market adjusted gradually and prices have fallen significantly."
"If only the system had been made more transparent, better technical solutions sought and the information systems spoken of in the proposal introduced, these measures would presumably have been enough to force prices down."
"Roaming prices have fallen substantially, and although this has certainly happened unevenly throughout Europe, it is still a sign that the market is regulating itself."
"in writing. I voted in favour of this measure as so many European citizens are affected by higher than necessary roaming charges."
"The reduction of costs for so many people and businesses is a very useful contribution to peoples' private pockets, as well as business costs."
"The function of the mobile telephony market is to allow the maximum efficiency of the industry, while striking the right balance in consumer interests."
"in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of the report on the proposal relating to the Regulation of the European Parliament and Council concerning roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community and amending Directive 2002/21/EC on the common regulatory framework for electronic communications."
"When we adopted the Lisbon Agenda, our aim was to turn the European Union into the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy."
"For that reason we must ensure that the market for mobile phone technology within the European Union is a dynamic market with no internal barriers."
"Currently about 80% of EU citizens have a mobile phone, but mobile phone roaming charges are so high that they limit demand for this service."
"However, mobile telephony is not restricted to voice communication, but also includes other types of new-generation communication such as GPS, Wi-Fi and remote Internet access."
"These are very advanced technologies, which are a particularly important element in helping to promote a knowledge-based economy."
"For this reason we cannot afford to allow their usage and their development to be stifled by exorbitant price barriers."
"in writing. UKIP MEPs, like all MEP's in the Parliament, have a vested interest in reduced mobile roaming charges."
"Therefore, UKIP MEPs will not vote on the Rubig report."
"UKIP believes it is morally wrong for MEPs to vote on an issue which could lead to personal enrichment."
"Moreover, we never approve of EU regulation."
"(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the introduction of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages in 1992 was the start of attempts to coordinate taxes in the creation of a common market."
"This was and is a complex process."
"So far there has been partial success in managing to coordinate indirect taxes, setting a minimal level for alcohol, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fuel."
"However, in reality, taxation policy has remained under the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"Increasing excise duty based on EU inflation indices for 1993-2006 is not logical."
"Why does this rate of inflation have to be applied to countries that joined the EU after 2004?"
"Complete abolition of excises based on the fact that these are small incomes for Member States is also not justified."
"Following the aim of the introduction of excise duties, analogically one ought also to abolish tobacco and fuel excise duties."
"I support maintaining the status quo, not changing excises and allowing Member States, based on the principle of subsidiarity, to further set their own tax levels."
"All the more so, because among the Member States themselves there is no common agreement on the abolition of excises."
"(DE) Mr President, I have done what the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, actually wanted people to do, and voted against her report on the grounds that it seeks the increase of more taxes, this time reheating the old familiar argument that this is needed to prevent distortions of competition, although it now turns out that - as the experts had predicted - the minimum rates brought in in 1992 did no more than widen the gulf between the rates in the Member States, some of which increased their rates repeatedly and now want the others to be compelled to do likewise."
"To act on this proposal would, I believe, be seen by the public as another outrage by Brussels."
"in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats should ideally have liked to have seen Parliament being able to support the Commission's original proposal for an increase in minimum taxes that took account of inflation since 1993."
"Since the vote was predicted to be very close, we chose to support the amendments aimed at increasing minimum taxes so that they took account of inflation since the 2004 enlargement."
"We are pleased that the report has now been referred back to the committee and hope that the latter will this time come to the view that taxes on alcohol are needed in order to reduce the harm caused by alcohol in the EU."
"It is a good thing that the majority in Parliament rejected this report."
"We voted against imposing excise duties at supranational level, as this would have restricted tax sovereignty and the sovereignty of political decision-making by means of taxes and the budget."
"The main purpose of excise duties, which are currently a significant proportion of the revenue of many Member States, is to moderate consumption, as in the case of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages, and in turn to protect public health."
"In addition to the direct impact of excise on activities in the agricultural sector and a significant part of the industrial sector, this should, first and foremost, be a national decision based on consumer preference for traditional products, on varying social choice as regards the consumption of alcoholic beverages, and on how different countries use different tax instruments, as in the case of wine in Portugal, where it is important to maintain the current minimum zero euro rate, a move that has been accepted in plenary."
"We are opposed, however, to the Commission's proposal to increase minimum rates and the rapporteur's ideas on having a maximum rate."
"As the report itself notes, the 1992 directive on excise duties did not result in any approximation of these rates among the Member States, or even settled the so-called problems concerning a distortion of competition."
"If it were consistent, the Commission, in line with its 'better lawmaking' programme, ought itself to call for the abolition of this text."
"The truth is that it is the responsibility of the Member States, and them alone, to set taxes, whether direct or indirect, on their territory, in accordance with their budgetary, economic and social requirements, and that the fiscal harmonisation sought by the Commission has in fact only an ideological aim."
"I shall conclude by saying that it is more than a little paradoxical for those who campaign for the abolition of border controls, the free movement of persons, goods and services and free competition to be the first to complain when this abolition and this freedom of movement encourage Europeans to use competition to their advantage."
"in writing. (SV) We have voted against this report because it does not address the conflicting aims that are central to the problem concerned."
"What we are really concerned with here is, of course, the fact that the Member States' right to decide on an issue as crucial as alcohol policy is in conflict both with the demand for a free internal market and the Member States' right to make their own decisions about their tax systems."
"Alcohol is not just any old product. The internal market is at the heart of the EU, and the right of taxation is one of the sovereign state's most important assets."
"The rapporteur has made no attempt at all to analyse and resolve these conflicting aims."
"The issue should therefore be addressed seriously by experts and political representatives with a proper grasp of the subject before Parliament is faced with new proposals."
"- (SK) I have voted in favour of the realistic approach presented in the Vergnaud report, since it is obvious that the decisions of the European Court of Justice defending the right of patients to be treated in a country other than their own where their health would otherwise be seriously at risk or where their life is at stake, interfere with the powers of national governments."
"As we know, the Directive on Services in the Internal Market excluded healthcare from the competence of the European Union and left it under the exclusive purview of national states."
"It is self-evident that patient mobility in Europe will increase."
"Patients will naturally be demanding access to care including the latest forms of treatment."
"This will not be confined to workers working in another country; it may also involve patients seeking out high-quality treatments abroad which for objective reasons are not available in the home country, and then travelling abroad to obtain such treatments."
"in writing. Believing that the provision of quality and universal health services is the sole competence of the Member States, I voted against the Vergnaud report and the attempt to re-introduce healthcare into the Services Directive."
"in writing. (SV) We have chosen to vote against this report, partly because we believe that the Member States themselves should be able to decide for which health services prior notification can be required."
"We believe that a system involving planned care in which, following a medical examination, prior notification could quickly be obtained would be to patients' advantage. It would be a system that provided equal access to cross-border care services for everyone and not just for those who could afford to pay out of their own pockets and then wait to be reimbursed."
"We have voted in favour of amendments that recommend political decisions rather than court decisions based on case law, even if we have reservations about all the political initiatives being subject to codecision by Parliament."
"We have also voted in favour of wording that contains references to freedom of establishment, but we would emphasise that we do not believe that this necessarily means having access to public resources."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Vergnaud report."
"The vote on this report in plenary has confirmed the specific nature of health services and hence their exclusion from the Services Directive."
"This vote has meant that equal access to health care and the financial viability of social security system will not be called into question."
"In my view, the discussions begun at Community level on health services must henceforth focus on the legal uncertainty resulting from the case-law of the CJEC and on the areas for which the European Union is liable to create added value."
"As far as I am concerned, a directive on health services that is in keeping with the goal of a framework directive on services of general economic interest remains the only tool that will enable the European Union to provide its added value and to regain the trust of the people of Europe in an area that is the very essence of their lives."
"In common with other Commission communications on healthcare, this own-initiative report is, to some extent, aimed at once again applying to health services the same approach as the internal market for services, which it does by tabling a fresh proposal for a separate health services directive."
"We therefore voted against the report."
"We welcome the fact, however, that the proposal to include health services in the directive on liberalising services was rejected."
"Universal access to high-quality, universal health services is a fundamental right of all citizens, which must be provided by the existing national social protection systems in the EU."
"Health services are a public good and the public authorities of each Member State have the crucial task of guaranteeing equal access to all high-quality health services, and of providing adequate public funding."
"We therefore oppose the creation of a liberalised internal market for health services and the current trend of reducing or privatising health services or making them ever more dependent on internal market regulation or on competition rules."
"Health services are services like no other."
"Therefore, under no circumstances must they be subject to the European rules on competition, State aid, public contracts or the internal market."
"Above all, their organisation and funding must be the responsibility of the Member States, and of them alone."
"Despite the predictable rejection of the paragraph calling for services to be made subject to the Bolkestein Directive, we feel that the text of the report is still dangerous."
"It proposes to encourage the mobility of health workers at the risk of creating shortages of those very workers, and thus treatment for all the citizens, in certain countries; or to encourage, with no controls, patient mobility, which may undermine the quality of treatment, lead to the saturation of infrastructure and compromise the balance of the social protection systems."
"The objective of access for all European citizens to high-quality and community-based health care cannot under any circumstances be achieved by a European directive based on the case-law of the European Court of Justice, ruling on a few contentious cross-border issues."
"In actual fact, this objective can only be achieved if there is a guarantee that Brussels will never be able to legislate in this field."
"in writing. I voted against this report, as amended, because I believe it still leaves our national health services at risk from creeping liberalisation and legal uncertainty."
"I welcome Parliament maintaining its position to exclude health services from the scope of the Services Directive."
"However, we are now apparently refusing to set boundaries on the role of the market in relation to the right of Member States to decide on the method, financing and scope of the health services they provide."
"Unless we adopt a clear legislative framework, preferably backed by a Treaty change, we are actively encouraging the Court of Justice to decide what is, or is not, a medical treatment and whether or not it should be reimbursed or require prior authorisation."
"As the Rapporteur on Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems, I wish to make it clear to some in this House that the reimbursement situation is not a new system: it has been in place for over 30 years and has proved invaluable to thousands of citizens but its scope and workings should be determined by Parliament and Government - not the Court, so I regret the adoption of amendment 24 from the Liberals."
"in writing. - (FR) This report shows the will to bypass the content of the Services Directive, which legitimately excluded health services from its scope."
"Health services are not commercial services but services vital to our ageing populations."
"Health must escape the desires of the ultraliberal vultures and the European federalist ideology that is going to harmonise everything downwards."
"The matter of excluding health services is the responsibility of the Member States and must remain so."
"Next, it is worrying to note that this woolly Lisbon Strategy is still being referred to as a prerequisite when we have known for a long time that it is a symbol of ultra-European inefficiency."
"Furthermore, in view of the differences between our countries, one might say that the universality of a so-called European social model is utopian."
"Finally creating a legal framework in this area amounts to implementing a quasi-internal market in health services or at least to laying the foundations for one."
"Our duty is to prevent the quality of health services from being jeopardised, to preserve medical ethics and to guarantee strict controls in relation to the authorising and reimbursement of treatment at national and ministerial level."
"The report on the impact of the exclusion of health services from the Bolkenstein Directive, on the pretext of protecting patients and health professionals, promotes the commercialisation and further privatisation of a choice sector for capital, so that it can generate profits for it."
"We MEPs of the Greek Communist Party clearly express our opposition to the Bolkenstein Directive and are fighting with the workers to get it repealed."
"The report takes it as given that national health systems will be inadequate and that health services will not be free."
"That is why it promotes the reduction of health services covered by insurance funds to the lowest common denominator, using the health card as the tool to do so."
"Nomadic employment is proposed for workers and the need for rounded scientific knowledge based on training and the acquisition of skills is underestimated."
"Professionals are also obliged to have indemnity insurance, thereby reducing the obligation of the state to provide medical and care services to a personal responsibility."
"The patient's choice of treatment is also reduced to a personal responsibility, through information networks which replace the state's obligation."
"That is why we MEPs of the Greek Communist Party voted against the report."
"Health is a social commodity and the workers need to extend their fight against its commercialisation by demanding modern, free, national health services run exclusively by the state which meet the workers' contemporary needs."
"in writing. I voted for this report on the consequences of excluding health services from the Services Directive."
"In particular I am pleased that the report asked the Commission to propose ""an appropriate instrument"" to codify the case law of the Court of Justice."
"In spite of the controversy generated by this report, which has been sorted out in time, I feel that the report in its current form reaffirms existing rights and fosters patient mobility. This was precisely the intention."
"Given the particular importance of this issue, the debate must encompass the broad range of different systems in the various EU Member States."
"In any event, the most important thing is to make sure that the facilities opened up by patient mobility are clear and viable."
"Health is one of the issues that the citizens hold most dear and it would be wrong to impose solutions on the Member States by means of Community legislation that would undermine rules on which the citizens and the politicians have agreed."
"Nevertheless this does not stop rules from being introduced to facilitate the use of this facility in a free area such as the EU, where there is a tradition of mobility on various issues."
"I therefore feel that the outcome is a positive one, and favourable to the citizens' interests and rights."
"European policy in the area of healthcare should not confine itself to regulating patient mobility or creating a unified market."
"We must avoid a two-speed policy by means of which anyone who is financially secure can choose to travel to find the best care."
"That undermines social and territorial cohesion and solidarity, and is therefore inappropriate."
"Healthcare - just like other social services of general interest - often forms part of a national structure of social protection which ensures that the citizens' fundamental rights are safeguarded."
"It was for those reasons that this House, last year, decided to exclude health services from the Services Directive."
"We should not undo this today!"
"The text that was approved a moment ago which examines the impact and implications of this exclusion, urges the Commission to develop a suitable instrument to codify jurisprudence in respect of the rights and duties of mobile patients as well as care providers."
"I do not believe that this goes far enough."
"If jurisdiction is taken as the only basis for policy, then this does not do justice to the importance of this area in a social Europe."
"Health is a fundamental right."
"Everyone is entitled to travel to a different country in order to receive the best care."
"Every care provider, as well as the Member States involved, has the duty to place all patients on an equal footing."
"At the time of the vote on the draft Vergnaud report within the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Members from the right supported an amendment aimed at reintroducing health services in the 'Services' Directive."
"By means of this vote, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats broke an earlier compromise with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that protected health services by keeping them outside the scope of the 'Services' Directive."
"Fortunately, the members of the PPE-DE Group decided during the vote in plenary to abide by this compromise, and to respect health care by refusing to make health a commodity."
"At the end of this vote, the will of the Socialists to protect accessible, high-quality and affordable health services for EU citizens triumphed."
"in writing. I very much welcome the fact that, as of next year, agriculture will no longer be the biggest item of expenditure on the EU budget, but the various structural funds will."
"This is a welcome reallocation of resources - provided, of course, that the reallocated money is well spent!"
"And here too, I would give a cautious welcome to the gradual shift within structural funding itself towards developing innovation and enterprise in our less prosperous regions."
"Structural funding must be more than a simple transfer of resources from the more prosperous Member States to the less prosperous ones - if that were all it is, this could be done simply by adjusting budget contributions and rebates."
"Structural funding must bring added value and be a genuine European policy in its own right, helping less prosperous regions rather than Member States, developing transnational linkages and helping ensure that all can benefit from the European single market."
"Bearing in mind that the intention of the report is to contribute to the debate on the future of the EU's cohesion policy, we must point out our disagreement with some significant aspects of the report, as follows:"
"the idea that the granting of funds as part of cohesion policy is conditional on compliance with economic performance criteria established at Community level, as a means of exerting extra pressure on the way in which Member States define their social and economic policies;"
"the establishment of mandatory ceilings on the manner in which structural funds, either at Community level or in the Member States, are to be used, for example 'to earmark at least 20% of the structural funds for promoting R+D+I';"
"promoting the use of the structural funds for financing private investment by means of what are referred to as private-public partnerships;"
"the use of new cohesion indicators, namely employment, the level of disparities in GDP between neighbouring regions, decentralisation and accessibility index, infrastructure and transport provision, the level of research/innovation, education and training activity and the diversity of production, without safeguarding the idea that GDP per capita must continue to be used as the base indicator of eligibility when it comes to EU cohesion policy."
"in writing. (PL) This report rightly emphasises the key role of cohesion policy in supporting the internal market through the commercial and jobs exchange that has arisen through projects that have enjoyed cofinancing by the European Union."
"We should also bear in mind the role played by cohesion policy in increasing the profile of the EU in the eyes of its citizens and growing support for it in regions which have benefited substantially from cohesion policy."
"Encouraging the Commission and the Council to assess whether allocating at least 20% of the structural funds to research, development and innovation is feasible deserves support."
"The proposal to devolve the function of technological initiator to local and regional level also deserves attention, as access to European programmes and assistance will make it easier for enterprises to innovate."
"In her call for greater exposure and publicity for projects supported by the structural funds, Francisca Pleguezuelos Aguilar wants to give our citizens greater awareness of the benefits of cohesion policy."
"The idea of cohesion, which has been with us since the Treaty of Rome, is one of the cornerstones of the EU."
"In a nutshell, the development of some is the development of all."
"History has shown us that cohesion, a tried and trusted concept, is characterised by generosity and realism, both for the Member States that have just joined and for those that have been in the Union for longer."
"I therefore feel, like the rapporteur and most European politicians, that cohesion, as a value, should be promoted and defended."
"I also feel, though, that it needs to be brought up to date."
"Objectives that ten or 15 years ago were excluded from cohesion, on account of more significant shortfalls and differences, are today issues that should definitely be included, in the context of a growing, more competitive economy."
"That being the case, cohesion must promote enhanced competences regarding research and development, on the one hand, and support for the most competitive parts of each area, on the other."
"Cohesion is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it is, more than anything, about investing in deriving the maximum benefit from our differences and about ensuring that the investment is sustainable over a period of time, with a view to harmonious development."
"Mr President, I was pleased to support this own-initiative report on the importance of Structural Funds to EU cohesion, as in Scotland we have vast experience of using the funds to develop our peripheral areas and regenerate our urban centres."
"As the new funds roll out, we have an expertise we are now using across Europe to assist our new colleagues as they set up their programmes, and we of course retain a crucial interest in this topic so I am pleased to see this report gain the majority it has today."
"I commend my colleague David Martin for his all too apposite report, which I will be supporting."
"The EU has a responsibility to ensure that developing countries have the capacity to engage in and benefit from the global economy."
"It is not just about a fairer, more open trading system."
"Despite enormous advances in market access including the 'Everything but Arms' initiative by the Commission, the Least Developed Countries' share of world trade has halved over the last 40 years from 1.9 % to 1 %."
"Aid for trade is necessary to create the conditions and infrastructure to trigger growth, but this aid must be under the control of the recipients themselves to fit within their own national development plans."
"I am delighted that the UK is taking a lead in delivering its share of the EUR 2 billion annual aid for trade budget promised by EU Member States at Gleneagles by 2010."
"We can only eradicate Third World poverty by empowering businesses, particularly those engaged in fair trade, to provide the decent work so desperately needed."
"As far as we are concerned, EU 'aid' cannot, and must not, be considered as part of the 'liberalisation of trade', as the rapporteur would like to see. It must also not be used as 'one of the most effective drivers of economic growth' of the poorest countries."
"This is for two reasons. Firstly, aid is contingent on the appropriateness of these countries' 'internal policies' and a 'real improvement in the capacity for good governance', in the interests of the powerful multinationals in the EU and the USA."
"In other words, conditions are placed on the 'aid'-based development of these countries, which is tantamount to exploiting their inherent structural fragility, following a history of colonialism, for the benefit of EU capital."
"They are forced to produce for export, in particular low added-value products with lower financial return, the price of which does not cover the production costs. This is true of many agricultural products, obliging them to erect customs barriers to block the entry of products from outside."
"Secondly, this guideline establishes a hierarchy between countries, thus deepening still further the gap between the so-called rich and poor countries, with consequences at national level for the EU Member States, and in what are known as third countries ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. As rapporteur I gladly supported my report."
"There were only a handful of amendments submitted to the plenary vote, some of which added to the report or positively changed the language, some however changed the emphasis of the report too much, meaning I was unable to support some of the amendments."
"in writing. - (FR) On the objectives of finally getting the countries of the South out of poverty, we are all agreed - even if the real measures are still not being taken for Black Africa, and by that, I mean the sharing out of water, food, basic medicines and education."
"As a tool for fighting poverty, international trade is necessary, but inadequate."
"It may be adequate in the long term but, as Keynes said: 'in the long term we shall all be dead'."
"Momentum and innovation are therefore required, not least through the invention of a new customs technology of deductible customs duties in the form of a customs credit offered by importers to exporters, to be deducted upon purchase from the economy of the importing country and equal to the sum of the customs duty to which the credit is charged."
"For the countries of the South, this customs credit would be subsidised, along the lines of matching credits and sparing credits, which already exist in international taxation."
"In this way, poor countries would no longer lose the precious revenue from their customs duties."
"As the report correctly says, 'opening up trade is one of the most effective drivers of economic growth, which is indispensable for reducing poverty and promoting pro-poor economic growth and employment and is also an important catalyst for sustainable development worldwide'."
"Of course, it does not follow - and nor is it my view - that all one has to do is open up trade and stable democracies will flourish in free and pluralistic societies."
"That is not the case, as evidenced in the modern era, with China being just one such example."
"Nevertheless, the fact is that there is no such thing as a free, pluralistic and democratic society that is not, in essence, open to trade."
"It is this idea - and not a watered-down or totally illiberal version thereof - that should be at the forefront of the EU's guidelines when it comes to aid for international trade."
"Our undertaking on the world stage should be geared towards opening up the world more and more to trade, without this leading to vulnerable economies and markets being left unprotected."
"In spite of its 'politically correct' language, the report fails to hide the EU's true intentions behind the current Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries."
"What the EU is seeking, with the EPAs, is to achieve as much as it can from the current WTO negotiations, on issues on which it has thus far failed, in other words, to try the back door having failed to get in through the front door."
"It therefore calls for 'the pacing, timing and scope of liberalisation to be gradual and flexible.' It 'highlights the development benefits that the Singapore issues may engender'."
"It 'believes' that 'agreements on investment, competition and government procurement ... could contribute to shared aims of good governance and transparency, creating an environment that should enable greater private-public partnership.' It 'recalls' that 'sound regulatory frameworks are an essential part of any liberalisation process,' as regards services and public services."
"In other words, this is merely a sugar-coated version of the neoliberal agenda."
"What is needed is an entirely different agenda, one that will promote effective cooperation, solidarity, independent development and social justice."
"in writing. Economic Partnership Agreements have been highly divisive and controversial."
"At times it has seemed as though development considerations have not been foremost in the Commission's thinking on EPAs."
"This Parliament report presents a very timely and balanced contribution to the debate and the Rapporteur Robert Sturdy is to be congratulated on his approach to the report."
"Within the limited framework of the WTO rules, the Economic Partnership Agreements can still be - and they must be - an effective instrument for promoting trade and, most importantly, for supporting the creation of infrastructure conducive to trade."
"Against this backdrop, this is a welcome report that sets out its principles clearly and that is underpinned by decent values."
"As regards similar issues discussed in this plenary session, I wish to reaffirm my conviction that the promotion of free, open and fair trade sustains the democratisation of societies and encourages the plurality of social forces."
"This is a further reason for the importance of the partnership agreements."
"in writing. - (FR) The negotiations on the economic partnership agreements will enter a crucial phase, on 1 January 2008, marking the expiry of the current agreements."
"Due to the essential nature of these agreements, I voted in favour of the report, believing that these agreements will enable a new economic and commercial framework to be established that is conducive to the sustainable development of the ACP countries' economies."
"I would emphasise this development dimension: these agreements cannot be reduced to mere free trade agreements under the WTO and must be instruments serving economic and human development."
"Therefore, the EPAs will also be as asymmetric and progressive as possible."
"I voted in favour of Amendments 20 and 28 on the need for the negotiations to take account of the specific circumstances of the overseas regions and territories pursuant to Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty."
"We should in fact examine the interests specific to these territories, consider market access differentiations and make the existing support methods more consistent with those of the ACP countries."
"I should like also to qualify paragraph 13 of the report by pointing out the conclusions adopted by the Council that provide for transitional periods in the provision of EU market access for certain products that are particularly sensitive from the EU's point of view."
"To date, the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) has guaranteed the ACP countries preferential access to the EU market, with lower import tariffs at the EU's borders and better market access."
"This has enabled the developing countries to export their products to the richer European countries more easily."
"This arrangement within the WTO forms a formal exception to the non-discrimination rule of the Most Favoured Nation principle."
"According to the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, this exception is to be lifted by no later than the end of 2007, and to be replaced by individually-negotiated Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)."
"If not, every WTO member would be able to report discrimination."
"This report is right to strike a critical note."
"It is of the essence that the Commission should negotiate the EPAs with due consideration for the level of development of the ACP countries."
"The principle of total liberalisation of the market should not come into play here, because it forms a real threat to them, both socially and economically."
"The report does not, however, take sufficient account of the circumstances on the ground."
"Whether the EPAs will have a positive or negative impact remains to be seen."
"It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the countries in question are not in a hurry to sign these agreements much before the end of 2007."
"If Parliament does not remove the time pressure and is not prepared to persevere with the GSP+ system, I will be unable to vote in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (FR) In line with the Cotonou agreement, the EPAs are not mere free trade agreements under the WTO, but a genuine partnership enabling a new economic and commercial framework to be created in favour of the ACP countries."
"Due to their geographical location, near many ACP countries, the overseas communities are at the heart of these preferential and reciprocal agreements with the ACP countries."
"It is imperative that the particular circumstances of the outermost regions be taken into account in the context of these negotiations, in accordance with Article 299 of the Treaty."
"Special attention must also be paid to the OCTs located near to the ACP countries, in accordance with the association agreements that already link them to the Union, under Article 229(3) of the Treaty."
"We should examine the interests specific to the outermost regions and the OCTs without omitting to involve them as far upstream as possible in the negotiations, so that market access differentiations can be considered and their respective support arrangements coordinated, for the purposes of integrating them more into their regional environments."
"I welcome the adoption of my amendment, which is designed to strike an intelligent balance between the regional integration of these overseas territories and the ties binding them to Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report on the grounds that the steps outlined in it need to be taken as a matter of absolute necessity if this European Union of ours is to be made a political union speaking with one voice to the outside world and hence capable of becoming a global player rather than a lame duck."
"For this, the European Union needs in particular the further development of its own security and defence policy, with joint research, a joint procurement office, shared defence forces capable of acting autonomously, and joint operations funded from the EU's Budget."
"Such a thing is dependent, however, on our acquiring a new regulatory framework in the shape of a new Treaty, and I trust that Mrs Merkel's presence in the chair of the Council, combined with Mr Sarkozy's pragmatism, will make it possible for a decisive step to be taken in the right direction."
"in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats do not think that Mr Brok's report is the right forum in which to debate the Treaty and what it should and should not contain."
"We think that cooperation on foreign policy should be increased, but we do not think it appropriate in this situation to commit ourselves irrevocably to having a common EU foreign minister."
"We therefore chose to abstain on these points."
"'Constitutional Treaty'. It makes strong calls for the Treaty's 'full ratification' (?) and 'entry into force' (?) 'in order to ensure that the Union is ready to face up to the global responsibilities, threats and challenges of today's world', by means of the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy, so they say ..."
"This position adopted by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (encompassing the Portuguese Social Democrats, Conservatives and Socialists) is especially significant given that it is these very political forces that are negotiating the wording of a 'simplified' Treaty, which they tell us is different in content from the 'European Constitution'."
"Let us make sure this is clear."
"Ultimately, how can something be presented as being different when it reaffirms precisely what it is supposed to be different from?"
"This is where the discrepancy lies ..."
"The true intention of the political forces and the economic and financial interests at the root of European capitalist integration is to speed up the militarisation of the EU, in a legal and constitutional framework - within the NATO framework, remember - and this would be established by the so-called 'European Constitution'."
"Hence the 'common' foreign policy of interventionism, with its aggressive approach, in thrall to the ambitions and interests of the large economic and financial groups of the major powers, headed by Germany."
"in writing. (SV) I have voted against Mr Brok's report not only because the rapporteur had chosen to include the issue of the Constitution but also because he raises the issue of whether the EU should have a common foreign minister."
"At present, we have no ministerial functions within the EU, and nor should we have."
"All the Member States already have their own foreign ministers."
"What can we expect next: a common minister for the environment and perhaps, in the end, a common prime minister?"
"in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports much of this resolution, in particular the high priority given to the consolidation of democracy, promotion of human rights and non-proliferation, and the important EU role in conflict prevention and building effective multilateralism."
"However, the resolution focuses too much attention on internal procedural changes rather than foreign policy priorities."
"The EPLP voted against paragraphs 1, 5 and 11, and abstained on 2, 3, 4 and 5, as the references to the Constitutional Treaty and the detailed provisions within are inappropriate whilst its future is still being discussed."
"In particular, the adoption of the Constitutional Treaty should not be seen as a prerequisite for future enlargement."
"The EPLP also abstained on paragraph 8(g), as the added value of an EU diplomatic academy has yet to be proven, and on paragraph 8(h) - whilst agreeing that there is certainly a need for external delegations to be strengthened, these will not be EU 'embassies'."
"The EPLP fully supports reform of the UN Security Council and also supports improvements in the way that the EU speaks at the UN - however it is inappropriate to talk of a single EU seat, as in paragraph 10."
"in writing. (CS) Mr Brok's report exposes the threadbare nature of the EU's common foreign and security policy."
"On the one hand, it calls for the EU to be more closely involved in the conflicts in the Caucasus and Transnistria, and therefore opposes the emergence of states in these areas and international recognition for them."
"On the other hand, it attempts to breach the incomplete Resolution 1244 and to declare the 'controlled independence of Kosovo'."
"The author, alongside Mrs Beer from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has accordingly chosen to reopen the can of worms of territorial change in Europe."
"I am curious to know when the call will go up for Catalonia, the Basque country or even Galicia to be separated from Spain and when the voices of the separatists in Slovakia, Romania and Serbia will be heard."
"What indeed will we do about the demand to break up Macedonia (or should that still be FYROM)?"
"Has an example been set for the relatively compact Muslim communities in some parts of southern France, or perhaps for the migrants concentrated in the large cities of Western Europe?"
"Similarly counterproductive is the fear expressed in Article 25 concerning the first trials of an anti-satellite defence mechanism in China."
"We do not have similar fears about the United States."
"Unfortunately there are so many similarly unacceptable parts of this report that neither I nor my parliamentary group will be supporting it in the final vote."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of Elmar Brok's report on the Council Annual Report to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices facing the CFSP, including the financial repercussions on the overall budget of the European Communities for 2005 (paragraph 40(H) of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999)."
"Mr Brok's report rightly underlines that without a constitutional treaty, the European Union will not be in a position to face the main challenges that the common foreign and security policy currently poses."
"Appointing a Foreign Minister who is also a member of the Commission and who also heads the Council of Foreign Ministers will allow the EU to act more effectively and robustly in the international sphere."
"The sum of EUR 1 740 million allocated for common foreign and security policy for 2007-2013 is inadequate for the EU's ambitions to be an international player."
"The report correctly notes the need to bolster the role of the European Parliament in the common foreign and security policy and the Council should not be limited to simply informing Parliament but primarily to fully involve it in the main choices and activities of the common foreign and security policy."
"in writing. I voted for this report and in particular am pleased that it emphasises the need for internal setting of external priorities, for example the fight against poverty, in order to have a common European voice in international affairs."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, Elmar Brok's report on the main aspects and fundamental choices facing the CFSP highlights the merits of the case well."
"Without a constitutional treaty, it will be impossible to speak of a common foreign and security policy that is capable of meeting the challenges faced by the European community."
"In addition, the report correctly defines the areas of interest for the EU on which we need to concentrate, including the fight against terrorism, immigration, energy security and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"The report is balanced and all the accents are in the right places, which is why I fully support its adoption."
"The annual report proposes strengthening the military and political sector of the CFSP to the tune of EUR 1.8 million, which is three times the expenditure for the period 2007-2013, in order to step up the EU's aggressive policy, so that it can claim a greater share of the spoils for the Euro-unifying monopolies from the imperialist interventions under way against the peoples."
"It restores the adoption of the European Constitution, which is 'dead' following the referenda in France and the Netherlands, as the necessary tool for promoting the CFSP."
"In order to implement the imperialist views and remove possible obstacles, it proposes abolishing unanimity and the application of qualified majority voting, so that the ruling imperialist powers can further their plans."
"In order to prepare and implement new interventions in the name of combating terrorism, of 'restoring democracy' and other pretexts, it promotes further militarisation, the completion of the formation of battle groups and the preparation of military occupying forces in Kosovo to replace the NATO forces."
"There is no reference to ballistic-missile defence, which indirectly but clearly proves it is being accepted through ΝΑΤΟ and the ΕU itself."
"It proposes increased funding, basically calling on European workers to pay for the EU's aggressive policy."
"We voted against the report on the CFSP."
"(DE) Mr President, I endorse the demands made in this report, particularly for the introduction of a minimum wage in all the Member States, which will be a safety net and is particularly calculated to protect those who are in work from exploitation and poverty, while also, at the same time, safeguarding competitiveness and preventing the loss of jobs in countries like Austria, which have higher standards of social protection."
"I am also in favour of the introduction of a quality mark for products from third countries that are manufactured under proper conditions and without the use of child labour; it would be an invitation to consumers to ensure, by purchasing such products, that humane and fair working conditions prevail in third countries and that jobs here are not wiped out by the import of cheap goods."
"(MT) Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I wished to explain that when it comes to work, and to decent work in particular, our Constitution is wholly based on work."
"I also wanted to make it clear that, throughout the years, Labour governments have always sought to improve conditions in the workplace for our country's labour force."
"It is important to note that whenever there has been a case where an employee has improved the quality of his job conditions, this was down to the initiative of Labour governments."
"I would also like to praise the unions in Malta, especially the General Workers' Union, for their hard work and efforts in the interests of Maltese workers."
"Thank you."
"in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament voted in favour of the report."
"The report is a good one, and we unreservedly support the EU's commitment to decent work."
"It is important for us to be able to guarantee people productive work, done under free, fair and safe conditions, both within the EU and internationally."
"We wish, however, to offer a number of clarifications."
"It is important to point out that a tax on financial and currency transactions must be international because a European tax would place countries outside the euro zone at a disadvantage."
"We are opposed to common standard definitions of the concepts of forced labour and abuse of vulnerability."
"The International Labour Organisation's definitions should be taken as basic, and further definitions should be left to the Member States."
"The report calls on the Member States to consider minimum wages."
"That is something we have already done in Sweden, and we have actively chosen a solution in which the matter is left to the social partners."
"in writing. - (FR) This report by the European Parliament is a step in the right direction."
"It makes decent work a tool of European development policy, firstly by cofinancing, with the ILO, a development programme for decent work, and secondly by creating a European label and a blacklist of companies that violate fundamental labour standards, and lastly by implementing trade sanctions against countries that seriously infringe fundamental social rights."
"It brings about progress for decent work in Europe, where much also remains to be done: by urging the Member States to ratify the ILO conventions on the health and safety of workers, maternity protection and migrant workers; by calling for the introduction of a minimum wage as a safety net to prevent workers from being exploited in any way; by improving access to lifelong learning and by calling for greater harmonisation of pension schemes."
"These are the foundations of this social Europe that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants to build."
"I shall therefore vote in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report on promoting decent work for all."
"The notion of 'decent work' seems to be a reference to the terms of multilateral declarations and agreements, but policies, for their part, are still far removed from the concept."
"Presentations and declarations are one thing; the everyday political actions and decisions of international institutions are quite something else."
"Indeed, the world is marked by a 'deficit' in decent work: in many unproductive and low-quality jobs that involve dangerous work for a precarious income, rights are flouted and inequality between the sexes prevails."
"Faced with this situation, the WTO and the ILO have adopted international labour standards."
"However, the IMF and the World Bank do not support any initiatives designed to ensure that the fundamental rights of workers are respected."
"If decent work is to become a reality worldwide, priority must be given to it by all the international institutions, which will have to work together to make this happen."
"Decent work must be a universal objective for all the international institutions."
"It is imperative that these fundamentals - quality employment, workers' rights, protection and social dialogue - determine all economic and social policies at international level."
"(The explanation of vote was abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I voted in favour of the Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou report on promoting decent work for all, because productive labour in conditions of freedom, equality, security and dignity should lie at the heart of EU trade relations."
"I feel we should demand that our partners comply with the International Labour Organisation's conventions on workers' rights, with regard to fair salaries and adequate social protection."
"I should also like to highlight the need for multinational companies to assume their social responsibility, either in Europe or anywhere else in the world."
"What happened in the vote on this report was disgraceful."
"The majority in Parliament blocked the adoption of some of the best paragraphs adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the theme of 'Promoting decent work for all - The EU contribution to the implementation of the decent work agenda in the world'."
"This position needs to be highlighted because it is clear that it is intrinsically linked with the increasing emphasis on so-called flexicurity."
"As we know, between 2000 and 2005 unemployment rose by one million in the EU, alongside a massive increase in unstable work: more than 4.7 million workers were on fixed-term contracts and at least 1.1 million found themselves working part time."
"The high number of workers who, despite earning a salary, are living below the poverty line, is also unacceptable."
"The promotion of decent work for all entails ensuring compliance with a progressive labour law, ensuring the dignity of those who work, guaranteeing decent living and working conditions, without any discrimination and inequality."
"This must not be restricted to mere good intentions - it must be matched by practical action."
"in writing. I will be voting for this report despite the Conservatives and Liberals gutting it of its most vital elements, for example deleting 'binding initiatives in corporate social responsibility', the need to introduce a 'fair and innovative tax policy' and investigating/listing companies violating core labour standards."
"I am appalled at their anti-labour movement attitudes."
"in writing. UK Conservatives fully support the ILO principle of decent work."
"We agree upon the importance of providing lifelong learning opportunities, the need to be proactive on increasing women's participation in the labour market, and the need to do so much more to resolve the challenges of reconciling work and family life."
"However, we disagree with the idea that the European Parliament should take up its time issuing pronouncements on this subject, however worthy or well-intentioned."
"Parliament does not have the competence to instruct Member States on what to do in this area."
"It is for Member State Governments to decide, and rightly so."
"So, while we have taken part in the debate, and also in the vote to curb the interventionist excesses of the Left, Conservative MEPs abstained on the final vote."
"in writing. I voted for this report and against the Liberal and EPP Amendments which sought to delete the references to binding initiatives on corporate social responsibility."
"CSR should be at the core of European businesses activities both internally within the EU and externally and I was highly disappointed that these two groups did not support the steps outlined in the report."
"in writing. I do not want EU policies to be imposed on national labour market policies."
"The EU proposal and the report debated in plenary of the European Parliament with the misleading title of 'decent work' (COM - 2006 - 0249) are the new reactionary, anti-grassroots framework of the ΕU for achieving the objectives of the 'Lisbon Strategy', minimising the price of labour and striking at the workers' fundamental rights, in order to increase the profits of the Euro-unifying monopoly business groups."
"The basis of the capitalist restructurings processed and formulated in the EU and in the international imperialist organisations and the plutocracy and its political spokesmen on the subject of so-called 'decent work' are being integrated into the anti-grassroots policy of the ΕU. They include the following:"
"lifelong learning, extending flexible forms of employment, striking at collective labour agreements, exacerbating the terms of insurance and retirement and further privatising education, health and public services for the common benefit in general;"
"setting a minimum wage for workers, a poverty-level safety net, in order to prevent reaction from the workers and grass roots, while the plutocracy reaps huge profits from its exploitation of the working class."
"That is why the parliamentary group of the Greek Communist Party voted against this EU proposal."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 13.10 and resumed at 15.00)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Debate on the future of Europe (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the future of Europe, in which we are joined by the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Member of the European Council, Mr Jan Peter Balkenende, whom I welcome most warmly to this House."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Balkenende, it is a great pleasure for me to be able to welcome you, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, to the European Parliament today in order to discuss the future of the European Union."
"Prime Minister, Mr Balkenende, the Kingdom of the Netherlands was not only among the founding members of the European Union, but also, in the course of the past 50 years, played a leading role on repeated occasions, on which it showed a great deal of determination, among those who themselves sought - and supported others who tried - to drive forward the history of our continent and make it an incomparable success story."
"Significant treaties and agreements within the European Union bear the names of cities in the Netherlands; there is the Treaty of Maastricht, whereby the European Union was founded, and the Treaty of Amsterdam, which accorded this House extensive rights of codecision."
"It was, then, all the more a painful experience for us when the citizens of the Netherlands, in a referendum, rejected the draft constitution that contained such significant answers to the questions about Europe's future."
"However, like my fellow Members of this Parliament, and like you, Prime Minister, I am persuaded that the citizens of the Netherlands were not, by this decision, saying 'no' to the European Union itself, or to its worth or to its values."
"This European Parliament very much values your willingness, Prime Minister, to participate in today's debate, above all in view of the fact that now, the cooperation of all 27 Member States is needed to put in place a renewed basis for the European Union, one that will stand the tests that the future will bring."
"The German Presidency of the Council, and the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in particular, is currently engaged in devoting all its energies to finding a solution on which all can agree and which will satisfy everyone, not only those countries that have not ratified the Treaty, but also those 18 Member States, and hence the majority by population of the European Union, which have already done so."
"The European Parliament supports the substance of the Constitutional Treaty, and we want it to become a reality."
"That will involve necessary reforms and will enshrine our common values."
"This House will not under any circumstances be satisfied with a result that is not in the interests of the European Union and of its citizens."
"We are aware, Prime Minister, that the people of the Netherlands, too, have a great interest in making the European Union fit to face the challenges of the future, and in making it possible for shared European solutions to global tasks to be found, and I am convinced that, with good will, we will be able, in the course of the negotiations over the coming weeks and months, not only to reach an accommodation with one another, but also to produce something that will make the European Union democratic, transparent, and effective in action."
"Prime Minister, I now ask you to take the floor and address us."
"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Commissioner Wallström, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, thank you kindly for your invitation to join in your debate on the future of Europe."
"I would also like to express my gratitude for the very useful visit by your President, Mr Poettering, to the Netherlands on 12 April last."
"We very much valued your presence and your contribution to the debate. It was an important visit, and thank you very much again for coming."
"(NL) Mr President, it feels good to be back in your Parliament and I have good memories of our meeting during the Dutch Presidency in 2004."
"We held stimulating debates, which were a great source of inspiration to me at the time."
"Today, however, I am here in a different capacity, as a representative of a Member State - the Netherlands, which is a pro-European country, a country where the overall support for European cooperation has always been - and still is - above the average."
"At the end of 2006, 75% of the people were in favour of EU membership."
"It is a country with an open economy that owes much of its prosperity and employment to the opportunities offered by the internal market."
"A country that wants to play an active role in the world, as is evident from our involvement in development missions in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world, in which respect, the Netherlands relies on cooperation."
"The Netherlands, however, is also one of the two Member States where a clear majority of the people said 'no' to the Constitutional Treaty in 2005, something to which you, Mr President, have made reference."
"I know that a large majority in your Parliament were in favour of the Constitutional Treaty, and I respect that, but whatever verdict one passes on the Constitution, what is now called for is a joint solution, one that is acceptable to us all."
"A solution that does justice to public concerns which came to the surface in the Netherlands and in France in a very visible way; to concerns that are also felt elsewhere: both in countries that have already ratified the Constitution and countries where no decisions have been taken to date."
"I am persuaded, Mr President, that obstacles can be overcome, because, in terms of future prospects, there is much more that unites us than divides us, and also because we have a firm foundation of shared values and shared interests."
"I would like to start my statement about how I see Europe's future with the idea that the Union is a rare and successful project."
"There is every reason to be proud of what we in Europe have achieved in a combined venture."
"The Europe that was torn apart by huge wars and sharp social contrasts now boasts a model of cooperation and integration that is second to none in the world."
"A model that is typified by balance: a balance between economic dynamism and social harmony; a balance between unity and diversity."
"The European decision-making model does justice to the equality of the Member States, as well as to that of its citizens."
"Europe is a respected world player, and an example to the world."
"What makes it that is our unique form of cooperation, our focus on solidarity, and our capacity for commitment, united by values and dialogue rather than by battle."
"Europe has been renewed in the space of 50 years, which, in terms of world history, is a short period of time."
"Europe is a young, but adult structure, with a bright future ahead."
"Step by step, we are facing new challenges, building on our achievements, but always with a keen eye on the public's expectations and concerns."
"One of the main objectives of the new Dutch Cabinet is to further reinforce the support base for European cooperation."
"If we are to do this, we have to find out exactly why nearly 62% of our population rejected the Constitutional Treaty, and to find the right response to that."
"I would first of all like to sketch the background to the Dutch 'no' before I go into the detail of what the Netherlands expect of the negotiations for a new Treaty."
"Much has changed in the 50 years that separate the Treaty of Rome and the Declaration of Berlin."
"The Union of today is not only many times bigger than the Community of the Six in those days; it also has a much larger sphere of activity."
"The enlargement is a historic success."
"It was the right decision."
"We have to realise, though, that following the recent major enlargement, the public need time to adjust."
"It all went very quickly - for some, too quickly."
"The feeling of reciprocal affinity has to grow."
"In addition to considerable growth, the Union has also experienced an enormous deepening in the past 15 years: the completion of the internal market, open borders, the euro, many new policies in important areas such as the environment, security and law."
"These are all positive developments in their own right, and have also brought with them a number of new realities that have become commonplace for the public, but not without any resistance, though."
"For example, the presence of European legislation in many areas is often misunderstood."
"At a time when citizens had not taken on board the enlargement and deepening, we asked the citizens their opinions about the Constitution."
"The question 'Do you agree with the Constitution for Europe' was understood by many as 'Would you like Europe to assume the character of a state?' or even 'Would you like Europe to eventually take the place of the Dutch national government?', which was, of course, a bridge too far."
"The term 'constitution' has different meanings in different Member States."
"To some, it is symbolic of democracy, of the curbing of authority."
"It is that, of course."
"Elsewhere, however - in the Netherlands at any rate - the word 'constitution' has a totally different connotation or meaning still."
"A constitution belongs to a national state."
"A constitution says something about national identity - hence the Dutch suggestion of a new Treaty not being a constitution."
"The symbolism of a constitution was a major factor in the Dutch saying 'no'."
"There was a sense of loss of control, a fear that our own identity would be lost, but a recognisable and accessible government is precisely what people want."
"People feel there is a limit to what Europe should do. People want control over the areas which we have to tackle jointly in Europe."
"Needless to say, there were other reasons why people voted 'no'."
"There are those according to whom Europe produces too many rules, or does too many things that should be regulated nationally, while others find the administration in Brussels is too lacking in transparency, and concerns about the Dutch financial contribution also played a part."
"There was too little appreciation of the specific added value of European cooperation."
"If you think this through, these issues can, to some extent, be resolved in a new Treaty."
"To another extent, we must be aware of these concerns that very many citizens in the Union have in our day-to-day policy decisions."
"We have made a good start on this in the past two years."
"Subsidiarity and less legislation are at the top of the agenda, not least in Brussels."
"There is more transparency."
"We have a budget that enables us to do what we have to do until 2013."
"We also have the right policy priorities, including climate change and energy policy."
"This, Mr President, honourable Members, we owe to your Parliament, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and the presidents of the European Council, namely, and in chronological order, Mr Blair, Mr Schüssel, Mr Vanhanen and now Mrs Merkel."
"It shows that Europe is prepared to prioritise matters that occupy the minds of the citizens."
"Before I turn to the things that the Netherlands hopes to find in a new Treaty, I should like to make a point."
"A referendum was held in four Member States, which produced two yes's and two no's."
"In total, 18 Member States approved the Constitutional Treaty via their own democratic process."
"The Constitutional Treaty was widely supported in your Parliament."
"There is no two ways about it."
"I hope, though, that we will be able to concentrate on what unites us, rather than on what divides us."
"The Dutch Cabinet seeks to find a joint solution in a constructive manner."
"This is, with a view to Europe's future, very much called for."
"The points on which the Netherlands focuses are directly related to public concerns that have surfaced over the past two years."
"No more, no less."
"This is to gather the necessary support for ratification of the new Treaty."
"In this light there are, I think, irrespective of the specific requirements of institutions and Member States, two major joint ambitions regarding the new Treaty."
"In the first instance, we want to improve Europe's democratic functioning."
"Secondly, we seek to enhance Europe's decisiveness."
"Europe's challenge has always been to set up the institutions in such a way as to ensure that as much justice as possible is done to both - at times - conflicting objectives."
"The institutional balance which the Convention and the previous IGC worked out offers improvements, both in terms of democratic content and power."
"The Netherlands is keen to retain these improvements, provided that agreement on this can go hand in hand with a credible way of dealing with the citizens' areas of concern."
"I will outline what the Netherlands faces in order to reach a solution jointly in four points."
"First of all, the successful method of changing the Treaty must be continued: improving Europe step by step, with a view to striking a balance."
"As I said earlier, the symbolism of a constitution plays an important role in the 'no', and this is why the Netherlands has argued in favour of a change to the treaty, as was the case with Amsterdam and Nice."
"This is following in the footsteps of the Monnet method: small steps forward, with concrete meaning."
"It turns the spotlight to the improvements, the democratic guarantees and increased decisiveness."
"This is how we can have a positive debate, and move forward from under the shadow of the rejected Constitution."
"In short: the name, the form, as well as the content that determine the image of a constitution require reconsideration."
"Secondly, the Netherlands sets great store by improving the Union's democratic functioning."
"A very important lesson we need to take away from the referendum is that the Dutch want to be certain that they have a say in the decision-making process."
"They want their voice heard in Europe."
"The institutional proposals of the Constitutional Treaty are a step in the right direction."
"The rule that the European Parliament always codecides when the Council takes decisions by majority is a case in point."
"Improvements are possible, though."
"In the case of the subsidiarity test for European legislative proposals, national parliaments should be accorded a more important role."
"If national parliaments pass a negative verdict by majority, this should have consequences."
"More involvement of the national parliaments should not be at the expense of the European Parliament."
"This test is done in the very first phase of decision-making."
"A verdict on subsidiarity is very much something for national parliaments to pass."
"The European Parliament retains its full role in the codecision procedure."
"The Commission's right to initiative is infringed upon."
"As you, Mr President, told me recently, the European Parliament and the national parliaments complement each other."
"Like democratic partners."
"This brings me to my third point: in addition to becoming more democratic, Europe must, and indeed can, become more decisive."
"I am referring to today's important topics that concern the public, when I say this: climate change, energy policy, the fight against terrorism and migration require a pro-active, joint approach."
"The Constitutional Treaty contains valuable improvements, with more majority decision-making."
"We cannot get around the fact, though, that people are reluctant to give up vetoes, and are frightened about a creeping increase in powers."
"This is why we must be quite clear."
"There is no power without support."
"Where necessary, we must, therefore, dare take the step towards majority decision-making."
"And I am prepared to stand up for those choices, provided that the transfer of sovereignty is a conscious choice, safeguarded by proper guarantees."
"The Union's powers must be clearly defined."
"Only then can we ease the hesitation surrounding the transfer of sovereignty."
"The Netherlands will be tabling proposals to this effect."
"A particular point that is related to this has also been the subject of intense debate in your Parliament. I am talking about the relationship between the internal market on the one hand and the freedom of movement on the part of the Member States when shaping their public services on the other."
"More clarity can be injected there as well, without taking anything away from the internal market."
"I am in favour of a strong internal market, as the citizens of all Member States stand to benefit from it."
"In matters such as the pension system, social security and education, however, the Member States seek to tailor these to the national situation."
"Europe should allow for this, for example, by laying down a number of criteria for services of general interest."
"This brings me to my fourth and final point."
"I think it is a good thing that the enlargement criteria are included in the new Treaty."
"We have had the collective wisdom to enlarge the Union and I stand four-square behind that decision."
"It says something about Europe's future and the change following the divided Europe dating back to after the Second World War."
"Nobody can deny the fact, though, that there is also doubt about the enlargement among the public."
"In the Netherlands, there is the perception that the Union does not take its own rules seriously, or not seriously enough."
"We may have the criteria, but these are not strictly followed in the eyes of the Dutch people."
"As this is something that affects public support for Europe, it is necessary to include the criteria in the new Treaty."
"Mr President, honourable Members, Europe has come a long way in 50 years."
"Expectations are running high."
"Together, we can set the tone when tackling climate change, the fight against poverty and insecurity in the world."
"Together, we can use Europe's economic potential in an ever more integrated world economy."
"Together, we must commit to a reliable supply of energy and raw materials."
"Together, we must fight the degrading spread of illegal migration, which is why we need a strong and decisive European Union, a Union that enjoys the trust of those who live in it."
"In the Netherlands, I will not hesitate to stand up for a treaty that comprises the four elements that I have just outlined - because I believe that the time is right for this, because I have great confidence in the Presidencies of Mrs Merkel and Mr Socrates after her, and because I believe that together we can take the next step, but above all, because this Treaty is needed to face up to today's challenges together."
"I recently came across the words of Robert Schuman, one of our visionary founding fathers, and I was once again struck by how wise and true they were."
"In his declaration of 9 May 1950, he said - and I quote - 'Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan."
"It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity'."
"I think that Mr Schuman's words are as current as ever, and can be guiding in our joint task to develop Europe further."
"Thank you very much."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Balkenende, I would like to thank you for your speech and, most of all, for what we hope is your firm determination that we should, together arrive at a good solution."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I should like to thank you, Prime Minister Balkenende, for the perspective on Europe that you have given us today, a perspective that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats very much shares."
"(Protests)"
"I see that those who are interrupting me have a very good perspective and that they listened carefully to Mr Prodi yesterday: he was ready to part with the flag, you have brought us yours today ..."
"This is a very good image and a very good example!"
"Europe means, of course, a currency, a great market, the opening up of borders and student exchanges, but, above all, Europe is the ideals, principles and values that are the envy of the entire world."
"Europe is traditions, a civilisation, but it is also the adaptation to new realities; it is a certain idea of globalisation, of the reforms aimed at creating a fairer society."
"Europe is not about maintaining the status quo; it is about movement and progress."
"Mr Balkenende, you are the Prime Minister of the country that is perhaps most open to the European spirit, I am not afraid to say, a country in which tolerance and solidarity are the driving force of social cohesion."
"Seventy-two per cent of your fellow citizens have come out in favour of European integration, when the European average is around 53%."
"However, the people of the Netherlands, like the people of France, rejected the Treaty in 2005."
"This certainly means that, as far as the great majority of them are concerned, Europe is not legitimate enough, not credible enough, and not effective enough."
"It certainly means that they regard the actions of the European Union as being too far removed from their everyday lives."
"We must learn lessons from these judgments, even if we do not share this opinion, which is often too critical."
"I shall not go back over the merits of European integration, as we are very clear about them."
"However, we must convince Europeans that our common project is not only beneficial, but also absolutely crucial."
"The draft treaty contained most of the answers to our fellow citizens' questions and dissatisfactions."
"We therefore need to take up the best parts of this treaty, namely parts 1 and 2."
"What Europeans are expecting from us is a better life, is Europe affirming its values in the world, as it has just done in Moscow, and as it must do more in the Middle East, and in Darfur."
"By putting ourselves in a position to make decisions, both democratic and effective ones, we are satisfying Europeans because we will be able to tackle the real fundamental problems."
"Let us cure Europe of its paralysis, let us provide ourselves with the resources for our political ambitions: the sooner the better, and the 2009 European elections is the most opportune time."
"Let us work relentlessly along these lines."
"Prime Minister, you have had the courage to carry out ambitious, long-term reforms in your country."
"You have not given in to the easiest options or to demagogy, and the results are there to see."
"You have carried out these reforms by respecting values, solidarity, open-mindedness and responsibility."
"That is the path that my group calls on Europe, as a whole, to take."
"You mentioned the role of the national parliaments and the need for a clearer division of responsibilities between the Member States and the European Union."
"On that point, too, we can only support you."
"If the national elected representatives of our countries do not take hold of European affairs - which no longer come under foreign affairs, but national affairs - if our national fellow Members do not seize the European dimension of our major issues, then the road will be even longer and more difficult."
"Who does what?"
"Who is responsible for which policy?"
"The citizens want to know!"
"Such clarification will prevent the ministers from putting the blame on Brussels, and we will deprive ourselves of an overly facile national alibi."
"You also raised the issue of European enlargement, Mr Balkenende."
"On this point, too, we must be clear."
"Europe can no longer let in new members until it has resolved its internal problems."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our immediate priority, and that of our governments, must be to reach an agreement among the 27, as quickly as possible, on the institutions."
"Mrs Merkel has created the necessary dynamic and, in spite of the dramatic gestures, both sides' positions are coming into line with each other."
"Let us seize this opportunity and let us reach an agreement among the 27 on the key issues, namely Europeans' rights and the decision-making process."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I shall begin by commenting on something we have just heard."
"You said, Prime Minister, that your government is in favour of a legal framework for services."
"Thank you very much for that; now perhaps you can say that to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to whom you have close links, who, this morning, rejected that very idea."
"I would like, Prime Minister, to refer to two of the observations you made, and which I see as the most important things you said in your speech."
"'I hope that we can concentrate on what unites us and not on what divides us.'"
"That was an encouraging thing to say."
"Until then, we had been under the impression that the Netherlands was focusing on what divides us rather than on what unites us."
"If that is meant to be an announcement to the effect that you and your government are willing to make compromises rather than insisting that the Dutch 'no' must result in fundamental change in Europe, if it is meant to mean that the Dutch 'no' means that the Constitution will not enter into force in its present form, but instead in some other, with some other comprehensive reform that will make the European Union more efficient, and that you, to that end, are prepared to make compromises and then defend them at home, then that, Mr Balkenende, was a good speech."
"(Applause)"
"By it, then, we will judge you, for I was in Rome, where we met, and where I saw you sign the Constitution with a golden pen."
"As you know, I keep a watchful eye on Dutch domestic politics."
"Compared with the other battles you have had to endure in the Netherlands, the battle for the constitution was - if I may put it that way - a rather restrained one."
"Nobody will regret it if you land more punches in future."
"Europe must learn to land more punches, but it will not do that on the basis on Nice or of 'Nice minus'; that will not make Europe a better fighter, but rather less able to take the action that needs to be taken in such situations as that in the Middle East, where, it is worth remembering, 13 000 European troops are stationed on the border between Lebanon and Israel in pursuance of the UNIFIL mandate, and I ask you also to think of the Gaza Strip in Palestine, where we are in the thick of the chaos, and where the place is getting like Somalia."
"Why is Europe not represented there by a foreign minister who could get something done?"
"It is because of the unanimity rule in the Council, which is preventing Europe from taking action."
"(Applause)"
"I have nothing against Calvinistic self-denial."
"I gather that you want no more flags, no anthem, and no foreign minister."
"Good: Beethoven's symphonies have survived revolutions and wars; they will outlive the European Constitution too."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) As the President of our Parliament introduced this debate in Dutch, I, too, Prime Minister, should like speak a few words in it."
"If, in future, the Foreign Affairs Minister is called the High Representative of Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands, then I have no problem with that, provided that he does his job."
"(DE) What is crucial is not what he is called, but rather what he is meant to do."
"(Applause)"
"I am a great admirer of the Dutch people; the Netherlands is a wonderful country with a great tradition, a country with a tradition of seafaring, and seafarers have always been courageous people."
"It was Dutch people who first sailed round Cape Horn and gave it its name."
"I, for one, get the feeling that they have today embarked on a ship and set the sails."
"Mr Goebbels has already pulled the flag down to half mast."
"I am less sceptical;"
"I get the impression that you, today, have hoisted the flag halfway up again, so I urge you to hoist it all the way up, and I can promise you that this House will put wind in your sails, so that then, Mr Balkenende, you will be sailing towards a compromise."
"Yesterday saw Mr Prodi expressing his own willingness to compromise; he is completely in favour of the Constitution."
"If you want half a constitution and you and he can meet one another halfway, we will end up with three-quarters of it, and a 75% constitution would be the Constitution without the anthem, without the flag and with a foreign minister called by another title."
"It would be a good result."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, yesterday, in this Chamber, one of Europe's great champions sketched his vision of a Union fit for the 21st century - a Union that is democratic, transparent and, above all, effective."
"However, crossing that Rubicon requires firm leadership, Mr Balkenende."
"The German Presidency has shown its strength by uniting Member States under the banner of the Berlin Declaration."
"It must pull them together again in the weeks before the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference which follows if we are to win the war of public opinion and unite around a revised Treaty."
"The stakes are high."
"Your Foreign Minister, Mr Verhagen, said: 'In today's globalised world people are afraid of losing their jobs, their social security, their quality of life'."
"Yet that is not an argument for less Europe, indeed, it may well be an argument for more Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Europe cannot secure its energy supply, combat climate change or tackle terrorism with a retreat into unilateralism."
"You, of all people, should know that, Mr Balkenende."
"For history teaches us that the Netherlands' golden years - as the wealthiest nation in the 17th-century world - came from uniting the seven provinces, not dividing them."
"You must convince your citizens that unity and prosperity are inseparable; that inability to make progress on political integration means Europe will lose its place as a global standard-setter and end up at the mercy of powers like Russia with its belligerent energy policy."
"To take key decisions on jobs, security and quality of life, the Union needs an end to unscrupulous use of national vetoes."
"To address the democratic deficit, it needs greater democratic accountability."
"To maintain its international prestige and internal effectiveness, its institutions must change with the times."
"None of this is possible without the substance of what was agreed in the European Convention, and that substance must be maintained, whatever cosmetic surgery you try to effect on the surface."
"We are not just talking about ideology here: we are talking about people's jobs, their quality of life and their long-term prospects."
"It is time that you, and others like you, retook the initiative and brought Europe back to their people."
"Nobody here is seeking a European superstate - diversity of customs, history and language will ensure that."
"However, we are seeking a European 'superpeople', a united people."
"Too often our heads of government have taken the advice of the English Conservative Prime Minister Arthur Bonar Law when he exclaimed: 'I must follow them;"
"I am their leader'."
"But populism cannot move Europe forward, nor cement our quality of life, international influence or economic strength - only solidarity can do that."
"When concerns over the so-called symbols of a superstate - like flags or anthems -supersede debate on real issues, then it is time for a change of strategy."
"(Applause)"
"Your public demands energy security; it demands a European environment policy; it demands common action on migration."
"From the new Treaty, they will get it, for the tools are already in the text."
"So sell that to your people, instead of sidestepping the issues."
"Stop letting the tail wag the dog, and lead the Netherlands back to the heart of European decision-making, as befits the founder status of your country in our Union."
"In conclusion, Prime Minister, I would say, do as your countryman Justus Lipsius advised: be stoical in adversity, embrace necessity and be constant in your faith in Europe."
"For your people's peace, prosperity and security depend upon it."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his presentation today."
"I was struck by the ideals of compromise and consensus contained within his speech."
"Particularly when we look forward to Europe's future, it is a Europe that has to be based on consensus, because, as Mr Daul said earlier on, if Europe means anything, Europe means equality."
"Europe means equality between nations, between peoples, between cultures."
"Europe means equality between all people within the European Union."
"That means that you cannot drive a coach-and-four and force everybody down the same path."
"It makes it more difficult to find agreement, yes, but it is still the best way of finding agreement."
"What we heard yesterday from Mr Prodi was not the new way forward, it was a threat: a threat that we will create a two-speed Europe for those who are with us and those who are against us, words more reminiscent of George W. Bush than of a European statesman."
"I am convinced that the future development of European policy and European ideals will not come from telling people to look at the great opportunities they have lost, to look at the things that they have thrown away."
"It will come by us convincing people that this is the best way forward, that this is the best path to follow."
"Many here have mentioned issues such as climate change, pension security, energy security and others. Yes, Europe can play a role and Europe can do things that are positive."
"Likewise, with regard to immigration and our own internal security, we can do things in a cooperative and consensual way that can achieve good."
"We have already done that, but there are still things that are best left to Member States, things that require unanimous agreement in the Council, not qualified majority all of the time."
"I think it is wrong, and I use this opportunity to point this out again."
"Commissioner Kovács and others are coming forward with proposals for harmonisation of taxes that they do not have the power to implement under the present Treaties and which the new Treaty would not give them the power to implement, and yet they continue to do it."
"Why?"
"Because it is ideologically driven."
"It is a political move and one that is driving people further and further away."
"If officialdom can ignore the rules, why should we not ignore them too?"
"George Bernard Shaw once said that some men see things as they are, and wonder, 'Why?'."
"We should dream things as they should be, and say, 'Why not?'."
"Consensus, compromise, cooperation - yes, that is the way forward, but most importantly of all, we must convince the people that it is the right way forward."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, my group would also like to extend a warm welcome to Prime Minister Balkenende and thank him for accepting the invitation."
"In the Netherlands, the new Cabinet has just spent 100 days talking with the public, but it was 500 days ago that we last heard anything said about Europe."
"Just as well that this came to an end."
"The question is, of course, whether people have actually been listened to."
"You seem to have been shopping selectively."
"With regard to your interpretation of the 'no', you only mention those objections to the Constitution that lead to a less ambitious Treaty, in other words, to fewer changes."
"This is a very bizarre way of thinking."
"Do you really believe that people have voted against the European Treaty because they are so satisfied with the current European Union?"
"Do you also think that the flag and the national anthem really are the biggest problem?"
"According to 80%, not least of the 'no' voters in the Netherlands, the negotiations should be seized as an opportunity to carry out more thorough reforms and to continue the democratisation process in Europe."
"Sixty-eight percent of the people also want a real European foreign and security policy."
"There is no mention of this more far-reaching democratic ambition anywhere in your proposals, though."
"You also want to scrap the Foreign Affairs Minister."
"You only want less, and you present this as an inevitable development."
"This situation is comparable to that of an unsatisfied customer who goes back to the bicycle shop and says 'fine, you can swap the bike, but only for a scooter'."
"I will not settle for a scooter, though; all I want is a better bike."
"One with brakes, that would do."
"After all, not all decisions should be taken in Brussels, and it is a good thing to demarcate national and European powers better."
"Brakes only make sense, though, if there are pedals."
"You claim that people want more control, but this seems to be in conflict with your commitment to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"You did not make reference to it on this occasion, but I have a hard copy somewhere of the debate in the Dutch national parliament, when you said: 'In the case of the Treaty being changed without any constitutional pretensions, the text of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights should not need to be included in its entirety'."
"Surely this is a bizarre interpretation of the 'no'!"
"There will not be many people who have voted against the constitution because this would have entitled them to more rights."
"(Applause)"
"Unlike the ECHR, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights also contains social fundamental rights, which can put up a barrier against anti-social interventions from Brussels in the welfare state."
"Now that would be a brake that I would think worth having on my bicycle."
"Finally, your real reason to remove the flag, the constitution, the Charter of fundamental rights and the anthems, is purely domestic."
"If the Treaty no longer shows any signs of a constitution, then you will be able to avoid a referendum in the Netherlands."
"We might be able to agree to disagree then."
"My party is quite happy to abandon the idea of a national referendum if you fear that in future, you will end up feeling isolated again."
"Perhaps we might get a European referendum instead, though, in which case you would not be isolated, but would instead, be doing what twenty-first century democracy requires of you."
"I would welcome your comments on this."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, yesterday, the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Prodi, urged the Members of this Parliament to defend in their countries the old draft for a European Constitution and said that this draft already contains so many compromises that it is virtually impossible that there should be any more of them."
"This sort of talk goes down well here, for this is a place where democracy is mainly seen on a large scale and from up above."
"It has transpired that this can really clash with a small-scale democracy from the bottom up, in which many more people feel involved."
"In 2005, the parliaments of the Member States were in favour of this constitution by large majorities."
"In the Netherlands, this figure was even as high as 85%, and in the Netherlands, unlike in France, where only the president decides on such things, it is parliament that decides on the subject of a referendum."
"The referendum was held at the proposal of three parties that were in favour of the constitution and that really believed that the voters thought the same way."
"Despite a high turn-out, 62% voted 'no'."
"It is highly likely that a majority of the voters in Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark would have equally said 'no' had they been given the opportunity."
"Today, the Dutch Prime Minister Mr Balkenende is struggling more than his Italian counterpart did yesterday."
"Earlier this year, the following agreement was reached in the government agreement on behalf of his coalition and at the behest of the voters - and I quote 'attempts are being made to change, and possibly combine, the existing EU treaties in which subsidiarity and democratic control are safeguarded and in which content, size and title are significantly different from the previously rejected Constitutional Treaty'."
"The Dutch Government was right to point out that in the European Union, the national parliaments must be given more voting power and that national decisions on public services should not be distorted."
"This is different from the constitutional text that calls for an ever more far-reaching liberalisation of services and free, unadulterated competition."
"This Parliament, which backed my proposal on 10 May to give the Member States, their regions and their municipalities more freedom in the way in which they organise their public transport should recognise the value of this."
"I would say the following to Prime Minister Balkenende and his government."
"If you receive insufficient support in this Parliament today, this does not mean that you are cut off from Europe."
"You have the difficult task of realising your government agreement."
"There is no reason why you should let others who still hold onto the old constitutional project dictate to you."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, Prime Minister, as a Dutch MEP, I am particularly delighted to see you visiting us here."
"In this House, since the 'no' to the European Constitution in our country, we have talked too much about the Netherlands instead of with the Netherlands."
"Let it be clear that I largely share the Dutch Government's view, yet, even so, I should like to make a few recommendations leading up to the European Council of 21 and 22 June."
"First of all, I appreciate your efforts in respect of the Constitution's aspirations to do such things as introduce the position of a permanent president; such a person would soon develop into a European President, and so I would propose a rota system for three presidencies, each lasting one and a half years, made up of one large, one medium-sized and one small Member State."
"This will avoid the unnecessary concentration of power surrounding one permanent president, and all Member States will retain the prospect of a place in the presidency on an equal basis."
"Prime Minister, I support your wish to include the Copenhagen criteria in the new Treaty."
"It is, however, just as necessary, in this new Treaty, to define once and for all the borders of the European Union, for this is something to which the European Union's citizens, and its neighbours, are entitled."
"I am specifically thinking of offering countries like Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus a prospect of EU membership in the long-term, this in combination with a powerful neighbourhood policy in order to help these countries overcome structural problems."
"I noticed there was some hesitation when you tabled your proposal to give national parliaments the power to veto legislative proposals from the Commission."
"I think it is better to give the European Parliament the power to refuse a proposal from the Commission, in which respect national parliaments can make their concerns known to the European Parliament."
"This route strikes me as purer institutionally and at the same time, it strengthens interparliamentary cooperation between the EP and national parliaments."
"Prime Minister, I should like to hear your thoughts on the points I made."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, Prime Minister, the Dutch electorate rejected the European constitution by a large margin."
"I can only hope that your government will continue to strive for a new Treaty rather than a constitution."
"I also hope that the voters will be given the opportunity to speak out on this, not only in the Netherlands, but in all Member States."
"This debate is not only about the institutional issue, though."
"It is about the future of Europe, thus including the fundamental question about the EU's borders, the question as to whether a non-European country such as Turkey could join."
"When you took over the EU presidency in 2004 and came to the European Parliament for the first time, you said that you would make sure that Turkey met all the Copenhagen criteria."
"Can you, Prime Minister, three years down the line, declare, hand on heart, that you have kept that promise?"
"The Turkish-Armenian publisher Hrant Dink was murdered after he was condemned by the Turkish courts as a criminal."
"Orhan Pamuk, a winner of the Nobel Prize for literature, fled the country after he, too, received threats."
"In Turkish criminal law, it is a crime to insult what is termed 'Turkish identity'."
"Freedom to express opinions is therefore absent."
"I am not even talking about the murder of three Christian publishers and a Catholic priest."
"I could also mention the fact that Turkey still refuses to recognise one of the EU's Member States or fulfil its duty to open up its ports and airports."
"Moreover, the trial of strength that is going on between the Islamists on the one hand and those in favour of the secular state on the other, should cause concern in Europe, but the European Union persists with the negotiations as if nothing was wrong."
"They completely ignore the large majority of the people who are against the accession."
"And whether they like it or not, this arrogance and this detachment from the world are the biggest threat to the EU's continued existence."
"(Applause)"
"- Mr President, one has to ask how much energy has now been wasted on chasing the moonbeam of an EU Constitution."
"In the rarefied atmosphere of this House, an EU Constitution may seem important, but frankly, most of our citizens have moved on and care more about things like good education, a good health service and rising house prices - things a constitution will not change."
"Part of the reason that the EU institutions are stuck in this rut is because of the refusal to take a democratic 'no' for an answer."
"These debates are dominated by siren demands for what is unobtainable and with demands for stratagems to avoid letting the citizens have their say."
"Hence the ploys of a change of title, a slimmed-down text and a total aversion to referenda."
"But rejig it as you might, that which imposes the apparatus of statehood on the EU, with a president and a foreign minister, and that which further savages national sovereignty by promoting even more qualified majority voting, is the same old tired, tarnished product that has already been rejected, and upon which citizens must have their say."
"Desperate as my own government is to welsh on the pledge of a referendum in the United Kingdom, I say the people of each nation-state have a right to have their say."
"Only those lacking in confidence in their own case or with a knavish design to thwart public opinion run away from letting the people decide."
"Prime Minister, you were brought here today - as I am sure you realise - so that the Euro-fanatics of this House could try to pressurise you to depart from the democratic decision made in your own country."
"I trust you will not be so foolish as to allow that to happen."
"Mr President, I am very much obliged to those Members of Parliament who have spoken for their inspiring contributions."
"What I sense in this House - and I would not have expected it to be any other way - is an atmosphere of inspiration, one in which the European ideals are considered in the context of the Europe of the 21st century."
"This is why I was so moved by what Mr Daul said - and this may well be what matters more than anything - about the values that have made Europe what it is today, the values which Europe stands for and the values for which we shoulder responsibility worldwide: peace, security, democracy, human rights and solidarity."
"These have made Europe strong, and that is what we need at the moment."
"This is perhaps where I should like pick up on what Mr Schulz said earlier."
"(DE) It really is very good that we should meet again;"
"I well remember our previous meetings."
"It was really great to discuss things with you, it is so still today, and for that I am very grateful."
"(NL) He spoke about the international aspects, the foreign aspects of the European Union, and I can do no other than endorse what he said."
"We live in a world in which changes are on the way - in China, India and the United States."
"We see changes in the areas of security, the fight against terrorism, the climate issue and energy."
"Europe can do better, work more effectively and speak more with one voice in all these areas."
"Discussion of what the High Representative is to be called can wait until later, but what is important is the content and the message of the values Mr Daul mentioned."
"Let us propagate these, and let us do it together."
"These are issues that say something about our ideals involving the Europe of the future, not only here and on our own continent, but worldwide."
"Mr Daul made a plea for this, which strikes me as appropriate and necessary."
"This brings me to the point Mr Watson made, namely that of energy."
"I should like to repeat what he said in this connection: we cannot do without one another."
"If Europe does not speak with one voice, we will face big problems."
"Energy is not just a matter of its presence, energy is also related to stability."
"Stability involving the supply of energy has an economic, social and ecological dimension."
"We need each other on this level too."
"Listening carefully to what Mr Watson said, which is what I did, I can see a connection between the European ideals, the way in which Europe presents itself to the outside world, foreign policy, and the way in which it tackles specific issues which we advocate, such as the energy issue to which he referred."
"If you think about this long and hard, then Europe faces a huge task."
"I liked the comparison that Mr Watson drew with the Netherlands of the 17th century, the Golden Century."
"An era in which the Netherlands did extremely well worldwide."
"Did all of this come out of nothing?"
"No, it did not."
"In order to achieve this, we had to take action."
"We needed to sail the seven seas and have a sound administrative structure in place."
"Did this happen overnight?"
"No, indeed not; it took time."
"What we did have, though, is determination in terms of wanting to achieve certain things together."
"If this is what you refer to, then you have touched a soft spot in me, because it brings up the question: how do we give shape to the Europe of the 21st century?"
"How can we ensure that Europe can perform in the areas of economy, energy and global relations?"
"The key question today is: are the existing relations adequate?"
"No, they are not."
"The Treaty of Nice is not enough to meet the requirements of the 21st century."
"(Applause)"
"This, of course, begs the question: what is the best way?"
"Then you face the problem that we in Europe have Member States that have approved the constitution, those that have said 'no' and countries that have not yet taken a decision."
"This is the reality."
"The last few years - the time of reflection - have not been in vain."
"I think that we have given answers to the citizens."
"We have said, let us work on the concrete projects in Europe."
"Make it clear to the people how important Europe is, so that Europe can return to people's minds and hearts."
"We have spoken about the process of enlargement."
"Let us turn this into a credible project."
"Let us carefully consider the criteria that have already been tightened up."
"That too is a question of the European project being credible."
"We have said, let us tackle those topics that are so critical to the people in Europe."
"Namely energy and the climate."
"This is also why, together with Tony Blair, I have written a letter to my colleagues to say that we want the topics of climate and energy high on the European agenda."
"They are also matters of concern to you."
"We cannot do without one another."
"Let Europe prove what it can do."
"That is when the period of reflection will come into its own."
"It should not be the case though, and I would like to make this quite clear, that at the end of the period of reflection, we end up with a climate in which one group is pitted against the other, in which the group of the 18 ratifying countries is pitted against those that said 'no'."
"If we were to do this, then we will not resolve the situation."
"It is my sincere conviction that it is possible to find solutions."
"Let us do this in a way with which we can all identify. This is, as I see it, the method of constitutional amendment, as we have done before, a viable route, because it is possible to embrace the sound elements from the Constitutional Treaty."
"Because those elements of an institutional compromise should play a key role."
"Because we cannot leave things the way they are."
"Needless to say, we have to look at the various sections."
"Mrs Buitenweg made a comment on the Charter of fundamental rights, which is very sensitive here, and I can see why."
"If you talk about the Charter, then you can join our camp, because we are equally persuaded of the importance of fundamental rights."
"Except, what do we see?"
"The question is whether all of this should be included in such a Constitution, or if it would be possible to refer to it using different means."
"This is the point."
"So let us discuss the significance of fundamental rights, whilst considering the limitations of a Constitution."
"This is a debate that I should like to enter into with you."
"It is my sincere conviction that we must make haste."
"My dream and ideal is that in June, we will be able to say that we will draw up a well-defined time table to resolve the issues."
"We would like to resolve them within a few years, and that is possible only if we join forces."
"I have made suggestions to this effect in my presentation."
"I argued against a Constitution, but in favour of an amending treaty instead, taking into account the role of the national parliaments without impinging on the role of the European Parliament, because your role is indispensable in Europe."
"I have mentioned these elements, and we must be able to act in unison, to consider what unites us rather than what divides us; that is where Mr Schulz is quite right, and we have to want to strike compromises."
"This applies to us all."
"If we manage to pull it off, then we can make progress; that is my plan."
"I am also doing this with the feeling and conviction that we must make sure we only talk about a 'no' of two countries, because feelings among citizens and concerns are a reality."
"We must answer the questions that are around today."
"If we do this from a position that we want to find a common solution, draw short-term conclusions, check what is needed for this, and I have made a contribution to this, then it is possible to find solutions."
"Indeed, what is unacceptable in a time of further globalisation, of social issues, is that we would be unable to find answers, because the division that was would simply carry on."
"I think we owe it to the founding fathers of the European Union, Adenauer, Schuman, de Gasperi, Monnet and all the others, to hold steadfast to the ideals, and, as Mr Daul said, to keep the value of Europe, the European dream in mind at all times - not to overlook public concerns, but do what has to be done."
"If we draw these conclusions in June, then we will have achieved a great deal."
"For this, we need each other, and I also think that we owe it to the ideals that we seek to achieve."
"Mr President, I was inspired by what you said."
"I will take your words to the Netherlands, and then we shall all have the task of finding solutions quickly, taking into consideration each other's positions, but always considering what we need to keep at the forefront of our minds, namely working on a European dream in the 21st century."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Mr President, Prime Minister, I should first of all like to thank you for coming to Strasbourg."
"The drafting of a new Treaty is in the interests of all of us."
"Now that France and the Netherlands have voted against the draft Constitution, we need, as has already been said, to look for another document, one with which all 27 countries can identify. It goes without saying that the Netherlands has a particular responsibility for making a huge effort in this respect."
"This is why it is useful that you have reminded us of the sensitivities surrounding this issue in the Netherlands, and that you have indicated the direction from which solutions are expected to arrive there."
"Whilst the Netherlands is one of Europe's co-founders and it is still pro-Europe, as is evident from any study, it does not want too much of Europe; it does not want Europe as a super state, or a constitutional set-up."
"The Netherlands likes to see things progress step by step, with due respect for subsidiarity of the Member States, a Europe that is more democratic and more decisive, and can therefore take majority decisions in more areas, and would like to see the enlargement criteria included in the Treaty."
"It is also important to be reminded of the sensitivities and requirements of the other Member States."
"After all, 18 countries have already spoken out in favour of the draft document and value the progress that could have been made by means of the text that was available at the time."
"What matters now, is that we all come up with a fresh treaty document in a short space of time, which is in the interest of us all."
"I was reminded of Paul-Henri Spaak's words; he said: 'Europe still consists solely of small countries."
"The only relevant distinction that remains is that some countries understand this, while others still refuse to acknowledge it.'"
"He said that in the 1950s."
"If this was the case back then, how much more relevant is it now, at a time of globalisation and internationalisation and with huge international issues, for example in the areas of immigration, energy, the environment and the fight against terrorism?"
"You described Europe as a rare and successful project."
"Indeed, it benefits the countries and the people."
"What we could do better together, we should."
"Anything that can be better regulated at national level should continue to be done at national level."
"The discussion is therefore not whether we are for or against Europe, it is about how we, in the short term, and involving all 27 Member States, can put the firmest possible foundation in place for a decisive, transparent Europe."
"The newspaper headlines read: Europe high on Prime Minister's agenda."
"Congratulations on your level of commitment in this matter, both at home and in Europe."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Mr President, I bid Prime Minister Balkenende welcome to the European Parliament."
"Just as, of course, the 'no' in the Netherlands was relatively firm, no less so, too, was the 'yes' from the European Parliament."
"I should like to give you credit for the fact that in your contribution and also in your responses, you tried to venture beyond the 'yes' and 'no' to see how we could come up with a Treaty."
"Not a Treaty of a kind that, I agree with you, has been stripped naked, but a Treaty that gives answers to a number of key issues that we are facing."
"Sometimes, this means that more is needed than what was set down in the original constitution, sometimes less or different."
"I should like to try to move this debate to the next level with a number of very specific questions."
"You said that you support the idea of criteria being put in place for services of general interest, so that countries will be able to regulate their own public housing, health care or other areas more. Are you prepared, via a protocol or in the Treaty, to include a basis for this of some kind, so that a legal basis of some kind is in place?"
"Secondly, you said something about the Charter."
"If I understand correctly, you say you and your colleagues in the Dutch Government agree with the content of the Charter, and would like to see it become binding, but it need not be included in its entirety, as long as there is a document in the new Treaty that safeguards this binding character."
"What I would like to know is whether you have a formula that can make this happen, for, if you do, I share your way of thinking."
"Thirdly, subsidiarity."
"Your plea in the field of subsidiarity is to create more room, to keep at a local level what can be done at a local level."
"Do you have a formula to tighten up subsidiarity, and if so, what is it, compared to the formula included in the draft Constitution?"
"Are you prepared, in this connection, to give the regions more room to experiment?"
"Fourthly, you stated that you would like to abolish a host of vetoes, which will give us in this House an undoubted right of codecision, although that is not what we want in certain areas."
"Are you mainly referring to criminal law?"
"Perhaps you would not mind clarifying again what your formula would be in that respect."
"You also said that 'Foreign Affairs Minister' is not the title we use."
"So what are we supposed to call him?"
"Finally, if the Netherlands opts for a Treaty, and a sound one at that, then I hope that the Prime Minister will blaze a trail in his own country, along with leaders of the other coalition parties, to inform the Dutch people and also get them onboard in good time, so that a real debate can underpin positive support for Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Prime Minister, three elements puzzled and concerned me in your speech."
"Firstly, your determination to keep the three-pillar structure will contribute neither to simplifying nor to making more transparent the system of the Union, nor will it strengthen the capacity of the Union to act effectively."
"Secondly, I was quite unable to understand what you were saying on the issue of clarifying competences and the transfer of sovereignty."
"As we all know, sovereignty cannot be transferred and competences cannot be conferred without the full agreement of 27 Member States."
"Thirdly, your demand that national parliaments should be able to block the Union's legislative process seems to me to be a severe assault not only upon the right of initiative of the Commission, but also upon the legislative prerogatives of the Council and Parliament."
"The setting-up of an effective third legislative chamber would be quite the opposite of simplifying, it would be an abuse of the principle of the separation of powers and it would certainly confuse the public."
"I would be grateful for a single example of where the Tweede Kamer [the Dutch House of Representatives] so far could have raised a complaint about a draft proposal breaching the principle of subsidiarity."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Mr Prime Minister, Mr President."
"The future of Europe is safe."
"The development opportunities of the new countries, accelerated economic growth in old Europe, and ultimately emancipation in international relations are just some examples of the success of integration."
"The European Union works."
"That is why I warn against the hysterical cries of a European Union crisis coming as a result of the problems of the reform of the treaty."
"The 'constitutional treaty or death' approach propounded by Romano Prodi yesterday is a serious mistake, and will bring nothing but tension."
"But even the supporters of this inflexible position are jointly responsible for slowing down negotiations today."
"Dressing up the old treaty in new clothes, or separating it into smaller chunks is a rather cheap ploy."
"I am confident that as the prime minister of a country that rejected the old constitutional treaty, you will be more pragmatic on matters of substantive amendments to the new draft treaty."
"I listened to your speech with Jan Zahradil, the Czech negotiator."
"I would therefore like to say that pragmatism is expected from you not just in Poland, but also in the Czech Republic."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, on the television a few days ago, a young Dutchman said, on being asked about the European Constitution, 'What do we need a Constitution for?"
"This is an economic area.'"
"I found myself wondering how it is possible for a young man in the Netherlands today, in a country that was a founding member of the European Community, was one of the first to embrace the idea of creating a politically united Europe, and had undertaken to overcome nationalism - how it is possible for such a young man not to know that this is a political union?"
"To that question, you have today provided me with the answer; a government that seeks to remove a symbol, to remove a flag, seeks to do away with an idea, to hide it away, to make it disappear."
"Take away the rhetorical flourishes and polite formularies, and your speech today is an ice-cold, nationalist, declaration of war on the idea that that flag symbolises."
"Let us consider the various points in it, the primacy of European law, for one."
"It appears to me from the utterances of your foreign minister that the primacy of European law is no longer to feature in the Treaty, although, at the same time, he does emphasise that the primacy of European law is not to be tampered with, which means that he and you are deceiving your own people and lying to them by not having the Treaty state what the actual nature of this Union is."
"You are trying to conceal it, for the primacy of European law will remain intact, and well you know it."
"You want to go back to regulations rather than laws, but I ask you, Prime Minister, what does that title signify?"
"Law has nothing to do with the nation state; republics have had laws, and laws have been in existence for as long as human beings have."
"It is laws that, when enacted through parliaments, serve as a guarantee to the citizen of democratic legitimacy."
"Prime Minister, having listened to your demands and understood your thinking, I was grateful that you were, firstly, willing to talk to us, and, secondly, did not also want to do away with this House or rename it, for this House embodies supranational democracy in the shape of the federal and political Europe; by its very existence it assures people that they are living as citizens of a political community rather than in an economic organisation or an association of states."
"A constitution has nothing to do with being a nation state; it is the basic law of a political community."
"Not least in the Treaty that we will soon have, there are such things as European citizens, and European citizenship is a real thing; we are here in the parliament of a supranational democracy and of a European citizenry."
"If you take the Charter out of the Treaty, while making it explicitly binding in law, what are you thereby doing?"
"You are engaging in the same old deception, hiding it away from the people, while leaving it effective in law, which means that you accept the reality of Europe where you have to, while nevertheless denying it."
"I have to tell you, Prime Minister, that neither the twenty-first century, nor Europe itself, are going to be won over by a lie."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Voggenhuber, whatever sympathy one might have with your remarks, you ought to be rather more cautious about using words like 'nationalism' and 'lie'."
"(DE) Mr President, your government, Mr Prime Minister, wants the European Constitution to dispense with the symbols of the European Union, with Article I-8 being deleted on the supposed grounds that the blue flag with the twelve golden stars and Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy' are expressions of an identity as a state."
"Is that meant to mean, Mr Prime Minister, that any and every local association may adopt a banner and make it binding under its own articles, but that the EU, with its 500 million people, may not?"
"I hope you will not mind me saying this, but that sort of thinking is both prehistoric and idiotic."
"European integration is an historic project like no other; it is not a state, let alone a superstate, and so it is not least for that reason that it is astonishing that such a dubious idea should originate from a founding member of the Community."
"Let me tell you that those who deny the validity, 50 years on from the signing of the Treaties of Rome, of the universally recognised and familiar symbols of the EU are - symbolically, adding grist to the mills of those who, questioning European integration as such, wish to turn their backs on it and return to their own identities as nation states."
"Surely it is not to be denied that the anthem and the flag bind our states and peoples together; it is because they foster an identity that they need official recognition."
"So, Mr Prime Minister, please do not take the people of Europe for a ride, not even those in your own country who voted 'no', for they, together with the people of my own country and in others, do not want a dispute about banners; what they want is a social and democratic Europe."
"They want an answer to the question as to whether the EU exists to protect people or markets; they want something done about dumping - wage dumping, social dumping and tax dumping, and that is what you should be picking up on, for that is where forward-looking solutions are wanted, so stop shadow-boxing with the symbols of European integration."
"(Applause)"
"(DA) Mr President, Prime Minister, you can be proud of the Dutch people."
"Sixty-two per cent of them voted 'no' - contrary to the advice of the majority of politicians."
"You are now, however, being put under pressure by Germany, where at least 70% of people would vote against the Constitution if they were allowed to vote on it."
"That is, of course, a statement that the Germans are welcome to disprove."
"As an itinerant critic of the Constitution, however, I have not been in any country with more opposition to it."
"People want less interference by the EU and they want the proximity principle genuinely to be applied."
"Even the former German President, Roman Herzog, now warns against over-centralisation and the dismantling of democracy."
"Eighty-four per cent of German laws come from Brussels."
"In Brussels there is, emphatically, no democracy."
"Mr Herzog says that it is doubtful whether the Federal Republic can be called a parliamentary democracy."
"It is that Germany that is now threatening its French and Dutch neighbours and saying: your people were mistaken; you should dress the Constitution up in new clothes and abolish referendums."
"Why do you accept that, Mr Balkenende?"
"Why do you not insist that Germany too consult its electorate before making war on the voters in neighbouring countries?"
"The Dutch negotiators now want the Constitution to be presented a second time - 'presented' being the operative word - so that a referendum can be avoided."
"However, you are not proposing any real and substantial changes to the rejected text, and two years have now gone by without the approval of 80% of the Member States yet being obtained."
"The Constitution is legally dead."
"We should start afresh with new negotiations and a referendum throughout the EU."
"It will then be possible to discuss matters with the German Government."
"(DE) Mr President, like millions of people the length and breadth of Europe, I am astonished by the creativity with which repeated attempts are made to resuscitate the EU constitution, which was formerly believed to be - and indeed pronounced to be - dead."
"In order to secure Brussels a licence to satisfy its evidently insatiable need for more powers, the spectre is conjured up of a European Union that is impotent and increasingly insignificant, but I do not believe that the object and point of the European Union, or indeed of European integration, can be to constantly undermine the Member States' scope for sovereign decision-making."
"Cooperation between governments is surely no less indispensable than the unanimity principle in the core areas of national sovereignty, particularly in foreign, security and defence policy."
"Our people have no need of an EU constitution negotiated secretively in backrooms, endowed with a revised dustjacket and small cosmetic adjustments, ratified by an aloof EU elite and sold as a new product."
"I do not expect the public, across Europe, to fall for that sort of trick with a change of labels."
"What we have to do is to abandon any new EU constitution in favour of a foundational treaty on the cooperation, as equals, of states and peoples secure in their own identities, relying, I believe, on the principle of maximising strength in our dealings with the outside world and freedom at home, as well as laying down a demarcation of powers between the European Union and the Member States that is not susceptible to misinterpretation."
"In all these areas, it will be necessary to let people have their say through the holding of referendums, for there is no doubting the need for weighty conventions such as this sort of foundational treaty to be made subject to a referendum by the people of the EU in the various Member States."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome the Prime Minister and congratulate him on his election success earlier this year."
"As he said, the June Summit will be an important one, and we know that the German Presidency is keen to reach an outline agreement then."
"Agreement will not be easy."
"The stated positions of the Member States continue to vary quite substantially and in these circumstances I believe it would be counterproductive to try to force through the wrong sort of agreement in Brussels."
"You said recently at your bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister that any new amending treaty should not have the characteristics of a constitution."
"I wholeheartedly agree with this view and I believe that this is the view of many millions of people across our continent."
"You also said that you were keen to see the role of national parliaments strengthened."
"I strongly agree with this view too and I hope you will pursue this at the Summit."
"I believe that our citizens need to have assurances that their national parliaments will also play a greater role in scrutinising draft European legislation."
"There remains a tangible disconnection between the European institutions and the people at this time."
"I have often said that I am not hostile to the idea of some solution that would improve the workings of the institutions in dealing with enlargement and which address the alienation people feel about the institutions themselves."
"However, I do not believe this solution is a constitution."
"We should not be seeking greater powers for the centre. Instead, we should be concentrating on policy delivery."
"As you have said, and my party leader David Cameron has also said, there is an urgent need for a greater emphasis on making Europe more competitive, tackling global poverty and dealing with the serious issues of climate change."
"These issues are what people want us to tackle and Member States can do much more to cooperate in these fields."
"I therefore urge the Prime Minister and his fellow heads of government not to get bogged down in institutional and constitutional debate in Brussels."
"Instead, let us begin responding to what people are asking us to do: reforming our economies, tackling global warming and alleviating the crushing poverty that we are seeing now in the developing world."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, unlike some here I am actually quite encouraged by what Mr Balkenende has said."
"Mr Balkenende, you could, after all, have come here and done what some over on that side of the House are urging you to do, and say, 'We said ""no”, end of story."
"Forget it."
"No new Treaty."
"No reform'."
"But you are not."
"You are coming here and saying, 'We said ""no”, but we recognise that 18 countries have said ""yes”, that an overwhelming majority of the European Union wants to go ahead and reform our Union in the way outlined in the Constitutional Treaty'."
"You are saying yes, we will sit down and negotiate a compromise acceptable to all 27 countries, and on top of that you are saying that you want to salvage some of those useful key reforms that are contained in the Constitutional Treaty."
"You do not want to throw away everything in that Treaty, you want to drop some things which gave cause for concern, much of it to do with the presentation and the vocabulary of that draft Treaty, but the substance you are willing to negotiate on and to save."
"I think that is a lesson to the doomsayers, and I am encouraged that a compromise is possible."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Prime Minister Balkenende, you have shown courage to walk into the lion's den in order to clarify the Dutch position."
"I think you came across convincingly - certainly in your first response just now - as you underlined the European calling of the Netherlands."
"With this, a new Treaty is moving closer, and this is important, because we need one, for things are just not going well enough at the moment."
"We need more transparency, more democracy, hence more powers for the European Parliament and, as you quite rightly stated, for the national parliaments."
"Things have to be done more effectively, so that we can really address issues such as climate change, energy policy, immigration and reinforcing Europe's role in the world."
"I can understand the principles and your main issues in those discussions."
"What is called for, in the final analysis, is a pragmatic attitude, for it is in the European and national interest that we find a way out of this impasse."
"Having, as I do, some background knowledge of you as a person, I can say, in response to what was said earlier, that I have every confidence in your ability to do this."
"You are not a nationalist and I also know that you are not lying."
"By way of final comment, you claim that you support the internal market."
"I am pleased that you do, but then you should also put your money where your mouth is."
"If all 27 Member States make exceptions to the internal market, and it is looking this way in the Netherlands, as is evident from the discussions there, then we will be left with no internal market, which would be detrimental to the European consumer and the European economy alike."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr President."
"I have no doubt that both those who support a European Constitution and those who oppose it want to see a stronger Europe."
"The differences lie in opinions as to how to achieve this."
"Just like the majority of people in this Chamber, I believe in the idea of the European Union, but lack of support from society weakens our attempts to turn this idea into a reality."
"We must therefore ask whether adopting the Constitution will help us to obtain the public's support."
"As one of the participants in the European Convention for the drafting of the Constitution, I am not convinced of it."
"We are far from even remotely exploiting the possibilities offered by the existing treaties."
"Prime Minister, the European services market you mentioned can be seen as an example of this."
"And extending the use of the qualified majority voting principle would not have assisted the liberalisation of the services sector - quite the reverse."
"At this period in history it is absolutely vital to achieve mutual comprehension between the Member States and an increased wish for cooperation, based on common values and the idea of the Union, so that the interests of large and small, rich and poor, new and old Member States can be given equal value."
"I admit that this is a difficult task, but without it it will be impossible for the Member States to regain steady support from the public."
"Without this the Union cannot become closer."
"The draft Constitution does not address these challenges."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard many noble ideas about the future of Europe, as well as some that have been less than noble."
"An overhaul of the constitutional framework, particularly in the interests of making it more operable, is certainly needed."
"We should, however, be clear about what it is that we are now offering to the citizens of the Union."
"In this regard, I should like to point out that there are a number of people here in this Chamber who are not interested in the debate on the need for an EU foreign minister."
"They are more interested in why it is that people from other, so-called new Member States still cannot travel freely in the Schengen area even after three years."
"They are amazed that in the much-vaunted Europe of equal rights they are unable to access the labour market in some countries, whilst at the same time capital flows freely in and out of my country."
"Why is it that the bigger Member States have more favourable conditions in certain sectors than the newer, smaller Member States?"
"Why, unlike the citizens of some Member States, can we not travel to the USA without visas?"
"We want to extend the competence of the Union to areas where it is not needed and where, for various reasons, it makes sense to maintain distinctions on the playing field based on the relative strength of the different players."
"It is no wonder that many Europeans often cannot understand our profound debates on the future of Europe."
"(SV) In the summer of 1787, a number of people in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania sat down and devised a Constitution for what became the United States of America."
"They were at the pinnacle of their era's knowledge of political science, philosophy and democracy."
"They put forward a proposal openly and honestly and obtained popular support and support from the various constituent states."
"How different is the process that is now under way to force a Constitution onto the EU countries!"
"The EU's powerful political elite knows that it lacks popular support for its plans for a United States of Europe."
"The negotiations are taking place in secret."
"There is no question of the European project having a democratic basis. Rather, it is designed to blind people with science."
"Angela Merkel asks, for example, whether it might be a good idea to alter the terminology of the draft Constitution without changing the legal substance."
"Its proposals concerning the flag and the anthem would be removed."
"The whole plan is designed to enable the political elite to push through a United States of Europe without being forced to win the peoples' confidence in the project."
"That is deceitful."
"(NL) Mr President, Prime Minister, as a resident of the Benelux countries, I have been somewhat frustrated lately."
"Indeed, we were used to being on the front line for the European project, but ever since the negative referendum in the Netherlands, I get the impression that the Dutch leaders, where Europe is concerned, have been suffering from cold feet to some extent."
"This was evident, inter alia, from the way in which you spoke about extending majority decision-making, while surely you know that this is one of the key elements in order to keep the momentum going in an enlarged Europe."
"I do however, appreciate the difficult position that you are in at the moment."
"You, Prime Minister, probably remain convinced that the text that you approved at the IGC does indeed adequately meet the challenge we are facing, but should take the verdict of your people into consideration."
"I therefore value your efforts to come up with solutions and to look for a compromise, in which respect you clearly recognise that due account must be given to those who approved the text as it was."
"I hope that this can lead to a compromise."
"I am, however, really concerned about what you said about the involvement of the national parliaments."
"You explicitly plead in favour of the red card, which I do not think of as the right way forward."
"What you are actually doing is turning the national parliaments into a new EU institution of some kind, and that is not exactly something we are waiting for."
"You need to convince your national parliament that their role is to monitor the ministers in relation to their role in the Council."
"This is the role of the national parliaments, and the national parliaments who have done this have not experienced any problems."
"Another reservation I have about what you said, and to which you perhaps ought to give some thought, is that when you seek to include the criteria for enlargement in the Treaty, like the Commission, you have to bear in mind that you would then subject the enlargement to the Court's legal control, while this is, in the final analysis, about political decision-making."
"I would advise you to give this some thought."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Mr President, Prime Minister, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, we are concluding a stage that began in Maastricht, followed - and I remember this as President - by the Dutch proposal, the Lubbers-Kok proposal, which was too federalist."
"You have now come along with an entirely opposite position."
"These things happen in families and we are prepared to build bridges."
"You have imposed four conditions."
"With regard to codecision and the national parliaments, I agree with Jean-Luc Dehaene: the national parliaments should show the red card to the governments, not to the European institutions."
"We are prepared to improve our cooperation."
"With regard to the new issues that are being added, paragraph 12 of our motion for a resolution contains them."
"We agree on that."
"With regard to the issue of public services, convince your political family."
"There is a fundamental problem however: splitting the Treaty open, considering amendments rather than its structure, means dismantling everything and it goes against transparency and understanding on the part of the citizens."
"One more thing, Mr President, regarding the anthem: the other day, in my constituency, I explained to my fellow countrymen that the Dutch national anthem, the 'Wilhelmus', pays homage to the King of Spain."
"They said, 'how nice the Dutch are!'"
"When I then said to them, 'and they talk about the cruel Spaniard', they said, 'that is a football problem'."
"So I would say one thing: this anthem business is very complicated, and I shall stick to the Ode to Joy."
"(NL) Mr President, it has just struck me that, in the debate, most of the support for Mr Balkenende came from the SP, the Vlaams Belang, the Party of Haider, the Polish League of Families and the Eurosceptics from Sweden and Denmark."
"I just thought that worth mentioning."
"The Cabinet's efforts bear witness to a depressing void and lack of any sense of responsibility in terms of Europe's future."
"After all, the consequence of a mini-Treaty will be reduced democracy, minimal involvement for the public and reduced decisiveness in terms of climate change and terrorism."
"A mini-Treaty will make Europe a political dwarf."
"The fundamental rights must be legally enforceable."
"Is the Dutch Labour Party in this Cabinet really prepared to sacrifice the fundamental rights to avoid a referendum?"
"The national parliaments should indeed be involved more, but rather than introduce paralysing red-card procedures, they should finally develop active interest and knowledge."
"They can do this now, but just do not bother."
"Finally, there is a lot of demagogic twaddle about a superstate."
"We should stop this, because I did not hear your party discuss this either when you campaigned in favour of the constitution prior to the referendum."
"Measures in the area of security against terrorism, for example, should, of course, be taken at European level, not as it is being done at the moment, though, in back rooms, but rather out in the open, democratically and with majority decision-making."
"This is not a superstate, this is democracy."
"Prime Minister Balkenende, the Netherlands can contribute so much more to Europe."
"Please let this be seen."
"- (PL) Mr President, one condition for a successful future for a united Europe is developing a European consciousness."
"This is defined by everything that we Europeans have in common - a Christian history and culture, and the understanding that our only future is together."
"We must remember that we cannot force people to adopt a European identity."
"No amount of legislation, even when it is adopted in an atmosphere of success, let alone a climate of unwillingness, can create it."
"The fact is that it is not constitutions that create communities, but communities create constitutions."
"For that reason, a constitutional treaty for Europe will not lead to a new growth in European identity, and there is no point in waging wars to defend it, particularly if it creates unneeded divisions."
"We must, however, make sure that our common history is punctuated by more events like the recent Samara summit."
"We need the world to see us as a united entity more often."
"We must speak in a single voice, because that is the only way we can rise to the challenges facing us."
"It is my sincere belief that we can succeed in this, precisely thanks to our common identity, and that is something that no legislation can guarantee."
"Mr President, I should like to say to the Prime Minister that the Constitutional Treaty is not about losing identity but about organising solidarity in a just, effective and sustainable way."
"Those who oppose it on grounds of identity are not in fact afraid of citizens losing control over the State but of the State losing control over citizens."
"In a world where the market, crime and poverty are globalised, the European Union must be political and coherent."
"We therefore need the double legitimacy of the European Union as a union of states and citizens and double majority voting."
"You will agree that the European Union is simply unable to exist without legal personality and is unable to decide whether the single-country veto is its decision-making rule."
"While accepting that subsidiarity should be an important principle of the Union, we should also accept the precedence of European legislation over national legislation."
"We cannot expect European citizens to be loyal to the European institutions if their fundamental rights are not legally binding."
"Likewise, without a social dimension, the European dream simply will not take off."
"However, a social Europe is not sustainable without a harmonised tax policy and European Union funds."
"Ultimately it is not possible to imagine a Europe which is economically and socially effective without a common foreign and security policy."
"By considering this aspect in a positive way you will certainly bridge the wishes of your citizens and the aspirations of other Europeans."
"Mr President, I am very much indebted to the Members of Parliament for their comments further to what was said on the subject earlier."
"I should like to start by clearing up a serious misunderstanding."
"I have heard a number of speakers, including Mrs Kaufmann and Mr Voggenhuber, talk about things such as the national anthem, the title of Foreign Affairs Minister and the flag, as if these were Dutch issues."
"This is not the case at all."
"I have indicated to you that the question is whether these symbols - that are wonderful in their own right and I have nothing against them - should be enshrined in a constitution."
"They are merely examples of the question whether we want to work on a constitution or would prefer to change the treaty."
"This is what this is about."
"Let us simply treasure our symbols, the question is only whether they should be included or not."
"What I meant went a lot deeper, as I indicated."
"I have tried to give answers to concerns that are around."
"In my contribution, I indicated that we must think in terms of a treaty amendment, a test of subsidiarity by the national parliaments."
"I will say more about this in a moment."
"The kind of things that matter to us are majority decision-making in relation to the powers of Europe and the inclusion of the enlargement criteria."
"Seeing things only in terms of symbols would turn the Netherlands' vision into a caricature."
"I also paid close attention when the comment about nationalism was made."
"It was one that I did not understand."
"During the debates which we held in the Dutch Lower Chamber and after the 'no', I made it quite clear that our future is in Europe."
"A positive message about the meaning of Europe in everyone's life."
"We cannot do without Europe."
"This has always been my message, and I have no desire, therefore, to be associated with purely nationalistic trends."
"There was also the assertion that Europe is about nothing but economics. to which, you, Mr President, of course referred."
"Everyone says certain things."
"You referred to the actions of a young media person."
"I should like to remind you once again that when we held the presidency of the European Union, I repeatedly said that Europe is much more than a market and currency."
"Do you remember that I took the initiative to organise conferences on values in Europe?"
"I then raised the question: what makes us Europeans?"
"What are our common motives?"
"What makes Europe this continent?"
"It is my dear wish that the debate on European values be continued."
"We cannot do without this debate."
"So do not try to tell me that this is just about economics."
"When we consider Europe's future, we face the question as to what the challenge is we are facing."
"Mrs Martens from the Netherlands made a pertinent comment in this connection."
"What is actually the ideal situation?"
"What are we trying to achieve together?"
"This subsequently leads to a host of concrete questions which have also been raised on this platform."
"I cannot address all of them."
"There are simply too many and we are also limited in time."
"Allow me to single out a few issues, though."
"One of the points that was made was the issue of powers and of subsidiarity."
"It is my firm belief that we must spell out what we mean."
"Mr Duff made no bones about the fact that the Union has only those powers that the Member States grant it."
"We should lay this down in very specific terms."
"When these powers are implemented, this is when the issues of subsidiarity and proportionality come into play."
"Of course, the national parliaments have their part to play in this."
"This is also true of the Netherlands."
"The Upper and Lower Chambers, and the Joint Committee, have reflected on the question as to what Europe should and should not do."
"This is extremely beneficial for involvement."
"Indeed, for too long, the debates were avoided and postponed."
"This is also the method by means of which we would like to say that national parliaments should be fully involved in what is happening in Europe."
"If there are points of criticism, they should be made."
"We, for example, commented on the harmonisation of criminal law in the fight against counterfeit goods, something with which Commissioner Frattini has concerned himself."
"This is the sort of thing that should be open to discussion."
"This is how national parliaments can operate."
"In a wider sense, it is also a good thing that the question of subsidiarity is also addressed in national parliaments."
"We should avoid a situation in which national parliaments and the European Parliament are pitted against one another."
"You have different powers and you play your own role in democracy."
"We should not see this as a sign of weakness, but rather as one of strength."
"I should now like to turn to the criteria of services of general interest, a subject that Mr Van den Berg raised, along with other questions."
"It is my firm belief that we need clarification."
"We can discuss the way in which this is done."
"At the same time I can see Mr Maaten - we know each other well from the days when we both sat on the town council of Amstelveen, a town near Amsterdam - we go back a long time."
"I can understand very well what you are saying about the internal market."
"Of course, we must consider this consequence, but I, in turn, would say, if we discuss pension systems, pension funds, schools, let us closely examine how the principles of the internal market work there."
"We need clarification on this and we can obviously discuss the way this should be brought about in greater detail."
"I understood very well that you talked about the importance of the Charter of fundamental rights."
"With good reason, because these fundamental rights belong to the values which Mr Daul mentioned."
"The question is only - and I would like to ask the same question - whether this should be included in a Constitution or if other methods could be applied."
"We need to find a solution for this."
"I have listened carefully to what you said and heard how important the topic is considered here."
"It was a pleasure to hear Mr Dehaene speak."
"I value him for his involvement in bringing about the Constitutional Treaty and the Convention at the time, and we have found ourselves thrashing things out on many occasions."
"I am pleased that you feel for the position that we are in, when people say 'no' in a referendum."
"You have also indicated what is needed to resolve this situation."
"I would respond to that by saying that we must be a little more pragmatic, as Mr Maaten indicated, but obviously whilst retaining the ideals we all share."
"If we can reach this solution, we will need to be mindful of the positions on either side."
"It is for precisely this reason that I repeat today that it is necessary that we look beyond the existing positions, that we should not take sides in Europe and that this, as I see it, can be done by means of an amending Treaty."
"I think it is possible to find solutions swiftly."
"Many comments have been made, which I find difficult to address, although I have taken note of them all for personal use."
"I listened carefully to Mr Barón Crespo, who mentioned - and I should like to finish with this remark - national anthems."
"You referred to the Dutch Wilhelmus, our anthem which, it is true, contains the sentence: 'de koning van Hispanje heb ik altijd geëerd'."
"The fact, though, that our anthem includes the line 'I have always respected the King of Spain' was related to the fact that Spain was involved in totally different things in the Netherlands, which culminated in a fight for independence and an 80-year war."
"This is now such a great time, a time in which we, for the first time in Europe's history, are experiencing peace and security so that we can discuss things here in friendship."
"I remember very well when I was in Madrid and visited the monastery where Philip II stayed."
"It was interesting, alongside our version of history, to hear the Spanish version."
"This is what is so good about Europe, that we can be different."
"Europe is a continent of diversity, but we also need unity."
"What is so special about Europe is that we boast this culture and religious pluriformity."
"This is what has made Europe strong."
"If we are talking about the ideals which we stand for, then I would say: let us use what has made Europe strong: human rights, democracy and working on security."
"Let us remain keenly aware that this should be a combined effort."
"Let us recognise the powers of national parliaments, let us get the European Parliament to do what needs to be done without any restrictions."
"I always find it extremely stimulating to be here, because the European Parliament is the symbol of a united Europe."
"I believe it is a good thing that national politicians enter into debate with you."
"I experienced the debate with you today as extremely stimulating."
"Of course we do not need to see eye to eye on everything, and of course I can take criticism, but there is more that unites us than divides us."
"If we are guided by the European dream, then we will undoubtedly be able to find solutions for the problems that have arisen."
"Together we can make a difference; together we can work on this solution."
"(Applause)"
"We in this House believe that there is no longer any basis for nationalism, and so the term ought not to have been used today."
"I would like to thank you sincerely on behalf of all our Members for being here, and will wish you success in your policy in order that we may find a way to preserve the substance of the constitution, in the shape of the necessary reforms and the values we seek to embody."
"My thanks also go to the Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner Frattini, and to Mr Gloser, the Minister of State."
"The debate is closed."
"Situation in Nigeria (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Nigeria."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the situation in Nigeria is of great significance for the stability of West Africa and, ultimately for that of the continent as a whole."
"The latest elections in Nigeria turned out very disappointingly, as the Council indicated in its statement of 27 April; there were numerous irregularities and acts of violence, with up to 200 people being killed and many more than that injured or intimidated, and the Council expects the persons responsible for these acts of violence to be called to account for their actions."
"It is fortunate, at any rate, that there was no evidence in these elections of religious or ethnic conflicts."
"The elections took place within an improved legal framework, with substantial funds being made available, and all this led us to expect that the 2007 elections would pass off better than those held in 2003."
"While we are still awaiting the final report from the EU's election observation mission, initial assessments give credence to the suspicion that the 2007 elections were an even more badly run affair than their predecessors in 2003."
"The main problems were in the lack of organisation exemplified in particular by the late opening of polling stations, the lack of ballot slips and the lack of secrecy around the voting process."
"What was even more serious was that, in addition to widespread irregularities, there was visible evidence of considerable electoral fraud."
"Another major problem with the elections was that failure to publish detailed results from them, with, moreover, those results that were available not being calculated in comprehensible ways, and we should now ask the Nigerian authorities to publish the results with the figures broken down according to the polling stations where the votes were cast, for this is the only way in which the election system can be guaranteed to be transparent."
"The Council did, however, find positive encouragement in the indications of greater independence on the part of the judicial system during the election campaign, and we hope that this tendency will continue in the post-election period."
"The lively debates in the privately-owned media before and after the election were also encouraging, and the Council has been impressed not least by the commitment of the Nigerians themselves to the democratic process, in consequence of which the involvement of civil society organisation is, and will continue to be, of very great importance."
"The Council has appealed to all the political actors to use peaceful means and to demonstrate an attitude of responsibility by having consistent recourse to the legal channels in order not to disappoint the Nigerian people."
"We hope that the independent national election commission and other bodies will make haste in producing the evidence that the electoral tribunals require in order to complete their work with the minimum delay possible."
"The Council also hopes that the Nigerian state authorities will be sympathetic to the idea of repeating the election process in instances where there is irrefutable evidence of grave electoral fraud."
"This is not, however, the time to turn our back on Nigeria - on the contrary;"
"Nigeria's stability and development matter not only to its own people, but also to Africa as a whole, and, if the Millennium Development Goals are not achieved in Nigeria, we are not going to be able to achieve them in Africa at all."
"Nigeria's future government will have numerous challenges to face; one fundamental area of concern will be the need to monitor efficiently the resources allocated to the federal states, and another will be the continuing insecurity in the Niger Delta."
"The EU should support Nigeria as it faces these challenges, stepping up its efforts to strengthen responsible governance and democracy and promoting respect for human rights in Nigeria."
"It must involve itself in these areas in cooperation with Nigeria and on the basis of that country's government's unequivocal consent."
"The Presidency will therefore continue to keep a watchful eye on developments in Nigeria."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, as we have just heard, Nigeria has recently held important elections that will determine the transfer of power from one civilian president to another."
"On the invitation of the Nigerian authorities, the Commission fielded a large independent election observation mission (EOM), which performed well and cooperated closely with other international and domestic observer groups."
"I appointed Mr van den Berg - who had also observed the elections in 2003 - chief observer for those elections, and he will shortly give us his report."
"The mission concluded that the 2007 state and federal elections fell short of basic international and regional standards for democratic elections, pointing out that they were marred by poor organisation - as has already been cited, a lack of essential transparency and safeguards, widespread irregularities, significant evidence of fraud and disenfranchisement of voters."
"Sadly, at least 200 deaths from election-related violence were also reported."
"Other international observers - including those fielded by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the US National Democratic Institute, led by Madeleine Albright - were also very critical, as were domestic observation groups."
"The EU Presidency expressed disappointment at these elections not having marked progress in relation to 2003, which has now been reiterated by our president, at the irregularities and at the high toll of victims."
"The reactions and the messages from the international community had been consistent in urging Nigerians who have complaints about the process to use the legal provisions outlined in the Constitution and in the Electoral Act, commending the independence shown by the judiciary and the engagement of civil society and praising the commitment of poll workers and voters."
"Disappointment at this missed opportunity is widespread in the international community, as Nigeria - one of the major powers in Africa - could have set an example of successful consolidation of the democratic process, which would have had a tremendous positive impact on the African continent."
"This is even more regrettable as the elections were held in an improved atmosphere in which the freedoms of assembly and expression were at least broadly respected."
"The elections have highlighted the many problems and shortcomings of the Nigerian democratic process, and the Commission is aware that many challenges and misgivings need now to be addressed and overcome."
"In the short term, pressure should be placed on Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission to publish a complete breakdown of the polling station results, which is a basic requirement of transparency, and the judiciary should also be encouraged to act swiftly and responsibly with the election petitions."
"If redress is not provided, this could have serious implications for the future."
"While the lessons learned will have to be taken into account in our future relations with Nigeria, entrenching positions should be avoided."
"I think the political dialogue has to restart, but future relations will have to include a deeper engagement at federal, state and Community level with a wider range of players in civil society and government."
"The topic of the elections must be a key feature of the political dialogue with Nigeria, based on the recommendations of the EOM."
"Our readiness to engage Nigeria in a political dialogue and the commitment to promote the strengthening of governments and democracy in the country, particularly together with ECOWAS, is highlighted in the joint EU-ECOWAS communiqué issued on 24 April at the 11th EU-ECOWAS ministerial meeting."
"While the main instrument for political dialogue will remain Articles 8 and 9 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, the programming of the development cooperation to be financed by the 10th European Development Fund will also provide a crucial avenue for dialogue and the opportunity to take into account lessons learnt from the elections and the outcome of the discussions with the new Government, civil society and other key players."
"Madam President, both the Nigerians and the international community had great hopes for the Nigerian elections for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa and as the Commissioner said, a successful democratic process in Nigeria could set a good example that other African countries would wish to replicate."
"Secondly, these were the first Nigerian elections where one civilian government would take over another, which is very important in a country with a history of military dictatorships."
"And thirdly, there is broad freedom of speech in Nigeria, and the judiciary is independent."
"Unfortunately these hopes of a positive example have been dashed."
"The resolution we are discussing is very critical, and justifiably so."
"Poor organisation, numerous mistakes and procedural irregularities, as well as electoral fraud have meant that the latest Nigerian elections cannot be regarded as credible, free or fair."
"The elections met neither international standards nor the regional standards defined by ECOWAS."
"Worse still, the elections were marred by violence resulting in the deaths of at least 200 people."
"Questions about the significance of this violence by discussing the death toll showed that most Nigerian politicians were unaware of the problem."
"It appears that long-term education in citizenship is very important in the case of Nigeria."
"Sending election observers is not enough, we need to invest in education and building a civil society."
"It is my belief that the Nigerians must not be subjected to blackmail based on threats that any questioning of the election results would be tantamount to inviting the military to stage a coup again."
"This philosophy of 'the lesser of two evils' undermines democracy and justifies and feeds anti-democratic tendencies."
"The 64 million registered Nigerian voters have a right to election results that reflect their real will, and the European Union must strive to make this happen."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I should like to say something on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, rather than as head of the Election Observation Mission, because that is a different role."
"The European Election Observation Mission has had to conclude that the elections in Nigeria were not credible."
"This is unfortunate, because despite the improved atmosphere in which the freedom of expression of opinion was respected during the campaign and despite the positive and independent role played by the law courts, the election process, and subsequently the results, cannot be seen as credible."
"The Council has confirmed, as has the Commissioner, that this is indeed the case."
"The Nigerian elections were badly organised and intransparent; there were far-reaching procedural irregularities and there was clear evidence of fraud."
"The process fell well short of the measure of international and regional standards for democratic elections."
"The point which the Council made a moment ago, namely failure to publish the results either in polling stations or at higher levels, and hence the complete lack of proof and transparency is, and remains, in fact, the most serious problem, because as a result, nothing can be proven or refuted, and this takes all the credibility out of the electoral result as such."
"This is simply, as we have established, one of the toughest verdicts which we as Election Observation Mission have passed in the different countries."
"This was particularly painful, because after 2003, there was real hope among the people that actual improvements would follow."
"The people were committed."
"When many people have made the necessary efforts and have shown commitment, then something like this will hit them particularly hard."
"If you compare 14 April to 21 April: at the governor's elections on 14 April, there was still a great deal of hope, whereas the situation on the 21 April was simply demoralising."
"This also explains the low turn-out, despite the upbeat figures that were published afterwards."
"What conclusion are we Europeans to draw from this?"
"That we should, emphatically, remain committed, and this is where I agree with the Council and the Commission in their conclusions."
"It is, after all, the Nigerian people we are talking about, and they deserve a better future and serious elections."
"This means, therefore, that in our diplomatic relations, we cannot pretend that the government that has just been appointed has been elected in a democratic manner at all."
"This is, of course, a very tricky business."
"We could do business as usual, provided we remain involved and active."
"Business as usual would affect not only the credibility of our European Election Observation Missions, but also - and to a far greater extent - our own values for which we stand when we act in the world and in a country such as this."
"We should therefore come clean and conclude that we have a democratic crisis on our hands at the moment."
"This crisis has partly become evident before the courts, where a number of people have objected and tried to prove that certain things are simply wrong."
"It has also become evident, and can become evident, via working parties of the Senate and the House of Representatives, who are launching investigations of their own and are trying to table fresh proposals."
"And we have to wait and see, of course, how people in Nigeria come to table their own proposals on the question as to how credible elections can be held."
"I have said before that it is not up to us to work this out in detail, but this is the essence and it would be good if in this respect, our resources could be put in place, preferably not with the federal government and with the state, but with all those players in society who can promote governance and democracy in this way."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, the analyses of the elections in Nigeria by international observers are, as I see it, strikingly similar: disappointment about the election process that is typified by poor organisation, large-scale fraud, intimidation and violence."
"These elections do not in any way meet international standards."
"This is the conclusion of the EU Observation Mission, under the leadership of Mr van den Berg, who has done sterling work under difficult circumstances."
"The reaction of certain Member States who would have preferred a slightly less outspokenly negative statement from the European observers has rather surprised me, and all the more so because the Member States in question are constantly banging on about the need for more democratisation in Africa."
"Diverse interests sometimes lead to diverse reactions - history is repeating itself."
"The EU Election Observation Mission was right not to be seduced into adopting a political stance."
"After all, as Mr van den Berg stated a moment ago, it is now up to the political class and civil society in Nigeria to do their bit."
"The judgment by the High Court on the Vice-President's participation in the elections demonstrates that this should not be utopia."
"Irregularities should now be reported to the election tribunals and the courts."
"Our role is more of a structural one. Accordingly, by means of dialogue, as the Commissioner pointed out with good reason, we must spell out that an independent election committee must be put in place that is capable of organising truly independent elections, and the newly elected Nigerian parliament can play an important role in this."
"In summary, following promising developments in countries such as Mali, Benin and Liberia, it is a crying shame that a regional superpower such as Nigeria has missed a great opportunity."
"Madam President, as we all know, the development of Nigeria is crucially important for the African continent."
"Nigeria is one of the largest countries in Africa and, just as it has done in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the European Union has put effort into organising elections and observing elections there."
"That being said, the chaotic and violent situation that reigns in Nigeria, especially in the delta region, must open our eyes to a number of issues - obvious and outstanding issues."
"As in Congo, the issue of the exploitation of raw materials and oil plays an extremely important role in the destabilisation of this country, in the atmosphere of violence and civil war that has come about there."
"On this point, I believe that we should be very pro-active in supporting the civil society and the democrats, who are fighting to obtain information and transparency on the exploitation of the resources and who are also seeking to preserve their resources."
"The delta region is totally devastated and plagued by murderous conflicts, and the manœuvres of the Nigerian army in this area sometimes do more harm than good."
"I also believe that the European Union should be far stricter in making the development aid that it provides conditional on the fight against corruption and on the very clear inclusion in the State budget of the profits made from oil and minerals, because it is all the same absolutely scandalous that the people of Nigeria, who live in a state of great poverty, do not see any benefits whatsoever from these mineral and oil profits!"
"At a time when the price of a barrel of oil has increased, the resources should be considerable."
"It is therefore most unusual that this issue has not been dealt with."
"Finally, progress needs to be made, too, concerning the social and environmental responsibility of large companies - Shell, in particular, has a major presence in this country, but it is not the only one - and we should also act together on these major issues, and not just on the matter of organising elections."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to the reports by the Council and the Commission, and as a member of the delegation of parliamentary observers at the presidential elections, I can fully confirm everything that has been said so far."
"The elections were definitely not conducted in compliance with international standards, since the standards laid down at international level were not reached, nor even the standards of the African states themselves."
"There was even a postponement in the opening time of polling stations that was decided on and notified only the day before, so that the majority of the population was unaware of it."
"Most of the polling stations closed early."
"There was an absence of any kind of secret ballot - and I could go on indefinitely, mentioning, for example, an electoral commission that was independent solely in name, but in fact was closely linked to the government."
"I would also like to mention the intimidating atmosphere."
"Hauwa Ibrahim, holder of the 2005 Sakharov prize, was supposed to meet our delegation in a public place but requested a change in the location of the appointment because she did not feel sufficiently safe."
"I would like to move the debate on to what can be done in the future."
"We absolutely must call for investigations into the electoral irregularities, call for an independent electoral commission, call for the Court of Appeal to be truly independent in dealing with electoral appeals and verify this, and state that new elections are necessary."
"We cannot, however, stop at just this, and I already see in the background the risk that the political choices of the Council are tending in the direction of continuing as if nothing was the matter."
"Let us not conceal the reason - some people may think that what matters is to have a government that is more or less legitimised, but in a country from which we can continue to buy oil."
"This cannot be the solution."
"I would like to ask what the intentions are with regard to using some instruments that the European Union possesses. For example, there is the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Are we able to verify that the Nigerian Government remains uninvolved in the selection and implementation of projects that are financed by this instrument?"
"I would like to ask the Commissioner, as I have already done on other occasions, what is happening with the democratic clause on rights, which was adopted by a very large majority within this Parliament, but never accepted by the Commission or the Council. It has never been transformed into the powerful tool that it could be, and in this case it could be extremely useful to place trade with Europe in the scales too, from the viewpoint of democratic progress."
"Last, but not least, there is the issue of what role Europe intends to play regarding events in the Niger delta."
"It does not seem adequate to me that individual States should do their utmost and be prepared to pay ransoms when someone is seized."
"We must call for a start in talks, relations and meetings between the Nigerian Government and the representatives of local people, putting pressure not only on the government but also on the large European companies operating in that region without any respect for human rights or environmental rights."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, Demokratie als Farce was the headline on 30 April of the weekly Das Parlement - the President of the Council may have noticed how I am quite German-minded."
"Above the headline, there is a big picture of two coyly smiling Nigerian boys brandishing their ballot papers."
"Any comment would be superfluous."
"The two elections in the most populous country in April have ended in human and political disaster, with more than 200 people killed, and fraud on a large scale - things about which the present joint resolution does not mince words."
"Where do we go from here in Nigeria?"
"I am very struck by a page-long article and interview with Nigeria's current President Obasanjo, who spells out quite clearly that Nigeria's future lies with its relationship with China."
"Cheap loans, infrastructure, marvellous, but the European Union is out of the game."
"What, I ask of the Council and the Commission, is the EU's response to this?"
"Do you, in light of these statements and this position, have a strategy, both tangible and intangible, for Nigeria, in fact, for the entire African continent?"
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, if a country is trying for the first time, in the aftermath of civil war and military dictatorships, to organise a peaceful handover of power, it follows that not everything is going to run ideally and perfectly smoothly."
"We all agree, though, that the elections laid on were a farce, for what has become of democracy when a party rejoices in its own victory even before the votes have been counted, or what of the free choice of the voters when threats are made as the voting papers are counted out, when ballot slips are completed many times over, and when there seem, in rural districts, to have been scarcely any elections at all?"
"What sort of message is it supposed to send out when ballot papers and election material arrive too late or not at all?"
"How, then, are the people of Nigeria supposed to feel that they are being taken seriously?"
"The election process was meant to have brought the region stability and pointed people to a viable way into the future, but those hopes have proved illusory, leaving behind them a disillusioned people whose experience of elections is, at best, of a symbolic act, and an opposition whose threat to contest the election result will probably avail it but little, for the winning party is hardly likely to agree to new elections, so what we are left to consider is to what degree the European Union can and may exert pressure when power is handed over on 29 May, for the European Union itself has hardly been always the best of examples; it, too, has seen the repetition of referendums until the desired result was achieved, something that is highly dubious in democratic political terms."
"Madam President, it was my first visit to Nigeria and my first African election, and I was disappointed: I had expected to see a free and fair election, and it was anything but that."
"I will not bore the House with my conclusions, because they are the same as those of the leader of the Commission's delegation and of the leader of the delegation I belong to, and they can be seen on YouTube, in a short video I made, under the headline 'Nigeria's rigged elections'."
"I should just like to address some lessons for the European Union from this election in the largest country in Africa."
"It seems to me that the Chinese influence, referred to by Mr Belder, might be a little deeper than we perceive."
"We know that China is involved in the democracy backlash around the world: working with Russia as a dirty duet, all over Africa, with Belarus, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Egypt."
"There is a process under way that the European Union has to respond to, and I believe that the Commissioner is committed to making the most use of the instrument that she and I are very committed to - the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Let me just make some specific points."
"I was one of three Members of the European Parliament on this delegation, and that was not enough."
"I believe we have to reconsider as a House the use of former Members of the European Parliament in such delegations."
"For example, we will send a delegation to Sierra Leone in August; I will not be surprised if there are very few takers."
"Secondly, concerning the independence of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, we heard that the EU mission in Nigeria is involved with the Government in approving projects."
"This must not happen: this instrument is supposed to be independent of host-country control."
"Then there is the question of follow-up for this election."
"I know that the final report has not yet been published, but I believe that the European Union has a commitment to the pursuit of democracy in those countries and the follow-up to the process of a bad election."
"Finally, the use of the United Nations as an agent for organising these very effective missions is an expensive luxury and needs to be reconsidered."
"(CS) Last month I went to Nigeria as a European Parliament election observer and I saw there many interesting, often unpleasant and sometimes appalling incidents."
"On the one hand, Nigerian voters often travel many miles in great discomfort to reach the polling booths."
"On the other hand, those manning Nigerian polling stations do everything they can to stop these people from accessing the ballot box."
"On the one hand, people cast their vote enthusiastically with a view to a better, fairer, more decent life."
"On the other hand, those manning the polling stations falsify people's votes with the aim of preventing political and economic change."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I feel there can be no doubt about where the European Parliament and the Union stand."
"We are on the side of justice, democracy, and free and fair elections."
"We are on the side of the millions of Nigerians who believe in democratic elections in the hope that democracy is the key to resolving political, economic and social problems."
"Last month Nigeria had a historic opportunity to prove to itself, to Africa and to the rest of the world that it is equal to that task, that it is capable of making the democratic, peaceful transition from one government to another."
"Unfortunately, it has squandered that historic opportunity."
"Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to Mr van den Berg for all his excellent work as chief observer in Nigeria in very difficult circumstances."
"I believe that the standing of the EU Election Observation Missions in general was enhanced by the fact that the EOM to Nigeria did not fudge but came out with a clear message that the elections had been irregular."
"The great value of EU Election Observation Missions is that they are independent and completely neutral."
"They are at arm's length from EU foreign policy."
"The one point on which I am unhappy with the motion for a resolution is that in recital V and paragraph 15 a confusion has entered the text."
"There is an association of election observation and foreign policy, whereas they need to be kept quite separate."
"I hope that a way can be found around this through a normal amendment to get over the problem, but otherwise I am afraid that the ALDE Group will have to vote against both recital V and paragraph 15."
"(PL) Madam President, despite its rich natural resources, Nigeria is a corrupt and backward country, where the profits from these resources, in particular its oil wealth, do not go towards economic development or improving the life of society."
"Influential pressure groups who want to maintain chaos in Nigeria are stoking up antagonism between Muslims and Christians, despite the separation of state and religion, and the fact that the constitution should guarantee citizens their rights."
"It seems to me, however, that the debate in this House before any pronouncement by the electoral commissions is somewhat premature."
"I would, however, like to use this heated debate and the dramatic situation in that African country as an occasion to remember here, in the European Parliament, the words of the greatest authority of the 20th and 21st century, Pope John Paul II, that a state's raison d'etre is the sovereignty of society and the people, and a condition of international peace and cooperation is respect for the right of a nation to have its existence, freedom and culture."
"- (PL) Madam President, over 200 people died during the recent elections in Nigeria."
"The way the elections were conducted had nothing to do with democratic procedures."
"The head of the EU observers Max van den Berg stressed that they did not justify the hopes and expectations of Nigerians, and cannot be regarded as credible."
"Nigeria is a country riddled by social conflict based on religious and ethnic differences, especially between Muslims and Christians."
"At the same time, the country has vast resources of oil and other minerals and is the ninth largest country in the world in terms of population."
"Political killings, torture, and summary justice meted out by the army are commonplace."
"Freedom of speech and of assembly are restricted."
"Cases of repression of the Christian minority are becoming increasingly worrying."
"Since its establishment, the European Union was built on the basis of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and citizens' freedoms."
"On many occasions in its history the European Community - and later the European Union - has spoken out when democracy and freedom were under threat."
"The examples of Georgia and Ukraine also show that only decisive action brings results."
"In Ukraine, this kind of action led to a re-run of the falsified second round of the presidential elections. This was the result not just of the resilient attitude of the Ukrainians, but also of the loud and clear signals sent by the European Union."
"In my view, the European Union's delayed reaction to the events in Nigeria is also cause for concern."
"Where fundamental standards are breached, instant reactions should follow."
"Exactly one month has passed since the disturbances and elections in Nigeria, and we should immediately suspend all financial aid from the European Union to government structures in Nigeria, as well as aid for democracy and human rights if there is a danger that this money may go into the pockets of corrupt government structures."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy has lost ground in Nigeria."
"The elections of Saturday 21 April, which were marked by fraud, violence and deaths, will not have been free or fair."
"All the international observers, as you said, have confirmed this."
"These elections were meant to be a test."
"For the first time since the country gained independence, in 1960, a democratically-elected president could have hoped to succeed another."
"This is a missed opportunity!"
"It does not bode at all well for Nigeria, at a time when the country, rich though it is, needs stability if it hopes to escape poverty."
"Since the elections, the violence has increased: the international community has a duty to intervene."
"I should like to remind you that, last year, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Mrs Hauwa Ibrahim, a Nigerian lawyer who courageously defended two women who had been sentenced to death by stoning for having committed adultery, for the Sharia is still observed in that country."
"On 28 and 29 May, a coalition of opposition parties, civil society and trade union organisations, including the Nigerian lawyers' union, will organise a two-day movement to protest against the staging of these elections."
"The European Parliament must support this democratic movement. It is by doing so that we will defend Nigerians and Nigeria, a large and important African country."
"Madam President, the election observation mission in Nigeria was the first one that I took part in."
"I have one thought that I would like to share with you in relation to that."
"The European Union was one of the biggest donors for carrying out elections in Nigeria."
"Therefore we must hold a certain degree of responsibility that the aid given most efficiently serves its purpose."
"The whole organisational burden for conducting the elections was carried by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC."
"In Nigeria, INEC was not able to meet the organisational and logistical challenges it faced in order to carry out truly democratic elections."
"The shortcomings also constitute the most comprehensive part of the resolution."
"I guess you must share INEC's responsibility by, for example, educating the approximately 500 000 INEC grassroots-level organisers so that more credible independent and democratic elections in Nigeria could take place next time."
"(PT) Regardless of the election result - and there is good reason to doubt the validity of that result - the most worrying aspect of the Nigerian election was the electoral process, on which the opinion of the other international observers left no room for doubt: it was disorganised and fraud took place."
"The report on the subject from our fellow Members who were there as observers is revealing."
"The conclusion can thus be drawn that the election was used to secure a degree of legitimacy that the observers do not recognise and that is not acceptable to democracies."
"The result had more to do with intimidation, fraud and violence than the will of the people."
"Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case on the African continent; far from it, in fact."
"Despite the progress made in recent decades, much of the most persistent violence still goes on and some of the most corrupt regimes are still very much in place."
"There is nothing in the geography of Africa or in the genetic make-up of African people that stops them living in a democracy, but the international community needs to be determined and resolute in the process of the democratisation of African countries."
"This is not only for all the usual reasons, but also because China has become a global player, and one that does not demand democratisation in return for cooperation; quite the contrary, in fact."
"Ahead of the EU-Africa summit due to take place in the second half of the year, the EU is now expected to play a genuinely effective role and not be reduced to mere rhetoric."
"Not all global players behave in the same fashion but we need to work in tandem with our allies."
"This is firstly for reasons both of values and principles, and of interests."
"In free and stable democracies it is possible to pursue international trade that is predictable and that is of benefit to all but those who seek to fan the flames of corruption and dictatorship."
"We must be tough, therefore, at the forthcoming summit, which is to take place during the Portuguese Presidency."
"We do not want statements of good intent or mere recognition of the mistakes of the past; what we want is political truth and true politics."
"The EU must remain the biggest provider of international aid and must actively promote cooperation. At the same time, though, it must succeed in bringing about reform, democratisation and freedom in these countries."
"Otherwise, the EU will be giving out fish rather than helping people to fish."
"(DE) Madam President, having been preceded by such tense expectation, Nigeria's electoral marathon is over, and a new President, new provincial parliaments, and a new federal parliament have been elected."
"The result was a certainty even before the election was held; while an overpowering victory by the governing party had been reckoned with, none of the election observers had expected the degree of electoral fraud, of falsified results, the logistical chaos and the widespread violence associated with this election."
"Not only the European Union's electoral observation commission but also - and this is a new thing - that officially appointed by the West African Economic Union, were merciless in denouncing the serious defects present in this election, which have been documented in a long list to which reference has already been made in this debate."
"I wish to join with my fellow Members in urging the authorities of the Nigerian state to subject the irregularities in this election to thorough and transparent investigation."
"I should also like the Commission to tell us what options are afforded us by the democracy and human rights instrument for taking the necessary steps both in our dialogue with Nigeria and in our cooperation with it; as we know, it is not just Chinese businesses that are disregarding human rights and social inequalities, for their Western counterparts have always turned a blind eye to them in the quest for oil."
"(HU) As vice-president of the delegation of observers from the International Republican Institute, I had the opportunity personally to take part, as an observer, in the recent Nigerian elections."
"Based on my experiences, I have to say that the coordination of the work between numerous international observer delegations was an exemplary success."
"As to the election itself, I can only confirm my colleagues' statement that Nigeria's elections can be considered neither fair nor free."
"They have satisfied neither international standards nor the local norms set by the government of Abuja."
"We witnessed serious shortcomings in the system of voter lists and in keeping the public informed."
"In many instances, local polling stations opened late and had no ballot forms."
"The murky process of compiling the results even raises the suspicion of fraud."
"It is quite telling that the results of some voting districts have not been disclosed."
"What is more, the elections were marred by violence."
"As we have already heard, some 200 citizens lost their lives in clashes linked to the voting."
"These massive irregularities are even more distressing in the light of previous Nigerian elections that took place in a much more orderly fashion."
"This time we witnessed with sadness that the voting public's allegiance to democracy - this is very important - was not accompanied by the intent of government bodies to keep the voting within legal bounds."
"We who were there saw how committed Nigerian citizens are to democratic values."
"Amidst often chaotic conditions they waited with dignity for the moment to exercise their democratic right."
"It is in Europe's interest too to see the consolidation of democracy in Nigeria so that it may become a model for the African continent."
"For that reason, it is important for the EU to remain an active observer of that process."
"(PL) Madam President, I apologise for re-scheduling my speech, as we were holding a very important vote to elect the president of EUROLAT."
"Nigeria failed to make use of the opportunity the elections presented."
"Our observers clearly confirmed that the elections were neither free nor fair."
"This was because of corruption and very poor organisation."
"The Nigerian Government is entirely to blame for this."
"The elections were overshadowed by terror, in which 50 people died, most of them in the Niger Delta."
"At times they were nothing but a caricature of elections, where some polling stations failed to open, while in others bandits destroyed the ballot boxes."
"Europe should be especially meticulous in observing elections in this country, which is the largest in Africa and for many other African countries is a point of reference economically and politically."
"Elections in a country of 110 million, of which 64 million are of voting age, should focus the attention of public opinion."
"Unfortunately these elections did not boost, but have effectively weakened, Nigeria's position in the international arena."
"In the run-up to the elections we noted a number of activities and tendencies not related to the election process that are cause for concern."
"For example, in Muslim-governed areas, girls going to Christian schools were forced to wear veils as symbols of Islamic tradition."
"This is a clear breach of religious rights and tolerance, but such practices are on the increase, and such discrimination may become even more widespread when Muslims take more power in Nigeria."
"As the European Parliament, we cannot pass over this matter in silence, particularly as it is an imposition on the minds of children."
"Tomorrow will be an opportunity to take a stand on this matter in the voting, and there will be voting in an amendment on this very issue."
"But what will happen next, after the elections?"
"We should do more than just criticise, for which we have just grounds."
"What we also need is a clear plan on how to force the observance of democratic rules of play in a country which plays a key role on a continent which is practically our neighbour."
"In other words we have to force the Nigerian authorities to reflect democracy and free elections or - to be frank - turn off the tap of financial aid."
"This aid must not be channelled towards state and federal structures."
"Instead it can and should be forwarded to non-governmental and social organisations."
"We must also put pressure on the Nigerian Government to act more effectively against corruption, the use of force and the sense of impunity that local authorities, which are practically states within a state, have."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to extend warm thanks to the honourable Members of this House for the interest they have shown and also for their support, and my particular thanks go to those who have performed the task of monitoring elections on the ground and who can therefore give very powerful and truthful descriptions of what happened there."
"In his speech, Mr Kaczmarek gave it as his opinion that an opportunity had been missed, and to that I want to add that it was not a case of the overwhelming majority of Nigerians missing an opportunity, but rather of there having been people who would not allow the holding of free and independent elections with secret ballots that might have had a significant impact."
"The question has been asked from various quarters as to what we can do about this."
"In your own speech, Mr van den Berg, you also said, that we cannot stint in our commitment to Nigeria and to its civil society in particular."
"It is very important that we should now, rather than backtracking on this commitment, clarify how the commitment made by us in the European Union can directly benefit the interested parties, not least civil society."
"One opportunity to once again spell out what we Europeans think about how elections should be conducted, and about the ways in which they are manipulated, will be the G8 summit in Heiligendamm, at which the President of Nigeria, among others, is expected."
"This first impression of what has been going on in Nigeria must not, however, exercise a generally negative influence on Africa's image in our eyes."
"Some of you have already mentioned the positive examples that are to be found on the African continent."
"Mauretania may not be a large country, but we have recently seen how it managed to organise a transition, and also, from its example, what sort of support is needed in order to do that."
"Another consideration, bearing in mind the prospect of the Africa Summit between the EU and the African Union being held in November, is the need for it to be made clear for which values the European Union stands, and to what it is committed, in its dealings with its African partners."
"We must also, at the same time, make clear where we stand in our dialogue with China, for it is not acceptable that China should have only a very limited economic interest in the continent of Africa, whilst the European Union is left to do much else in such areas as responsible action by the state and the development of civil society."
"I was struck, a few weeks ago, when I attended a joint meeting between the EU and ECOWAS, to hear the participating countries say that, for many small shoots that had sprouted in them and which they hoped would grow still further, this amounted to a retrograde step."
"There are also many countries in Africa that are enjoying economic growth and that are well governed."
"I am glad to see that many of the public media are currently, in preparation for the Africa summit, taking note of that as they take a look at Africa, and that was another reason why it was important that the European Union and some of its Member States should show their colours while securing the elections in Congo, for there are, quite apart from Congo, a number of countries where development is progressing well."
"So, then, I want to say thank you again for that."
"I hope that we will, together with the Commission, and with your House's support, find ways of coming to terms with what has happened in Nigeria;"
"I hope that there will be changes, and that we will be able to give our continued support to those in Nigeria who want that land to change and become a democratic country."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, we all agree that, unfortunately, these elections were a real disappointment, but I hope that democracy in Nigeria will become a force in the future, and not a farce."
"We have a lot of work to do."
"I agree that it is not possible or advisable to continue with business as usual, and certainly we will not do that."
"As has been said by, I believe, a majority here, we have to engage with members of civil society in Nigeria who are willing to change the situation and the election process."
"This must be part of the dialogue that we have to follow up, based especially on the recommendations of the EOM."
"On the other hand, political engagement and dialogue with the Government are also needed."
"Such a dialogue has to be regular; it has to be structured; it has to be held at troika, or local or even higher level, and must be extended to national and regional organisations, as was done between the EU and ECOWAS, as was just mentioned, as well as to representatives of civil society."
"As regards the Electoral Commission, according to the observers, there were irregularities and fraud, but INEC in particular failed to act independently as it is required to do."
"It is clear, therefore, that INEC, tarnished as it is by serious doubts over its impartiality, cannot continue to be a beneficiary of EDF support."
"Issues concerning INEC's independence, mandate, structure and leadership must therefore be addressed before any decision about the continuation of our support can be taken."
"As regards the Niger Delta, which has already been mentioned by some of you, the Human Rights Watch report entitled 'Chop Fine' on Rivers State is emblematic of a situation widespread in the Niger Delta, where large financial resources are made available, but very little reaches the people and even less the communities in remote areas of the Delta."
"People there have been deprived of their voices and land resources, and they are not given anything in return by the Government."
"The threats and challenges presented by this area are left unaddressed and will, sooner or later, have serious repercussions at national and regional level."
"The ambassadors of the EU Member States have twice submitted clear and simple recommendations."
"Before the financial resources allocated to the Niger Delta are increased, total transparency should be ensured and dialogue between all the stakeholders established."
"Articles 8 and 9 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement have also been mentioned. They contain all the ingredients needed to ensure the most effective dialogue not only with the Government but also with civil society and the regional African organisations, as has been said."
"I consider it absolutely paramount that more coherent, more regular and more systematic action by the EU as a group vis-à-vis Nigeria is the only possible way of addressing the questions highlighted by these elections."
"This should be a very strong thrust of our policy."
"On the other hand, we have to be careful not to push Nigeria into the hands of religious extremists, including Muslim extremists."
"China has been mentioned."
"When I was in China in January, I made it clear that we want to have a dialogue on Africa with China."
"It is not so easy to do, but it is very important and, therefore, it is important that Nigeria is being invited to the G8 Summit in order to give them these messages directly, because we have to tell Nigeria that we want our values and interests to be respected and it cannot only be a question of pure economic matters."
"I shall just repeat that the EIDHR provides an opportunity to work with civil society."
"It can work without the approval of the Government, but we normally have contact with the Government."
"Finally, it is also important to see what our financial funding means there."
"It is a mere 0.2% of the oil revenue and the total international aid to Nigeria."
"Therefore this makes the consequences of aid suspension negligible from a financial viewpoint and potentially counterproductive, as it would further impair political dialogue with the Government."
"But, on the whole, 25% of funding is promoting good governance."
"Therefore, we should use this part in particular in order to work with civil society, as I think we would all agree."
"To wind up the debate, a motion for resolution signed by seven groups has been tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 noon."
"International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (debate)"
"The next item is a debate on"
"the oral question by Miroslav Ouzký, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Council: Key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to be held in The Hague on 3-15 June 2007 (B6-0020/2007) and"
"the oral question by Miroslav Ouzký, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Council: Key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to be held in The Hague on 3-15 June 2007 (B6-0121/2007)."
"substitute author. - (FR) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the reports follow each other but are not alike, since we are at present going to deal with biodiversity."
"Minister, this week will have been marked by the desire shown by the European Parliament to fight against the loss of biodiversity."
"On Monday, the report by our fellow Member, Mr Amadou, and the report on Life+ were debated and, today, we are examining two oral questions tabled ahead of the next meeting of the Conference of the parties to the Convention on international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna, the CITES."
"Our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, whose chairman I excuse for not being able to be here with us, questions the Member States' negotiating method and asks the European Council what key objectives the Union will uphold during the fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the parties to the CITES Convention, which will be held, as you said, Madam President, in the Hague on 14 and 15 June 2007."
"The CITES Convention is one of the oldest multilateral environmental protection instruments."
"It was adopted in 1973, in Washington, by States that were already anxious to go beyond the national regulatory frameworks."
"The aim was to preserve wild plants and animals from commercial overexploitation."
"The significance of this Convention compared with the other multilateral agreements on the environment is its great power of adaptation."
"It directly influences trade through supply, which it restricts."
"In very practical terms, it influences around 500 000 transactions - that is no small amount, 500 000 commercial transactions! - thereby restricting the overexploitation of biodiversity."
"With the coming on board of the various institutional partners, nearly 170 States, including our 27 Member States, of scientists and NGOs, the CITES Convention will have made it possible to prevent the removal of particularly endangered species and to save species such as the Siberian tiger, the blue whale and African elephants."
"Of course, the challenges facing the Convention are many. On the one hand, they are structural."
"The Convention struggles, in fact, to find funding to match its ambitions."
"It has to deal with the over-consumption of natural species, some of which are not always listed."
"On the other hand, the Convention must take account of new data, including, of course, climate change."
"It must incorporate the ineffectiveness of certain instruments, such as the action plan for forest law enforcement, governance and trade, or FLEGT, with which everyone in this House is familiar."
"It must review also the decisions that have had a negative impact on certain species: for example, during the twelfth Conference of the parties, the permits for the sale of ivory originating from Botswana, Namibia and South Africa resulted in almost 20 000 elephants being decimated, according to estimates."
"As part of the fight against the loss of species, the European Union must at all costs speak with one voice during the conferences of the parties to the Convention."
"In this connection, I should like to point out, Minister, that the European Union often abstains when decisions are taken because our Member States do not manage to come to an agreement, with the result that 27 votes are lost, and 27 votes is not a negligible amount; it is even often a large amount."
"Therefore, Minister, we ask that the Council take account of Parliament's resolution, which reflects the interests of the European people and conveys that which our citizens want us to defend within the context of this CITES Convention. Firstly, because the resolution points out certain requirements to the negotiators."
"Thus, the precautionary principle must be applied with the same rigour as that imposed by the European Union in other international negotiations on the environment."
"Equally, the Union must demand transparency in the voting process and reject secret ballots, a practice that really exists, especially when it comes to listing species in annexes."
"In fact, the point is to modernise this slightly antiquated procedure, which no longer in any way meets the requirements of the citizens, who must be able to exercise their right to inspect the decisions that are taken on their behalf."
"We know that the NGOs criticise the EU Member States at every turn for not disclosing their votes and for voting in secret ballots on certain species."
"We consider this to be totally unacceptable and we call for transparency, because this Convention is special and because the Member States, as we know, have specific interests where some subjects are concerned."
"The questions included in the agenda of the Conference must be submitted to the European Parliament."
"We do not expect anything less."
"Each time a Conference of the parties to the CITES Convention is announced, we put the same questions to the Council: we do not understand why we have not been consulted earlier, so that we know what positions the Council plans to uphold during the Conference."
"I should also like to ask the Commission and the Council to involve our parliamentary delegation in the work of the Conferences so that we are not forced, as we usually are, to skulk around the corridors in the hope of gleaning some information from them, and that is when the Council and the Commission see fit to invite us!"
"I therefore thank you for involving the European Parliament delegation in the work done on the Convention."
"Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, including those who have spoken on behalf of your colleague Mr Ouzký, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the presidency."
"As at previous meetings of the conference of the contracting parties to the Washington convention on the protection of species, the EU Member States will, together, put forward the position agreed by the Community."
"The Council will shortly set down this position on the basis of the latest proposal from the Commission, and will, of course, inform Parliament of the position thus arrived at."
"The Community's position will incorporate three overarching goals:"
"One is that the Convention shall become as efficient as possible, and the first thing to be done with this end in mind will be to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens; practicable and working solutions to problems of implementation need to be found, and it needs to be ensured that the contracting parties' resources are targeted where there is a real need for preservation."
"Greater synergies must be established between the Convention on the Protection of Species and other instruments and processes relating to biological diversity; in particular, the resolutions of the fourteenth conference should help to bring about, by 2010, a marked deceleration of the worldwide loss of biological diversity, and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"Furthermore, the European Union also wants to ensure at the conference that the planned amendments to the annexes to the Washington Convention actually do improve the preservation of the species in question, and it will, in this respect, be particularly important to ensure that monitoring is carried out, for it is only in this way that poaching and illegal trading can be curbed and the sustainability of the international trade in species guaranteed."
"Elephants and whales are again the individual species on which this conference focuses."
"To summarise, the Community is not prepared to give its consent to a resumption of commercial trading in ivory until such time as appropriate mechanisms are in place to prevent the more widespread illegal killing of elephants, and it thus calls on all range states of elephants to engage in constructive dialogue and to cooperate in maintaining stocks of elephants and in their sustainable management."
"Since it is the International Whaling Commission that is primarily responsible for whale issues, no new resolutions should be framed in the course of our negotiations that would alter the current preservation status of whales under the Convention, and it follows that a review of whale stocks with a view to the possible downgrading of their preservation status under CITES should be considered only after mechanisms for checks on their management have been introduced and considered suitable by the International Whaling Commission."
"I would like to conclude by expressing my thanks to the author of the question and to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their interest in this important issue."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, the 14th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in the Hague is indeed the first CITES conference to be held in the European Union since CITES was put in place in 1973."
"Therefore I think it will provide a very good opportunity to highlight our strong commitment to the implementation of this Convention and to raise political and public awareness."
"I believe it will be the first time that a ministerial conference will address key issues regarding the future of the Convention."
"Therefore the following key strategic objectives for the Conference of the Parties known as COP 14 have been defined. The COP should reconfirm the important contribution that CITES made, or can make, to reaching the 2010 target of significantly reducing the rate of biodiversity loss."
"The Community fully supports the contribution of CITES to this global target by regulating international trade in wildlife and wildlife products in order to ensure that this is sustainable."
"The new strategic vision for CITES for 2008 to 2013 will determine how CITES can ensure that conservation, sustainable use and poverty reduction can also be mutually supportive and are therefore crucial for the continued importance and relevance of CITES."
"The draft strategic vision also advocates that CITES should pay greater attention to the international trade in commercially exploited timber and fish species."
"Given the strain on natural resources and continued over-exploitation, the Community believes that CITES could focus more on ensuring sustainable trade in such species."
"We the Community have submitted proposals for listing several marine and timber species on CITES, so I think this will be a very important discussion."
"Finally, a key issue for CITES COP 14 will of course be elephant ivory."
"Diverging proposals are on the table from Elephant Range States in Africa."
"We continue to hold the view that commercial trade in government-owned ivory stocks should not be resumed until we are satisfied that all mechanisms are in place to ensure that trade will not result in the increased illegal killing of elephants."
"These mechanisms are currently being put in place and should hopefully be operational before we take a final position on this matter."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, yesterday the newspapers had some good news."
"It was about the hatching of some rare Egyptian tortoise eggs."
"The problem was, they were hatched in Rome."
"They should not have been in Rome."
"They should not have been smuggled from Libya to Rome along with 275 other rare tortoises, because they are in the highest protection category under the CITES Convention."
"Even worse, this is happening inside our European Union."
"We know that the European Union is one of the world's largest and most diverse importers and markets for wildlife products, with demands for pets, for fashion products, ornaments and medicines."
"That is why Europe has a particular responsibility to do something about it."
"In my country, some 570 illegal wildlife items are seized every day by Her Majesty's Customs."
"One wonders how many are not detected."
"We know that the illegal trade in wildlife is the second biggest direct threat to species after habitat destruction."
"We know that a quarter of the trade is illegal."
"We know that billions of euros annually are made out of this, third only to the trafficking in drugs and arms."
"We know, of course, that we have to take account of the local populations and their traditions and needs, and that is in this resolution."
"We know there are differences of views between NGOs and between scientists, but this motion for a resolution, I believe, is a balanced one."
"Lastly, I very much welcome what the Minister and the Commissioner said about the elephant, so will you please support the resolution from Kenya and Mali for a 20-year moratorium on the ivory trade."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, President of the Council, Commissioner, as has already been stated, this CITES Conference will be the first to be held in Europe, and this offers an opportunity to bring the protection of wild animals and plants to the attention of the public at large, more so than before."
"Even though CITES is one of the most effective and concrete instruments to protect the international environment, the decline in biodiversity is alarming."
"For example, a large number of fish species are in a bad way due to overexploitation, among other causes."
"Demand for fish is enormous and still rising."
"This has the depressing consequence that even at this stage, many deep-sea fish species are critically endangered, and that in many developing countries, the sea has also been emptied by Europe, or by European boats at any rate."
"Unfortunately, the same is true to some extent of tropical forests."
"Demand for tropical wood, despite all campaigns, remains high."
"Added to that is the fact that demand for agricultural land is also rising due to the need for food and increasing demand for biofuels, and it is age-old forests that pay the price for this."
"Europe's initiative to include a large number of fish species on the list of protected species deserves our unqualified support, as does the initiative to include a number of tree species on the list."
"We should, however, ask ourselves how we can improve on things."
"Pressure on nature is rising worldwide."
"Increased prosperity goes some way to explaining this, while in a number of developing countries, it is poverty that is the motive."
"We should, therefore, take a different course and realise that the protection of nature also creates prosperity and jobs."
"We must take steps to guarantee that trade is truly sustainable and that the illegal trade is actually tackled and discontinued."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, there is a strong case for supporting the proposal for a 20-year moratorium on the ivory trade."
"Contrary to what some southern African range States say - that they have too many elephants - estimates by the African Elephant Status Report put the population at between 10 and 20 % of what it was in the 1930s and 1940s."
"The major cause of the decline is the ivory trade."
"Ivory prices increased more than seven times over in China and Japan in the late 1990s."
"A 20-year moratorium will send a clear signal that international trade is banned, it would suppress demand, lower prices and remove incentives for buying and stockpiling ivory."
"Commissioner, could you be more precise as regards to what extent the Commission intends to take into consideration the pro-moratorium position expressed by the delegation of Western and Central African States who visited us at the European Parliament?"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Gloser and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for what I was almost tempted to call their reassuring words."
"However, I received no answer regarding the transparency of votes: I believe that it is crucial for us to know who votes for what within the European Union during this CITES conference."
"I should like to begin by also expressing my satisfaction with the proposal made by Germany to include two species of shark - the dogfish and the mackeral shark - in Annex II to the CITES, a proposal that has also been endorsed by many associations working to protect these species."
"In our view, this is a proposal that must gain full support because these two species, which are included in the IUCN Red Book of endangered species, require special attention."
"However, above and beyond the specific case of these species, we should also give greater consideration to the status of the other species of shark in the waters bordering the countries of the EU, in the Mediterranean, for example, so that, on this issue, the European Union is affected as much as the neighbourhood policy."
"In general, it must be recognised that the Mediterranean is an endangered sea: the indiscriminate withdrawal of fishery stocks over the last few decades, with the use of drift nets in particular, has resulted in a significant depletion of species."
"The case of bluefin tuna is one such example, which has been highly publicised recently by Greenpeace."
"Yet, what do we know, for example, about the sharks in the Mediterranean?"
"What we know overall about sharks is that, throughout the world, they are totally endangered, overfished and that they are suffering from the deteriorating marine balance."
"That being said, does the European Union have any information or studies enabling it to assess the situation of the sharks in the Mediterranean?"
"That is the question."
"If it does not have these, can it envisage serious studies being carried out so that, in the long term, it will be in a position to make concrete proposals, on the CITES in particular?"
"Furthermore, we also think it crucial that red coral, which is also overfished in the Mediterranean, be included in Annex II to the CITES."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the CITES Conference that is to be held in The Hague next month is of huge importance if we want to take measures against the international trade in endangered animal and plant species."
"It is for that reason that I wholeheartedly support the resolution."
"There is, however, one issue that I should like to single out and that came up several times this afternoon, namely that of the elephants in Botswana and Namibia."
"Three quarters of the 400 000 elephants in Africa live in this region, thus resulting in inevitable risks for the people and the environment, and being detrimental to biodiversity."
"This is why these countries have tabled their own proposals in order to maintain the elephant population and to reduce the risks."
"The resolution, unfortunately, rejects these proposals."
"Whilst it is understandable that people are keen to stop the trade in elephant products, a view which I share, it is equally important to face up to the situation in Botswana and Namibia, that boasts such an enormous expansion in the number of elephants."
"We must give this matter some more thought."
"After all, we cannot afford to reject solutions without replacing them with alternatives."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Isler Béguin has, in fact, already presented the substance of this oral question, which has particularly to do with what the Council is aiming to achieve through the negotiations, but also with the methods of negotiation and the way in which this House's delegation is involved in the work on the ground."
"Like many other Members, I would like to return to the subject of the trade in ivory, which the Convention has prohibited since 1989, while allowing since 1997 the sale of individual items of stock."
"Understandable though it is that the countries in which the trade goes on have an interest in this, the problem is that it has not so far been possible to distinguish between legal and illegal ivory, and hence there is a great danger that the legal trade will contribute to a revival of poaching."
"A greater incidence of poaching putting those engaged in the protection of wildlife and the natural protection authorities under increasing pressure, and effective protection of pachyderms, which are important in terms of many countries' incomes from tourism, makes increasing demands on resources that are generally scarce; the only long-term protection for ivory is an absolute ban on the trade in it, for it is estimated that some 20 000 elephants a year are killed in Africa for their tusks."
"Our resolution, then, endorses the proposal made by Kenya and Mali, and their demand for a 20-year moratorium on any kind of trade in ivory."
"We hope that the Commission and the Member States will, in the course of the negotiations, give this demand their backing."
"(IT) Madam President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to summarise very quickly the sense of my amendment, which is backed by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"I have called for the deletion of the seventh indent of Article 10 in the proposal for a resolution on the CITES Convention."
"There is no scientific justification for transferring coral to Appendix II, since a panel of highly-respected experts working for the FAO has stated that the requirements for including the species in the genus corallium in the CITES Appendix II are not met - and this is a direct quote."
"Coral can be properly preserved through a system of rotating the protected areas between producer countries."
"Maintaining the current wording would strike a severe blow to the jewellery and craft sectors, as well as to the local economy and employment in various EU countries - Italy, Spain, France, Greece and Malta - and countries outside Europe such as China and Japan."
"I therefore call on you to support my amendment, which is acceptable from a political viewpoint and backed up by scientific thinking."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, on the subject of elephants we are currently sceptical of supporting any of the proposals on the table, because the African Elephant Range States will be meeting directly before the conference."
"We encourage them - and I think this would be the best solution - to engage in a real dialogue and thus seek an agreement on a common approach."
"I have received a motion for a resolution to wind up the debate tabled under Rule 108(5)."
"The vote will be held on Thursday at 12.00."
"Council Question Time"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0018/2007)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: Political crisis in Turkey and prospects of accession"
"In the last few days, in connection with the appointment of the President of the Republic, Turkey has fallen into a deep political crisis which gives rise to serious doubts about the functioning of its democratic institutions."
"The country's Constitutional Court has annulled the first round of the elections, a decision vigorously contested by the government."
"The Prime Minister has stated that the parliamentary system has been brought to a halt and he is calling for early elections, while the General Army Staff has issued a warning that it will intervene to prevent the election of the Islamist, Abdullah Gül, to the office of President."
"What are the Council's views on this situation in a candidate country for accession to the EU?"
"Does it share the opinion of the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, Mr Olli Rehn, that the armed forces should respect the independent role of the democratic process, that the EU is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and the sovereignty of political forces vis-à-vis the military, and his insistence that any country seeking accession to the EU must respect those principles, which are the key elements of the Copenhagen criteria?"
"What impact does it believe such interventions by the military could have on the country's accession procedure?"
"Does the Council have direct contacts with leading political figures in Turkey and what is their reaction?"
"Madam President, we are following developments in Turkey with close attention, and I would also like to remind the House of the Presidency's statement on 28 April of this year, in which we emphasised the need for the presidential elections to be conducted in line with the principles of democracy and the rule of law laid down in the constitution."
"Generally speaking, it is worthy of note that negotiations were commenced with Turkey in 2005 on the basis that Turkey would meet sufficiently the political criteria laid down by the 1993 European Council in Copenhagen, on which membership of the EU is conditional, and one of which is that a country should demonstrate institutional stability as a guarantee for democratic order and the rule of law, for the safeguarding of human rights and for respect for, and the protection of, minorities."
"Over and above these, and in accordance with the framework for negotiations adopted by the Council in October 2005, the European Union expects Turkey to press on with its reform process and work towards making further improvements as regards respect for the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law, together with that for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including European court rulings on the subject."
"The Council noted on 11 September 2006 that further considerable efforts would be needed in order to develop free expression of opinion, freedom of religion, the rights of women, minorities and trades unions, together with civilian control over the armed forces."
"These issues are discussed on a regular basis as part of the political dialogue with Turkey, and, since the Council expects the principles I have mentioned of the rule of law and the civilian control of the armed forces to be fully complied with in the current situation, the presidency will continue to keep a watchful eye on the progress of the Turkish elections."
"(EL) Thank you very much, Minister, for setting out the preconditions laid down by the European Union for the integration of Turkey."
"However, I referred to the recent crisis, which could not have happened either in the countries of the European Union or in the candidate countries."
"We are not accustomed to such crises in the candidate countries and I think that for us to simply - as you said - 'monitor' the situation is not enough."
"We too must account to the citizens of Europe for what we do in order to address the situation and we need to rattle Turkey's cage so that it finally follows the preconditions imposed in order for it to progress towards the European Union."
"We are calling for a bit more than simple 'monitoring', Minister."
"Are you doing more?"
"In its talks with Turkey, the European Union has, I do believe, always acted with reference to the list of criteria to which I have just referred, and it also, on earlier occasions, highlighted ways in which the country might be given support and in which developments to that end might be set in motion within it."
"I do believe that the European Union must be able to expect compliance with the framework requisite for accession and that, ultimately, the actors in Turkey become aware that decisions on such matters rest primarily with politicians rather than with the armed forces."
"One important point - and one of which you will be aware - is that, in the course of this dispute, an appeal has been lodged with the Turkish constitutional court, and this - as the European Union has indeed stated - is the way down which the country must go."
"I do not believe that more can be done at the present time."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, while your statements imply that a whole array of positions have been put on record by the Council and by the European Union, the reality is, however, that Cyprus, as a candidate for accession, failed to comply with these criteria in at least an equal number of instances."
"While I am on the subject of Cyprus, would it not be possible for the European Union or the Council to become involved in ways more active than those you have announced."
"We are keeping a close eye on what is going on there."
"(DE) While the AKP does describe itself as being in favour of the separation of religion and state set down in the Turkish constitution, it is nonetheless known to have taken initiatives that give cause to doubt the truth of that claim; for example, it has campaigned for the abolition of the ban on the headscarf and for more extensive Islamic instruction."
"To what degree does the Council share the concern expressed by critics of the creeping Islamicisation threatened by this party, and in what ways is this threat being considered in the course of the accession negotiations?"
"I would refer the honourable Member to the explanations given to him in response to an oral question in the April question session, and would like to reiterate that the Presidency attaches great importance to the constant improvement of integrated border control at the external borders of the European Union and, in particular, to the reinforcement of the maritime external borders to the south."
"Further to this, the Council has already stressed, in its conclusions on the reinforcement of the southern sea frontier on 5 and 6 October 2006, that Frontex has to be built up by means of additional personnel and increased budgetary resources."
"In order to improve Frontex' immediate response capability in emergency situations, the Commission put forward, in 2006, a proposal for the formation of rapid reaction border intervention teams."
"The Council has had fruitful discussions with your House on this proposal, and your House voted on the text of the proposal on 26 April this year, so that the Council can adopt it at first reading."
"The Presidency's ambition is that the text should be able to be adopted by the Council over the next few weeks, so that the instrument can be applied over the coming summer period."
"In accordance with its working programme for 2007, Frontex will, as well as completing the European Patrol Network, be carrying out a number of joint operations on the maritime borders, the number and location of which will be determined by its management board."
"Finally, the Council wishes to stress that the Commission, in accordance with the Hague Programme, which the European Council adopted on 4 November 2004, will, before the end of this year, be submitting an evaluation report on the agency."
"(ES) The President mentioned my question of last April."
"The FRONTEX system is effective, but the big problem is the interruption."
"A quick interruption of a couple of weeks has led to the arrival over recent weeks of over a thousand immigrants in the Canary Islands, with the whole dramatic situation that that implies."
"Our concern is that that system should be permanent and I hope that, by means of the measures announced by the President-in-Office of the Council, that system will really be permanent, since each day or week without it may mean the deaths of hundreds of people in the waters of the Atlantic."
"I can assure Mr Medina Ortega that I am well aware of the problem, for we too get to see these things in the media, and the people on the ground, too, are aware of what this means for the refugees and for those who have to look after them."
"I said back in April, in response to a question, that the protection of the external border is in the first instance a task for the Member State in question, while assistance may be sought from Frontex in a particular situation, in which case immediate response teams can also be formed."
"This all depends on the interaction between the relevant Member States and the Frontex agency itself."
"The question was about the Atlantic, but I would like to bring to your attention the human tragedy, which is taking place as we speak, in the Mediterranean, where last weekend just one person survived from a boat carrying 29 people 75 nautical miles to the south of Malta."
"Yesterday 24 people were saved at sea and one person remained unaccounted for after a boat capsized."
"Also yesterday, another boat with 53 people on board went missing."
"It simply disappeared and could not be traced."
"My question is: why have the Frontex patrols not started already in the Mediterranean?"
"When will they be started?"
"And what is the Presidency doing about this?"
"(FR) Minister, I was head of the election observation mission in Mauritania."
"I can tell you that not a week goes by without a boat arriving, running aground, and requesting assistance, during its voyage to the Canaries."
"These poor souls must be accommodated, and, as may sometimes be the case, they must be accommodated in the Mediterranean waters."
"I should therefore like to know what resources the European Union - this European Union that uses up so many resources on protecting its borders - is making available to neighbouring countries, that is to say, to Mauritania, which is a transit country - these countries are not migrant countries, but merely transit countries and host countries - and what resources the European Union is putting in place to help these countries to manage this issue."
"I am sure that Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou is aware that we would all like to have the opportunity or the freedom to travel in ways other than we are, but, measures have been taken in the European Union in the form of the Regulation that the Commission adopted in October 2006, in order that a certain standard of safety should be guaranteed."
"The adoption of this regulation is a matter for the Commission, which has been supported in this by the Civil Aviation Safety Committee, which is composed of representatives from the Member States and was acting in accordance with its own rules."
"Since the Commission has undertaken to have these measures reviewed six months following their adoption, questions pertaining to this regulation should be addressed directly to the Commission, which is responsible for such a review."
"I would remind the honourable Member and the House that the Council's functions as regards air safety is limited to the examination of legislative proposals on the framework conditions for the relevant safety measures, further to which the Council and your House are currently discussing the Commission's proposal for a Regulation of the Council and Parliament to lay down common rules for safety in civil aviation, which it is intended should replace the Regulation currently in force."
"(EL) Thank you, Minister, for your reply."
"My question was whether citizens have any facility for filing complaints which could then be taken into account by the Commission and, if you, as the Council, could not propose the free distribution of water, even if just for short trips, and if you are seeing to an environmental evaluation of waste from this measure."
"Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I do believe that it is in everyone's interests, particularly of the travellers themselves, that they should be able to fly with the maximum of safety."
"None of this was done on the spur of the moment, and there were concrete reasons why security under these conditions had to be guaranteed."
"It is certainly important that the persons involved be asked just what all this achieved."
"It is unfortunate that there are at present no other mechanisms for examining things in a more transparent manner and perhaps as simply as was formerly the case, but none of the members of the public who are happy to avail themselves of their freedom of movement and their freedom to travel would understand persons responsible for their safety and freedom not themselves guaranteeing the highest possible standard of security."
"If new technical developments make it possible to do this in new ways without such hindrances, then all parties will surely be happy to accept them."
"Further to the points that you have made, despite all the information provided as to all the things that may no longer be taken through the checkpoints, there are still far too many members of the public taking their own bottles of mineral water and fruit juice or other items with them. If people were to take some responsibility for themselves, then, it might well help reduce the amount of rubbish."
"I can advise the honourable Member that there is a hearing on that tomorrow."
"Picking up on what the President-in-Office has just said, does he feel that the sentiments expressed in this question are naive and include insinuations, cheap generalisations and, I would say, criticisms of valued security staff at our airports?"
"Further, would the Council agree that perhaps, for example, paying a bit more for water and sacrificing some convenience at our airports is a small price to pay if it means increased security for passengers, lower risks of terrorist attacks and improved welfare for all people using the airports, whether departing, arriving or transiting through airports?"
"(LT) Madam President, Minister, a month ago in this venue the same question was put to a European Commission representative, but we did not get a clear answer."
"Really, I agree, the most important priority is safety, but nonetheless it is probably time to review that decision and either ease off on that measure or get strict with it."
"What do you think?"
"(EL) Madam President, I am sorry but I can only assume two things: either that my supplementary question was not translated or that the President-in-Office of the Council did not reply at all to what I asked him."
"I asked specific questions: if I, like any other European citizen, can voice my complaint following this control."
"I also asked about the waste ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"The Presidency takes the view that discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, religion or outlook on life, disability, age or sexual orientation is incompatible with the foundational principles of the European Union, and the EU institutions have denounced such discrimination whenever it has appeared in any form whatever;"
"I would also refer you to the debate held here in this House a few weeks ago."
"The Presidency also promotes freedom of assembly and association and expresses opposition to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and I will take this opportunity to reiterate that any increase in racist and homophobic violence in Europe or elsewhere in the world is a matter of concern to it."
"By virtue of the powers conferred upon it by the Treaties, the European Union pursues with determination an explicit policy of combating the phenomena to which I have referred not only within its own borders but also through its external policy measures; in its foreign relations, the European Union actively endeavours within the United Nations to combat discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and so it was that it, with others, in 2006, mounted a successful campaign for groups of homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals to be unconditionally granted consultative status by the Committee for Non-Governmental Organisations of the United Nations Economic and Social Council."
"Those are indeed fine sentiments, but what I am interested in is whether we are translating the sentiments into action."
"We have EU Member States not only banning Gay Pride marches in the case of Poland, getting a condemnation from the European Court of Human Rights; now we have the Vilnius authorities saying that the EU Equal Opportunities Bus cannot be received in the city."
"Surely this is a matter of breach of Article 6 of the EU Treaty on Human Rights and Article 13 of the EC Treaty on non-discrimination."
"What is the Council and the Presidency saying to the Governments of Poland and Lithuania and other EU countries which are not respecting equality law?"
"Is Vilnius the right place to locate the Gender Institute in the light of these very disturbing tendencies in that city?"
"Mr Posselt, we do share the concern evident in your question on the position concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Northern Caucasus and Russia as a whole, and, for that reason too, we are keeping developments under continual observation."
"The Council regularly brings this concern to Russia's attention in the course of the EU/Russia dialogue, to which I have just made reference in another instance, and various levels have been established at which concerns may be raised with the Russians, not only in policy dialogue at summits and ministerial meetings, but also at the human rights consultations which were introduced in March 2005 under the presidency of Luxembourg and now take place twice a year."
"At these consultations, the EU regularly expresses its particular concerns in relation to the situation in the Chechen Republic."
"The fifth human rights consultations are now a fixed component in relations between the EU and Russia, and the latest round took place on 3 May, with the situation in Chechnya on its agenda."
"While we are on this subject, I should also like to mention that the TACIS action programme for social and economic reconstruction in the Northern Caucasus, which is funded by the EU to the tune of EUR 20 million, has now become operational, and it offers the prospect of positive developments being brought about."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, just as the Federal Chancellor, at the weekend, demonstrated that it is possible to combine firmness of purpose and faithfulness to principle with diplomatic adroitness, you are doing the same here."
"I would like to ask now - and this is a very practical question - just what can be done to improve access to Chechnya."
"Are you doing anything to this end?"
"Secondly, elections in Chechnya are held under the supervision of the OSCE, and the Council of Europe has done a great deal too."
"All that has been brought to nothing."
"Would it not be possible for the EU, as a community within the Council of Europe and the OSCE, to press for new initiatives for direct action in Chechnya?"
"Mr Bushill-Matthews, the Council would refer you in the first instance to its answer of 5 March of this year to the written question on this subject, in which it explained why it was that, in 2001, anti-dumping tariffs were imposed on the import of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps originating from the People's Republic of China, and in which it also stated that the Commission, on 17 July 2006, had begun a review further to the imminent cessation of these measures' applicability in line with Article 11(2) of the Anti-Dumping Regulation and that it was expected that this review would be completed within at most 15 months, that is to say by October 2007."
"Once the Commission has arrived at its conclusions, it will forward a proposal to the Council, which will then have a month in which to decide whether or not to agree to it."
"No such proposal has as yet been submitted to the Council, nor is it as yet aware of the final positions taken by the Member States."
"I can assure you, however, that any decision will take the interests of all parties into account."
"I am sure that you will understand that the Commission and the Council, when enacting trade protection measures, constantly consider the facts and the various interests involved - for example those of producers, users, importers and consumers - and try to keep them in balance in order to make it possible for a suitable level of protection to be guaranteed to the branch of industry in question."
"What that means is that action will be taken only to such an extent as will make it possible for the Community sector in question to be protected against unfair practices in third countries, and only for such a length of time as is in the interests of the Community."
"Well that was a most diplomatically crafted answer, but perhaps I could try again in a slightly different context."
"I see announced in the paper today that a certain food processing company is now asking for protection against imports of sweetcorn from Thailand."
"Is the Council - not the Commission - concerned at the growing tide of protectionism coming up from fellow Member States and is the Council under your Presidency going to provide any leadership to combat this?"
"The intention is that the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on the facilitation of the visa system should enter into force with effect from 1 June 2007, and this, too, was the subject of a debate here in this House a few weeks ago."
"The object of this agreement is to make it easier to issue visas for a planned stay of no more than 90 days in duration for nationals of the Russian Federation travelling to EU Member States, or for citizens of the European Union travelling to the Russian Federation."
"According to this agreement, a national of the Russian Federation is a person possessing Russian Federation nationality or having acquired it in accordance with Russia's own regulations."
"The consequence of that is that, in accordance with the law as it currently stands, the agreement is applicable to all Russian citizens irrespective of the country in which they live."
"No initiatives have been taken to mandate the Commission to commence negotiations on a similar agreement with Georgia, for provision is already made in the EU-Georgia action plan and within the European Neighbourhood Policy for the initiation of a dialogue on the transit of persons, with specific reference to issues of return and the visa problem."
"(FR) Minister, you have given me exactly the same answer that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner gave me three times, but you are not in fact answering the question."
"The question concerns the facilitation of the visa system for persons residing on Georgian territory, in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, and to whom Russia has kindly offered nationality by issuing them with Russian passports - even though these people are Georgian - to the extent that the people of Georgia are subject to a system of double standards."
"My question is this: did you weigh up the fact that, when the visa system was facilitated for Russian citizens, those persons, to whom Russia has granted nationality, with passports in support of this, and who, residing on Georgian territory, are Georgians from Abkhazia or South Ossetia, were going to benefit from the facilitation of the visa system, while the people of Georgia themselves would not benefit from it?"
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, what is the Council's position as regards similar favourable visa arrangements for states such as Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus?"
"I think it very important that we should not forget them."
"I can tell Mrs Isler Béguin that, if the Commission and the Council have given the same answer three times over, that does not mean that they have given a wrong or incomplete one; that is the legal position."
"Listening to your question, though, I alighted on the political issue of how one can - in view of the frozen conflicts in these regions - make concessionary arrangements for the citizens in, for example, Georgia or - as Mr Paleckis has just pointed out - in other countries."
"These issues are the subjects of negotiations in the context of the specific relationships, and with Georgia, for example, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy."
"It is quite clear to me that the special relationship between the EU and Ukraine or Belarus makes it necessary for us, in these specific cases, to keep on trying to bring about such agreements in accordance with the provisions of the EU and with the Schengen regime."
"Thank you, President-in-Office and thank you all for helping us get through more questions than I anticipated."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.05 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Beniamino Donnici (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the verification of the credentials of Mr Beniamino Donnici."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention in this Chamber the work carried out in committee, which has thoroughly discussed the credentials of Mr Donnici, resulting in a large majority in favour of the report."
"I defend the committee, of which I have the great honour to be chairman, and I would like to answer those making petty insinuations to the effect that the committee has not been calm or objective - insinuations that clearly do nothing to honour this Parliament, given that the committee contains many jurists."
"We have people and jurists such as Mr Lehne, Mr Medina, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Frassoni, to mention just the coordinators, and also very many other prominent figures throughout the committee."
"Our discussions were always at a high level, and were conducted exhaustively and with great sincerity."
"We always focused primarily on the role of this Parliament, which is a giant in terms of many things that it does and its role in Europe, but a dwarf on some occasions when you want to force it into a procedural corner."
"The issue we were discussing comes within this major issue: the facts are known, the withdrawal by Mr Occhetto infringes the European Act, and we cannot give Mr Donnici a positive verdict."
"The rules governing the European election procedure fall within the Community's jurisdiction and therefore the reference to national provisions laid down in the 1976 European Act is of a solely supplementary character."
"The national provisions must, however, conform to the fundamental principals of the Community legal system, its primary rules and the spirit of the wording of the 1976 Act."
"For these reasons, the relevant legislative and administrative national authorities, as well as the jurisdictional authorities, may not omit to take account of the Community legal framework on election issues."
"The admissibility of the withdrawal by Mr Occhetto must be assessed firstly on the basis of Article 4 of the 1976 Act, pursuant to which Members of Parliament may not be bound by instructions and may not receive a binding mandate, and the freedom and independence of parliamentary representatives constitutes a fundamental cornerstone of the freedom of citizens."
"This is laid down in the 1976 Act, but the new Statute for Members of the European Parliament, which I now quote, even though it enters into force for the next parliamentary term, is, in the current state of the Community legal system, a legislative act of primary law, adopted by the European Parliament with the approval of the Council and published in the Official Journal."
"It is perfectly obvious that the withdrawal from election made by Mr Occhetto is the result of an expression of will that has been affected and vitiated by an agreement made prior to the proclamation of those elected in the 2004 European elections, that this agreement was entered into with the other member of the Società civile Di Pietro-Occhetto list, and that this withdrawal must be considered incompatible with the letter and spirit of the Act of 1976, and specifically with Article 6."
"It could not under any circumstances be validly revoked, as it was revoked."
"In the grounds for the judgment holding the opposite to be true, the Italian Council of State - I want to confirm this in this Chamber, as an Italian - did not mention or take into account in any way the aforementioned principles of Community law, thereby disregarding not only the spirit and the letter of the Act but also Article 4 and Article 6 of the text."
"Pursuant to settled case law by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the infringement of Community law by the authorities of a Member State, even when committed by a legal body of the highest level, through a final judgment, does not prevent the Court of Justice from holding that the supreme national court is in breach of Community law as mentioned above."
"This does not, however, constitute a waiver of the responsibility of the State - in this case, Italy - to which the said court belongs, as has been established."
"I believe that all this clearly demonstrates the situation in which we find ourselves."
"I would like to quickly explain two things that are part of Italian law."
"The act of withdrawal may validly have existing rights as its object, and in such a case the withdrawal made by Mr Occhetto with regard to Mr Chiesa is, because of its explanation, fully valid and effective."
"The withdrawal also holds valid for future rights, but naturally the withdrawal may certainly be revoked before the event ends, before the withdrawing party finds himself in the actual circumstance of being able to withdraw."
"The withdrawal expressed by Mr Occhetto following the proclamation of the electoral results did not alter the classification of the candidates on the Di Pietro-Occhetto list."
"The final argument, Mr President, is that we must recognise as a basic principle of law the fact that withdrawal can only take effect at the moment in which the necessary prerequisites exist for the right to be realised."
"For this very reason, in the decision of 3 July 2006 that is alleged to contradict what we have done - in fact because of that decision by the Committee on Legal Affairs - we have confirmed the election of Mr Occhetto, because at the time the proclamation was in conformity with the European Act, in that we recognised his withdrawal to be invalid, improper and null and void."
"The exceptions with regard to Mr Donnici were then irrelevant."
"It is because of this that there is no contradiction."
"We took this decision last year, and today we can confirm that decision because it is consistent, thoroughly reflected on by a Committee on Legal Affairs that naturally has no partisan interest, but has every interest in promoting and guaranteeing the autonomy of this Parliament."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I believe that we are at an important moment in the history of this Parliament."
"The rapporteur, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, has explained the legal reasoning, with which we agree."
"My group has tabled a series of amendments aimed at enhancing this kind of legal reasoning."
"We should look at the issue from a rather broader perspective, however."
"The European Parliament - the Committee on Legal Affairs - has always recognised the decisions of the national authorities with regard to the appointment of an MEP, and has also recognised electoral dispute procedures."
"What is not acceptable is for the Italian judiciary, practically three years after the last elections, a year after Mr Occhetto was accepted as a Member of this Parliament, to suddenly tell us that that appointment was not valid."
"Mr Gargani has explained the reasons from a legal point of view, but there is a fundamental political aspect: Parliament is made up of Members appointed in accordance with national law, by means of decisions by national authorities: administrative, electoral or judicial."
"Once we are in this Parliament, however, Parliament constitutes a body in its own right, with its own personality, with the right to defend itself."
"I believe that the Occhetto case is going to set a great parliamentary precedent."
"From this point onwards, the national administrative or judicial authorities will know that Parliament has the power, at a given moment, to declare that a national decision does not comply with the law, that it has been arbitrary."
"Parliament has the right and the duty to protect its Members."
"If we do not do so, Mr President, we shall be exposed to a situation in which, as a result of an arbitrary decision by a national authority or national court, you or any other Member of this Parliament can have their status as MEP taken away."
"It is essential to our parliamentary work that Members of Parliament should feel secure when carrying out their work."
"I believe that Mr Gargani has done a great job as chairman - we have discussed many issues over many years - and in this case we have an agreement that is accepted by all of the parties, which does not reflect any party-political interest, but which responds to the need to defend the very status of the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament, the body that represents the people of Europe, is established as a body in its own right and makes its own decisions."
"It is not like the Council, which is subject to the vicissitudes of national politics."
"We MEPs have a mandate, a fixed-term mandate that cannot be interrupted by means of an arbitrary national decision."
"I shall therefore say once again that the Occhetto decision will be an historic decision in the history of Parliament, in the history of the affirmation of the personality of Parliament and of the rights of MEPs."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one thing with which I agree, it is that there is a risk that the decision by this Parliament may mark a genuinely historic step, in that it will compromise issues, problems, principles and rules that go far beyond this specific event."
"This Parliament has never cast doubt upon the principle and rule laid down by the provisions of the Treaty on the national jurisdiction to settle disputes relating to electoral procedure and, thus, to proclaim those elected, with regard to whom Parliament then proceeds to carry out the so-called 'verification of credentials' - in other words, verification of electoral offices."
"To confirm what I am saying, instead of commenting on it I would like to quote word for word the content of Parliament's decision, adopted on 14 December 2004 by this plenary, validating the mandate of all of us who were elected in those European elections."
"The mandate was declared valid, and I quote exactly '...subject to any decisions by the competent authorities of Member States in which the election results have been disputed'."
"This plenary confirmed a rule that is well-known to all!"
"I would like to add that in support of its decision the Committee on Legal Affairs refers to several articles both from the European Election Act and from the Rules of Procedure, referring to Parliament's jurisdiction to intervene in the event of resignations."
"We are not talking about any resignations!"
"The issue on which the Italian courts handed down a judgment relates to the dispute or the resolution of the dispute regarding the election, once Mr Di Pietro had resigned as a Member of this Parliament, his replacement being Mr Occhetto or Mr Donnici."
"The dispute was resolved by means of a provisional judgment, subject to appeal, which resulted in the proclamation of Mr Occhetto as the successful candidate; then came the judgment by the Italian Council of State - the Electoral Office, it is the same thing, Mr Gargani, it is not important - then came the judgment on the dispute, the final judgment by the Council of State, which proclaimed Mr Donnici as the successful candidate."
"Let us not discuss the resignations by Mr Occhetto, their compatibility with the wording, with the letter or with the mandate - let us simply discuss the prerogative and the jurisdiction of the national authorities to proclaim a Member, whose electoral credentials are then verified."
"The consequences of the vote that we are about to make would involve a serious institutional conflict, breach of the provisions of the Treaty, and a possible empty seat, because in any case it would be for the national authorities to proclaim the person elected to replace the person whose mandate was not validated."
"I will end by expressing my full appreciation for the members of the committee."
"Mr Gargani, nobody is casting doubt on the competence of the members; on the contrary, you have all my admiration, because the real skill of a jurist can be seen not when he is defending just causes, but when he is defending lost causes."
"I have every appreciation and respect for the way in which you have succeeded in obtaining this result."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all respect to the multitude of authoritative jurists with which the Committee on Legal Affairs is swarming, more modestly, I believe that if this Chamber were to approve the Gargani report tomorrow, the European Parliament would be committing a very serious and unprecedented act. It would be an unheard-of abuse of a Member who would see himself illegitimately deprived of his parliamentary mandate, and an unprecedented and unique breach of the treaties which, on electoral matters, clearly recognise the pre-eminence of the laws, procedures and authority of the Member States."
"This would be a serious conflict with a Member State, which would be deprived of a Member recognised as such by the laws and the legal authority of that country."
"Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs has usurped powers that do not belong to it."
"I do not side with either of the two contenders."
"I am politically indifferent because they are both from the centre left;"
"I understand Mr Occhetto's personal problem, for which I have empathy in purely human terms. What is at stake here, though, is the law, the correct composition of the European Parliament and the credibility of the highest Community institution."
"Justice, and only justice, must therefore be done, and any hint of politics and petty political party calculations must be left aside."
"What sort of trust can the citizens place in a European Parliament that distorts its own composition by excluding a Member who is eminently qualified to be a part of it?"
"Let us look at the facts: the legal authority proclaimed Mr Donnici as the successful candidate, in an unappealable judgment."
"The Italian State notified the European Parliament of his election."
"The committee was charged with verifying Mr Donnici's credentials."
"It was supposed to verify the offices he held and any incompatibility in them."
"It is of course true that it could examine appeals by third parties and therefore it legitimately examined the challenges put forward by Mr Occhetto."
"What it could not do was to declare null and void an act delivered before a public official of a Member State."
"This is a legal act that may be carried out solely by the legal authority of the Member State that has dealt with the matter and that has handed down an irrevocable and unappealable judgment."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank Mr Gargani, because the issue has been very complex and difficult, and the work has been completed with great wisdom and with a sense of responsibility, in accordance with just one criterion: safeguarding, above all, the rights and prerogatives of this Parliament."
"The main or crucial point of the decisions taken is right and, above all, it avoids a precedent being set, namely the recognition of acts or initiatives that restrict the choices of candidates or of those who are about to become MEPs."
"It is true that this is a first, and probably also sets a precedent, but this precedent and this first are fair and guarantee the prerogatives of the European Parliament."
"The decisions that we are taking are linked to a function and to a prerogative that is granted to us, giving us the right to express ourselves, to accept, to assess or to reject credentials and acts that are put before us."
"So this is not a case of going beyond our territory, but just the right to express an opinion that is given to us by this Parliament itself."
"It is necessary firstly to protect the rights of our colleagues and secondly the rights of the European Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) I will vote against the proposal for a decision, for the following reasons which, I am certain, will be accepted by the Court of Justice."
"The proposal is misguided because:"
"1) in general, the appointment of those elected is the province of national bodies, as provided by Articles 7 and 11 of the Act of 20 September 1976;"
"2) in letter C: Mr Occhetto did not withdraw from the mandate at all, but from nomination by the Italian central electoral office and his position in the list of the candidates voted for; the withdrawal referred to in Rule 3(5) of the Rules of Procedure is that of a Member who has already been appointed and does not refer to acts preceding appointment;"
"3) in letter D: the prohibition on a binding mandate relates to the exercise of a mandate already received, and not to events preceding the appointment;"
"4) in letters E, F and G: the reference to the Statute for Members that has not yet entered into force is irrelevant, and so is the reference to Members subsequent to appointment;"
"5) in letters J, I, K and L: the Italian Council of State not only annulled but also amended the previous decision by the regional administrative tribunal, in a judgment not subject to appeal;"
"6) point 2: Parliament cannot replace the Italian office appointing a Member of Parliament."
"Common organisation of agricultural markets (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Niels Busk, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products - C6-0045/2007 -."
"Madam President, I want to start by thanking Parliament, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and the rapporteur, Mr Busk, for the swift and constructive way the proposal was dealt with."
"Secondly, on behalf of Mrs Fischer-Boel, I am grateful for the political support you are giving to the proposal."
"I also greatly appreciate the positive thrust of the Committee on Agriculture's report."
"We are discussing a very specific subject: the European Parliament's opinion on the single common market organisation, or CMO."
"Simplification in the field of agriculture is one of the flagships of the Commission."
"This text is different from most Commission proposals in the area of the CAP."
"Why?"
"With the single CMO we want to make an important step towards simplifying and improving the legislative framework of the common agricultural policy."
"I know that it has become popular to talk about simplification and better regulation."
"This proposal shows very clearly what these terms can mean in practice."
"The single CMO will merge all 21 CMOs into one text."
"It will replace more than 40 Council regulations and almost 620 articles and it will reduce the number of articles and pages in the Official Journal by more than two thirds."
"Apart from such merely quantitative parameters, the single CMO will make our market legislation more homogenous and consistent, in other words more easily accessed and read and thus better understood and applied."
"According to the Presidency's planning, this proposal will be discussed at the meeting of the Special Committee for Agriculture on 29 May and 4 June and probably on 11 June in the Council."
"Let me also at this stage thank Parliament for helping make this early decision possible."
"From time to time the Commission is told that the single CMO is not enough to make our farmers' lives easier."
"I fully agree."
"It takes more than one legislative text to achieve real simplification."
"That is why the single CMO is only one element, even though a very important one, of several components of simplification strategy in agriculture."
"Other components, as you will recall, include the Commission's cross-compliance report, which will have a real impact on farmers' lives once its proposals are implemented, the simplification action plan, currently with 37 practical measures, which agriculture is busy implementing, and the health check, which will also be targeted at further simplifying the CAP."
"But back to the CMO."
"As I have already said, on behalf of the Commission, I appreciate the positive tone of the report and I will therefore be able to accept a number of amendments set out in the Committee on Agriculture report."
"But you will not be surprised that I have some serious difficulties with some of the proposed amendments because I believe they would unnecessarily reduce the proposal's impact."
"I would like to mention two points of particular importance."
"First there is the request to keep two areas entirely out of the single CMO until they are reformed: fruit and vegetables and wine."
"I do not share this view but I could accept incorporation of their substantive parts only after the reform processes are over."
"The second point concerns the set-up of the management committee."
"The Committee on Agriculture report recommends four subsections."
"This would in our view be in contradiction with the single CMO and make the new committee unnecessarily inflexible."
"But I can assure you that the Commission is determined to organise the meetings of the single committee in such a way as to include the necessary expertise and take account of the specificities of the sectors concerned."
"Thank you for your attention at this late hour."
"I am looking forward to the discussion."
"rapporteur. - (DA) Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I should like to thank the German Presidency and the Commission for their particularly constructive cooperation during the preparation of this report."
"The cooperation has been based on openness and trust and has without a doubt contributed to this report being adopted by a very large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I would, of course, also thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for some interesting debates and for their major contribution to this report."
"It has, overall, been a pleasure to cooperate with them on this matter."
"The Commission has put forward a very ambitious proposal, which I welcome."
"It is good to simplify and to create openness and transparency, and transparency is something that I do most certainly believe that this proposal will result in."
"That being said, it should be added that this simplification is most evident of all in the legislative document itself, which overall has been reduced from 600 to 200 pages."
"This shows that a lot has happened."
"This legislative package constitutes the agricultural industry's framework conditions, and the overarching objective should be to create clarity regarding the framework conditions, and in such a way that those at whom this report is targeted, namely the operators, also perceive the changes as a simplification."
"There is no real policy change here, and the simplification will not be noticed in any way by the end-user, that is to say the farmer."
"During the process, many people have complained that what has taken place has been anything but a simplification."
"The operators have until now worked with one market organisation or perhaps with quite a small number of them. These are now to be incorporated into just the one, which will comprise all the old organisations."
"Some people may not immediately perhaps see the changes as a simplification."
"For those, however, who use more than one of the sector-specific market organisations or those who want to obtain an overview of the different market organisations, this consolidated set of regulations is definitely a simplification."
"The Commission proposes that a number of provisions of a technical nature be transferred from the Council to the Commission."
"The provisions concerned are ones that, until now, the Council has been able to adopt without first consulting the European Parliament."
"These are what are known as the second-generation agreements. Insofar as we are concerned exclusively in this case with provisions of a purely technical nature, I think it very appropriate to transfer these, as a regulatory power, to the Commission, which will thus be able to take some very rapid and effective decisions."
"I should like, however, to emphasise that any decision of a political nature must still be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 37 of the Treaty, that is to say after consulting the European Parliament."
"As a natural extension of the simplification, the Commission proposes that, in future, only one management committee be employed."
"That is something I am very sceptical about, since I cannot imagine only one management committee being able to provide the necessary expertise."
"There are such big differences between the many market mechanisms we have, for example as regards animal production and vegetable production, and that applies within all the various sectors."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has therefore proposed that four management committees be set up."
"This is an area that I want the Commission to keep a careful eye on and that it should also report on."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would like a progress report to be drawn up two years down the line."
"We shall then have to look more closely at the number of management committees."
"We must look at the organisation and at the support we receive from experts, and we must take an overall look at how this very important area - the market sector - operates."
"In conclusion, I should like to wish the Commission good luck."
"I am convinced that it will continue to be possible for the Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to cooperate in this area."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to our rapporteur Mr Busk for the truly constructive, collegial and - in my opinion - very good work he has done in cooperation with the other members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"We have all been calling for a simplification of the CAP and the market organisations for a long time."
"I am delighted that it is agricultural policy, the only policy really brought within the Community, that is prepared to take this course."
"I warmly welcome the fact that these 21 regulations on sector-specific market organisations are being combined into a single Regulation, and thus that the legal framework is being streamlined."
"The rapporteur has already specified the benefits of this single common market organisation."
"In my opinion, the CAP should be managed by means of the four basic regulations."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur that this can only be a matter of technical changes, which are dealt with by the Commission, and not of changes to political decisions."
"We, as representatives and Members of the European Parliament, want to, and must, insist on having codecision powers and on participating in dealing with these issues."
"I also consider it important that the wine and the fruit and vegetables sectors be exempted, as the process of reform for these is not yet complete."
"I am also in favour of the special management committees, as, particularly in very specific matters, things cannot just be lumped together."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and say on behalf of my group that this is a very successful report."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) In theory, I cannot believe that anyone could object to the principles of simplifying, streamlining and removing bureaucracy announced by the Commission in this proposal to bring the 21 current regulations under one single regulation."
"Anything that can be done to remove or reduce the bureaucratic intricacies woven by agricultural policy while it has been in force, which in some cases have been the most surreal puzzle for farmers, has to be applauded."
"When it comes to the practical benefits of the proposal for farmers' lives, one cannot help but feel a certain amount of disappointment."
"The proposal is a good exercise in codification, insofar as it brings a series of dispersed rules under one single text."
"I also welcome the inclusion of the new common market organisations (CMOs) for various products thus far covered by standards that did not constitute genuine CMOs and the fact that other rules adopted by the Council not currently part of CMOs have been brought under the same regulation."
"The reduction in the number of management committees will also certainly lead to some savings for the Commission's budget, although there is a serious risk of a drop in the technical level."
"All of these are real gains for the Commission services but, let me repeat, I do not expect real gains for the farmers, who are the biggest victims of the complexity of the bureaucratic system."
"For these reasons, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament gives the benefit of the doubt to the Commission's proposal, and seeks to contribute by means of amendments on its initiative and by supporting others aimed at improving upon the proposal."
"Examples of this include re-establishing the balance of powers between the Commission and the Council, clarification and strengthening of the role of interbranch organisations and the guarantee of adequate involvement of the Member States in a more limited number of management committees, with the aim of ensuring that the technical quality is kept at an acceptable level."
"We also support the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development aimed at excluding the CMOs under review from the new regulation, as we believe that their inclusion at this time could lead to less compliance among participants with the ongoing process, the conclusion of which cannot and must not be brought forward."
"The Commission will hopefully welcome these constructive suggestions, which I am sure Parliament will adopt by a resounding majority."
"Lastly, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I should like to commend the work of the rapporteur, Mr Busk, and all those who helped to achieve a broad consensus on the core issues."
"Madam President, the initiative to simplify the common agricultural policy and to adopt more comprehensible and transparent legal norms deserves our support, but on condition that the new regulation does not end up imposing yet another set of technical - supposedly universal - standards on the Community."
"This begs the question as to whether such wide-ranging simplification is not tantamount to restricting specialisation, and the loss of sensitivity to specific agricultural conditions."
"The Commission assures us that these are merely technical amendments, but in reality it also wants to take some of the powers away from the Council."
"The Commission also assures us that all decisions of a political nature are taken in accordance with Article 37 of the EU Treaty, after consultation with the European Parliament."
"But we know that this is not the case."
"One instance of this rule being infringed was the sugar market reform."
"Now, under the guise of technical amendments, it is trying to intervene in the pork market, which in combination with the elimination of maize subsidies, will destabilise these areas of agriculture and will again hit farmers' pockets."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group - (PL) Madam President, please allow me to re-iterate the fundamental facts of discrimination against the new Member States in the framework of the so-called 'common' agricultural policy."
"And note that these statistics come from EU institutions."
"For example, in 2004 the new Member States had 22% of the total farmland, but received just under 4% in subsidies."
"Per-hectare agricultural and rural development subsidies in 2007 were EUR 148 per hectare for the new Member States, and EUR 366 per hectare for the old Member States."
"A similar imbalance is expected for 2013, which means we face ten years of discrimination against the new Member States, thereby losing the opportunity to build up a strong European agriculture."
"Imbalances in the allocation of milk quotas persist."
"Holland, which has one-eighth of the farmland that Poland has, has a higher milk quota."
"As regards the sugar market, the reform mainly favours the old Member States, which are the ones responsible for over-production in the first place."
"And finally, the fruit and vegetable market, where some EUR 700 million are allocated to producers' organisations."
"90% of these subsidies go to three Member States where they go to a narrow circle of the most powerful producers' organisations."
"The processed fruit and vegetables market currently enjoys EUR 775 million of subsidies, of which more than 86% go to just three old Member States, and 2.5% goes to the new Member States."
"All new Member States receive one-tenth of the average for one old Member State."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in his speech before this House on 25 of April this year, the Indian President Abdul Kalam said amongst others that achieving a lasting solution required 'righteousness in the heart'."
"His message was warmly received with ovations by yourselves."
"The agricultural market reforms we are discussing today has many good points: it will simplify legislation and reduce administrative costs, and make the lives of farmers easier."
"But it has one fundamental flaw, and that is that it does not have 'righteousness in the heart', as it fails to correct the unfair subsidies for farmers on individual markets."
"It affects mainly the poorer farmers in the new Member States."
"The poor get less, and the rich more."
"This has nothing to do with fundamental principles of the European Union, such as solidarity."
"The rules of the CAP are blatantly breached in many markets."
"Repeated attempts to introduce fair subsidies for farmers in particular markets have proved ineffective."
"Statistical data showing clear discrimination have been ignored."
"The European Commission's present proposal retains some of the organisational defects of individual markets."
"It is artificial, unfair and cut off from the real situation."
"Voting for simplification in this situation is voting for continued injustice and discrimination."
"So I appeal mainly to the Members representing the new Member States: do not vote for simplification, because despite its apparent merits, it discriminates against your farmers."
"At the same time I appeal to the representatives of old Member States: do you know that financial discrimination against the new states is a threat to the future of the entire European Union, and perpetuates the division of the EU into rich and poor by denying the idea of building a strong Europe capable of competing on the global market?"
"For this reason I am voting against the Commission's proposal and against adopting this report."
"While I realise that simplifying legislation is necessary, it should only happen when individual markets have been organised fairly."
"My fellow Europeans, let us all have 'righteousness in the heart'!"
"- Madam President, consolidation of 21 regulations on sector-specific common market organisations into a single regulation which combines all sectors as a simplification step is welcome."
"But it is the impact delivered on the ground that really matters."
"Simplification must translate into noticeable improvements in terms of a lesser bureaucratic burden for the agri-food sector right across the Member States."
"If I have one major concern: we must not denude the new management committee - or committees, if it be that - of the valuable expertise which existed on the outgoing sectoral management committees."
"A super CMO which, on the face of it, ticks the boxes of regulation reduction but which diminishes expert sectoral input would only be a short-term gain."
"A triumph of bureaucrats over experts from the sectors is not a good deal."
"Sectoral expertise has been valuable and must be preserved."
"Thus, I think we need to hear more from the Commission in terms of assurances and indications as to how sectoral expertise will, in fact, be retained, utilised and respected."
"- (PL) Madam President, today we are debating the simplification of CAP legislation."
"On the table is the creation of a unified common agricultural market organisation in place of the 21 sectors that currently exist."
"We will be able to abrogate 41 Council regulations containing more than 600 articles and replace them by one single regulation."
"These activities obviously deserve a positive response, if they lead to an improvement in EU legislation and will be more readily understood by farmers and taxpayers."
"However, it all appears somewhat unrealistic."
"Let me give you an example: the paying authority in Poland is now accepting applications for direct payments for the third time."
"This year they have been so simplified that we were late in submitting them because the farmers had problems filling them in."
"The whole idea of simplification will be technical in nature, and therefore cannot by metamorphosed in the latest CAP reform."
"Removing intervention purchases for the pork meat market is not acceptable."
"I would also tread carefully on the matter of transferring the Council's regulatory authority to the Commission, as it may give Member States less say in the decision-making process concerning the functioning of the first pillar of the CAP."
"Another question that arises is what is the point of making all of these changes, when we are in the process of reforming the fruit and vegetable and wine markets anyway, and we do not know the results of the 2008 health check which will generally determine the future of the CAP."
"In my view, we should streamline and simplify the system of direct payments in the EU 27 particularly, and equalise the rates of subsidies, and only then can we talk of equal conditions for competition."
"As regards the simplicity of the SAPS system, we should consider its simplification for the EU 15."
"Let us hope that this simplification, and the creation of a harmonised common market (...)"
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Madam President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good report."
"He is a very experienced Member of this House and I would have expected nothing less from him."
"There is no doubt that the need to streamline decision-making and removing red tape from the common agricultural policy is a primacy of importance."
"It is my view that if we have to harmonise - and we must have harmonisation - we should always harmonise up to the best possible standard."
"It is clear that better regulation can be achieved."
"I do not want more and more civil servants - let me make that very clear - either in Brussels or in Member States making more difficulties for the farmers trying to do their job on the ground, creating and developing more problems than we would like to solve."
"Yes, we need better regulation, but we also need more transparency."
"I share Mr Busk's view on the need to keep intervention for pig meat, because this sector does - as we have experienced on numerous occasions - from time to time go into over-production, which is very difficult to control."
"I believe that, for short periods, we require support in that sector."
"I also believe that it would be going much too far, in the short term, to reduce the advisory committees, as we require a high degree of expertise on what can be extremely delicate issues."
"I would give qualified support to the Commission to consolidate the existing 21 regulations."
"It is my belief that we need less regulation, not more."
"This is a welcome start, and I trust we can look forward to the health check to bring forward even more deregulation."
"Let us destroy red tape in the common agricultural policy forever."
"(PL) Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate Niels Busk for his report in such a difficult area as the creation of a harmonised and common organisation for agricultural markets."
"Replacing the 21 common market organisations by a single horizontal Regulation of the Council for a single market organisation will undoubtedly lead to a simplification and improvement of the legal structure of the first pillar of the CAP, and to greater transparency in agricultural legislation."
"However, we must not forget that creating a uniform, common market organisation is a process of technical simplification which cannot incorporate elements of policy change."
"The work currently underway on the new directive cannot mean the endorsement of the adopted rules of the CAP, and should not be a pretext for changing political decisions already taken in respect of agricultural policy."
"In this regard, the Commission's proposal to remove the intervention group on the pig meat market, which in Poland at least is so important, is unjustified."
"The European Commission's proposal to create a single committee to manage the common organisation of agricultural markets also arouses doubts in me."
"Can one committee with a limited number of national experts function properly?"
"Will this solution not result in a limitation of the influence of Member States on the administration of market instruments?"
"How does the Commission intend to ensure the full representation of national expertise in the committee-based process?"
"Would the above not indicate the need for at least a few management committees, including separate committees for the meat, milk and vegetable markets?"
"And one final question: As regards extending the authority of the Commission, I would like to say that the competences of the Council can only be transferred to the European Commission on technical matters which do not have any effect on the functioning of the agricultural markets."
"This means that the authority to define quality standards and the system of classifying carcasses on the beef, veal and pork markets, the authority to determine trading standards on the egg, poultry and live plant market should be within the competence of the Council, and not the European Commission."
"Furthermore, any questions of a political nature should continue to be discussed with the Council and Parliament."
"Madam President, honourable Members, this was a very interesting discussion, I should like to thank you very much for it."
"First of all, let me recall that this exercise is indeed about simplification and not about another reform of the CAP or a redistribution of aid as some have feared."
"I think it also revealed that there are quite a few points which I can accept or where I am certain that acceptable solutions will eventually be found, notably on the carcass classification, the reference to potato starch quotas and also a clause giving a further assurance that the status quo for producer and inter-branch organisations is maintained."
"As far as the fruit and vegetable and wine sectors are concerned, and their inclusion in the single CMO from the outset and as regards the kind of management committee, I have already made my point."
"In some cases the report is asking to go beyond the status quo of what we have today."
"I do not think we should introduce any such amendments on this occasion as that would change the character of the exercise."
"Concerning the set-up of the management committee - a matter raised by Mr Busk - organising four subsections would go against the idea of a single CMO and make the new committee unnecessarily inflexible."
"But we can assure you that the Commission is determined to organise the meetings of the single committee in such a way as to include the necessary expertise and take account of the specificities of the sectors concerned."
"Let me also make very clear that with regard to the role of the European Parliament, technical decisions and market management decisions need to be decided at Commission level."
"In no way is the Commission receiving powers to amend substantive or any other policy decisions."
"Therefore Parliament is not being bypassed."
"The Commission's powers will be restricted to implementing rules."
"I can assure you of that."
"With regard to pigmeat, I am not so certain why an instrument that has not been used in more than 30 years should still be considered as a basic policy decision that needs to be maintained."
"In concluding, let me stress once again in answer to the points raised regarding the complexity and the bureaucracy of the CAP, this is just a first step."
"Others will follow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)"
"Madam President, on a point of order, under our Rules of Procedure, Annex I, Article 2, any Member who has not submitted a declaration of interests has to be reminded of this fact by the President."
"If he or she continues to fail to do so, this fact is published in the Minutes."
"It is then stated that, if the Member continues to refuse to submit the declaration, the President shall take action in accordance with Rule 147 to suspend the Member concerned."
"I see from the Minutes of the sitting on Monday that Mr Herrero-Tejedor and Mr Nattrass, from the UK Independence Party, have still failed to complete their declaration of interests. It is now several months in a row that they have been named and shamed in the Minutes and I would urge the President to take action appropriate to the situation."
"It undermines the reputation and the credibility of this House."
"I shall pass that on, Mr Corbett."
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Transfers of appropriations: see Minutes"
"Kashmir: present situation and future prospects (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Kashmir: present situation and future prospects."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I am honoured to present the Committee on Foreign Affairs report entitled 'Kashmir: present situation and future prospects'."
"This report correctly contrasts the situation between the world's largest secular democracy which has devolved structures at all levels - India, including Jammu and Kashmir - and Pakistan, which still lacks full implementation of democracy in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and has yet to take steps towards democracy in Gilgit and Baltistan."
"It also highlights the fact that there is considerable evidence that over many years Pakistan has provided Kashmiri militants with training, weapons, funding and sanctuary and has encouraged militants to commit atrocities on the Indian-administered side."
"It takes a firm line on human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir."
"It is also constructive as it highlights the common heritage shared by India and Pakistan, exemplified in the ancient culture of Jammu and Kashmir, and recognises and values the pluralism, multiculturalism and multi-faith nature and secular traditions of the peoples of Jammu and Kashmir, which have been kept alive in the Indian part of Jammu and Kashmir."
"This is an enlightened and balanced report, which denounces terrorism and those who support terrorism; it promotes a vision of peace, coexistence, friendship and economic integration and commerce between peoples on both sides of the border and in Gilgit and Baltistan along the lines of the European Union model."
"I urge this House to adopt it in its entirety, with certain amendments, so that an unambiguous message is sent to the disturbers of peace in that part of the world that the international community will not tolerate extremism or terrorism any more and that we respect and uphold the rights and ethnicity of the Kashmiri people."
"I have with me a strong statement - of this morning - by Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party, in which she welcomes this report for drawing attention to the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people; for reaffirming the EU's commitment to the settlement of dispute by peaceful means; for taking note of the impact of the earthquake and urging the European Union to help and support the Kashmiris; for supporting the role of the composite peace process in moving towards a durable settlement for the Kashmiris based on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights; for urging the Indian and Pakistan Governments to facilitate the ceasefire on the Line of Control by calling further on militant armed groups to enrol in a disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation process; for encouraging the Pakistan Government to transform the ceasefire in place in Siachin since 2003 into a lasting peace agreement; for urging both governments to allow international human rights organisations immediate and unrestricted access to all parts of the former princely state in order to investigate the human rights situation there; for calling on the Indian Government to put an end to all practices of extrajudicial killings, 'disappearances', torture and arbitrary detentions in Jammu and Kashmir; for calling on the Indian and Pakistani authorities to ease restrictions on travel between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad; for urging Pakistan to revisit its concepts of fundamental rights of freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of religious practices in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit and Baltistan; for calling for the first-ever elections to be held in Gilgit and Baltistan and for seeking higher democratic representation in the Northern Areas."
"She firmly supports this report."
"I am proud to inform the House that Imran Khan MP, former captain of the Pakistan cricket team and now head of his political party Tehreek-e-Insaaf, today pledged his full support for this report."
"The plight of the Kashmiri people has been of concern to the international community for nearly 60 years."
"The European Union strongly supports regional integration, trade liberalisation and economic cooperation."
"The European Parliament is keenly interested in all aspects of the situation."
"Let me draw your attention to the hundreds of young people who demonstrated in favour of this report, calling for the democratic freedoms that we recommend."
"They were beaten up by the police, their banners and petitions to the UN were destroyed."
"They demonstrated again."
"Two hundred of their relatives were kidnapped and have not been heard of since."
"Subsequently, many thousands of citizens of Azad Jammu and Kashmir have held meetings and pledged their full support for the report."
"Over the border in Jammu and Kashmir, India continues to be criticised for her large military presence."
"The report is strong on human rights in Jammu and Kashmir, as in the other areas."
"In Gilgit and Baltistan, the people are kept in poverty, illiteracy and backwardness."
"The report makes clear its support for the current peace process."
"It recognises the ancient and unique heritage of the Kashmiri people. It reflects many principles of the European Union."
"I earnestly hope that this House will support the report as wholeheartedly during the vote today as it was supported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Madam President, I followed with great interest the very lively debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Kashmir report by Baroness Nicholson."
"There is much food for thought in this report."
"It is too comprehensive for me to be able to respond in detail today, but I should like to reflect on some of the issues which it raises."
"The focus on Kashmir is timely."
"On the political front, there have been many positive developments, which, for the first time in many years, give some hope that this long-standing issue is getting closer to a solution."
"Both India and Pakistan have indicated that the Line of Control could become a 'soft border'."
"The European Union has expressed its firm support for the reconciliation process between India and Pakistan."
"But the road is still full of pitfalls."
"It is encouraging that the composite dialogue process remains on track despite terrorism."
"I was in Delhi when the terrible attacks on the daily Lahore-Samjhota Express train took place last February."
"It would indeed be tragic if the peace process could be taken hostage by terrorists."
"I see no alternative to both countries addressing their differences through dialogue."
"This will, hopefully, lead eventually to settlement of all bilateral issues."
"I also feel it is important that the Kashmiris themselves have become more involved in the arrangements for the peace process."
"I would like to say a few words about the terrible earthquake that struck Kashmir on the morning of 8 October 2005 and which, as Baroness Nicholson's report describes, had a devastating impact on the lives of the Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control, especially in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the North West Frontier Province."
"I had the opportunity to visit the earthquake-affected areas in person when I visited Pakistan to represent the European Commission at the earthquake reconstruction conference in November that year."
"The European Commission responded to this tragedy by providing humanitarian aid of EUR 48 million and by committing, in December 2005, a EUR 50 million programme on 'Earthquake Recovery and Reconstruction support to Pakistan', which covers rehabilitation of education and health facilities in the affected areas, an emergency education programme and community-based livelihood recovery schemes."
"Thus, we are aiming to do what the report recommends, namely help the most vulnerable and restore economic activities in the affected area."
"This earthquake response comes in addition to other development programmes in Pakistan under our country strategy."
"Although the Commission has been quick to react to this challenge, I nevertheless expect that the reconstruction effort will still take a number of years."
"The Commission's reconstruction programme will be implemented over a period of five years."
"As far as the Northern Areas of Pakistan are concerned, the Commission has been active there over many years in developing human resources especially, in improving the public school system and in cooperating with the Aga Khan Education Services."
"While implementing our programmes there, we have ensured that all communities - and government schools - benefit from project activities."
"Before I conclude, I would like to thank Baroness Nicholson for the encouraging words she found to recognise the work of the Commission's delegations in Islamabad and New Delhi."
"This is much appreciated."
"I would just like to add that I would have loved to have stayed for the whole debate but, as communicated, I have to leave before the end due to long-standing commitments which I could not alter after Parliament's change to the agenda, but my colleague Mrs Grybauskaitwill take over and stay on in the debate."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, the tragic and bloody dispute over the beautiful Himalayan territory of the former princely state of Kashmir between the two great south-Asian countries of India and Pakistan is one of the oldest in the world, going right back to UN Security Council resolutions 39 and 47 of 1948."
"I strongly support the Nicholson report, and I congratulate the rapporteur on its content and quality, after considerable rebalancing during the committee stage, both in tone and in terms of its approach."
"The report is accurate and primarily recognises that current ongoing bilateral confidence-building talks between the Indian and Pakistani Governments remain the best strategy to achieve a just and enduring peace between these two nuclear-armed states."
"My British colleague, Mr Bushill-Matthews, who alone voted against it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, informs me that he will now be supporting the report, which indicates how it has progressed during its various stages."
"Mercifully, since the agreed ceasefire on 25 November 2003, we are now witnessing one of the most peaceful periods in terms of military action since the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war: a ceasefire that has survived serious provocations to the Government of India, including the Mumbai terrorist bombings."
"Nevertheless, Kashmiri Pandits still continue to claim that cross-border infiltrating terrorists are attempting a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the local Hindu population, albeit it on a vastly reduced scale."
"Similarly, the report rightly calls for restraint by the Indian military, with full respect by the security forces for human rights, the wellbeing of civilian populations and observance of issued court orders."
"The report highlights the lack of genuine democracy in Azad Kashmir and, in particular, for the first time, the plight of the inhabitants of Gilgit-Baltistan."
"There are also general concerns expressed in AJK over a number of issues, including women's rights and religious minority rights."
"I, and many colleagues, warmly welcomed in 2005 the launching of a bus service across the line of control between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad allowing divided families to be reunited after nearly 60 years, and it is my hope that, eventually, the borders, including the line of control, will be just a line on the map and become increasingly irrelevant."
"We in the EU have already proved this with our four freedoms of movement of people, goods, services and capital. A similar future vision of a south-Asian economic community by 2025 will require free trade across the line of control."
"Both India and Pakistan, much to their credit, cooperated positively after the October Kashmir earthquake to provide humanitarian aid to thousands of victims and displaced people."
"But much remains to be done to resettle the displaced populations permanently."
"The EU's role, in my opinion, is to support a peaceful settlement of the problem over the former princely state, with the EU willing to act as an honest broker for peace, but only if both sovereign governments ask for our help, as, ultimately, we regard the Kashmir dispute as a bilateral matter."
"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to repeat my appeal to all parties that support the militants waging a violent Jihad to stop their activities immediately."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, India and Pakistan have waged three wars over the Kashmir region."
"This very much reminds me of the dispute between Germany and France over the Alsace-Lorraine region - where this sitting is being held."
"Three wars were waged in this region, too - but Germany and France decided after the Second World War to put an end to the confrontation and make cooperation the maxim of their policy."
"The successes of this policy can be seen in the European Union today."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament would like to see India and Pakistan, too, moving on from confrontation and making cooperation the maxim of their policy."
"People in the Kashmir region would benefit tremendously and the whole region would blossom."
"I believe SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) has the potential to be a similar success story to the EU."
"Naturally, peace thrives best where democracy prevails."
"In this report, we are very critical of the absence of democracy - the democratic deficits - in the Kashmir region, and also of the many human rights violations."
"People are suffering on both sides of the Line of Control."
"All parties involved are called on, therefore, to introduce democracy and respect for human rights there once and for all."
"We can see that there is a tremendous amount of violence there - consisting of violence within the region and also infiltration from outside - and 80 000 people have lost their lives."
"There must be an end to the arrival of violent groups in the region from across the border."
"Naturally, we call on the military, too, to respect human rights."
"We also call on human rights commissions to penalise, including in court, violations of this kind taking place in both countries."
"It is unacceptable that people are being kidnapped, tortured and killed with impunity."
"In our opinion, the EU should support the region's environmental and economic rehabilitation."
"Excellent work has been done there in the field of humanitarian aid, as I have been able to see with my own eyes."
"This commitment must continue."
"This report is evidently the first in the world to deal with Kashmir."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur for her courage in including quite a few things in her report."
"We have been struggling over this for months."
"I believe that this report will help the people in the region and also assist the India-Pakistan peace process."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (HU) First of all, I would like to congratulate Baroness Nicholson for the comprehensive and important report."
"I know that she was under all sorts of pressures but that she was able to withstand them."
"I am aware that it is not easy for a British deputy to free herself from domestic political considerations, and that she was successful in doing so."
"Therefore she deserves all our respect, and I support the report."
"The European Union is taking on a serious commitment to repair the damage caused by the earthquake in Kashmir."
"We have agreed to provide support in the amount of EUR 100 million, and in the coming years will be offering 200 million to Pakistan and 470 million in the form of development aid."
"This means that we have a moral basis for expressing an opinion on these questions."
"We are all very concerned that on both sides of the 'Line of Control' serious violations of human rights have taken place."
"But it is very encouraging that Prime Minister Singh of India has announced a policy of zero tolerance, and over the past few years there have visibly been very positive steps forward in Indian-controlled territory."
"We expect the same from Pakistan."
"We also expect Pakistan to take much more decisive action against extremists and terrorists, and not to allow them to drift across the border into Indian-controlled territory."
"The conflict is not simply a question of boundaries."
"It cannot be resolved from one day to the next."
"The first prerequisite for building confidence is for the conflict to be resolved."
"Baroness Nicholson's report shows that real improvement is needed in the current situation."
"The necessary social and economic conditions must be created."
"Family reunification must be made possible."
"Commercial ties need to be fostered, the infrastructure developed, new education institutions established and jobs created."
"But all this is not enough."
"It is necessary, but not sufficient."
"It is important for political dialogue to begin, with the Indian Government, the Pakistani Government and the whole spectrum of Kashmiri political life, with all those authorities that are willing to give up the use of force."
"It is very important for the Kashmiris to be involved as well in finding a solution to the problem, for there will be no durable solution to the problem in Kashmir as long as freely and democratically elected Kashmiri leaders are unable to take part."
"In my judgment, India has shown a high degree of flexibility in recent times, and for this reason we expect the same from Pakistan as well, since there are close ties linking us to both countries."
"Both countries are important partners to us, and it is in our greatest interest that the two countries finally put an end to their conflict in a peaceful, constructive manner, and that in the meantime everything be done in an atmosphere of trust and dialogue."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Baroness Nicholson, for her report."
"I also wish to thank those Members who helped steer this difficult and very controversial report clearly in the direction of a compromise, and thus helped us all make considerable progress."
"I do think, however, that we have some way to go in today's vote before we have a report that - without also attracting censure from India, Pakistan or anyone else - ultimately serves our common aim of helping Kashmir to finally become a region characterised by peace, prosperity, and respect for the environment and human rights."
"We can make an important contribution to this today, if together we find the willpower and focus on the heart of the matter."
"This is a report on Kashmir, not one on India or Pakistan."
"We are perfectly justified in drawing up similar reports."
"I should like to point out that much of the criticism levelled at India or Pakistan in the report is undoubtedly legitimate - in the case of Pakistan, in particular, much more could have been said."
"Yet this is not the place for a debate on Pakistan, as we are talking about Kashmir."
"Since time immemorial, Kashmir has been a bridging point and intersection between the Near East, Central Asia and South Asia."
"The region, which has even been the subject of a rock song by Led Zeppelin, can once more be a region in which people from all parts of Kashmir can live together in peace and prosperity."
"Let us contribute to this today."
"This would be the best contribution we could make towards the fight against terrorism."
"The region does not need more armed forces; it needs fewer arms, fewer armed forces."
"Parliament would then send out a signal to India and Pakistan today that they should continue to go down the route of peace; that they should do everything to increase the irrelevance of the border, so that Kashmir may one day be a region of prosperity and peace."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Madam President, for a long time, it was Europe that decided how other parts of the world should be governed."
"One of the effects this had is that all the states in a large part of South Asia were combined into one enormous British colonial empire, some parts of which were governed directly by colonial officials, and some indirectly by the successors of traditional sovereigns who had submitted to the colonial supreme authority."
"In 1947, the future of the states formerly ruled by those sovereigns was in the hands of the sovereigns themselves."
"They were able to join one of the two new states that had gained independence during that year and into which the colonial empire had been carved up: India, which was large and secular and Pakistan, which, while in those days also comprising Bangladesh, was small and Islamic."
"The earlier states were unable to regain independence and there was no referendum about whether they wanted to join India or Pakistan."
"In most areas, this did not lead to any insuperable problems, for the preference of the sovereign and most inhabitants happened to coincide."
"Kashmir was the exception to the rule."
"The people would probably have opted for Pakistan, while the sovereign went for India."
"This goes some way to explaining the problems of the past 60 years."
"India may be the world's largest democracy, but that democracy is being dealt heavy blows because of the overlap with Indian territory of a large section of Kashmir."
"Without any majority backing from its inhabitants, Kashmir can be kept under Indian control only by the army and the police."
"Democracy there cannot function as it should under such conditions."
"India, being a secular democracy, has considerable advantages over Pakistan, where religious fanatics and the military have always had far too much influence."
"It is to precisely those benefits that India can offer that the inhabitants of Kashmir are blind."
"In the contacts between the European Union and India, instead of sweeping this problem under the carpet, we should draw attention to it, and it was this idea that I found absent from the rapporteur's original text, which was very much focused on three components: recovery following the earthquake, cementing relations between the European Union and India and more trade and transport as means of improving relations between the leaders of India and Pakistan."
"The people of Kashmir did not, however, have any role in this."
"Their long-term desire for a referendum about the future, and international support for this, were explicitly omitted, although it now looks like the final result will be more balanced."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the theme of the Kashmir-EU week in early June will be 'peace building in Kashmir', and it is an important initiative given the human rights violations in that region, where the need for help on both sides of the border is highlighted not least by the actions of militant groups both in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir and in the Pakistani part Azad Kashmir."
"It is important that European aid be offered to all victims within Kashmir."
"Humanitarian aid, however, does not involve political interference."
"The United Nations found out earlier this month how difficult aid operations are to manage in the region, when eighty-three of their staff had to be evacuated because - according to a UN spokesperson - local groups that had not managed to secure reconstruction projects had been pitting the people against them."
"The rapporteur is also right to note that the European Union has not been asked to act as an external mediator in the Kashmir conflict, although the space given in the report to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is in stark contrast with this view."
"The EU should not lose sight of the value of international intervention, aid and mediation."
"It is an omission that this value should be given such scant attention in this report."
"How do the Council and Commission intend to provide aid to all Kashmiris and the Asian regional partners?"
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, it goes without saying that the European Union will need to make a meaningful contribution in order to support the peace process in Kashmir."
"It is important that the channels of communications between all interested parties are opened, and indeed kept open."
"Perhaps I might touch on one of its many aspects, that being the problem of terrorism."
"It is a fact that many acts of terrorism are committed by groups that either operate from Pakistan, or are supported by it, Lashkar e-Taiba and Hizb ul-Mujahideen being two examples."
"President Musharraf has on several occasions committed himself to tackling the problem of terrorism, but I am afraid that he has a long way to go yet."
"The same can be said of the extreme Islamism that is promoted on a large scale via the notorious schools called madrassas."
"If Pakistan does not manage to get this problem under control, the peace process is bound to founder in the longer term."
"This is why the European Union should no longer content itself with promises from Pakistan; it should also expect concrete action."
"Madam President, I warmly welcome this debate this morning."
"It is the culmination of a long process which started in March 2000 when the House voted overwhelmingly for a factual report on the question of Kashmir."
"It has thus become not just a British problem, but is seen increasingly as a European one, as our debate this morning shows."
"We have had vigorous discussions in committee and we now have a more balanced report than when we started out this morning."
"Some 450 amendments have been tabled, around 180 of those amendments have now been included in this document and so there has been a substantial revision."
"There are still some areas where I remain unhappy, in particular regarding Amendment 21 which refers to the question of machine-readable Pakistan passports."
"I understand there is no such concern in AJK."
"We have to be careful to keep the report factual."
"There are, however, three amendments in particular to which I would like to draw colleagues' attention and which I shall be supporting."
"The first is tabled by Mr Tannock on behalf of my group - and I thank him for having done so - where in order to create an atmosphere of confidence and goodwill it is vital to remove all obstructions and hindrances for all Kashmiris to travel freely in the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir."
"Secondly, this particularly relates to the financial aspects of the earthquake."
"We all know what terrible suffering there was."
"There has been a request for further funds from the Government of Azad Kashmir, but I understand that they have not yet had a full reply, therefore Amendment 41 is asking for a clear reply from the Commission so that we know what we have to do in budgetary terms."
"The last aspect refers to demilitarisation and that is why we have tabled Amendment 55 together with Mrs Lambert."
"The article in The Economist of 7 April was very clear and I commend it to the House."
"It says that there are three fundamental reasons why we should now be pressing for demilitarisation."
"First, the present numbers are not needed."
"We now have a process of nearly three years of a ceasefire and the dangers of militancy have significantly decreased."
"Second, this would be hugely popular in Kashmir where, to quote from The Economist, there is an alienation 'from Indian rule which runs deep, the withdrawal of the army would be widely seen not as a removal of a protective shield but as a lifting of an oppressive curse'."
"Third, withdrawing troops from Kashmir would be a great boost to the painstaking rapprochement between India and Pakistan."
"In conclusion, I would like to draw attention, as one or two other colleagues have done, to the work of my colleague Mr Bushill-Matthews."
"I will be voting in favour of this report because it has a positive message of shining a light on the problems which are faced on a daily basis by the people of Jammu and Kashmir."
"We should keep that spotlight shining brightly and we should associate everybody possible with the process to find a resolution to the problem for the Kashmiri people."
"Madam President, the European Union's positive role in dealing with any conflict in the world and our role in relation to Kashmir should be to support peace processes and to uphold international law."
"Our own Labour amendments to this report concentrated on advancing the withdrawal of troops on both sides, extending development aid, encouraging the practical involvement of the Kashmiri people themselves: balanced, constructive, diplomatic in our approach."
"When I was in Kashmir in March at the same time as the Commissioner, I saw an AJK more open than ever before; the Indians willing to talk with the secessionists and both governments optimistic about their composite dialogue and when that bomb on a train from New Delhi to Lahore killed 68 people in February, the politics of blame was replaced by a mutual solidarity to defeat the terrorists who had planted it."
"However, the support the Liberal Democrat rapporteur claims for her report this morning is possible only because at parliamentary committee level we defeated her proposals to cut off trade relations with one side, not the other; to provide economic aid on one side only; to overturn the UN resolution in favour of self-determination; and, most offensive of all, to score political points about the sixth worst earthquake in the history of humanity."
"I note today the Liberal Democrat Amendment 58 to blame one side for preventing a plebiscite and the Conservative Amendment 5 to resist a plebiscite in the future."
"Labour and Socialist MEPs will oppose both."
"In this report, I regret to say we have seen a rapporteur who claimed to uphold the principle of primum non nocere - do no harm - yet she has done only harm."
"I caution others in this debate and in our vote: do not speak today for India or for Pakistan; speak for Europe, for peace and for human rights and you will do a greater service for the people of Kashmir and for the honour of this Parliament."
"Madam President, I welcome the Commissioner's comments."
"In October 2005 the catastrophic earthquake opened the eyes of the world to the desperate plight of the Kashmiri people."
"This tragedy offered India and Pakistan a window of opportunity to make peace out of disaster."
"It also gave the international community the prospect of engaging in a previously closed region."
"The Council has stressed that India and Pakistan must find a durable settlement for Jammu and Kashmir which takes into account the wishes of all the people of Kashmir."
"This is a just and responsible approach and one which this House must follow if it is to contribute constructively to the Kashmir debate."
"As Liberals, whose forefathers shaped the concept, my group's passion must be self-determination, self-determination and self-determination."
"It is an absolute right enshrined by the UN and respected and protected by the European Union."
"It is a democratic process that as a House we have a duty to support."
"The EU must support the positive ideas now coming forward - systems of self-governance, making borders irrelevant, and joint management across the Line of Control."
"It is not for us to take any options off the table."
"We must, however, insist that they are explored through full consultation with the Kashmiris and, if the conditions are right, we must support their desire to determine their destiny through a democratic plebiscite."
"With a history of human rights abuses, a sustainable solution is impossible without ending impunity and ensuring that human rights are the building blocks of peace."
"India and Pakistan are now both members of the UN Human Rights Council."
"With membership comes a responsibility to lead."
"Women and children have born the brunt of the conflict and the earthquake."
"Women have been widowed and children left orphaned."
"All are struggling to rebuild their lives."
"The EU, through its trade and economic relations with both India and Pakistan, must protect the most vulnerable in the short term and secure their livelihoods in the long term."
"The greatest tragedy of the earthquake was the loss of a whole generation of Kashmiris."
"We must mourn their deaths."
"For those who remain, our core goals must be peace, justice and self-determination for the generation of Kashmiris to come."
"Madam President, I would agree with everything that my colleague, Mr Karim, has just said and, in particular, that self-determination is of crucial importance - even more so for peoples divided by history."
"We would agree that the conditions for a plebiscite are not met at present, but they should not be set aside."
"Hence our Amendments 18 and 56, tabled with colleagues from ALDE Group, are of crucial importance for us."
"This conflict in Kashmir has brought the world nearer to nuclear conflict than anything else since the 1960s."
"Therefore, it is hugely important to all of us in this House."
"Whether our countries have a historical involvement or not, the EU definitely has an interest."
"We welcome the confidence-building measures."
"The environment is of common concern to peoples on whatever side of the Line of Control, and can be a valuable peace-builder."
"We need the normalisation of relations at every level, grass-roots to political, and that softening of the border as an interim measure."
"(MT) Thank you, Madam President."
"Throughout the years, the conflict in Kashmir has left thousands of victims in its wake, including thousands of victims torn from their families and thousands of others forced to leave their country to seek a better life elsewhere."
"Therefore, I believe we can all agree that the time has come for the European Union to do all it can to seek a long-term solution that is devoid of violence - one that is beneficial to all those involved."
"Surely everyone will accept that after years of insecurity, spilt blood and unfulfilled promises this is no easy task, even though there may seem to be consensus on an official level."
"Yet, we must ensure that what we have achieved up till now is not lost, and we must also see to it that permanent dialogue between India and Pakistan is given our full support and assistance."
"Both India and Pakistan must be given the chance to persevere with their confidence-building measures and to continue to allow people to cross control lines."
"This step was greatly welcomed after so many years of division."
"I am certain that the European Union will lend all its support to any initiative that could bring about peace, even if this could turn out to be a slow and lengthy process."
"As the Commissioner said, we must ensure, on a humanitarian basis, that people in refugee camps are provided with all the humanitarian aid they require, especially following the devastating earthquake that left so many people in a desperate plight."
"Aid has to be increased and the camps that have been in existence for so long must be given some form of official status."
"I strongly appeal to all Indian and Pakistani authorities to honour their obligations and to bestow upon the Kashmiri population the dignity it deserves, because every single person in the world has a right to such dignity."
"Last but not least; I believe we need to take action in order to protect the unique history of this people."
"The Indian, Pakistani and Kashmiri population must focus on the factors that bind them together."
"It is only in this way that the peace process can be successful."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for all the work she has put in to making this report a successful one."
"Madam President, I wish to congratulate Baroness Nicholson on her work on what has already become one of the most talked-about reports initiated by this House."
"When I led a delegation to Pakistan last December, this report was raised with us almost everywhere, and, having followed the progress of the report closely, I do not underestimate the challenges there have been in bringing the basic facts about these issues into the open."
"I am sure that, in time, it will become an authoritative report on the issue."
"I, too, have visited one part of divided Kashmir and empathise with the plight of the Kashmiri people, especially following the tragic impact of the earthquake."
"This report has also brought out into the open for the first time the conditions prevailing, not only in Kashmir but also in the northern areas."
"Whilst in Pakistan, I met many people who expressed a strong desire for greater democracy and a greater voice."
"Therefore, I hope one outcome of this report will be more democracy and greater democratic structures, especially in Gilgit and Baltistan, in the near future."
"One of the issues that has most divided the Members of this House has been the question of a plebiscite."
"However, I welcome the consensus that has now developed on this issue in the report, and it is important to remember that the UN resolution that called for a plebiscite to be held clearly stated that it should happen only when the conditions have been met."
"It is therefore unfortunate that the conditions under which this might happen have not been met so far."
"Having chaired the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia and the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation, and now the Delegation for relations with India, I recognise that this issue has hindered proper development between neighbouring countries and the region as a whole."
"Therefore, I strongly welcome the confidence-building measures that both India and Pakistan have committed themselves to in the past few years."
"I urge them to continue along this track with soft borders and more trade, because this has already paid dividends as regards regional prosperity, and I sincerely hope it will eventually lead to improvements on all fronts for the people of Kashmir."
"Madam President, this report is about the present and future prospects for the Kashmiri people and we must not lose sight of that."
"This report is not about India and it is not about Pakistan."
"I am pleased that the report was amended substantially in committee."
"I have, however, sought to amend it further and many of the amendments tabled by my group - though not all - are the ones I hope you can vote for."
"Amendment 18 calls for the Kashmiri people to exercise their right to self-determination through a plebiscite in the future."
"This, to my mind, is the bottom line."
"I believe all people should have a right to determine their own destiny."
"This is what the Kashmiri people have been calling for for many years."
"Sixty years ago the resolutions were passed by the UN and they still have not been brought into effect."
"How can we be so selective about which UN resolutions we adhere to?"
"I would like us, however, to go further and for any plebiscite to have the three options: governed by India, governed by Pakistan or independence."
"Another concern I have about this report, although it is now much better than it was, is that it seems to be concentrating a great deal on the shortcomings of the Pakistan Government within Pakistan, rather than taking a balanced approach relating to both India and Pakistan's failures in Jammu and Kashmir generally."
"Finally, we must build on the positive steps taken by both India and Pakistan and not undermine them."
"However, no solution can be achieved without the Kashmiri people having the final say themselves."
"- (PL) Madam President, from the point of view of international human rights organisations, Kashmir has been one of the most volatile places on the map for the last 56 years."
"The civilian population has been in a difficult situation for many years and has received virtually no aid or protection from the international community."
"There is almost continuous fighting in Kashmir."
"Human rights organisations report that, since the Mujahadin insurrection in 1989, over 30 000 civilians have died in Kashmir."
"Kashmir should weigh heavily on our consciences."
"All European democracies that pride themselves on a tradition of dialogue and freedom, especially concerning matters of faith, seem not to notice or to ignore the tragedy facing the civilian population in Kashmir."
"The European Union has to take part in spreading and promoting democracy by all possible means, especially in areas which have been affected by armed religious or racial conflict for many years."
"At the moment, in view of the talks that are being held between India and Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir and which are, unfortunately, unlikely to end in success, we need the European Union to show a strong will to support the civilian population in Kashmir."
"We need the European Union to show the same sort of active attitude in supporting the peace process in Asia as it did when it backed the Orange Revolution and supported Aleksander Milinkiewicz by awarding him the Sacharov Prize."
"We should not forget that Asia will be the European Union's most important partner in the future, thanks to its natural resources and manpower."
"Ignoring conflicts is a sign of ignorance and foolishness, something we cannot afford in the twenty-first century, knowing that weapons of mass destruction may be used in these conflicts."
"(SV) I wish to thank everyone for the success in finally reaching an acceptable compromise."
"India, Pakistan and Kashmir do not constitute a traditional issue for me as a Swedish Social Democrat and Member of the European Parliament, but I felt very committed when I read the first draft and heard different parties' representatives, mainly from the United Kingdom, engage in debate."
"Our task is not to live in the past or to adopt a position in favour of, or against, India and Pakistan."
"We have a responsibility for what is happening in Kashmir and for the human rights situation there."
"Our task as Members of the European Parliament is to see if we might play a role of some kind and then to offer our support and experience and in that way help resolve the conflict surrounding Kashmir."
"What is going on, and has been going on for such a long time, is a scandal."
"I believe that two civilised countries such as India and Pakistan should be able to take greater shared responsibility, devise a timetable for achieving practical results and, naturally, help each other to combat terrorism."
"If that does not happen, the United Nations and the European Union will have to intervene more seriously than in the past."
"The EU's strategy is to exert pressure via agreements, aid and contacts."
"I should have liked us to have gone further and been prepared to support a referendum, but I appreciate that we are not yet in a position to do that."
"Kashmir's wishes must be our guide in our future work and a guide for all those who wish to accept responsibility for the region."
"I want to call on everyone to think in terms not of prestige but of peace and in terms not of history but of the present and future."
"As Mr Leinen said, if France and Germany were able to create peace in Europe and found the EU, I am convinced that India and Pakistan have it within them successfully to bring about freedom and peace in Kashmir."
"Madam President, the Commission would like to emphasise its belief that there are now renewed hopes that the Kashmiri issue can be brought closer to a solution."
"Both sides have, we believe, sent out signals that appear to be more flexible now than in the past."
"Nevertheless, we would expect a slow and gradual process rather than quick results."
"But it is important - and this is where the rapporteur is very clear in her report - that the key to resolving this conflict is very much in the political aspirations of the people of both sides and of both countries."
"The European Union will continue to support the reconciliation process between India and Pakistan and, for its part, the Commission is fully prepared to continue to provide assistance to the region through its different cooperation programmes and, in reply to Mr Elles, we have already decided on EUR 50 million for reconstruction work, which we think will take a few years."
"We have not had any additional claim from either government for additional resources, but we are open to discussing this in due course if such requests come."
"This programme will also help restore economic development and good governance in the two countries."
"That is the main and fundamental condition to finding a sustainable solution to the situation in Kashmir."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 p.m."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Kashmir has suffered more than its fair share of tragedy, the most recent being the devastating earthquake."
"Sometimes out of tragedy comes hope, and so with the aftermath of the earthquake both India and Pakistan showed a desire to cooperate to improve the lives of the Kashmiri people."
"We must encourage all sides to continue with confidence measures and 'softening' the border."
"India must reduce the suffocating impact of its troops in Kashmir and Pakistan must continue to tackle terrorism."
"When the time is right the people of Kashmir must be given a voice in determining their future."
"Via Baltica (debate)"
"The next item is a statement by the Commission on Via Baltica."
"Member of the Commission."
"On behalf of the Commission, and replacing my colleague, Commissioner Dimas, who is unable to participate today because of serious health problems, I would like to make a presentation on the situation and to explain why the Commission applied to the Court."
"The Polish authorities gave the green light to the construction of the Augustów bypass, which cuts through the unique Rospuda valley in a forested Natura 2000 site, despite the initiation of previous infringement procedures."
"A letter of formal notice, covering the Augustów bypass among other things, was addressed to Poland on 15 December 2006, while the decision authorising the start of the works was issued by the Polish authorities on 2 and 9 February 2007."
"The Rospuda valley is the last peat bog system of its kind in Europe."
"Therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that, if the project is executed in its current form, it would be in breach of the directives on birds and habitats."
"On 28 February 2007, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion on an urgent basis requesting Poland to comply with EC environmental law within a week."
"Having found the response of the Polish authorities unsatisfactory, the Commission decided on 21 March to refer the case to the Court of Justice."
"The decision provides for a request for interim measures, which means the suspension of construction works until the judgment of the main case is delivered, in order to avoid irreversible damage to the Natura 2000 site concerned."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, perhaps first we could send our good wishes to Commissioner Dimas and wish him a speedy recovery."
"Secondly, let me say to my Polish friends that this is not an issue which is getting at Poland."
"There are many Member States who have been subject to pressure from Parliament and the Commission when a development proposal is potentially damaging to the environment."
"I think in this case, though, we have a serious case which is going to be a test of will of the Commission, of the policy and certainly of this Parliament too."
"We have irreversible damage in prospect for the habitats of a large number of species from eagles to woodpeckers, to capercaillie, wolves and lynx."
"I welcome the Commission taking the steps of going to the ECJ and I certainly welcome the subsequent decision to seek a special procedure from the ECJ to make an order urgently requiring Poland to stop the works pending the proper full decision."
"That is sensible."
"The ECJ President granted that on 18 April and I hope that is a very strong message to the Polish authorities who are involved with this scheme."
"But regrettably, it appears that Poland is ignoring that and proceeding, at least in part, with construction works for two of the projects in north-east Poland."
"So my request to the Commission is to insist that we look seriously at alternative routes, because we believe, and my committee believes, that there are alternatives which would be much better for the environment."
"We believe that they must be fully explored, they must use the strategic environmental assessment principles and that only if those are complied with should we agree to this road corridor proceeding."
"I hope the Commission will take that message to her colleague."
"I hope it will make him better."
"It will certainly make it better for the Polish environment if we comply with the rules."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, my group supports the Commission in this dispute with the Polish Government."
"With its environmental directives, including the Habitat Directive and the Bird Directive, the European Union has made a vital step towards the sustainable development of our continent."
"The directives are a great success."
"The areas where they apply often form part of Europe's Natura 2000 network, which network of protected nature conservation sites located in the Member States is at the heart of the EU's environmental policy and of the preservation and recovery of biodiversity."
"They give the protection of nature and the environment an enormous boost."
"In some cases, this goes against the local and national grain."
"Politicians easily yield to pressure on the basis of short-term economic interests, instead of standing up courageously for a clean environment for the sake of future generations."
"Needless to say, the Via Baltica is of major economic importance."
"This is beyond dispute."
"Moreover, it is essential to open up Northern and Eastern Europe, and to link up the Baltic states with the west of Europe."
"Increased prosperity and wellbeing in Poland are in the interest of the whole of Europe."
"This is why billions of euros from the Structural Funds are being invested in that country, and everyone will understand that the residents of the city of Augustov are keen to see the end of the dangerous, noisy traffic pollution caused by lorries."
"Traffic will need to be diverted away from the city centre."
"At what cost, though?"
"The Rospuda valley is a unique area, a special protection zone under the Birds Directive, and it should, on account of its extraordinary value, also fall within the scope of the Habitat Directive."
"Poland has enormous natural resources, with a landscape of outstanding natural beauty."
"It is these resources that hold the key to Poland's economic future."
"In the Netherlands, we faced a similar situation not so long ago, with the construction - that was subsequently turned down - of a new motorway cutting across some of the Naardermeer, the Naardermeer being the oldest nature conservation site in our country which falls within the scope of the European Birds Directive."
"This situation was comparable to the Polish nature conservation area where the Via Baltica is planned."
"The Commission was right to warn the Polish Government against the construction of this section of the motorway."
"As a European Member State, Poland has the duty to protect the Rospuda valley, and, whilst it has proposed measures that are intended to compensate for the destruction of part of the nature conservation area, this compensation is inadequate."
"The study into possible alternative routes has not been carried out fully."
"There are other routes conceivable that could prevent irreparable damage being done to the area."
"In mid-June, this House's Committee on Petitions will be sending out an inquiry mission that will be looking into the complaints by Polish citizens who do not want to see the valley destroyed."
"Although we will hear all parties and weigh up all arguments, one thing will be paramount: that the Via Baltica should not be allowed to damage one of Europe's most attractive nature conservation sites."
"The construction of this road should not contravene European environmental laws which Poland has also signed."
"Pacta sunt servanda: treaties are there to be complied with."
"Madam President, we can view the case of the Via Baltica and the Rospuda Valley from two different perspectives which should not be contradictory."
"The first point of view is a practical one, involving the people who live there and who use those roads."
"It is not only Poles who are affected, but also the inhabitants of the Baltic states and Scandinavia."
"It is a real problem which we cannot ignore."
"Many people die on these roads."
"These people have a right to roads that are built to the highest standard possible and they have a right to travel in comfort and safety."
"The other issue at stake here is that of the authorities taking responsibility for decisions that they make."
"It is not true, in spite of attempts to prove to the contrary, that there is no alternative route."
"There is an alternative."
"It is possible and practical to implement and needs only the necessary political will."
"In Poland, this issue has been debated for many years."
"We, together with a group of Members of the European Parliament, drew attention to this problem last year when we tabled a question to the Commission and appealed to the Polish Government to stop this project from going ahead, as it would be a good idea for the project to already comply with European standards at the planning stage."
"The second issue is that of lessons learnt."
"This is the first case of its kind in Poland, and sets a precedent."
"We, as Members of the European Parliament, and the European institutions should take care to ensure that, for the good of citizens and in order to improve their safety, all Member States plan their investment projects properly, in line with European Union directives and environmental protection standards."
"This can be achieved."
"There are no contradictions."
"This lesson has to be very effective."
"We, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, therefore strongly support a solution that will allow the Via Baltica to be built as soon as possible."
"However, this solution also needs to quickly lead to a breakthrough based on the fact that it is pointless to insist on bad decisions that damage the environment."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Thank you, Madam President and Mrs Grybauskaitė."
"First of all, I would like to say that, on becoming acquainted with the history of this section of road, it certainly seems to me, as a Latvian citizen, that it has been known for several years that this stretch of road was going to be built."
"It is possible that the agreement of the Natura 2000 territories by the previous Polish Government was perhaps not conducted in the best manner."
"As a result, however, this delay is causing not only residents of Poland to suffer, particularly those in the eastern region, who may use this stretch of road every day, but also three entire European Union Member States - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - and not only citizens travelling to the European Union but also a large section of industry, since 4 500 lorries pass through the town of Augustów daily via this stretch of road."
"I would really very much like a compromise to be reached that would not further delay the already delayed construction of this road."
"It worries me that these three Baltic States are in fact not connected with the European Union via a normal, modern highway."
"These three Baltic States are not connected with the European Union through Poland by rail, since it seems that the Rail Baltica section in this region will encounter the same difficulties in complying with environmental requirements."
"Nor are these three Baltic States even connected with the European electricity market at the Poland-Lithuania border."
"So I call on the Commission and all other parties, including the Polish Government, which can reach these decisions within a reasonable length of time, to reflect upon this issue not only from the viewpoint of Poland and Europe's environmental needs, but also from the point of view of the interests of these three European Union Member States. Thank you."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, the Polish Government is issuing a challenge to the European Institutions."
"European environmental legislation must be applied."
"The directive on natural habitats is there to be applied."
"The way we deal with this issue will be crucial."
"We must either take Community law seriously, and take the application and use of European funds for great infrastructures seriously, or the whole thing will gradually become pointless."
"I have had the pleasure of visiting the beautiful and unique area of the Rospuda Valley, and I can state that this project is absurd."
"It is also practically impossible from a technical point of view, given the marsh area that it has to cross."
"At the same time, I can state that there are clear alternatives which are more viable, more economical and which could serve the same purpose as this road."
"People suffering from lorry traffic in Eastern Poland, in Augustów, are hostages to the political game being played by the Polish Government in relation to other issues."
"It is a political challenge to the European Commission, which is combined with other political issues."
"It is the inhabitants of the area and nature that are going to suffer as a result."
"Furthermore, the alternatives to this road which runs through the forest have the support of the preliminary study, the strategic environmental study, carried out by the Scott Wilson consultancy, which is a highly prestigious international consultancy."
"It is not true, therefore, that the option of this road via the Via Baltica through the Rospuda Valley is the only possibility."
"Not at all."
"The seriousness of this Parliament and the seriousness of European environmental legislation is at stake."
"I hope that the European Commission will stand firm, and that means not sending any more regional funds until Poland realises that being part of the European club means obeying the rules."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Madam President, most of the EU Member States that acceded in 2004 and 2007 possess well-developed railway networks."
"Unfortunately, this railway network has, in the last 15 years, been pared down, and there have been cutbacks also in the maintenance of it."
"Moreover, in many cases, the old railway companies have not received from the state the compensation they thought they could count on beforehand for their operating shortages, and this has the effect of deterring new enterprises that would otherwise be keen to take part in tenders, and so the likelihood is that the railway network will be used less and less and that rolling stock will become unusable."
"These countries once had a huge head start over the west of Europe in the area of rail transport, but it has thus been lost, and their environment is particularly vulnerable too."
"Fewer tracks does not mean less traffic."
"In order to channel this traffic elsewhere, all attention is now focused on investments in motorways."
"Roads like these were around 15 years ago, except that they were limited to the busiest routes, particularly around the big cities."
"New roads of this sort will now be built very quickly."
"In an effort to limit costs, the interests of nature and the landscape are often overlooked."
"The shortest possible route cutting through areas considered empty is preferred, and there is no money for diversions, tunnels or bridges for wildlife."
"Poland is not the first, or only, country to face this problem."
"The same thing occurred years ago in the Czech Republic, which planned a connection from Prague to Dresden and also in Bulgaria when a link was planned between Sofia and Thessaloniki."
"The way in which valuable nature conservation areas are handled does not only make the national, but also international, news, as international nature and environmental organisations draw attention to this."
"They also point out that the European Union is partly responsible for destroying the environment if it helps to finance bad projects of this kind."
"I have been urging the European Union to refuse any responsibility in this matter for years."
"On 2 July 2002, Commissioner Wallström stated by way of response to my written requests that Poland should adapt its Via Baltica plans."
"I would remind her that, according to the original plan, the Via Baltica avoided this vulnerable area, but that these plans were subsequently reviewed in a bid to better serve other cities."
"What the European Union should insist on is a return to the original plan that was drawn up a long time ago."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, it is a good thing that we, despite the urbanisation that goes hand in hand with increasing prosperity, still boast valuable nature conservation areas within the European Union's borders."
"These areas form part of the Natura 2000 network, which does something very important by ensuring that nature in the European Union is accorded a protected status, and, for example, by helping to maintain biodiversity."
"We approved Mr Adamou's proposal only this week, in which a stand is made for maintaining biodiversity."
"Moreover, the Natura 2000 status ensures that the nature conservation areas remain intact for posterity."
"At least, that is how it should be."
"Not every government appears to realise this, as was evident last year."
"The Polish Government seeks to build the new road, the Via Baltica, right across the Natura 2000 area of the Rospuda Valley."
"Along with a delegation of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I have visited the Rospuda valley and was able to see for myself how unique and valuable this Polish nature conservation site is."
"It is totally beyond me that it is the Polish Environment Minister, no less, who is in favour of this project, even though sound alternatives are available."
"He, of all people, should surely realise what disastrous effects this project could have."
"By way of compensation for the construction of the road, it is intended to plant a million trees to the north of the region, despite the adverse effects this will have on nature."
"I know that this is a very sensitive issue in Poland."
"For traffic safety, it is necessary for the Via Baltica to be in place soon, provided it is tailored to regional circumstances with minimum adverse effects on the environment."
"I am delighted that the Commission has issued warnings to the Polish Government, and that, when it received no response to its demands, it brought the matter before the European Court of Justice."
"It is to be hoped that the Court's ruling of 18 April, according to which the Polish Government should stop the compensation measures with immediate effect, will be a message for the future - a message that Member States cannot simply tamper with valuable nature conservation sites."
"- (PL) Madam President, the planned construction of the Via Baltica has caused a lot of controversy, as have many other trans-European transport routes."
"Having studied the Commission's statistics on the subject, it is clear that a number of Member States have considerable problems related to planning infrastructure projects in the areas covered by the Natura 2000 network, namely Austria, Spain and Portugal."
"At the moment, the Polish Government still wants to continue the construction of the Augustów bypass which will pass through the Rospuda Valley."
"It argues that the decision regarding the project was made before Poland joined the European Union, when Poland was not bound by the strict requirements of the European Union directives on birds and habitats."
"The European Commission is accusing Poland of infringing these directives as a result of its investment in the road building project."
"For Poland, road safety is the argument that speaks in favour of constructing the bypass."
"However, the environmental criteria that need to be fulfilled in the implementation of this project, seem to have been forgotten."
"However, in spite of the current situation, we cannot allow talks on the issue of the ring road to stall."
"The problem has to be solved in the form of a compromise which will be satisfactory for both sides."
"Both arguments, namely those concerning environmental aspects and road safety, are equally important and will affect hundreds of similar projects in Poland and elsewhere."
"We should make cooperation mechanisms more efficient at various levels and adapt the regulatory criteria to the current environmental and social situation."
"However, I would appeal for similar requests for debate to be treated equally in the future."
"To this day, in spite of the support of over 60 Members, no permission has been granted for a debate on the biggest environmental threat resulting from the construction of the North European Gas Pipeline under the Baltic sea."
"I would like to remind you that over 10% of marine areas are part of the Natura 2000 network and no one, literally no one, has taken this issue up in the European Parliament."
"At the moment, when important areas of biodiversity are being destroyed before the very eyes of environmentalists and the whole of Europe, there seems to be no will to discuss the issue of the environmental threat to our only internal sea, namely the Baltic."
"(PL) Madam President, the Polish PSE delegation in the European Parliament has stressed the need for the construction of the Augustów bypass for a long time."
"However, the chosen construction plan for the new road, which will pass through the Rospuda Valley, will certainly have a negative impact on the ecosystem, which is unique in Europe and is located in an area that is protected by the Natura 2000 programme."
"Allowing the Augustów bypass to pass through the valley will cause irreparable damage to the natural environment, including the destruction of 20 000 trees and the disappearance of extremely rare plants and animal species."
"Sadly, we need to be aware of the fact that any alternative to the ring road will have an impact on the natural environment in that region."
"We should opt for the project whose negative impact on the unique fauna and flora in the Rospuda Valley will be as small as possible."
"Representatives of the Law and Justice party, which currently governs Poland, assured us before the elections that the Via Baltica, which includes the Augustów bypass, will avoid the most precious natural areas."
"Now they are breaking their promise."
"The Polish authorities have had time to reconsider the location of the bypass."
"However, they have ignored the environmentalists' suggestions that changing the route of the motorway would avoid damaging the environment and would save money."
"The Minister for the Environment did not take advantage of opportunities to reconcile the interests of the residents of Augustów, who are campaigning for a motorway, and those who seek to protect the environment."
"The Polish Government is ignoring the problematic fact that this investment will be incredibly expensive and will place a large burden on the Polish taxpayers, as the European Union will not contribute to the construction of the road in an area where, according to the habitats directive, it is forbidden to destroy the environment."
"Moreover, given the European Commission's negative assessment of the project, further work on the construction of the road may make Poland liable for fines amounting to millions of euros."
"This will be a burden which Polish taxpayers will have to bear."
"In my view, Prime Minister Kaczyński's proposal to hold a local, regional referendum on the Augustów bypass, and its route through the Rospuda Valley, is simply a sign that the Polish Government wants to shirk its responsibility for home affairs and is an unnecessary bone of contention for Polish society."
"The referendum was held because local government elections were being held in the Podlasie Voivodship at the same time."
"However, it was obvious from the start that the result of this referendum would not be binding for the European Court of Justice, which is currently dealing with the matter."
"It is therefore irrelevant and these kinds of activities only serve internal political ends."
"In addition to this, I would like to point out that, according to Polish legislation, a referendum is only valid if the turnout is over 30% of those eligible to vote."
"The turnout on Sunday did not exceed this threshold."
"The natural environment is one of our greatest treasures, and yet we do not do enough to protect it."
"I think that the Polish Government should make a real effort to draw up alternative solutions to the problem as soon as possible."
"(LT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Augustavas bypass should become part of the Via Baltica."
"This is very important to the city of Augustavas, where about 1.5 million vehicles annually drive through the centre of the city."
"The European Commission has appealed to the European Court of Justice against Poland's building of the Augustavas bypass on the Via Baltica, which was commenced before Poland joined the EU."
"The appeal is based on claims that the environmental protection requirements of the Rospuda Valley, through which the projected viaduct must pass, will be violated."
"The territory is protected by the Natura 2000 programme."
"However, no such environmental protection issues have been raised concerning the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is projected to pass through Natura 2000 territory and which may lead to unpredictable ecological consequences."
"Poland is seeking ways of solving the problem, perhaps by building a considerably more expensive tunnel."
"However, the people of Augustavas want to live quietly."
"No one is concerned about the residents suffering from pollution."
"I have asked the Commission what solution there might be, apart from a prohibition on building the bypass, and what help Poland might get."
"It was explained to me that in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission is not empowered to dictate concrete solutions to Member States nor to prescribe expenditure."
"Perhaps it is time to review the Commission's powers?"
"Will residents of the Baltic countries be obliged to travel to Europe only by air?"
"(PL) Madam President, the natural environment is very important."
"Indeed, it is one of the most important issues today."
"The natural world is an independent part of our surroundings."
"We did not create it and we should certainly protect it."
"However, protecting the environment cannot become an alibi for certain small groups of environmental activists who resort to blackmailing specific regions and governments."
"For reasons that are rather more political than environmental, and due to expected material gains, these groups are trying to block the construction of roads, bypasses and airports."
"A classic example of the misuse of environmental arguments is the campaign against the construction of an airport in Świdniku, near Lublin, in Poland."
"The colony of marmots is the reason given."
"However, no mention is made of the fact that this was not their original habitat and that, according to experts, they could be safely relocated to another site."
"Similarly dubious arguments are used by environmentalists to argue against other planned investments in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Via Baltica."
"No mention is made of the fact that a referendum in Poland produced a definite majority in favour of the project in the region where the bypass is supposed to be built."
"European environmental regulations cannot be applied automatically, without acknowledging that specific cases exist."
"We should use our common sense and not be led by ideological feelings."
"Use of the environment as a scarecrow could be prevented by more investment in infrastructure in the new Member States."
"Let us not forget that these investments really do influence peoples' quality of life, and that their right to good quality infrastructure is at least as important as environmental considerations."
"- (PL) Madam President, it is true that Poland, which has done a lot since starting its programme of reforms 18 years ago, has unfortunately neglected the building of roads."
"That is a fact."
"We are now quickly trying to make up for lost ground, although this is clearly far from easy."
"One of the hurdles in our path consists of environmental restrictions."
"We should bear in mind that when Western Europe was building roads that covered a significant proportion of its territory, no such restrictions existed on the construction of transport networks."
"Now, a conflict has erupted."
"However, nature is not mute in this conflict. Various environmental groups speak on behalf of the environment."
"Indeed, they often speak too loudly, forgetting that man is also an important, if not the most important, part of this ecosystem."
"Indeed, it is man who needs to be protected, first and foremost."
"It is regrettable that the conflict surrounding the construction work in the Rospuda Valley has escalated to such an extent and that it has become so complicated, including its political dimension."
"Is there a way out?"
"Is there a sensible solution which could satisfy both sides?"
"I am afraid that the answer is no and that the Commission has to choose."
"A decision has to be made."
"I personally think that the road should be built."
"However, permission for the work should include a strict list of conditions that have to be met in order to minimise damage to the environment."
"This is because, let us admit, losses cannot be avoided."
"They accompany civilisation, as progress is never free."
"Everything has its price."
"(PL) Madam President, the Via Baltica is most important in terms of increasing cohesion within the European Union."
"It is important in terms of decreasing the temporal distance separating the Baltic states, namely Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and indirectly also Finland, from the rest of the European Union, by means of access through Poland."
"The benefits for the Union and for Europe seem to be significant and measurable."
"I am also aware of the very difficult situation in which the inhabitants of Augustów find themselves, as an increasingly large number of lorries, passenger vehicles and buses continues to pass through the town."
"Those people cannot continue to live like this."
"This region of Poland is very rich in natural resources: flora, fauna, lakes, forests and the entire landscape."
"Any road in this area will have a negative impact on the environment."
"However, it is simply impossible to avoid this region altogether."
"The road will give Europeans access to these landscapes and bring them closer, while not building the road will mean that the region will remain an inaccessible fortress."
"In spite of the fact that the current Polish Government's stance has sometimes been less than professional, I would like to ask the Commission to take these aspects into account."
"It is possible and necessary for the Commission and the Polish Government to effectively seek a solution that will be beneficial to the Union, the citizens and bring relief to both the inhabitants of Augustów and the drivers of the vehicles passing through the area, without causing too much damage to the environment."
"During the mid-1990s, I was the Minister of Transport in Poland."
"I supported the project then, as I thought that it was necessary."
"Today, I continue to support the construction of the Via Baltica."
"(PL) Madam President, it is my duty as a Polish Member of the European Parliament to inform my colleagues that the case of the Via Baltica has two sides to it. The first is environmental and the other is political."
"The worst thing in this case is that the European Commission has also become involved in local electoral conflicts."
"I would like to take this opportunity to mention the fact that the European Commission has recently become too frequently and unnecessarily involved in matters which fall within the remit of Polish national and local government."
"That is why we will soon be hearing a lot about the E-19 road."
"This begs the question: what does the Commission want?"
"In Poland, people say that it wants to block resources allocated to Poland for the construction of motorways."
"Perhaps it would be better for the Commission to deal with issues such as GMOs in Europe, as this is the reason why we are facing the threat of an environmental and biological disaster, or perhaps the Schmidt farms, whose increasing pollution of the environment continues to go unpunished."
"There is much to do and there is no need to interfere with those who are doing an honest job."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Commission decided to file a case against Poland at the European Court of Justice because it began to build a section of road that was 1 500 metres longer than the road that is currently used by lorries and five kilometres of which infringes on land protected by the Natura 2000 programme."
"The current state of the road is so appalling that residents have dubbed it the 'road of death'."
"In 2006 alone, 14 people died and 25 were injured on that stretch of road near the small town of Augustów."
"Postponing the construction of the road by three to five years, as this is the minimum amount of time that the Court will need to deal with the case, and perhaps having to start from scratch with the investment process, may lead to another 40 to 70 deaths."
"I would also like to mention the noise pollution created by the thousands of lorries which pass through Augustów and the potentially lethal threat of accidents involving lorries transporting dangerous goods through built-up areas."
"The habitats directive permits investment in projects on Natura 2000 land in exceptional circumstances, if compensation is offered."
"Last Sunday, nearly 92% of local residents voted in a referendum in favour of the designated new route."
"Is this stance on the part of the residents not enough reason to withdraw the case filed at the European Court of Justice?"
"If the Commission does not decide to withdraw its complaint, it will show that it has not been able to fairly balance the opinions of a small but significant minority in the Directorate-General for the Environment, environmental groups and eco-terrorists, as well as the expectations and needs of the inhabitants, which both the mayor and the Marshall of the Voivodship presented to the Commission."
"In this situation, if the alternative methods for building a bridge across the Rospuda Valley do not satisfy the Commission, a serious conflict may erupt, which threatens to permanently paralyse and block the road that is currently used."
"In view of how determined the local residents are, and I know that they are because I, unlike the others here, actually live in that area, anything is possible."
"If the aforementioned road is not going to be built soon, we should perhaps consider opening negotiations with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, with a view to diverting transit traffic from the Baltic states through these countries."
"(ET) Madam President, as a representative of Estonia, I would like to emphasise the importance of the Via Baltica."
"Historically, this has, for us, been an important connection with European countries, and it must be developed so that it becomes quick and safe."
"Today it is neither."
"This spring, for instance, it took more than 12 hours to get from Tallinn to Warsaw by car, and this is not as it should be."
"Thus we wholeheartedly welcome the opportunities offered by the Tenth Framework Programme for the construction of the motorway."
"That being said, a good road does not justify abandoning all environmental requirements."
"Nor are such roads likely to lead us to a happy future."
"Unfortunately, the Polish incident casts a shadow over the entire Via Baltica project, which is of vital importance for the Baltic region in particular."
"We hope that the European Court of Justice will soon make its decision and that a compromise can be reached between the Commission and the Polish authorities as soon as possible."
"I would like to reiterate the importance of all connecting links between the Member States of the European Union - whether they be roads, railways or power lines."
"We cannot feel like full members of the European Union if these connecting links are virtually absent or in very poor condition."
"Madam President, I understand the sensitivity of this issue."
"We are talking about trans-European networks, about trans-European works and roads and people who are living near these roads."
"We understand that this project started before the entry of Poland into the European Union."
"However, I would like to stress, on behalf of the Commission, that certain procedures need to be followed before large programmes can be started, in particular impact assessments."
"The Commission is urging Poland - as it is now its responsibility - to complete the impact assessment as soon as possible."
"In comparison, and in reply to the question on the North Stream proposal, the project concerned has not yet started; the impact assessment is ongoing and this project can only start after the impact assessment is completed."
"That is a different matter."
"It is the opposite with the Via Baltica situation."
"There has been no impact assessment; the process is only halfway through, but the works are ongoing."
"The works are ongoing outside Natura 2000."
"We do not have any information that Poland is breaching any decision of the Court."
"I can also confirm that no European financial resources have yet been given to the project."
"There were some comments concerning the Commission's responsibilities and powers."
"They are outlined in the European Treaties."
"If you want to change them, then you will have to change the Treaties."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) Madam President, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia need both the Via Baltica and other investments in road-building projects, as well as measures to protect the natural environment, including the Rospuda Valley."
"We cannot cut certain areas of the Union off from other regions and countries simply because of environmental protection requirements."
"However, we cannot ignore the environment and use the need for infrastructural improvements as a way of justifying any decision we make."
"Experts tell us that there are alternative routes that do not damage the environment as much as the current plans."
"If that is the case, then we should focus on bringing forward their implementation, rather than stubbornly sticking to this less than ideal solution."
"This problem is stirring up a lot of emotion in Poland."
"It seems that it would be more sensible to find a solution that is based on facts."
"The coalition governing Poland has made the issue extremely political."
"It has even forced a local referendum, which it is difficult to view as anything other than an attempt to use the issue of the route of the Via Baltica for their own purposes as the referendum took place at the same time as the regional elections."
"Furthermore, the referendum is not binding either for the European Court of Justice or even for the Polish authorities."
"The best solution for the inhabitants of the region and future road users would seem to be a compromise at a European level, in order to make sure that the principle of sustainable development does ring hollow."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.35 and resumed at 12.00)"

"Ladies and gentlemen, It was on 15 April that I invited Garri Kasparov to come to the European Parliament, at a time when he was being held under arrest for eleven hours, and a member of my staff had other reasons - to do, in fact, with the legacy of Andrej Sakharov - to be in Moscow."
"I am glad that Mr Kasparov has been here yesterday and today, and I rejoice in the great support that you have expressed for him and for his friends in Russia."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would like to inform the House that last night the Israeli authorities arrested a number of elected representatives of the PLC, including a Minister of the Abbas Government."
"I would therefore ask you, President, to condemn this Israeli action and to make a strong statement against their practice of arresting elected representatives of the Palestinian people."
"This is not the way to go forward with the peace process."
"(Applause)"
"We have just been discussing this in the Conference of Presidents, too."

"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. I welcome the Busk Report which should lead to significant simplification of the Common Agricultural Policy."
"While I want to see further reform of CAP I accept the Rapporteur's argument that this should not be by the ""back door""."
"in writing. (SV) It is good that the legal framework is being simplified, but both export subsidies and other aid in the form of intervention also remain in place."
"That is a state of affairs that I can never accept, and I am therefore abstaining in the vote."
"in writing. - (FR) I question the reasoning behind the Commission's action which, despite the quite appealing appearance of concern for the simplification of administration, is liable to take less account of the specific details of certain modes of production."
"I also find it regrettable that neither my fellow Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development nor I have had the time to study, under the right conditions, the Commission's proposal, as a consequence of the diabolical timetable laid down by the Presidency of the Council."
"This whole process was worthy of being considered in greater depth within the European institutions, and I find it regrettable that more time could not have been found for a subject of such fundamental importance."
"It is for that reason I decided to abstain from the final vote."
"in writing. (SV) The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has again prepared a report opposed to reform of the common agricultural policy."
"We wish to abolish the common organisation of the market in cereals."
"However, we support the Commission's proposal, as opposed to the approach of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, because the said committee now wants to oppose the abolition of maize intervention."
"The June List observes that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision in respect of the EU's agricultural policy. Otherwise, the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of providing heavy subsidies to all the various farming groups."
"I voted for the Glattfelder Report on the Common organisation of the market in cereals not because I entirely support its contents but because it is in line with CAP reform."
"I also accepted as a compromise the phasing out of public interventions to support cereal crops."
"in writing. - (FR) Reform of the system for intervention in support of maize is a matter of necessity."
"Although it is thought of as a safety rope in the event of difficulties and as a means of getting production flowing, the system is no longer - particularly in Hungary - playing only this primary role and constitutes nothing other than a business opportunity."
"It must not, however, be abandoned overnight, and certainly not only on the basis of an economic study relating to two exceptional marketing campaigns, and based on the problems of one Member State, namely Hungary."
"The Commission's proposal is unacceptable on the grounds of being premature and incapable of being managed by producers under favourable conditions."
"One must not treat speed and haste as being the same thing."
"Limiting the quantity eligible to benefit from the intervention system and re-examination at the time of the health check would be a good compromise between the need to act and the need to take the time to do so."
"Solutions to local problems need themselves to be local in nature, and Parliament's response to the radical and ill conceived measure proposed by the Commission shall be to propose progressive reform, reflection, listening to agriculturalists and a re-examination at the time of the health check."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall limit myself to pointing out the regrettable fact that the vote that has been taken in favour of our colleague will easily be overturned by the European Communities' Court of Justice, and the reason why this is so is that you have variable-geometry case law."
"When the scandalous attempt was made to deprive Mr Le Pen of his mandate, you had recourse to national competence and were unwilling to confirm for yourselves that the French authorities were interfering with his rights."
"You saw fit to act similarly when it came to the verification of the credentials of another Member of this House, Mr Ruiz-Mateos, when, again, you had recourse to national law."
"Yet now you want to defend the prerogatives of this House, and why ever not?"
"In any case, the end product of your attitude was a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Communities which, unfortunately for you, found against you, thus confirming the truth of the Latin dictum, 'Hodie mihi, cras tibi' - my turn today and yours tomorrow."
"This House's acting as judge is defensible only if the House judges all its Members equally."
"The issues raised in this report are complex and have far-reaching implications. At the heart of the matter is the sovereign power of Member States to nominate MEPs and to define how they are represented in the European Parliament within the context of the existing regulatory framework for elections to Parliament."
"I do not wish to go into detail regarding a procedural and legal issue that rests exclusively with the Member State in question, but, according to the report before us, the Italian authorities have decided, on the basis of a decision by the Italian Council of State, to nominate a particular politician to the European Parliament whose credentials are called into question by this report."
"We take the view that, given that all the criteria and conditions for the nomination of an MEP by a Member State have been met - at national and European Parliament level - the Member State in question should be allowed to proceed with the nomination, in compliance with the internal legal framework."
"(DE) Mr President, I just wanted to make known that I abstained from the vote on CITES: not because I did not agree with many things contained in the resolution but because, as so often happens, this House is dictating to developing countries behaviour that seems right to us, but that those countries may not consider so appropriate."
"That is why I abstained."
"The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international agreement aimed at ensuring that the international trade in certain species of wild fauna and flora does not threaten their survival."
"171 countries are signatories to the Convention, including Portugal, which ratified the text of the Convention in December 1980. It entered into force in Portugal in March 1981."
"Given the vulnerability of many species, CITES is of acute importance."
"There are currently 5 000 animals and 28 000 plants protected by CITES including species found on Portuguese territory."
"The species covered by CITES are divided into three appendices according to the level of protection needed."
"The legal trade in animals and plants has for a number of years constituted a serious threat to many species and, although many countries have stepped up the fight, and have become increasingly vigilant, the threat level unfortunately remains high."
"As in other kinds of agreement and protection plans for wild species, the success of CITES also depends on the adoption of a balanced approach based on scientific criteria and recommendations by accredited bodies thus ensuring the validity and credibility of its actions and the effective implementation of the agreed recommendations."
"The report views innovation as a variable in the internal market. It calls for the liberalisation of the markets and the systematic removal of obstacles to the free movement of goods, services and capital, to freedom of establishment and to the mobility of the workforce, all of which forms part of a capitalist approach based on competition and concentration."
"In order to deal with the under-funding of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development, the report follows the trend of providing for the use of structural funds and seeks 'to promote and strengthen public-private partnerships', in other words to put public investment at the mercy of private profit."
"What is needed is to promote public investment in research, education and innovation, on the basis of sustainable development strategies, in every country."
"This would help improve the quality of life, create jobs (with rights) and generate (fairly distributed) wealth."
"What are needed are strategies that oppose the commercialisation of knowledge, education and research and that oppose the idea that only highly profitable research, with market opportunities, can actually take place. What are needed are strategies that promote greater investment in education and training at all levels and that actually make it easier for SMEs to access existing programmes and actions."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. (PL) The report basically highlights the need for a broad innovation strategy in Europe, which would improve the competitiveness of its economy."
"The innovation strategy should be based on the creation of specialised areas of knowledge, the reform of patent laws and the introduction of tax incentives for companies investing in research and innovation."
"In order to make the exchange of knowledge between research institutions and economic entities easier, the rapporteur sees a need to promote specialised areas of knowledge in the Member States, greater trans-border cooperation and more intensive cooperation with experts from third countries."
"In keeping with the spirit of the report, I would say that the European Institute of Technology should create the necessary conditions for connecting centres of knowledge with companies by means of an emphasis on innovation and efforts to foster competition in economic sectors focusing on innovation."
"Another important part of the report is the emphasis it places on the need to reform European patent policy."
"We cannot deny that reliable and fair copyright protection and patent systems are key elements for building an economy, and a society, that is based on innovation and knowledge."
"I voted for the Gierek report but against all amendments which could have led to reviving discussions on the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive."
"Given the efforts to find a majority in the first place for this directive it would not have been helpful to reopen the debate."
"There is a long-established idea that close relations between higher education and business can only benefit both parties. There is sometimes a discrepancy, however, between that idea and the reality."
"The public authorities are often engaged in creating conditions (depending on methods and times) that are conducive to scientific and academic research, but do not always do so - or do not always succeed in doing so - as effectively in the business community."
"Support for innovation in the business sphere of course follows different rules and methods from those governing investment in research in the academic sphere."
"Even so, bearing in mind that a major part of innovation comes directly from business activity and from the quest for responses to what the market is looking for, I feel that this report by Parliament makes a useful contribution to the proposals contained in the Commission communication."
"Let us hope that the national and regional authorities make the most of these opportunities."
"Mr President, I would like to explain the way I voted on Mr Gierek's report on innovation."
"I voted in favour, since the rapporteur has done a difficult and necessary job on an issue that is crucial in terms of achieving the Lisbon objectives, but which we have yet to deal with."
"In order to become an advanced knowledge-based society, not only do we have to be strong on technological research and development, that is to say on our capacity to generate, absorb, assimilate and communicate new knowledge and capacities to society and to companies, but we also have to be strong on the capacity to convert this knowledge into wealth and social well-being. That is innovation."
"Not all of the EU's countries are at the same level in terms of the indicators defining a knowledge-based society, nor in terms of innovation efforts."
"Reducing these differences would benefit everybody."
"Innovation is probably the only instrument that can enable us, within a reasonable space of time, to achieve such important objectives as:"
"1) Improving the quality and competitiveness of our companies;"
"2) Making economic growth compatible with preserving the environment, and with quality of life and social cohesion."
"3) Innovation makes it possible to maintain traditional sectors;"
"4) Naturally, innovation can contribute to substantially improving working conditions and also the integration of certain groups, such as disabled people."
"The most up-to-date economic analyses establish a direct relationship between research, development and innovation efforts and productivity, which is of particular interest to the majority of our countries with economies based on the services sector, for which productivity is perhaps one of their greatest weaknesses."
"All of this is taken up to a greater or lesser extent in the report, and for that reason I have voted in favour."
"I am voting in favour of Professor Adam Gierek's report on 'Putting knowledge into practice: A broad-based innovation strategy for Europe'."
"At the moment, there is a great innovation divide in the world."
"On the one hand, there are countries who create 'innovation fronts', which group together the great majority of the scientific, research and development sectors, while on the other there are the sidelined countries, which can only participate as importers or countries where innovation is diffused."
"The world leaders in terms of innovation are the USA, Japan and the countries of the European Union, and the competition between these economies provides a stimulus for further innovation."
"However, in the European Union, there has recently appeared a so-called 'innovation paradox'."
"Economic results for the Community can be seen as disappointing in view of the opportunities that the single European market offers."
"The plan to transform the EU into the 'most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world'” is, on the one hand, a sign of the fact that the Union is aware of the need to fundamentally reform its social and economic system and, on the other hand, a sign of the ambitious and optimistic view that such change is possible."
"In the report, the rapporteur very aptly points to the main reasons for this situation in the EU and, above all, highlights the need to develop an effective innovation strategy for Europe."
"(CS) Today's recommendation from the European Parliament to the Council concerning the development of a strategic concept for tackling organised crime is an extremely important and welcome piece of news for Europe's citizens."
"It is proof that the Union is fulfilling its central role in an area that requires the closest possible international cooperation."
"Such cooperation is already working extremely well, but it is no longer enough."
"Terrorism and other forms of organised crime know no boundaries and are also, quite literally, exploiting the benefits of our democratic system."
"We must therefore weigh up what are the most important values in any given situation: combating crime or unfettered freedom."
"The time has come for us to cut back on our wonderful unlimited freedom in situations where that freedom prevents us from protecting the most precious thing of all, namely life itself."
"The time has definitely come to change tack and to remove some internal obstacles, including those which protect illegally acquired economic and financial resources."
"The Council must provide Europol and Eurojust with greater independence and authority."
"This is a new strategic task, and it is a responsibility that we have towards the 500 million citizens of the EU."
"in writing. - (FR) I am happy that Mr Newton Dunn's own-initiative report has been adopted by a very large majority; for our House is thereby making several recommendations to the Council in respect of the drafting of a strategic concept for combating organised crime."
"The abolition of internal borders between the Member States belonging to the Schengen area is certainly a major advance for our fellow citizens, but it is also helpful to organised crime, and so the European Union has a particularly important part to play in this area."
"One fundamental and urgent requirement is that a policy of prevention be implemented and effective instruments put in place."
"If there is to be greater trust between states, and between their respective police forces in particular, then a great deal of progress needs to be made, and the countries from which we all come need to be pressed to set aside sufficient budgetary resources for their exchange and training programmes."
"Finally, this House of ours has highlighted the need not only for victim and witness protection schemes to be reinforced, but also for the promotion of campaigns making public opinion more aware of the traffic in human beings."
"For all these reasons, I have given the rapporteur my backing and have, in the final vote, cast my vote in favour of this report."
"I welcome the report by Bill Newton Dunn on tackling organised crime."
"It is vital that the EU has the necessary tools to promote and strengthen a coordinated strategy to tackle organised crime."
"The roles of Europol and Eurojust need to be enhanced and the public need to be made more aware of the EU's role in this matter."
"I voted for the report on the fight against organised crime presented by Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE, GB) because it will ensure that Europol's role as a criminal intelligence body is strengthened, allowing it to fulfil its task of providing Member States with information and intelligence leading to more effective results in preventing and combating organised crime."
"The EU has always played an important role in the fight against organised crime and it is now necessary to provide the Union with a more powerful and ambitious instrument to work more closely with Member States to improve cooperation in order to combat organised crime more effectively."
"More than a matter of choice or duty, the need for cooperation when it comes to fighting organised crime is clearly of practical value, as organised crime becomes more sophisticated, better equipped and more efficient in its use of the most up-to-date technology."
"As well as the opening up of physical borders arising from the process of EU integration, one must be mindful of the fact that globalisation and its mechanisms also come into play when it comes to crime."
"As with all technological innovations, it is always open to being used for good deeds and bad."
"I therefore welcome the overall thrust of this report, which advocates enhanced cooperation and the need for a strategic approach that encompasses this fight and everything connected with it at all stages."
"That being said, the recommendation will only prove useful, and be at its most effective, if in addition to passing laws, steps are taken aimed at actually enhancing mutual trust between the institutions responsible for fighting crime in the various Member States."
"Trust of this kind, which is not always in evidence, has been shown to be vital to the success of this mission."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Union needs to equip itself with the instruments that will enable it to fight more effectively against organised crime, which knows no frontiers and is, lamentably, on the increase."
"In view of organised crime's activities being spread over different areas, the European Union must coordinate and maximise the effect of its actions; while it must be able to respond, it must also put in place a policy of prevention."
"Putting this strategy in place will make for deeper understanding of problems and will make available the tools with which organised crime can better be fought, and one of our priorities is greater cooperation between the police in criminal matters by means of Europol, Eurojust and OLAF."
"A multi-disciplinary approach is of primary importance if we are to find the best possible way to keep organised criminal gangs in check, for we need to dismantle such organisations, bring the criminals in them to justice and deny them the proceeds of their crimes."
"The fight against money-laundering and weapons trafficking is among Europe's priorities in this conflict, for these two types of organised crime serve the interests of terrorists."
"in writing. - (EL) The report uses the existing problem of organised crime as a pretext to promote a harsher policy to restrict fundamental individual rights and strengthen the police state and the uncontrolled action of the repressive mechanisms of the ΕU."
"Within this framework it proposes: the approximation of the criminal law provisions of the Member States, thereby paving the way for the 'communitisation' of criminal law and limiting one of the most important foundations of the national sovereignty of the Member States, the creation of joint investigation teams acting for the repressive mechanisms, the autonomy of Europol and Eurojust and the strengthening of their character and competences, so that they can act as a 'moving spirit' in the exercise of the policy of the Member States, the recognition of the fundamental role of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator and the adoption of an informant mechanism, calling for 'a formal status for collaborators of justice at European level'."
"Of course, after all that, it is hardly surprising that the report makes no reference to the link between organised crime and state institutions and the repressive state mechanisms themselves, even though their underground relations are common knowledge."
"It is clear that, ultimately, the real aim of the report is to 'combat' democratic rights and grassroot freedoms, not organised crime."
"in writing. (SV) Because we believe that it is not at EU level that foreign policy should be conducted or, by extension, foreign policy statements made, we have voted against all the amendments and against the report as a whole."
"There is no doubt that many of the proposals are commendable in themselves, but neither the EU nor the European Parliament should have competence in these issues."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party is pleased to have been able to inject a degree of balance and impartiality into this report, which was severely lacking in the first draft presented to Committee."
"In relation to amendments 16 and 34, we express our deep concern regarding the suspension of the Pakistan Chief Justice and subsequent unrest that has led to over 40 deaths."
"Protecting the independence of the judiciary is of vital importance in a modern democratic society."
"However, referring to this case is inappropriate in a report dealing specifically with the Kashmir dispute."
"With regards to combating terrorism, we have supported the more constructive and forward-looking language in amendments 55 and 56, which acknowledge that there has been progress in decreasing the levels of infiltration by militant groups, but that further action needs to be taken in parallel with meaningful demilitarisation."
"In voting for amendments 18 and 56, we reaffirm the right to self-determination for the Kashmiri people, which can be expressed through a plebiscite when the conditions are right."
"Reluctantly, I voted for this report."
"I recognise that it is radically different from the one-sided version originally put before the Foreign Affairs Committee and thank those involved for those changes."
"Kashmir is a region divided by history and has become a cause of conflict, which has been perpetuated at times by government and militant action on both sides of the Line of Control."
"This is not simply an issue for governments but also for the Kashmiri people."
"I regret that Parliament did not vote to strengthen the commitment to the right of those people for self-determination through a plebiscite."
"I also regret that we did not strengthen our calls for the demilitarisation of the region."
"I recognise the role of insurgency but we must acknowledge that the Indian side has one of the highest ratios of military and security personnel to the population of any part of the world."
"We call for confidence-building measures and greater democracy: democracy cannot flourish in such circumstances."
"So, I wish the final report had been stronger on these crucial areas but I also recognise that this version now has a political value in EU relations with the peoples concerned."
"I voted for this report, which is more balanced than the text put to Committee."
"I abstained on the amendment which expressed regret at the suspension of the Chief Justice of Pakistan not because I disagree with the criticism but because I did not see it as relevant to this report."
"I voted for the amendment calling for a plebiscite at a future date because I believe that the people of Kashmir should be in charge of their own destiny."
"Having visited Kashmir and seen some of the devastating effects of the past violence but also having seen a people ready for peace, I support this report based on the importance it has for the way the European Union seeks, by offering best practice measures and experience, to show other countries how an economic zone can develop peace and prosperity in regions that have a history of war."
"I herald the confidence-building measures proposed in this report, in particular the joint monitoring cell for the sharing of data on seismic activity to provide early warning against possible earthquakes."
"I also see the importance of community development measures that will stimulate the economy and activate untapped economic resources in the region."
"Furthermore, I believe it is of utmost importance that the region of AJK has proper representation in the Pakistani Government, which it does not yet have."
"(LT) Mr President, first I would like to thank my colleagues who voted for the resolution on Estonia."
"Today's vote in the European Parliament showed that EU common foreign and defence policy is not just a declaration on paper or a collection of slogans."
"It showed that it is an operating policy."
"Today the European Parliament demonstrated something else too; namely, that solidarity in the European Union is alive and an operating principle."
"It is easy to declare and demonstrate solidarity when there are no problems and everything is fine."
"However, it is much more important and more complicated to implement solidarity at critical moments, in times of crisis."
"Today the European Parliament also showed that there is no disjuncture in the European Union between old and new, or large and small European Union Member States, and that there are no important or less important Members whose interests can be sacrificed for the benefit or interests of the large countries."
"UKIP deplores the behaviour of Russia towards Estonia, but cannot vote in favour of any resolution from the EU Parliament whose legitimacy we do not recognise."
"We are firmly opposed to the resolution adopted by Parliament today, which trivialises and obfuscates the true, serious significance of the recent events in Estonia and forms part of attempts to rewrite history."
"Hence our vote against the resolution."
"The point must be made that the resolution fails to make any reference to acts of Nazism and Fascism in Estonia, such as the renewed veneration of collaborators with the Nazi occupiers, thereby hiding their participation in the brutal repression and systematic murder of thousands of people."
"The recent decision to remove a World War II memorial in honour of those who lost their lives in the cause of defeating the Nazis and Fascists - entailing the removal of human remains - from the centre of Tallinn is a further provocation which forms part of this revisionism."
"The citizens of Estonia legitimately expressed their opposition to this decision and their actions were brutally repressed."
"Added to this provocation is the unacceptable discrimination towards large sections of the Russian-speaking Estonian population, who are refused citizenship by the authorities."
"This is an issue that goes way beyond EU relations with the Russian Federation."
"All anti-fascists and democrats should join forces to express their indignation."
"in writing. (SV) I support the resolution because we believe that Russian interference in what happened in Estonia is very serious and is unacceptable."
"I do not, however, agree with paragraph 8."
"It is up to each sovereign state to decide whether or not a dialogue should be begun."
"Paragraph 7 comments on the Internet attacks carried out."
"These are very serious actions, but I do not believe that the EU should devise a plan in this connection, because the issue is best dealt with at Member State level."
"I supported the resolution on Estonia, which showed solidarity with the country in the face of interference by the Russian authorities in the internal affairs of Estonia."
"In particular, I support the call on the Russian Government to respect the Vienna Convention on the protection of diplomats."
"I voted against the compromise motion for a resolution on the recent events in Estonia, as did the left wing of the European Parliament, because it is governed by unilateral perceptions and because I believe that it is unacceptable for anyone to revise history, whatever they suffered from the Soviets."
"The monument whose removal was the cause of the demonstrations and tension is a monument to the victory over fascism."
"No one can call it otherwise in the name of opposition to Soviet sovereignty."
"The unilateral approach to the matter cannot be accepted."
"Not only does it not help to reduce the tension caused between Estonia and Russia, it feeds it."
"in writing. (PL) The riots in Tallinn and the attack on the Estonian embassy in Moscow have made Member States aware of the current government's policy towards individual Member States."
"However, on this occasion, Moscow, which has adopted a very aggressive stance towards one of the smallest European countries, has bitten off more than it can chew."
"For the first time, Europe has presented a unified front towards Russia."
"This is an important day in the history of the European Union, as solidarity is one of the fundamental principles on which the Community is based."
"That is why I am pleased to have been part of the majority of Members who supported the adoption of the previously mentioned resolution."

"1."
"The Radio Caracas TV Channel in Venezuela"
"The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on the case of 'Radio Caracas TV' in Venezuela."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Venezuela we are witnessing the classic phenomenon of the gradual concentration of authoritarian power."
"The Venezuelan Government often speaks of itself as the promoter of a revolution and we should therefore be asking whether that revolution is leading in a democratic direction or not."
"Unfortunately it is not."
"Things are increasingly moving in the opposite direction to freedoms, fundamental rights, pluralism and social harmony."
"There are other worrying phenomena that I could mention in the political, constitutional, legislative, social and also, recently, military spheres."
"These events are worrying for all democrats, for the Venezuelan people's friends in the world and also for the large Portuguese community that lives and works in Venezuela."
"We know that the Venezuelans have paid a high price to win democracy over the last fifty years, and we want it to be maintained."
"We also know that political and social stability is valuable for democracy, freedom and peace."
"Today we are focussing on the Radio Caracas Televisión case and on the threat that it represents to freedom of expression, a universal fundamental right."
"I shall not go into details, but it was his Excellency President Chávez who, on 28 December, announced the decision to close down the broadcasts of Radio Caracas, making extremely serious political accusations against it."
"The competent authority did not issue the administrative act until three months later, on 28 March, and that act does not mention any of the serious accusations that the Venezuelan Embassy in Brussels has also communicated to us."
"None of these accusations have been brought before a court and the administrative act of the National Telecommunications Council (CONATEL) mentions other intentions involving the creation of a public service channel, in a process which, in our countries, we would consider illegal and arbitrary."
"The mood has become more heated and we have seen people protesting against this decision in the streets."
"We also know from the polls that public opinion is against and we know that this is a political case, and, being a political one, it is therefore a bad case."
"We are calling for the Rule of Law to be upheld and we are appealing for dialogue: dialogue and law."
"That is what is needed."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an international campaign is being conducted to delegitimise Venezuela, its freely elected President and all its democratic institutions."
"There is a direct relationship between today's debate and this international campaign; even the European Parliament is inappropriately debating an issue that is for the Venezuelan national government alone to decide."
"What is more, our debate focuses on an inappropriate sector, that of human rights violations, when in fact we all know that no human rights have been violated."
"The reality is that this represents a political move; it is no accident that this agenda item was put forward by a group of MEPs and not by an official European Parliament delegation as some have tried to claim, to be precise, by a group of MEPs who went to Venezuela and met with members of the opposition only."
"In reality, the non-renewal of the licence for Radio Caracas TV is a matter for the Venezuelan Government alone, and their decision respects the country's laws and constitution."
"Radio Caracas TV will be able to transmit via cable, satellite and the Internet, and therefore those who claim that the decision represents an act that is hostile to freedom of expression know this to be a lie."
"There are a great number of cases in Europe in which frequency licences are not renewed and yet this Parliament has never spoken of human rights violations and curbing freedom of expression."
"The fact is that freedom of expression and pluralism of information and television broadcasts are guaranteed in Venezuela."
"In the particular case of Radio Caracas TV we are talking about a television station that played an active role in supporting the coup in 2002 and the oil blockade in 2002 and 2003."
"Any accusations of subversive activities should therefore be made to those who have encouraged the breakdown of Venezuela's democratic and constitutional regime through a terrorist campaign and by manipulating information, and certainly not to a democratically elected government actively demonstrating its social commitment."
"author. - Mr President, RCTV is a privately-owned TV station, which has been operating in Venezuela for more than half a century."
"RCTV's history is, unfortunately, stigmatised mainly by its alleged controversial role in the April 2002 attempted coup in Venezuela."
"This is seen as the main reason behind the recent National Telecommunications Commission's decision, supported by a Supreme Tribunal decision, not to renew RCTV's broadcast licence."
"Against this position, one has to set the upholding of the principle of freedom of the press and of media plurality."
"I admit the situation here is not black and white and the line separating one side of opinion from another is very fine, but only by a tiny margin we consider the freedom of the press prevails and any alleged ill-doing by the RCTV station must be properly substantiated in a court of law."
"Consequently, my group supports the resolution as it stands."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the non-renewal of the frequency licence for RCTV represents a politically inopportune precedent, insofar as such measures should be restricted to the specific cases laid down by law."
"At the same time, we refuse to become involved in a campaign that is justified not only by events in Venezuela, but has arisen within a Member State of the European Union, that is to say in Spain, where this idea is actively used."
"In our opinion, dealing with such matters in an atmosphere of urgency, in a situation in which there is no opportunity for background work on freedom of expression, not only in Venezuela, I might add, but also in various other countries of the European Union, does not enable our Parliament to work on these issues in a credible manner."
"We cannot divide ourselves into left and right on such subjects, we cannot take a vote in which one side of the Chamber goes one way and the other side goes another."
"We must send out a positive message that encourages dialogue and does not conjure up phantoms and devils."
"Although we will not support the resolution, we believe and we hope that approval will be given to a paragraph enabling our competent committees to work together on these issues to achieve a united position that may be of use to the debate in Venezuela."
"It is not a question of interfering in national affairs, but words like 'legitimacy' and 'illegitimacy' are not to be bandied about at random."
"We are talking about a serious topic; we recognise that there is indeed a risk of restriction of freedom in Venezuela, but this does not justify a witch-hunt that is, moreover, unworthy of the European Union."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, when we speak about freedom of speech and the fact that President Chavez decided not to renew the licence of one of the largest radio and television networks in Venezuela, we should consider in general terms what the limits of freedom are."
"We agree that freedom is not absolute, that it is restricted for the good of others, that it is limited by moral principles and that it may be restricted by legal principles."
"Freedom must serve a purpose."
"The freedom of the press is the very cornerstone of useful freedom."
"That is why I am surprised that here, in this Chamber, there are those from the Left, as is often case, who are attempting to justify the fact that freedom can be limited simply because the freedom in question is that of political adversaries."
"Freedom for us, according to one of the previous speakers, is a good thing, but freedom for our adversaries is not."
"This kind of freedom is no freedom at all."
"This is something we have experienced and observed."
"We lived in a communist state where people said that freedom should exist, but only for us, and not for our adversaries, in keeping with the famous motto that 'there is no freedom for enemies of freedom'."
"Communism fell and it seemed that we would have peace."
"Meanwhile, it turns out that Communism is like a hydra which springs back to life in various parts of the world and that there are those who defend it even here in this Chamber."
"They say that Mr Chavez is doing the right thing by silencing those he does not like, as it turns out that those people are also disliked by some of those present here."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us beware of the Left, the extreme Left, which is always prepared to defend all restrictions placed on human rights when it suits their purposes."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, dictatorships are not established overnight."
"They take form through a thousand small subversions of the democratic order - the targeting of opposition leaders, the subversion of the electoral commission, the vitiation of the judiciary, the dissolution of the national assembly and, not least, the silencing of independent media."
"Hugo Chávez's Venezuela has something of the feel of Eastern Europe in the late 1940s."
"There are still elections, there are still opposition parties, there are still free newspapers, but the direction is unmistakable."
"True, President Chávez has not annulled the electoral process, but then there were elections every four years in the Comecon states throughout the Cold War."
"There are elections today in most of Mr Chávez's closest allies - Iran, Byelorussia, Zimbabwe - it is simply that opponents of the regime find it hard to contest those elections, and that is why we should be so alarmed by the harassment and expropriation of Mr Chávez's critics."
"Venezuela is not Cuba, at least not yet, but the complacency exhibited by some in this House is at best naive, and at worst shameful."
"We are witnessing the slow asphyxiation of a once open and liberal polity."
"If we do nothing else, for heaven's sake, let us at least register our disapprobation!"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to speak in this House in defence of press freedom: here, in Venezuela and anywhere in the world."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has supported a motion for a resolution, basically presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance with certain amendments, and we are still supporting it in this House."
"We are doing so because there are elections in Venezuela, as previous speakers have said."
"Mrs Frassoni and I were there representing the European Union during the last elections, and we witnessed a fair election process."
"There is press freedom in Venezuela."
"It is true that it is not good for press freedom to be restricted and we must be concerned about anything of that nature, but we must also acknowledge that the Venezuelan Government is a democratic government and that there are judicial guarantees."
"Any intervention by us could therefore be interpreted as the European Union interfering in the internal affairs of a country that is in a rather delicate situation."
"Venezuela is currently split in two and the last thing we should do is contribute to a confrontation amongst Venezuelans."
"The role of this Parliament and of the European Union must be to act in a friendly manner towards the Venezuelan authorities, society and political forces in order to prevent this conflict from becoming any worse."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is true that President Chávez's economic and social policies are posing a big challenge to powerful interests and there may well be, as Mr Catania maintains, a campaign to delegitimise his government."
"However, we are not here to discuss the rights and wrongs of his socio-economic policies or indeed the internal politics of Venezuela."
"This motion for a resolution is an expression of worry about a suppression of pluralism and dissent, and that is our business."
"It is a shame if the elevation of President Chávez to an icon of anti-globalisation and anti-capitalism blinds some in this House to the drift towards an authoritarian and anti-democratic system."
"I find myself in rather rare agreement with Mr Hannan."
"This has happened to the Mayor of my city, London, Mr Livingstone, who belongs to the Labour Party."
"A year ago he said: 'For many years people have demanded that social progress and democracy go hand in hand, and that is exactly what is now taking place in Venezuela. ..."
"With Chávez the choice is not difficult at all."
"He is both carrying out a progressive programme and doing so through the mandate of the ballot box.'"
"It is true, as Mr Hannan has said, that there are still elections, but there is an undoubted drift towards autocracy and a suppression of opinions that do not fit with the regime."
"We had some amusement when six months ago Mr Livingstone went 5000 miles to try to see President Chávez but unfortunately got stranded in Cuba because the President could not find the time to see him."
"We had a laugh about that."
"However, it is quite serious when somebody who is democratically elected as the Mayor of, I would say, Europe's premier city, finds himself wishing to cosy up to someone who is not only populist but increasingly authoritarian."
"It is because there are breaches of human rights in Venezuela that we have this motion for a resolution."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, we have said it before and we must say it again: freedom of expression is not just a fundamental right, but it is also the guarantee of democracy."
"We must therefore condemn, and combat, any attempt to restrict it or violate it, wherever it takes place."
"This is precisely what is expressed in the joint resolution presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, in which we call essentially for two things: firstly, for the Venezuelan State to guarantee the plurality of the media and non-concentration as a mechanism for promoting freedom of expression; and secondly, we call upon the Venezuelan media, both public and private, to treat information relating to electoral politics in an objective and impartial manner."
"The resolution also takes note of the Venezuelan Government's statement that it will abide strictly by decisions taken by the judiciary, and we add that all of the parties should do exactly the same thing."
"I sincerely believe that this is an extremely balanced resolution that is consistent with the principles of freedom of expression and plurality of the media."
"I can therefore only imagine that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group have presented their alternative proposal for reasons of Spanish domestic politics, not motivated by the fundamental issue that we are discussing but rather by the kind of political opportunism that we have seen on previous occasions in this House."
"It ignores fundamental facts such as, for example, the fact that the non-renewal of the licence is only for VHF and not for broadcasts by cable, UHF, satellite or Internet."
"It is not a question of deciding whether or not we are in favour of Hugo Chávez: that is not the issue."
"What we are talking about here is freedom of expression, but let us not indulge in demagoguery please."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present resolution represents a further attempt by the conservative groups to exploit the subject of human rights for their own ends."
"This is not about the freedom of the media; it is about condemning the Venezuelan Government, one that has repeatedly received an overwhelming majority of the popular vote in democratic elections and is serious about fighting poverty and exploitation in its country - in contrast, of course, to most European governments, who with their neoliberal agenda are making the gulf between the haves and the have-nots ever wider."
"In fact, it is Europe where the tackling of the power of private media moguls and private media conglomerates, and the establishment of a genuinely democratic media culture, is long overdue."
"Instead of arrogantly interfering in Venezuelan media politics, therefore, it would be far more appropriate to follow the example of the democratic and social standard of the Bolivian revolution."
"Europe, too, has alternatives to neoliberalism."
"- (PL) Mr President, the President of Venezuela, Mr Hugo Chavez, has said that he will not renew the licence of one of the largest private television stations, Radio Caracas TV, which has been broadcasting for 53 years."
"This move is nothing less than an attack on democracy and freedom of speech, as well as an attempt to undermine the position of private broadcasting companies that are critical of the Venezuelan Government."
"This decision is unacceptable and goes against all international treaties which Venezuela has signed and which compel it to respect the plurality of the media, not to mention the fact that Articles 57 and 58 of the Venezuelan constitution guarantee the freedom of speech, communication and information."
"Events taking place in Venezuela are extremely worrying, as they are yet another example of the flagrant abuse of human and civil rights in countries which call themselves democracies, such as Cuba, China or Venezuela."
"The death of Anna Politkovska, a Russian journalist who denounced the Kremlin's activities in Chechnya, recently shocked the world."
"The European Union should clearly and emphatically denounce attempts to silence journalists who have dared to criticise the government."
"We cannot remain indifferent to the infringement of democratic principles."
"(EL) Mr President, the superficial interest of the political groups of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Liberals and the Union for Europe of the Nations, to project on the pretext of freedom of expression and through a joint resolution by the European Parliament the groundless, false allegations by the owners of the Radio Caracas TV radio and television station and the reactionary political forces in Venezuela which together played a leading part in the attempted coup in 2002, in the oil embargo in 2003, in the subversive action during the referendum on the dismissal of the president and in the constant, blatant infringements of the rules of freedom of information, is a barefaced and unacceptable action against both the government and the people of Venezuela."
"Information is a social commodity. 82% of radio and television stations belong to private companies."
"The spectrum of radio and television frequencies in Venezuela is a social asset that belongs to the people of the country and the legal representative for its management is its government."
"The government of Venezuela fully applies national and international rules on freedom of information."
"It takes a great deal of courage for someone to attack the government of Venezuela from this tribune when it is clear that the reasons for the attack lie elsewhere."
"They basically want to restore the status quo ante in Venezuela, they want the wealth-producing resources in this country and they want the exploitation of the people of Venezuela to continue and the European Parliament and the people of Venezuela themselves will not allow it."
"(CS) President Hugo Chávez has prevented Radio Caracas Televisión from renewing its license."
"Tens of thousands of Venezuelan citizens have gone out on to the streets to defend free broadcasting and they are expecting the help of democratic Europe."
"They are aware that if they lose their broadcasting freedom, what awaits them is the 'Cuban way'."
"They are aware that they will soon be prisoners in their own country, just like the Cubans, without independent information, because they are losing the opportunity to decide their affairs through democratic means."
"Chávez is planning to silence the media and to crush the opposition, which is warning that nationalisation and autocracy are bringing to the country not development, but food rations for poor people on the one hand, and luxury and unlimited power for the communist oligarchy on the other."
"Venezuela, Cuba and Bolivia: this is a dangerous alliance of autocratic regimes spreading anti-democratic ideologies around Latin America and the Caribbean."
"Europe will not remain silent."
"We insist on Venezuela upholding its international obligations on human rights and on maintaining equal rights for independent media outlets."
"Mr President, the Commission has been closely following the debate on the future of Radio Caracas TV, and our concern was raised at the outset by the statement made by the President of Venezuela and members of the Venezuelan Government to the effect that the frequency would not be renewed as of 27 May."
"The Commission has raised this important issue with the Venezuelan authorities several times."
"We have always underlined each state's sovereign right to organise and regulate its own broadcasting policies, but we have also stressed the importance that the European Union attaches to freedom of expression as the cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law."
"In its contacts with the Venezuelan Government, the Commission has also underlined its support for all initiatives aimed at promoting dialogue and mutual understanding and stressed that licensing procedures for the broadcast media should be transparent and non-discriminatory."
"The Commission received a letter in April from the head of television, Mr Granier, and members of Primero Justicia."
"It has also held meetings with the authorities and members of the Venezuelan Parliament and has listened carefully to the arguments and explanations offered by both sides."
"I wish to assure Parliament that the Commission is keeping a close eye on developments through its delegation in Venezuela and by virtue of its close cooperation with the diplomatic representations of EU Member States in Caracas."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"2."
"Human rights in Syria"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on human rights in Syria."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, my interest in Syrian affairs is common knowledge;"
"I have always taken the view that isolating that country would do no good at the international level and would do nothing to advance peace in the region, and it is for that reason that I am a supporter of the plan for an association agreement, which has been put on ice ever since the assassination of Rafiq Hariri."
"Commitment to Syria and friendship with it also imply, however, that we do not mince our words when fundamental rights are violated, and that is why I take a critical line on, and indeed denounce, the political repression under which all the opposition, of whatever tendency, currently labour."
"Most of the prisoners for whose release we are calling today are people we have met; they are almost friends, and none of them, when speaking with us, talked in terms of recourse to any means other than legal and peaceful ones in democratising the country that they all love passionately."
"When a country turns on those who love it passionately, when it stifles freedom of expression, it puts itself in danger, and I would not want to see Syria doing that to itself."
"Today, we are calling for the release of Michel Kilo, Mahmoud Issa, Suleiman Achmar, Faek El Mir, Aref Dalila, Kamal al-Labwani and Anouar Bunni, who must be set at liberty."
"I would therefore appreciate it if the Council and the Commission were to pass this message on to the Syrian Government and if that body were to give it a very great deal of attention, for the message is a serious one."
"Moreover, it would be good if Syria were to firmly declare itself in favour of there being an international criminal tribunal under Chapter 6 to try Hariri's assassins; the international community would appreciate such a gesture, which would facilitate an exit from the political stalemate with which Lebanon is struggling, a stalemate that encourages recurrent bloody conflicts and offers forebodings of a period of violence and instability."
"It is common knowledge that Syria's adopting such a position, far from being an interference in Lebanese affairs, would, on the contrary, make it possible to break the deadlock and, above all, to put a stop to the rumours that give people cause to think that Syrian could, in an underhand way, frustrate the establishment of such a criminal tribunal."
"author. - (NL) Syria is a permanently recurring item on our agenda."
"The European Union is keen to strike up good and intense relations with that country in the framework of the Neighbourhood Policy involving countries around the Mediterranean."
"The chaos in its neighbour, Iraq, is yet another reason why stability in Syria would be valuable."
"Syria, however, is a dictatorship that does not tolerate internal opposition."
"For Christians and Kurds, it is, to say the least, an unpleasant place to be."
"Although it is not a theocratic state with sympathies towards Muslim fundamentalism, it does consider Iran - which is a theocratic dictatorship - as an ally."
"In Lebanon, it gives its backing to Lebanese and Palestinian Muslim fundamentalists, as long as they help to build up Syrian influence in its small neighbour."
"Lebanon is considered - albeit wrongly so - as an area that has been cut off from Syria as a result of European intervention."
"The conflict with Israel is being carefully nourished, because the tension that this brings with it means that the Syrians could well consider the continued existence of the regime as the lesser of two evils."
"There is no improvement in sight."
"Both an aggressive attitude towards Syria and friendly relations with this regime are counterproductive."
"The only thing that can contribute to long-term improvement is support for Syrian refugees and Syrian opponents in prison and in exile."
"I would like to finish off by saying that those who have recently become the victims of restrictions on freedom, like Michel Kilo who has been to visit this Parliament before, need our undivided attention."
"author. - Mr President, the annual report on the human rights situation in Syria for 2006 makes very grim reading indeed."
"Scores of arbitrary arrests and detentions of political opposition figures, reformists and human rights and civil society activists have taken place."
"In addition, documented reports of torture used as a routine and systematic interrogation method of extracting confessions are found in abundance."
"Furthermore, corrupt members of the Syrian judiciary, both civil and military, have been passing draconian sentences, including life incarceration and death sentences, influenced mainly by political motives."
"We call upon the Syrian Government, in the face of international condemnation, to at last make a serious effort to improve respect for the human rights of its citizens or face the consequences, which I hope, with some reservation, will be forthcoming and drastic."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Damascus is one of the oldest cities in the world, and present-day Syria is an ancient cultural area in which several peoples and religions have coexisted - peacefully, for the most part - for centuries, and where close cooperation between Muslims and Christians still exists."
"Mr Dess and I are particularly involved with the dialogue between these religions, which certainly has a good chance of success in that country - being an Arab country that is not Islamist and is very important throughout the region."
"All the more regrettable, then, that a regime has established itself there that, under Ba'athist national socialism, is victimising, persecuting and repressing people, subjecting them to show trials and taking political prisoners - and this at a time when our need for Syria's help in achieving peace in the region is more pressing than ever."
"I am not one of those who believe in the complete isolation of Syria."
"The country has an ancient tradition; one that should be harnessed to build peace."
"Without Syria there can be no peace in the Middle East, no peace in Lebanon and no resolution of the Iraq problem."
"For this very reason, however, we cannot accept violations of human rights, such as the repression of Kurds and others on the flimsiest grounds, and so we would appeal to Syria to return to a policy of dialogue and cooperation. We are prepared to engage in this, but not with a regime that lacks the fundamental will to respect democracy and the rule of law."
"It is impossible to conduct a reasonable foreign and security policy and reasonable economic relations with a country that shows contempt for fundamental human rights."
"This should be a clear signal to Syria, therefore, to change its course and return to the path of cooperation."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, the ongoing human rights abuses in Syria are reaching a frightening scale."
"The Syrian Government is drastically restricting freedom of speech, assembly and association of any kind."
"The Syrian authorities continue to pursue a policy of intimidation and imprisonment when dealing with human rights defenders and peaceful critics of the policies of the current government."
"Following the Beirut-Damascus declaration, which was signed in May of 2006, and which appealed for improved relations between Lebanon and Syria, the Syrian security forces arrested a dozen or so people for expressing views in this declaration that were different to the those of the Syrian Government."
"Those arrested included the brilliant writer Michel Kilo and the human rights campaigner Anwar al-Bunni."
"Thousands of political prisoners remain in prison without ever having been sentenced."
"The year 2006 passed without the Syrian authorities providing any information on the fate of 17 000 people arrested by the Syrian security forces."
"They were mainly members of the banned organisation Muslim Brotherhood, Syrian activists arrested in the 1980s and a few hundred Lebanese and Palestinian citizens arrested in Syria and Lebanon by the Syrian security forces, as well as by the Syrian-controlled Lebanese and Palestinian military police."
"As representatives of the European Union, we have to decisively oppose further repression and human rights abuses in Syria, as we jointly stated in today's resolution."
"Mr President, the Commission, together with Member States, is following the situation in Syria very closely."
"Since our last debate at the June 2006 part-session there have been a few positive developments."
"I would like to point out that a human rights contact was appointed in January 2007 in the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
"We also consider it positive that the EU is granted regular access to trials at the High State Security Court, the Military Court and the Criminal Court."
"However, we regret that none of the promises of political openness have been transformed into action - for instance, the relaxation of the emergency law, the adoption of a multi-party law, the granting of citizenship to stateless Kurds or the declaration of the National Council for Human Rights."
"We also deplore the disproportionate sentences pronounced against prominent civil society activists in recent weeks."
"We cannot accept that they are jailed only because they have expressed themselves freely."
"We call again for the release of all political prisoners in Syria."
"To give an example, all our attempts to help Mr Anwar al-Bunni have led to a dead end."
"Today Mr al-Bunni was sentenced to five years in prison merely for denouncing torture and poor prison conditions in Syria and fined EUR 1500 for allegedly not respecting Syria's law when setting up the training centre, also financed by European Funds."
"For several years the Commission has been supporting the modernisation process in Syria through a range of activities."
"We have seen very encouraging results in the economic field."
"We sincerely hope that these will spread to the political sphere."
"We will continue to encourage Syria to respect this obligation and the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights and Torture."
"I am sure that the European Parliament will give its support to these efforts by the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"3."
"Human rights in Sudan"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on human rights in Sudan."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, this is my first term as a Member of the European Parliament, but I do recall that this is our third debate on the subject of Sudan."
"In an ideal situation, from the point of view of the Sudanese people, there would be no need for our involvement."
"I welcome the fact that the six largest political groups in Parliament have come to an agreement on the matter of Sudan, and that we have a joint position."
"Paradoxically enough, one could say that the suffering and terrible verdicts handed down by the injustice system, I repeat - the injustice system, in that country seem to unite us in Europe."
"It is unacceptable in the twenty-first century for a situation to continue where women are sentenced to death by stoning for adultery or where sixteen year old children are sentenced to death by hanging."
"Yes, we have become involved in Sudan's internal affairs."
"Moreover, we should be involved for moral as well as other reasons."
"One of these reasons is that we have already earmarked EUR 85 million for humanitarian aid to that country this year alone."
"That figure was increased two months ago, as it initially stood at EUR 40 millions."
"We also have to loudly denounce cruel practices, such as the mutilation of young women, which also occurs in that country."
"On a personal note, there is no point hiding the fact that there is a debate taking place in my country on the subject of the death penalty."
"Personally, I am against the death penalty."
"Events in Sudan confirm my convictions, although the cultural context is, of course, entirely different."
"I would like to highlight the fact that we have to show solidarity in this matter."
"We have to act together, as it is only our solidarity, the solidarity of the whole European Union, that can put an end to these absurd verdicts."
"author. - Mr President, Sudan is perhaps best known for the conflict in Darfur, in which human rights abuses have reached gigantic proportions."
"However, Sudan is also a state where respect for human rights in general is seriously lacking throughout the country."
"This motion for a resolution reminds us again of the anachronistic and primitive judicial system applicable in Sudan, a system that allows the sentencing of women to death by stoning if found guilty of adultery and the sentencing of children to death."
"It is truly hard to believe that in the 21st century there are still governments that continue to tolerate and support such extraordinarily barbaric systems."
"We understand that Sudan is a very poor country, with many political and economic problems, but such problems should not be an excuse for not following a course of common-sense-guided progress towards upholding universal values of justice and democracy."
"Furthermore, we find it difficult to accept how religion can interfere to such drastic and occasionally sadistic effect in matters of criminal and civil law."
"We wish to send a strong message to the Sudanese Government that our patience is running out and the limits on our tolerance have long been exceeded."
"We demand that they implement an urgent revision of their judicial system, taking into consideration international law, UN conventions and respect for the human rights of the Sudanese people."
"We trust this will be done speedily, in order to avoid having to resort to more drastic persuasive measures."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, I fully agree with Mr Matsakis, except on one point."
"He states that Sudan is a poor country - which is true, but, with its oil wealth and much more, it has the potential to be an extremely rich one."
"Yet it is being exploited, and international forces and companies have certainly fanned the flames of the war in Darfur and elsewhere to promote their energy interests."
"Sudan, with its defective political system, is also inflicting infinite harm on itself, however, not only as a result of the conflict between north and south, east and west, Christians and Muslims - as the generalisation always goes - but also as a result of a host of individual conflicts."
"For this reason, we must insist on respect for fundamental human rights there."
"As has just been said, rightly, Europe rejects the death penalty."
"The debate in Poland has been mentioned."
"As we know, the death penalty is incompatible with membership of the European Union and also of the Council of Europe; but similar standards are having to be developed slowly in Africa, of course."
"The still fledgling African Union is particularly called upon in this regard to not only develop, but also implement and enforce politically the relevant human rights standards little by little - we know that this cannot be done overnight."
"For this reason, we appeal to the Sudanese Government to not only discontinue the death penalty - particularly its particularly scandalous use on minors - but also to refrain from a) misinterpreting Sharia law as it is doing, as the barbaric customs practised there have nothing to do with real Sharia law, and b) extending Sharia law to non-Islamic communities."
"The country must comply with normal civil law that is in line with the human rights standards of the United Nations."
"author. - (ES) Of all the horrors that can be inflicted on a human being, death by stoning is unquestionably one of the most incomprehensible and patently unacceptable."
"The case we are discussing today, the sentencing to death by stoning of Sadia Idris Fadul and Amouna Abdallah Daldoum, has two equally important dimensions."
"On the one hand, it obliges us once again to state our opposition to the death penalty as a form of punishment under any circumstances, and, on the other, it brings us face to face with another case of flagrant gender discrimination, since the sentence in question is based on an alleged crime - adultery - that is only classed as such in the case of women, and not in the case of men."
"It is not sufficient, therefore, to call for compliance with the international legislation regarding the death penalty against minors, nor even to urge all of the countries maintaining that practice to consign it to judicial and political history."
"In this case, we must also present this situation as one of blatant sexism, or one of selective killings on behalf of a patriarchy, which comes to the same thing."
"What we are dealing with when it comes to this kind of sentence that only affects women is a situation in which less value is attached to the lives of women compared to those of men."
"That is not acceptable in Sudan or in any other country of the world."
"I am therefore delighted with the extremely high degree of consensus on this resolution and I hope that it will contribute not just to putting an end to the death penalty but also to the practice of valuing the lives of men and women differently."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, even in the days when the current state of Sudan was still known as Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the question was whether this very extensive area with very different peoples should gain independence as one state."
"A united state would mainly be the state of the Arabic people in the north, the east and the centre, because it would be difficult for the black Islamic people in the east and the black Christian and animistic people in the south to secure an equivalent position."
"These areas, which were far less developed, were at a fair distance from the sea and were largely unknown to the international community."
"Eventually, they were ignored by everyone."
"After years of war, a compromise appeared to have been struck for the non-Islamic south that had been given self-government and a representation in the central government."
"As we know, this is not the case for Darfur that is located to the west."
"Fundamentalism is a prevailing force among the dominating Arabic people, and particularly among those who wield power and administer justice, with capital punishment, even stoning, for offences including adultery being the worst outward signs of this."
"The resolution rightly draws attention to international agreements and the need to abolish capital punishment."
"Sufficient attention must be given to this area, for the situation facing Sudan is a terrible one."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the conflict in Sudan, which has continued for over 50 years, has claimed at least 2 million victims."
"The breakthrough in one of the bloodiest wars in contemporary Africa came when a peace agreement was signed in Nairobi in 2005."
"However, the conflict continues in Darfur, in the western part of the country."
"To date, this conflict has resulted in 400 000 deaths and has displaced 2 million people."
"The inhabitants of this province are victims of the most serious crisis in the world today."
"They have no food, water or healthcare."
"The situation in Darfur has been critical for four years."
"The European Union has yet to take any effective steps to force the government in Khartoum to stop committing war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"The latest reports on the execution of minors in Sudan is additional confirmation of the fact that this country has, once again, infringed human rights."
"Although Sudan has signed many international agreements, including the Cotonou agreement, it flagrantly disregards them."
"We can no longer simply express our concern regarding the situation in Sudan, as European foreign ministers have done for the last three years in nineteen declarations on this issue."
"The time has come for effective economic sanctions, which would show the Sudanese leaders that their campaign of mass violence against their own citizens has a real price."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the four-year war in Darfur gives little hope that human rights will be observed in countries at war."
"Although the appropriate documents have been signed, the commitments made have not been honoured."
"During the military conflict in Darfur about 200 000 people have perished, and 2.5 million of the province's people have become homeless."
"The country is rife with chaos and governmental self-indulgence."
"I would like to draw attention to the conditions which continue to provoke military conflict and allow for human rights breaches in Sudan."
"Whose arms are being used for the fighting in Darfur?"
"According to Amnesty International, arms are being supplied to Darfur by China and Russia, although they deny it and have supported the UN Security Council resolution prohibiting the delivery of arms to Darfur."
"In addition, China has many energy and raw material interests in Sudan."
"They come to take profits and, it would appear, the unstable situation is to their advantage."
"Resolution of the conflict and rebuilding of human rights in Sudan will depend on the EU's cooperation with interested parties and international organisations, and their commitments, which these countries are not honouring."
"Mr President, Sudan's human rights record remains a cause of extreme concern to the European Commission and the EU, especially in consideration of the insecure and extremely volatile situation still existing in marginalised areas such as Darfur."
"Almost two years after signing the comprehensive peace agreement, the Sudanese Government is falling far short of many of the human rights commitments made under the CPA and the internal interim national constitution, signed by the President of the Republic in July 2005."
"Within the international community, European efforts to improve civilian protection in Sudan focus simultaneously on both security and political civilian actions."
"Since 2005 the Commission has funded approximately 35 projects aimed at promoting human rights and democracy in Sudan with a total budget of about EUR 6 million."
"With regard to the cases of the two women mentioned in Parliament's resolution, I can assure the honourable Members of Parliament that the European Union and the Commission are following the case very closely."
"This case was first raised by the heads of missions meeting in the Netherlands in mid-March and it was followed by the EU Troika on 27 March, composed of representatives from Germany, Greece and the Commission."
"More recently the EU raised the issue at the last Advisory Council on Human Rights meeting on 16 April."
"The Court of Appeal ordered that case be returned to the court of origin - the al-Gezira State Court - to be looked into again."
"Although we remain firmly opposed to the death penalty, the fact that the case has been sent for retrial is at least positive and we hope that the women will be given a fair trial in line with international human rights standards."
"The last case which we are discussing now is the case of two boys aged 16 years old sentenced to death by hanging."
"Various Member States and the Commission have raised this issue with the German Embassy and are waiting for the EU Presidency to take the lead on this issue in the days to come."
"If not, the Commission intends to raise this issue directly in a letter to the Sudanese authorities such as the Minister of Justice and the Advisory Council on Human Rights."
"The next meeting of EU-Sudan political dialogue with the Advisory Council on Human Rights will be in early June and this could be a good opportunity to raise this case again."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - How is this still going on?"
"There have been so many genocides in the past 100 years and each time we say it will never happen again."
"But we know it is happening right now in Darfur, and the world knows it is happening - so why are we so powerless to stop it?"
"In my own country of Ireland we have been able to silence the gun and bring communities together that we never thought imaginable."
"So why are we so unable to make headway in this part of the world?"
"To answer this question, we need to look at the situation in Darfur in a different way."
"If the world's sympathy and our resolutions could bring peace and relief to the people of Sudan it would have arrived long ago."
"We can continue to call on an unresponsive government in Sudan to change its ways, or we can look at why the support for its intransigence continues."
"We must cut the lifelines that are fuelling the destruction in Darfur, lifelines like Chinese oil money and Russian weapons."
"Until we are willing to stand up to these powers our resolutions will remain impotent and ineffective."
"4."
"The situation concerning the President of the World Bank"
"The next item is the debate on four motions for resolutions on the situation concerning the President of the World Bank."
"(DE) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my group."
"Under the Rules of Procedure, three debates on human rights issues are held within one hour on Thursday afternoon - and solely on cases of violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"This is a fourth debate, and it has nothing to do with democracy or human rights."
"Therefore, we are of the opinion that this constitutes an infringement of the Rules of Procedure - which not even the Conference of Presidents may disregard."
"Thus my group formally proposes that this item be discontinued immediately."
"I take note of your statement, Mr Posselt."
"Since the Conference of Presidents, in full knowledge of the facts, has decided to schedule four topics for debate today, I can do no more than take note of your statement and forward it to the President, who will consider how best to respond to it."
"That having been said, this item clearly cannot be carried forward."
"You are familiar with the rules, according to which items not taken today under the heading of debates on matters of topical and urgent importance lapse, and so, if you are absolutely insistent on this item not being discussed today, it will lapse and will not be taken forward to the mini-session."
"Mr President, on a point of order, you said that the Conference of Presidents had decided this under the Rules of Procedure."
"Could you tell me under which rule they were enabled to extend this item to have four rather than three debates?"
"Mr President, there has been a decision by the Conference of Presidents to follow this particular procedure."
"These matters have been placed on the agenda and I think that we should continue."
"I do not see why we are prevented from continuing our work."
"(FR) It may well be, Mr President, that we read the Rules of Procedure in a different way ..."
"In any case, as I read Rule 115, which allows these points of order to be put together under the heading of urgent business, the rule of law does actually have a part to play and, if the Conference of Presidents has ruled that, in its opinion, this resolution could be fitted in under this heading of our order of business, it may well be because the situation that has come about within the World Bank raises questions pertaining to the rule of law and of the way in which the law is applied within that institution."
"(DE) Mr President, as has already been said, the Rules of Procedure speak of three subjects - no one can disregard this."
"As my fellow Member has just mentioned, the matter itself has already been resolved by the resignation of the World Bank President."
"There is no reason whatsoever to address this matter, as the man concerned has taken the appropriate action."
"The Rules of Procedure state the number three, and we have already discussed three subjects."
"Even the Conference of Presidents cannot disregard this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the situation is as follows."
"As they stand, our Rules of Procedure permit the listing of three items on the agenda for debates on violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law; the Conference of Presidents has proposed four of them, and the plenary of our House accepted this on Monday without any objection being made."
"It can be contested under Rule 167, by moving the inadmissibility of a matter, but this has to be done twenty-four hours before the debates."
"In view of the fact that the Conference of Presidents, which is acquainted with the Rules of Procedure, made the proposal to the plenary, which did not object, I do not see how I could, today, go against the plenary's decision on Monday, not least in view of the fact that you have not submitted your request within the prescribed time."
"(DE) Mr President, it is possible, however, to propose the discontinuation of an item at the start of the debate - and that is what I have done."
"Mr Posselt, I shall quote from the Rule: 'The intention to move adjournment shall be notified at least twenty-four hours in advance to the President, who shall inform Parliament immediately.'"
"I very much regret it, but I am obliged to apply this Rule."
"You are perfectly entitled to demand that this item be withdrawn; you were able to do so when the agenda was adopted on Monday."
"I would remind you that nobody in this House on Monday objected to the agenda as proposed by the Conference of Presidents, and the period in which the withdrawal of this item could be requested has, unfortunately, expired."
"I really am very sorry, but I cannot decree that the plenary was wrong on Monday, and what I propose to do now is to move on to this debate, which, I can assure you, will be very brief, as very few Members have put themselves down to speak in it."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, appointing of the President of the World Bank should not be the privilege of the leader of the state with the largest package of shares, which has been the case to date."
"There was no need to compare the United States candidate to other candidates, or to weigh them up against each other, and there is one man who decides who the US candidate shall be."
"Wolfowitz was not the choice of those most closely involved in the World Bank, but the American President, George W. Bush's, and his alone."
"To Bush, he was a faithful ally, to others, an accident-prone person who always makes unsuccessful attempts at pursuing the wrong policy."
"He was a very controversial man when he took up office in the World Bank and has not really ceased to be one now that he is leaving it."
"Showing favouritism towards his fiancée was not an inadvertent mistake, but the justification needed to put an end to his headstrong and unacceptable way of going about things."
"These mistakes should not be repeated when his successor is chosen."
"A transparent appointment procedure with public hearings for candidates is very much what is called for."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, 60 years after the implementation of the Bretton Woods system, something clearly has to change."
"Two years after Mr Wolfowitz's arrival at the World Bank - and we all remember the conditions under which he was appointed and of which the previous speaker reminded us, whereby Mr Wolfowitz was obliged to come and explain himself to EU representatives meeting at Ecofin - it could be said that Europeans made the mistake of being right too early."
"Two years on, we find ourselves in a situation that has weakened not only the World Bank but also the entire international regulatory system, at a time when we really need it to be equal to its tasks."
"I would urge the EU - and this is the point of the resolution we are proposing - in future to meet its responsibilities in full and prove capable of proposing changes to the Bretton Woods system, in order to enhance the system of nominations, which currently ensures neither the legitimacy, transparency nor credibility of the person in charge of an institution as important as the World Bank."
"In this regard, the International Monetary Fund, for example, operates a system in which there is a degree of competition between the candidates and a certain amount of publicity, and this strikes me as a more acceptable system."
"In order to obtain something similar, we need to hold exhaustive negotiations with our US partners, covering all aspects of the issue."
"We made this point in the resolution we adopted last month and, with this in mind, we call on the current German and forthcoming Portuguese Presidencies to consider proposals that the EU might like to put on the table."
"For the appointment of Mr Wolfowitz's successor, Europeans will hopefully have the opportunity to hold a hearing with the selected candidate, prior to that person's confirmation."
"Lastly, we regret the fact that Mr Barroso acted as host to Mr Wolfowitz during the time when the latter's post at the head of the World Bank was under review."
"author. - Mr President, Mr Wolfowitz belongs to the powerful Iraq War Bush gang."
"It was therefore no surprise to anyone that in June 2005 Uncle Sam appointed him to the lucrative post of President of the World Bank."
"What was surprising was the sheer audacity exhibited by this individual in provocatively arranging a generous pay increase for his girlfriend, and even more surprising was the shameless way in which he fought to stay in office, despite the worldwide outcry against him."
"Needless to say, during this fight he had the full backing of President Bush, himself not unaccustomed to shameful behaviour."
"The Wolfowitz affair may now be over, but the stench associated with the Bush Administration's corrupt and evil running of the world remains firmly stuck to our nasal smell receptors."
"Let us hope and pray that, for the sake of the American people as well as for the rest of the world, soon enough Mr Bush and his warmongering associates will also find their way out of office."
"In adopting this motion for a resolution, we wish the World Bank good riddance to Mr Wolfowitz, and may better days ensue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Mr Wolfowitz was appointed to the head of the World Bank, our Parliament, through its Committee on Development, sent an open letter listing in detail all the problems liable to be created by an appointment made in this way, both in terms of governance and therefore the rule of law and from an international point of view."
"Events have proven that initiative to be right, unfortunately it remained isolated within the European Union, given that neither the Commission nor the members of the Council have ever had a real desire to commit themselves to developing a European position on the Bretton Woods institutions."
"I believe that the next few weeks hold a challenge for us: to demonstrate and try to convince the Member States, but also the Commission, to act on this issue, without pretending that the matter does not concern us; without a European voice, this kind of procedure will remain unchanged."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Paul Wolfowitz is stepping down as President of the World Bank at the end of June."
"The impetus for his resignation came primarily from Canada and Europe, as we justifiably feared a loss of confidence in the World Bank."
"The principles of democracy, transparency and accountability of public institutions called for time and again by the outgoing World Bank President must also apply to the operations and decision processes of the World Bank itself."
"Like many of my fellow Members, I welcome the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz, a leading neoconservative and one of the main proponents of the war in Iraq."
"Like many others, I regret that this decision is somewhat belated."
"Of course, today's discussion and resolution do not concern only Paul Wolfowitz personally."
"What is more important is to avoid making the same mistakes in future and to seek much better selection procedures."
"We would ask the German and Portuguese Presidencies to present proposals on behalf of the Union for making the selection of executives of the Bretton Woods Institutions more democratic, more transparent and more responsible in future."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the resolution talks about the Wolfowitz affair in terms of 'the World Bank's failure to live up to the globally shared standards of transparency and democracy'."
"What utter humbug!"
"Any standards of transparency and democracy in the world are practised on a strictly limited basis, and the European Union hardly sets an example."
"Mr Wolfowitz has been hounded out of office by those opposed to his anti-corruption agenda."
"The worst thing that the executive directors of the Bank could find to say against him was that 'a number of mistakes were made'."
"If Mr Wolfowitz's worst offence was giving his girlfriend a job, then it would hardly qualify as a minor error of judgement compared to the legendary levels of nepotism and corruption that the European Union has been guilty of over the years and the usual levels of corruption associated with the World Bank."
"Mr Wolfowitz wanted to clean it up and now he will not be able to, but it is an ill wind that cannot be used by the European Union to its advantage."
"This brings me to paragraph 6 of the resolution that calls for the Commission to have observer status at the Bank and for it to attend and intervene at certain councils."
"The key phrase here is 'pending legal personality for the Union'."
"That legal personality depends on the ratification of the European Constitution that the European Union intends to stuff down the throats of the peoples of Europe whether they want it or not."
"President Bush should nominate a new head of the World Bank whose girlfriend or boyfriend already has a job and who will either clean it up or close it down, and he should make sure that the European Union is let nowhere near it in the meantime!"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, the Commission understands the European Parliament's concerns about the situation at the World Bank before Mr Wolfowitz's resignation."
"However, unlike the Member States, the Commission is not a shareholder in the Bank; it is not a member of the Board of Directors and can only take note of Mr Wolfowitz's decision to resign."
"The Commission calls on the Bank and its members to begin discussions to designate a successor to ensure continuity and stability in the leadership of the Bank."
"The World Bank plays a crucial role in development."
"The Commission looks forward to a continuing strong role for the World Bank and to continuing its good cooperation with this institution in development efforts."
"Before I close the debate, I should like to make the following statement."
"I understand why Members of this Chamber were surprised and perplexed to see that we had four points for this afternoon's debate instead of three, as laid down by the Rules of Procedure."
"What happened was something of a divergence between two entirely legitimate perspectives: namely, what is laid down in the Rules of Procedure and what Monday's Conference of Presidents was seeking, which was validated in plenary."
"I therefore call on the President of Parliament to ensure that the Chair will never again be faced with such a problem."
"The Chair had to do his best to respond to the Chamber's astonishment, which is understandable given the conflict we have seen today between two sources of legitimacy."
"Please do not think that your points of view have gone unheard."
"They will be followed up, and the necessary conclusions will be drawn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon's debates, that is to say right now."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)"
"That concludes the vote."

"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great joy for me to be able to welcome today 18 fellow Members from Bulgaria - the first directly elected MEPS - to this House, and thus into our midst."
"(Applause)"
"The citizens of Bulgaria went to the polls on 20 May 2007 and elected their representatives to the European Parliament in a democratic process."
"This was an important day for Bulgaria, which joined the European Union on 1 January."
"It completes Bulgaria's integration into the European family after the fall of communism."
"It took over 60 years for Bulgaria to be restored to a free Europe and for our continent to be reunited."
"Bulgaria's culture is an ancient one, and the country is situated at a crossing point between East and West."
"It is claimed to be the site of one of the oldest countries in Europe, founded in 681."
"Bulgaria is the country of Orpheus and Eurydice, the home of the Thracians and of Dionysus."
"It brings with it a rich cultural and intellectual heritage, and will thus contribute to the mutual enrichment of the European Union and Bulgaria."
"Particular thanks are due to Bulgaria, and especially its people, for their efforts over recent years and the willingness to undertake reforms."
"Great progress has been made, and many reforms were accomplished in a relatively short period of time."
"It is now up to our new fellow Members to help ensure that the reforms that remain necessary are implemented with the same determination."
"I wish you a speedy, successful integration into the work of the European Parliament so that, with your work and efforts, you are able to make a constructive contribution for the benefit of your voters and of Europe."
"You will be the voice of Bulgarian citizens in the European Parliament, and will represent their interests."
"Let us work together on the further development of our European community!"
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, in agreement with the chairmen of the groups and the whole of the European Parliament - and seeing Mrs Dührkop Dührkop in our midst - I should like to make the following statement on behalf of this House."
"The terrorist organisation ETA has declared the 'ceasefire' announced on 22 March 2006 at an end."
"I should like to express my solidarity with the entire Spanish nation and its democratic institutions in these difficult times."
"Parliament firmly condemns the use of violence as a means to any end."
"Today, more than ever, Parliament appeals to all Member States to be determined in their support for the Spanish authorities in their fight against terrorism. This is a fight that can only be carried out on the basis of the rule of law, with the full force of the law and strong democratic institutions."
"We remember the victims of terrorism at this time, with whom we stand in sympathy and solidarity."

"Mr President, I would like to address a very brief request to you as President of this House."
"I should like you to ask the Mayor of Moscow, Mr Luzhkov, for clarification on the treatment of two MEPs - Mr Cappato and myself; a member of the German Bundestag, Mr Volker Beck, and a member of the Italian Parliament, Ms Vladimir Luxuria, on 27 May."
"On the occasion of a peaceful action for equal rights for gay people, we wanted to hand over a letter to the Mayor of Moscow signed by nearly 50 Members of this House."
"Mr Cappato, Mr Beck and an ALDE Group official were violently attacked by hooligans and then arrested by the Russian police."
"Two of the Russian activists who were arrested are here today - Mr Nikolaj Aleksejev and Mr Nikolaj Khramov."
"The police equally failed to protect Ms Luxuria and myself from an angry crowd and the police stood by watching as other activists were beaten up by thugs, skinheads and even priests."
"As Members of Parliament not engaged in any illegal activity, we would expect the Russian authorities to protect us against violent criminals, and certainly not to arrest us on dubious grounds."
"Freedom of assembly is a basic human right that must be observed by Russia as well, being a Member of the Council of Europe and present at the G8 Summit today."
"Mr President, I trust you will ask Mr Luzhkov and Mr Putin for an explanation on the way that Members of this House were treated."
"(Applause)"
"Many thanks, Mrs in 't Veld."
"We shall take the steps you propose and do what is necessary."
"I declare our solidarity with you."

"Middle East (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the Middle East, with statements by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission."
"Mr President, we, as Members of the European Parliament, have decided to express our solidarity vis-à-vis our Palestinian colleagues imprisoned by Israel."
"Symbolically, 45 MEPs demonstrated this support by collectively sponsoring the 45 Palestinian Members of Parliament."
"As elected representatives, we cannot but condemn the imprisonment of the President and of one third of the Members of the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"We ask for their immediate and unconditional release."
"We continue to appeal for a European Parliament delegation to be sent and for all the necessary steps to be taken in order to achieve this aim."
"(Applause)"
"I must inform the honourable Member that last Wednesday - a week ago today - I made a similar request to the Knesset."
"Making such a request before the Knesset is something that takes a great deal of prior thought."
"Let us hope that we reach a solution on all the issues, including the release of the three captured Israeli soldiers and the BBC journalist Alan Johnston."
"Movement is needed on all sides."
"High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by saying that exactly a week ago, the Quartet was meeting in Berlin."
"Since I am sure that you will have read the document that was made public that same evening, you may be aware of our solidarity with the Members of the Palestinian Authority, of the Parliament, who have been detained and, as the President of this Parliament has quite rightly said, with the other people who have been detained against their will in Israeli or Palestinian territories."
"Mr President, I would like to make a brief statement."
"I have been asked to speak for no longer than 10 or 15 minutes - I shall try to do so I would like to tell you that I have just returned from a long journey throughout the region, and I have been able to meet with the most important regional leaders and to carry out an analysis of the situation so that I could report also to the Quartet, which met last Wednesday."
"I was pleased to make that trip at more or less the same time as the President of Parliament, with whom I spoke by telephone, and also a distinguished group of MEPs, who have written me a letter to which I have not yet replied."
"I would like to meet with them personally, because, please believe me, I have not been in Brussels for a single day since then."
"I shall see if I can do so so that I can meet with you to talk calmly about the issues that you have raised, which I believe to be extremely important."
"Mr President, I believe that this sitting is of particular importance."
"It is also being held on a very important date for Palestine, for Israel and for the citizens of the world in general, and of the Arab world in particular."
"It is currently the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1967 war, the many tragic consequences of which we are still suffering."
"When we look at the last forty years, it undoubtedly sends a shudder right through us."
"They have been forty years of occupation, of suffering on both sides, of violence, during which the citizens - both Palestinians and Israelis - have suffered greatly, and also forty years during which there have been an excess of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories."
"Given this forty-year situation, we have two opportunities or ways to look at the situation: to look back in order to try to learn lessons regarding mistakes that must not be repeated or to look forward and try to see whether we can learn the most important lesson of all - that the only solution to this conflict that has now lasted for forty years is peace."
"A rapid peace process that leads rapidly to peace."
"There have been many processes, many opportunities for peace have been missed."
"I believe that we should now all have the will - the will to act, not just the will to think and speak, but the will to act - so that we can truly make peace a reality in those lands that are so dear to many of us and to Europeans in general."
"I would therefore like to look forward, but I must make a brief comment on this journey, since the areas that I have visited are all areas which are unfortunately not enjoying the best of times at the moment."
"In the occupied territories, in Palestine, we are witnessing a difficult situation, with violence amongst Palestinians and also renewed violence between Israel and Palestine."
"The parties' appeals for a ceasefire have not been heard, either in Palestine or between Palestine and Israel."
"I would like to send an appeal today to everybody with responsibilities in this area for a ceasefire as soon as possible, so that a favourable climate can be created for progressing towards peace."
"I had the opportunity to visit Gaza. So did the President of Parliament."
"Visiting Gaza at the moment is a truly significant experience."
"This is not the first time I have been to Gaza, but I believe that going there at this point in particular and meeting with the President of the Palestinian Authority was a moral obligation in order not to give the impression that the world has completely forgotten about what is happening in Gaza."
"Gaza is in a difficult situation, with violence between Palestinians, violence which will lead nowhere if it continues."
"The first thing we must do is therefore to try to quell that violence, to bring about a ceasefire, so that the Palestinians can finally begin to work together for a common cause, which is of course peace: peace with their neighbours and peace amongst themselves."
"We are doing everything we can in relation to that policy, both from my position and from the position of the Commission, which is helping generously."
"I would like to tell you that the situation in Palestine, from economic and social points of view, is a dramatic one."
"I therefore believe that, as soon as this period is over and we can meet again with the political leaders in a clearer and more transparent way, we shall have to think about drawing up a special plan of aid for Gaza."
"Otherwise we may be faced with a truly difficult situation in Gaza, and it will be difficult to recover for the purposes of a genuine peace process."
"I would also like to say that I believe that President Abbas's solemn appeal yesterday, on the anniversary of the beginning of the 1967 war, deserves to be read and analysed by everybody, because it shows a moral courage that is worthy of note."
"I would like to say that I was also in Israel."
"I met with the Prime Minister, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I was also in Sderot, the area suffering the most Kassam rocket attacks."
"I also felt it appropriate to express our solidarity European solidarity with all of those suffering any kind of violence, including Kassam rocket attacks."
"It was a difficult and tough place to be, but in any event, experiencing it on the ground gives us a clearer picture of what is happening."
"In our statement last Wednesday, the members of the Quartet called upon Israel to show restraint."
"Israel is also experiencing a difficult political situation."
"The primary elections in the Labour Party are not yet over - they are about to conclude - and we shall see what form the next government takes, if there are any changes, after the elections in the Israeli Labour Party."
"I would also like to say that the Quartet's statement contains a clear - and vigorous - appeal for Israel to transfer resources to the Palestinian authorities."
"The international community can do a lot, and we are doing a lot in fact."
"We Europeans are probably doing more than anybody."
"The Arab countries have also started to give money to the Finance Minister, Salam Fallad, and today we can say that the possibility is beginning to emerge of creating a budget for the Palestinian National Authority."
"Without the transfer of resources from Israel to Palestine, however, there is little else the international community can do."
"Improving the economic conditions is essentially linked to a transfer of resources from Israel to the Palestinians."
"I would like to make a few brief comments on the Quartet and then on Lebanon."
"I believe that the meeting of the Quartet last Wednesday in Berlin was, in my experience - and we have belonged to the Quartet for many years since I participated in setting it up - surely one of the most important meetings we have held so far."
"It was a Quartet in which we were able to give serious thought to how the peace process can be implemented."
"If you read the final paragraph of the Statement you will see that it truly looks to the future and commits the members of the Quartet to beginning to work hard, in cooperation with the parties - Israel, Palestine and Arab States - to initiate a peace process, to initiate a process with a political outlook."
"I would like to inform you that, for the first time in its history, the Quartet is going to make a joint visit to the region, it is going to hold a meeting over the coming weeks with the Palestinians and with the Israelis and it is also going to hold a meeting with the Arab countries, who I believe, with the Arab peace initiative, are also cooperating in the beginnings of a normalisation of life - or the beginning of the possibility of normalisation - in the territories between Israel and Palestine."
"I therefore believe that, at this time of dejection amongst many people, of dejection amongst the Palestinians and also within a certain sector of Israeli society, the international community, by means of the Quartet, is reacting in the opposite manner: It is reacting with hope, with the sense that, after forty years, we have the moral obligation to make every possible effort to make progress towards the formalisation of peace, towards a peace process."
"I would like to say to you that these coming weeks are going to be absolutely crucial in terms of setting in train a movement that can take us from the current situation to a peace process that leads to peace."
"It is not so difficult to identify the elements that can lead this process to peace."
"Almost all of us have a notion of the parameters required in order to achieve peace."
"What we now need to do is to get to work on it in cooperation with all of the members of the Quartet."
"I would like to stress that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the US Secretary of State and the Russian Foreign Affairs Minister were very cooperative with regard to our proposal, and they expressed clear support for the ideas that it was my privilege to present to the Quartet on Europe's behalf."
"We are therefore at an extremely significant crossroads, ladies and gentlemen, in terms of the situation on the ground, but also a positive crossroads in terms of moving towards a peace process that we can begin to see sketched out on the horizon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot let this speaking time that the Presidency has allowed me to go by without saying a few words about Lebanon."
"Lebanon is once again in a situation of profound crisis."
"The honourable Members are well aware of this."
"These are moments of profound significance, and some of them have been going on for some time."
"From the murder of former Prime Minister Hariri, the whole situation that they experienced over the summer, the current situation of political paralysis, which has become even more serious with the movements that have emerged, with acts of terrorism, in the refugee camps, in two refugee camps, specifically: one in the north and the other in the south."
"As you know, the Lebanese army has reacted in a way that I would describe as patriotic, and the support for the Lebanese army from all of Lebanon's political factions has also been patriotic, which is truly extraordinary given the differences that have existed amongst them over recent months, weeks and days."
"We also hope and pray that peace will also come to Lebanon, and that the special circumstances that have arisen over recent days - which were also accompanied by the United Nations Security Council's approval of the International Criminal Court to try the crimes that were committed in Lebanon - will make it possible to reach an agreement amongst all of the political forces in order to unblock the political process in Lebanon."
"That is what we want, and we are cooperating in the best possible to way in order to see it come about."
"Mr President, I shall remain within the speaking time available to me and I would like to end by reiterating what I said at the beginning: we have a moment of hope, a moment that we must be able to exploit, which in one way or another must complete the circle that was begun forty years ago and which we hope to see completed by means of peace, by means of a life lived together by two States - Israel and Palestine."
"That peace must include the other countries - Syria, Lebanon - so that we can see the re-emergence of a Middle East that can offer more hope to everybody, which is prosperous and which makes a constructive contribution to peace throughout the region."
"We Europeans cannot close our eyes to this task and you may rest assured that mine at least will always be open."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Dr Javier Solana, for your statement but also for your untiring work and deep commitment."
"Let me say that my experiences were the same as yours."
"We must not let ourselves be discouraged from continuing along the path of peace."
"Mr President, as we all know and as Mr Solana has just said, the atmosphere in the region is extremely tense."
"I would even say that there is even a sense of despair."
"My director is still there and he has just called me."
"Unfortunately, security has deteriorated and we are witnessing a vicious circle of violence, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in Israel and in Lebanon, as Mr Solana has just said."
"If the causes of this despair are not addressed, we may very soon witness the consolidation of more radical groups throughout the region."
"I think this is the great danger there."
"In Lebanon, as Mr Solana has just said, fighting has now spread to other Palestinian camps."
"We are therefore deeply concerned that the confrontation between the Lebanese armed forces and the Islamist insurgents is there."
"This has turned out to be the most serious internal conflict since the end of the civil war and has already cost over 100 human lives."
"I would like to stress once again our full support for the legitimate government of Lebanon."
"I would, however, repeat our position that everything possible has to be done to avoid further casualties among the civilian population."
"The relief agencies must be able to carry out their work."
"On the other hand, I would also like to express my satisfaction with the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1757, which secures the establishment of a special tribunal on the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri."
"I think this will allow the people of Lebanon to affirm respect for the law and the rule of law in their country and to turn a page on one of the most tragic events in Lebanon's recent history."
"The meeting due to take place in Gaza tomorrow between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert has unfortunately been cancelled, but at least the leaders of the G8 will tomorrow be tackling the issue of the Palestine-Israeli conflict, as we did at the G8 Foreign Ministers' meeting."
"There was the greatest concern about the political and security developments both in Gaza and in Israel, but also recognition that there is no alternative to continuing this humanitarian support and, on the other hand, to exploring how to support this Arab peace initiative."
"Even at this very delicate and difficult time, we believe that there is still some reason for hope, because the Israeli initiative is a unique opportunity for a comprehensive solution."
"We know that the Egyptians too are trying to broker a ceasefire with all the Palestinian factions."
"US involvement, particularly the involvement of Condoleezza Rice, is very valuable at this difficult time."
"Our EU Presidency is also very committed."
"The Quartet has done exactly as Mr Solana has said, I think it was a very good meeting and the idea is there for both the bilateral track and the regional track."
"Hopefully the meeting can come about in Egypt with Arab League interlocutors and hopefully also with the two parties."
"Two days ago I spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister, Mr Abdel Ilah Al-Khatib, who is planning, with his Egyptian counterpart, to visit Israel before the Arab League meets with the Quartet at the end of June."
"We hope that this will help to further engage Israel and encourage it to respond positively to the Arab peace initiative."
"Last week I also attended a conference in Vienna on the role of women leaders as contributors to peace and security in the Middle East."
"Prominent women, such as Tzipi Livni, Hanan Ashrawi, Condoleezza Rice and others, discussed the potential contribution of civil society, of women in society, to peace."
"Even if it is a small contribution, this was the first time that Tzipi Livni and Hanan Ashrawi had held discussions at the same table."
"I must say that there was quite a lot of mutual understanding and there was even a friendly atmosphere."
"The initiative proved to be another useful part of this very difficult process."
"I plan to organise some sort of follow-up meeting in Brussels, perhaps next year."
"We very much appreciate the European Parliament's involvement: the visit by the EP Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council was followed by your visit, Mr President, and by your very balanced speech in the Knesset on 30 May."
"It is encouraging that the speech, as you said, was quite well received by the Knesset."
"This is not an easy opportunity."
"The Palestinian people desperately need a political perspective."
"We, the members of the Quartet, are all clear on that."
"This is why we must press for negotiations on a final status issue, cooperating with the structures set up by the Arab League."
"The Arab League asked Israel to free certain measures also related to the occupation, for instance the settlements and the separation barrier."
"I was very encouraged by President Abbas's call for an immediate end to this internal violence, because Qassam rockets from Gaza have to stop once and for all."
"The ceasefire should indeed be extended to the West Bank."
"I very much regret that tomorrow's meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas had to be cancelled, but we apparently have to realise that the two sides could not reach agreement on Abbas's plan for a ceasefire, in particular on linking the ceasefire in Gaza with the cessation of military operations in the West Bank."
"No agreement was possible, either, on unfreezing Palestinian clearance revenues withheld by Israel before the release of the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit."
"We had hoped for some movement on this."
"The Palestinians decided that they could not risk this meeting, but of course we had all hoped that this would give a little more progress on the dialogue on the ceasefire, progress on the transfer of revenues and on movement of access."
"Regarding the National Unity Government, in my opinion now is certainly not the time to give up on it."
"I can agree that it has not yet delivered everything we were hoping for, but there are no attractive alternatives."
"If we allow this Government to crumble, the implications for the institutions of the Palestinian Authority are very grave and radical splinter groups may be strengthened as a result."
"I think this is the last result we would want."
"As you know, within the limits set by the Council of Ministers, the Commission has responded quickly to the National Unity Government and to the increased needs of the Palestinians."
"In the first half of 2007 alone, we committed EUR 320 million of Community funds, which almost equals the total amount of funds committed last year."
"This exceptional effort shows that, since the formation of the National Unity Government, we have stepped up our emergency assistance to the Palestinians."
"But the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority is extremely grave, as Salam Fayyad told my colleague yesterday."
"They still need us to go on even with this mechanism."
"Israel must release the withheld clearance revenue to the Palestinian Authority."
"I think we therefore will have to go on encouraging them to do so via the temporary international mechanism or through the PLO account."
"We reiterated this request at the last Association Committee with Israel in Jerusalem on 4 June."
"The Quartet has also noted the importance of the resumption of transfers to improve economic and humanitarian conditions in the West Bank and Gaza."
"As I said, movement is of course essential in any case."
"Since the formation of this National Unity Government, we have been working very closely with the Minister of Finance."
"Because the socio-economic situation is so dire, we will extend the TIM until 30 September and we must look for fresh funds for this new extension."
"I will soon ask the European Parliament and the Council to make another effort and to find additional resources in the budget."
"I thank you for whatever you have given as support in the past and do hope that this support will also be extended to us in the future, because our priority task should be to help restore the institutions of the Palestinian authority so that it can then deliver services to the Palestinian people."
"We are trying gradually to shift towards a resumption of institution-building and development projects, and to decrease our current concentration on emergency and humanitarian aid if we can do so - of course, this condition is still there."
"We look forward to new Palestinian proposals."
"They said they would come up with ideas for specific international support."
"The Palestinian Authority is currently preparing an operational plan which could then be a useful tool for identifying development activities, particularly in Gaza, that we could support."
"I would also like to say that the financial deficit of the Palestinian Authority is so large that it would be impossible for the Community to shoulder the burden alone."
"Arab States also have to deliver on their commitments to help the National Unity Government."
"I was encouraged to see that the PLO account established now was at least used by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates."
"This will help but it is not sufficient."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"May I also thank you very sincerely, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, for your commitment to this difficult peace process - if we can still speak of a peace process."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the High Representative for his tireless efforts in the quest for peace, and you yourself, Mr President, for your visit to the region, for its symbolism and the solidarity it demonstrated; and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, for the immense job that the European Commission is doing in the midst of a serious political crisis, with the factions making up the Government of National Unity now in confrontation and in the midst of an extremely serious social, economic and humanitarian crisis."
"What can be done in this situation?"
"Little more than what Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana have told us, I believe: to redouble the European Union's diplomatic efforts and to act on the basis of two premises."
"The first is a halt to the internal fighting between the two factions making up the Government of National Unity, which are waging a vicious battle for power, which is having a dramatic effect on the civilian population."
"Secondly, Mr President - and we must also state this very clearly - a permanent and explicit commitment from the Government of National Unity to democracy and the renunciation of violence."
"What can we do in the meantime, Mr President?"
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has explained it very clearly: to try to apply the humanitarian aid mechanism as flexibly as possible, to increase the sums allocated to it and to redistribute it amongst the other priorities."
"Mr President, the maximum sentence according to my country's Penal Code is thirty years and one day."
"Mr Solana reminded us today that it is forty years since the Six Day War, which led to the occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights."
"And the situation remains stagnant and bogged down."
"Forty years of suffering and death is more than a society - or two societies, as Mr Solana pointed out - can tolerate."
"I believe that this Parliament must respond in a united fashion in support of the representatives of the Council and the Commission so that the European Union, within the international community in general and the Quartet in particular, can do everything possible to bring about - as Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have said - a new opportunity for peace for a society and a region that has already suffered too much."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, as has been pointed out, this debate is taking place on the 40th anniversary of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza."
"What was supposed to be a lightning strike has turned into a never-ending nightmare: 40 years is such a long time that entire generations of Palestinians have never known anything but occupation, humiliation, checkpoints and then the wall and almost total imprisonment."
"Movement is now all but impossible in the occupied territories."
"Over these 40 years, Israel has certainly not found the guarantees of security that it was looking for, either, and it has experienced worrying erosions of democracy and the rule of law."
"These are two peoples exhausted by endless war and violence."
"For our part, we would like to emphasise - as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has long been saying quite clearly - that the only possible way to inject any form of a constructive approach into a constantly deteriorating situation is to openly support the Palestinian Government of National Unity."
"We should add to that the commitment that the international community should consider making to send in a peace-keeping force to prevent the violence of recent weeks in Gaza from degenerating even further, to re-establish the basic conditions for people to lead normal lives and for international law to be respected, and above all to break the vicious circle of endless violence."
"From Israel we expect gestures other than the murders and indiscriminate arrests that came in response to the Qassam rocket strikes on Sderot."
"The occupation, the settlements, the wall and the status of Jerusalem are making the prospect of a two-State solution more unlikely every day, as even United Nations sources are now saying."
"The United Nations, the United States, Russia, Europe and the entire international community have a responsibility to act before all chances of coexistence are gone for ever."
"Lastly, I would remind you that there is an Arab plan that offers Israel a prospect of peace, not only with the Palestinians but with Arab countries as a whole."
"That is something that needs addressing with more conviction."
"Prime Minister Olmert himself said the other day that that plan could provide a basis for negotiations."
"I hope he did not say so just because his government is particularly weak."
"The situation in Lebanon is equally serious, as you have pointed out."
"I believe that the UNIFIL forces on the ground should be supported and reinforced."
"Lastly, we should like to call on President Poettering to take steps to call an extraordinary meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, around this time, we commemorate the Six-Day War, which, on the one hand, established Israel's military supremacy, but which also ushered in the start of the occupation, confrontations, violence and endless bloodshed that have lasted 40 years."
"Anyone in Israel who was born in the Occupied Territories after June 1967, in other words anyone who is 40 years or younger, has known nothing but uncertainty and anxiety about the future of their own country, their loved ones and their own lives."
"After 40 years, it is really time to say enough is enough."
"Peace should now be brokered as a matter of urgency: sustainable peace, on the basis that two countries recognise each other's right to exist and need to be left alone by their neighbouring countries."
"All previous speakers have taken great pains to explain how complicated, difficult and complex this is but, ladies and gentlemen, there is one ingredient without which it will never work, namely political will and political courage."
"Without the kind of political will and political courage that was evident at one time in South Africa, for example, in both camps, to end apartheid - a brutal regime - it will not work."
"The unfortunate thing is that nobody can have political will and political courage for the protagonists."
"It is they themselves who will need to muster this political will and this political courage."
"Tomorrow, a human chain of Jews and Palestinians will be formed around the Berlaymont building who will all say together: 'After 40 years, we have really had enough."
"After 40 years, we must work on peace.'"
"Sadly, though, the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not the only one fermenting trouble in the region."
"Fresh violence has flared up in Lebanon, in which some see the hand of Syria, which wants to avoid an international Hariri tribunal at all costs."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to welcome the decision by the UN Security Council, which has had the courage to say that such a tribunal will be set up."
"As you know, this will be a mixed tribunal, involving both international and Lebanese judges and a mixed public prosecution, which will function according to the principles of Lebanese law."
"In Lebanon, too, though, political courage will be needed in all camps finally to give the Lebanese what they are entitled to as well: peace and security."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the High Representative and the Commissioner for their presentations here today."
"Rather than speak about all the countries in such a short time, I shall concentrate on Palestine, because everything that happens in every other part of the Middle East relates to the situation in Israel and Palestine."
"Looking at the debates that took place at the special session of the UN Security Council 40 years ago in 1967, after the start of the Six-Day War, it is interesting to see that the potential solution or plan considered was a guarantee of Israeli security and borders based on a withdrawal by Israeli forces from the Occupied Territories and a two-state solution."
"Forty years later, the Quartet has failed to deliver on what should be the simplest of all goals: to bring people around to this way of thinking."
"We have made mistakes at European level with our negative reaction to the election of the Hamas Government in Palestine, which sent out the wrong signal, allowing radical groups to take control on the ground and leading people to say 'There is no point in voting for these people or bringing these people in because the Europeans will cut off the money'."
"That is why it was so important, as the Commissioner rightly said, that funding was restored through the emergency mechanism."
"That work must continue, because only by building relations and building dialogue between the peoples can we guarantee that there will be a resolution."
"That resolution must be predicated on the same principles as 40 years ago: a two-state solution, a guarantee of secure borders and justice and equity for all peoples in Israel and in Palestine."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Israel won the Six Day War, but it has lost the peace with forty years of occupation."
"We are now seeing a dangerous tendency towards the Iraqisation and tribalisation of violence in the Middle East."
"The emergence of Fatah al-Islam in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon and the increasing fragmentation of the civil conflicts in Gaza do not bode well for the future of the region."
"We are seeing the impact of the Palestinian problem spreading throughout the Middle East and becoming mixed up with the interests of the different players."
"We are running the risk of hitting rock bottom very soon."
"Are we going to wait around doing nothing until the Palestinian Authority collapses?"
"As I have said, we cannot allow that to happen."
"How can we ensure that it will not?"
"Is the chaos and violence of war by everybody against everybody a 'death foretold'?"
"Gaza cannot wait any longer."
"The European Union cannot carry on turning its back on the democratically-elected Government of National Unity."
"This European policy has contributed to the popular discrediting of any hint of moderation on the part of Hamas and Fatah, because it demonstrates that the acceptance of the Mecca Agreement does nothing to change the embargo or improve the terrible living conditions in the huge prison known as Gaza."
"Firstly, the European Union must begin a dialogue with all of the parties, including Hamas, in order to promote a stable unity government."
"Secondly, we must restore direct financial aid to the Palestinian Authority and ensure that Israel returns the money from Palestinian taxes that it is keeping."
"Finally, we must work to extend the Gaza ceasefire to the West Bank, with the creation of international guarantees, sending European and Arab troops under a UN mandate to Gaza and, if necessary, to the West Bank."
"At the same time, we are calling for the release of the forty-five Members of Parliament and of the Israeli Gilad Shalit and for a halt to the launching of Kassam rockets and Israel's devastating responses."
"(Applause from the left)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, my group was very keen to hold this debate, particularly today, 40 years after the start of a war to which the international community, including the European Union, has shown itself to this day incapable of imposing the only just and lasting solution, that is, an end to the occupation, to the colonisation, to the oppression by Israel of the Palestinian territories conquered in 1967."
"Mr President, I welcomed, in their form and substance, the strong words you spoke about this in the Knesset on 30 May."
"I particularly remember three key sentences from your speech."
"You stated that, 'international law is binding on us all'."
"You are right."
"We ask no more of Israel than that it should respect the Security Council resolutions, the Geneva Conventions, the opinions of the International Court of Justice and humanitarian law, as the United Nations Organisation (UNO) has just pointed out."
"The violations of the law are flagrant, constant and massive."
"They are in relation to settlements, refugees, prisoners, the wall and, primarily of course, the occupation of the territories and the annexation of East Jerusalem."
"You have also pointed out, Mr President, that, I quote: 'a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders is and remains the only way to a satisfactory solution'."
"It is a fundamental truth."
"The multiplication of settlements, the construction of the wall, the isolation of Palestinian areas of Jerusalem, however, serve precisely to make this solution impossible."
"The Israeli authorities' disregard for the Arab League's peace plan confirms this strategy of making things worse."
"You have rightly reminded us, Mr President, of this obvious fact: there is no peace without justice."
"The famous Israeli historian, Tom Segev, recently echoed the thoughts of those of his compatriots who, for 40 years, have believed that, I quote, 'in 1967, Israel laid the foundations for future terrorism'."
"Great men of State, such as Yitzhak Rabin, understood this, but the Israeli peace forces, who are a credit to that country, are marginalised by the current regime."
"The conclusion to be drawn from this tragic experience of 40 years of blindness is, in the opinion of my group, as follows: laisser faire amounts to us making ourselves guilty."
"Let us dare to stand up for truth."
"I quote your words one last time, Mr President, you said, 'let us have the courage to make a new start together'."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Thank you, Francis Wurtz, for the reference to what I said before the Knesset."
"Mr President, I should very briefly like to reply to the contributions from the honourable Members representing the different political groups in this House."
"I think that most of the speeches followed a line which is in a sense the same one that we have been defending for a long time: namely, the time has come to move on from the policy of crisis management - which is very important, but it is not enough."
"We need policies, together with crisis management, to solving the conflict."
"We need to work towards a political horizon to really begin to get into the business of solving the conflict that started 40 years ago."
"That is basically the view everybody has expressed, and it is something that we will be trying to do in the coming days."
"I told you that last Wednesday the Quartet met in Berlin, and I said that for the first time the Quartet is committed to starting a debate with the parties in order to begin to work towards a political horizon."
"This means that, before the end of this month, the Quartet will meet with the Palestinians and Israelis in order to push forward the dialogue - which is still in its preliminary stages - that has begun between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert."
"They are the two people who must find the way towards peace."
"It is our obligation to push and to provide a catalyst for this process."
"That is what we are going to do."
"It is written very clearly in the statement produced by the Quartet last Wednesday."
"I think that this is a profound change, and I would like to underline that, because someone asked whether we are going wait passively for a catastrophe to arrive."
"The answer is no: we do not want to do that; you do not want to do that; the people in the region do not want to do that."
"Therefore, under the leadership of the Quartet, we are trying to put forward this mechanism in order to move towards peace."
"A few other ideas were put forward by some of the honourable Members representing the political groups, including the suggestion of an international force."
"I would like to say that, for the first time in many years, the idea of an international force is not out of the question."
"As you know, the idea was brought up in the Knesset by two members of the parliamentary groups, saying that this may be the time to call for an international force, at least at the beginning, in a peacekeeping role or to control the border in the south - the so-called 'Philadelphi Corridor' - where the Rafah Crossing is situated."
"We are working on that, as you probably know, because information has already been published."
"The Israelis are also considering that possibility, as are the Palestinians."
"The Egyptians are also considering that possibility with different intensity."
"For the Egyptians it would probably be very difficult to have an international force there, as it may give the impression that they are not able to control that part of the border."
"However, I think that we can still begin discussions on these issues and perhaps eventually reach a solution."
"This also ties in with what Mrs Napoletano said about the success of UNIFIL."
"The fact that the international force has been responsible for UNIFIL - i.e. for the application of the UN Security Council resolution on Lebanon - and the manner in which it has been perceived - i.e. the efficiency of the force, of which the backbone is European - have also caused some in the Israeli Government, the Knesset and Israel as a whole to think that it might be possible for a force of that nature also to be applied elsewhere."
"In a way, we have to link all the issues together."
"It may be possible for us to use what we have learned from our presence in Lebanon in another place."
"That opens the way to a monitoring presence which will be absolutely necessary if we want the peace process to come to fruition."
"I would like to stress again that, as regards Lebanon, the resolution creating the tribunal is very important."
"The tribunal is not against anybody."
"There has been a very negative reaction in Syria, but I must stress that an international tribunal is not against anybody, any country."
"It is a tribunal that is organised in order to see who is responsible for the killing of a good man - a friend of many of ours, Mr Hariri - who was assassinated in a manner that has to be clarified if we want peace and reconciliation in Lebanon."
"Therefore we in the European Union have been working towards this, and last Wednesday the Security Council came to another important decision on setting up an international tribunal."
"I would like to say once again that what we have striven to do in taking the Quartet in the direction that we are now moving is something that has many fathers - or many mothers - as always, but you can be sure that the Europeans have been working very hard from the very beginning to arrive at this moment."
"Let us hope that we are able to continue working in that direction."
"It will be difficult, but for the future I hope to have the support, help and understanding of the European Parliament, as always."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, yesterday I met a delegation of Israeli citizens from Sderot who related to me first-hand the terror in their civilian population from 300 random Qassam rocket attacks launched at them from Hamas-controlled sites in Gaza, which clearly constitutes a war crime in international law, with two dead and many injured to date."
"Last week 33 people were detained by the IDF in the West Bank, including the Palestinian Education Minister Nasser al-Shaer, allegedly for their overt support for these rocket attacks."
"The detention of an education minister is interesting as it tends to support the repeated allegations in this House that the Palestinian textbooks and school curriculum supported for years by EU funds are still aimed at fomenting a climate of hatred and distrust for Israel and a glorification of terrorist violence."
"Many of the Hamas ministerial components of the Unity Government - like the Hamas 1988 Charter inspired by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood - still believe strongly that the State of Israel has no right to exist, that all terrorist violence is justified through so-called armed struggle, and that they are not bound by previous PLO-signed international agreements."
"Therefore, in my view at present the PA Unity Government clearly does not comply with the Quartet criteria, and the EU must not yet lift the ban on Hamas as a designated terrorist organisation, or directly fund the PA Government."
"Neither should the TIM be abandoned for the delivery of humanitarian aid, which now totals over EUR 500 million yearly and has actually risen over the last three years, contrary to popular opinion."
"I too support the Arab League's new proposals for a negotiated solution, although the right of return is totally unrealistic."
"But again, and curiously, Hamas rejects their proposals for Israel's recognition."
"Some hardliners on all sides reject peace or a two-state solution, but on the 40th anniversary of the six-day war it is clear that this is the only viable long-term solution for a lasting peace in the region."
"But first the PA must ensure law and order on its territory and stop the dissent into virtual Hamas-Fatah civil war in Gaza, which is also being stirred up in Lebanon."
"Once again I would like to call upon the House and the international community to put pressure on all those responsible for the release of the BBC reporter Alan Johnston, who we now know is alive and well, and the kidnapped soldier Corporal Shalit."
"This will create a climate conducive to restarting the vital roadmap for peace talks."
"(FR) Mr President, at the time of the legislative elections in 2006, I asked a Palestinian: 'Do you think that these elections will bring peace?'"
"He replied: 'No, not peace, but democracy."
"And we are going to show the world that, even in the occupied territories, we are capable of holding free elections'."
"Our response was pathetic."
"Our disregard for the aspirations of a people, including their right to make mistakes, introduced just a bit more chaos still into a region that is now in ferment."
"The establishment of a National Unity Government and the Mecca Agreement have not sufficiently altered the European Union's hard line or its sanctions."
"Despite your efforts, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner - and I appreciate those efforts - in spite of what you have said to us, and it is encouraging, Mr Solana, I believe that we have not yet radically changed our policy towards the Middle East and that we have not properly understood that we are damaging the very notion of democracy with our response to these elections."
"It is an attitude that has persisted for 40 years."
"I believe that we are partly responsible for having allowed, for 40 years, a situation of total lawlessness to take hold in Palestine, with extra-judicial executions, theft of land, kidnapping, now, of legitimately elected representatives and ministers, the existence of a wall considered illegal by the Court in The Hague and the Geneva Conventions flouted, Francis Wurtz spoke about it: more than 400 children still held in Israeli prisons, more than 400 young Palestinians."
"The United Nations Organisation (UNO) resolutions ignored the sealing off of territories and restrictions on movements."
"And what else?"
"Of course, Mr Tannock, we condemn violence, we condemn the firing of rockets, we condemn the kidnapping of the soldier, Shalit, but there is at present an imbalance."
"Look at the figures."
"They are, alas, dramatically unfavourable to the Palestinian people and, I repeat, there is no equidistance."
"International law - that is not equidistance."
"Nothing today justifies our silence and I should like to salute, here, these new Just Men, those Jews who, in Israel and elsewhere, speak out and say 'That must be stopped'."
"They say it amid the sniggering, the sarcasm, and sometimes the threats of their fellow citizens."
"I see myself as a supporter of all those people, as I see myself as a supporter of our Palestinian colleagues who, regardless of parliamentary immunity, have been imprisoned."
"I should like to say to you that in Belgium, all the leaders of the political parties are to meet tomorrow, at 1 p.m. at Berlaymont, to make a chain for peace and to ask the European Union to take on its responsibilities, not only humanitarian responsibilities, but real political responsibilities which are a credit to the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of us questions Israel's right to exist."
"We are aware of our political responsibility."
"At the same time, I would like to remind the House of the message from a peace conference held in Palestine in the last few days."
"Women, who are, after all, part of civil society, Palestinian and Israeli women, delivered a clear message to us. You speak, they said, of the coexistence of two states."
"That is good, but please take note that our existence is threatened in Palestine and in Gaza."
"I believe that the crux of the matter at this time is the existence issue."
"For this reason I am glad that Javier Solana said we had to consider whether we should not review the Lebanon experience as quickly as possible and possibly become involved in Gaza."
"We must act before the situation slides completely out of control, because there will not be many more opportunities."
"What you described as courage, Dr Solana, namely the hope we must have if we are to remain committed and explain our commitment to the people on the ground too, that hope has faded to a shadow in the region itself."
"I wish to thank Mr Poettering on behalf of my group for having made that journey."
"You said that the situation in Gaza is intolerable."
"It is our duty to become more heavily committed than ever before to the right of people there to live in peace, and of course that also means criticising Hamas for its duplicity."
"The statement made by Hamas to mark the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War is unacceptable in our view."
"At the same time, however, we must cooperate actively with the Government of National Unity."
"We shall not get a second chance."
"I second the criticism voiced by Mrs De Keyser just a few moments ago."
"We in the European Union have indeed made mistakes in that region."
"We have bitterly disappointed people's hopes and have failed to harness their willingness to look to the future."
"I hope that the Middle East Quartet is now roused from slumber."
"I hope it will go into action, and I hope there will be trips to the region."
"It may be a last chance before we can no longer speak realistically of any hope of peace."
"Mr President, I would like to begin with some quotes."
"On 2 April, Prime Minister Haniyeh said on Al-Jazeera: 'As far as we are concerned, the issue of recognition of Israel has been settled once and for all."
"It has been settled in our political literature, in our Islamic thought and in our Jihadist culture, on which we base our moves."
"We will declare a truce, but never recognition of Israel'."
"On Al-Jazeera on 27 April, he said: 'If the siege continues beyond a certain time, we will be forced to make a decision and there is no doubt that we will act'."
"On 5 May, in a prayer, he said: 'I reiterate, on behalf of the Palestinian Government, that the security plan will not hurt the resistance."
"We will give Allah the opportunity to grant us one of the two mercies, victory or martyrdom'."
"As a fluent speaker of Arabic, I can assure you that the translation is correct."
"The situation is grave."
"We face not only the 'Iraqisation' of Gaza but the 'Iranisation' of the whole Middle East."
"This is not just a threat to the Middle East."
"This is a serious threat to our own security."
"Europe must be a player and we must be absolutely unified."
"Therefore Parliament should remain unified, supporting the Council, the Commission and the Quartet."
"The Temporary International Mechanism must go on."
"We have to continue humanitarian aid."
"We may even use the PLO account."
"However, the key issue is to bring the Palestinian National Unity Government to renounce violence, to recognise Israel and to honour international agreements."
"Only then can we return to UN Resolution 242, clearly asking Israel to withdraw from territories, so that there are no 'deterritories' or occupied territories."
"I therefore ask the Council and the Commission whether they consider that the preconditions for the recognition and direct financing of the Palestinian National Unity Government have been met."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, when 40 years have passed since the Six Day War and the nations of the Middle East are still suffering now from its tragic consequences; when reports by Amnesty International and the United Nations now seriously question the viability of a Palestinian state because of the persistent Israeli policies of occupation and colonisation; when unbearable misery is rife in Gaza and on the West Bank, feeding the fire between rival Palestinian factions, and the National Unity Government, the last rampart against civil war, is hanging by a thread; when the whole region is in ferment from Iraq to Lebanon, we can say that compassionate speeches are no longer enough and it is urgent to bring about change, an upheaval, a revolution, dare I say, in our Middle East policy and to take on the full extent of our responsibilities."
"First of all, by recognising the Palestinian National Unity Government on which we have pinned our hopes and which has declared willingness to respect all of the UN and PLO resolutions, all of the previous resolutions, as well as the demands of the Quartet to restore credibility to the two-state solution."
"Next, by reinstating our direct aid to this government, because it is unrealistic to count on the Israelis to release the tax revenues that were collected by right and which remain confiscated and because the temporary mechanism has fizzled out."
"Furthermore, by deploying an international interposition force at the border between Gaza and Israel, the only measure that is likely to bring about a ceasefire the effectiveness and endurance of which have been demonstrated in Lebanon."
"Finally and above all, by showing considerable ambition, perhaps, by taking the initiative for a European Camp David that has become necessary since the roadmap brandished by the Quartet comes down to nothing more than a pious hope."
"Since 1967, we have lost our way in mistakes and injustices."
"Do we have to wait another 40 years..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DA) Thank you, Mr President, and thanks also to the Commissioner and the High Representative."
"Simply put, however, I have my doubts."
"We, in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have attempted to discuss amongst ourselves what it is we have learnt here."
"It is a top priority for us that we now recognise the Palestinian Government and that action be taken again."
"I am quite simply unable to tell whether that is what we have been told is to happen."
"It was not what Mr Solana told us; but was it what Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said?"
"That is - did she say that we would now grant recognition and go on from there?"
"It seems to me that we need a clear answer to this question because what frustrates the whole system is the fact that all we get is endless talk and no action."
"The double standards and the paralysis of action are on the point of wrecking not only the Middle East but also the EU."
"The other matter about which we need clarity is what is meant by the fact that we are now to support the Arab initiative."
"I was unable to conclude from Mr Solana's presentation that this is actually what we intend to do."
"All I could make out was that it was said that we must now engage again in negotiation."
"We are well aware, however, of where we need to go."
"It is a difficult process to turn this into a reality, but we know what has to be brought about, and we cannot allow ourselves to become notorious for mentioning the Arab initiative over and over and then letting all the steam out of it by saying 'now let us see what happens'."
"We need to say that this is the point at which we are making a start."
"We have, set out before us, the final result that we are all well aware is the only acceptable outcome if we are to make progress and that, to top it all, is what both the West and Israel have long been calling for. It has suddenly been put on the table."
"Can we not have clear answers?"
"That would be nice."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, the fact that the Quartet now intends to act jointly in the region is good news."
"That is an important message, because, as we have often said in this House, it is only through concerted action that the Quartet acquires the credibility it needs to be able to give all parties the essential security guarantees."
"In the eyes of the region, no member of the Quartet can do that on its own."
"May I congratulate you on this development and also on the fact that it can be combined with the Arab initiative."
"If we want to advance - and we have discussed this so often - and avoid giving in to hopelessness and despair, we must be clear about one thing: the moderates on both sides must be able to create conditions in their own territories in which the foundations can be built for a peace process that will not be demolished by the provocations of the extremist minorities on the other side."
"This must therefore be the starting point."
"It is true, of course, that Israel must release the money."
"It is also true that this patchwork situation in the West Bank, with checks and settlements everywhere, which nips any economic development in the bud, must be ended, and that conditions must prevail in which economic development is possible again."
"We can pump as much money into the West Bank as we like, but the right conditions simply must be created there."
"It must also be said, however, that what is happening in Gaza is a civil war between Palestinians."
"The answer is not an international force deployed between Israel and Gaza but meetings between the warring factions to bring about a satisfactory end to the conflict."
"All of these issues are plainly interconnected, but please let us remember that everyone is responsible for his own domain."
"We cannot take over this responsibility."
"Accordingly, we must demand an end to the civil war."
"Anyone trying to resolve conflicts between the rival groups by military means is destroying the future prospects of his own people."
"For this reason we must take care to seek our starting points here and thus create a platform from which the Quartet can operate successfully and give us a genuine chance of progress."
"Mr President, sometimes I get very dispirited when listening to the debates in this House on this issue, particularly when I hear Mr Tannock and Mrs Hybášková, who seem intent on laying down conditions in this House for a solution in the Middle East."
"It is not for us to set preconditions for the Israelis and the Palestinians in terms of how they will address each other in the peace negotiations."
"The only preconditions necessary for successful peace negotiations are a demonstrable commitment to peace on each side, a mandate to negotiate on each side and the capacity to deliver on the commitments made in the negotiations."
"All other preconditions which MEPs in this House seek to apply to Israelis and Palestinians are so much hot air."
"They have no effect and there is no possible likelihood that they will be met in a situation in which the Palestinian Authority, in particular, is at the point of collapse."
"If that Authority, that Unity Government, collapses, then nothing we say and nothing the European Union does will prevent the appalling bloodbath that will follow, for the Israelis and for the Palestinians."
"The role of the international community is to ensure that the patrons of each side in this conflict - the Quartet and the Arab States - set aside their immediate short-term interests and put the interests of the Palestinians and the Israelis first."
"We must seek to ensure that they come to the table and address the outlines that are already there, and which have been for some time, as regards the possibilities and conditions for peace."
"It is time we stopped talking and started to act in the interests ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"(SK) As Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have told us, the situation in the Middle East is indeed critical."
"The situation is critical in Lebanon, and it continues to be critical in Palestinian-Israeli relations."
"The very notion of 'critical', however, is dramatic, since it implies a situation of financial, economic and social decline, accompanied by terror attacks and activities, kidnappings and the death of civilians."
"The mounting resistance and attacks against the state of Israel and her citizens breed fear and concern, resulting in measures which we find incomprehensible."
"The region is a mess, conflict is intensifying and the ceasefire is not being abided by."
"The meeting of the Quartet last week pointed out that our active involvement in the peace process was essential."
"However, the degree of frustration on either side, be it Palestinian or Israeli, is just as great as our endeavours to further the peace process."
"It is imperative, therefore, to beef up our diplomatic efforts, to make them more dynamic and, in particular, to make them balanced."
"Our activities should not generate the impression that we stand on one side of the conflict."
"It is our duty to demand that Israel release the funds; by the same token, it is our duty to ensure that the funds are indeed invested in economic and social development."
"It is also our duty to guarantee for the citizens of Israel basic protection of their lives and the basic defence of their state."
"(PT) This issue of the Middle East, and in particular the tragic situation in Palestine, has resurfaced several times in recent plenary sessions."
"This should come as no surprise."
"We have all seen on the ground what goes on there."
"We have all seen the same thing, we have come to Parliament and reported a terrible and explosive humanitarian situation."
"We have all seen Israel's illegal retention of some EUR 700 million in taxes - money that does not belong to Israel and that is generating interest by the day."
"We have all seen in the eyes of those people - human beings with the right to justice and dignity just like us - the hope for a future in which they can live in peace."
"This is a hope that remains alive despite the constraints, a hope that every day is severely put to the test by a lack of mobility and by the wall."
"This is a wall that puts paid to any kind of local economy, either in its purest meaning of subsistence through farming, or in terms of something more ambitious like having enough produce to run a small shop."
"In the face of the continuous erosion of that hope, despair takes hold and, as members of this privileged club of countries that won peace after enduring the bitter taste of war, we must not think that we can solve problems by throwing money at them."
"Helping the Palestinian people is very important, crucial in fact."
"Much more important, though, is helping them realise that their voice makes a difference in their country and that the credible manner in which they ran their elections and sought a solution to present to the world counted for something."
"Authority must be restored to the Palestinian territories."
"Let us hope that Finance Minister Salam Fayad can become one of the main spokesmen on matters of financial help to the people."
"It is therefore vital to normalise institutional relations."
"We must demonstrate that we are actually prepared to resolve the conflict."
"We Europeans have a vital part to play in bringing peace to the region and to the world."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, we must give peace a chance in the Middle East."
"We know how difficult it is and we all know about the challenges, but we all know about the new hopes and we have clearly explained the situation."
"What is necessary is, on the one hand, to achieve a certain level of security, and a better security situation first to the Palestinians within Gaza, but also in the West Bank."
"That is very true."
"Both we and Americans are working with the Palestinians to come to such a solution, but unfortunately we are not yet completely there."
"Second, there needs to be greater economic freedom in order to improve the daily lives of the Palestinians."
"This is also what we are trying to do."
"We also said very clearly that we want to engage with this national Unity Government according to the actions and the programme."
"Salam Fayyad is, therefore, our preferred interlocutor to see what else can be done."
"I have very clearly said what could be done."
"I would like to repeat to you that in addition to from our continuous work with the temporary international mechanism - that I would have liked to phase out as soon as possible, but I cannot do so because there humanitarian assistance is still necessary - we offered Salam Fayyad technical assistance in the area of audit, revenue collection and customs."
"We are currently working with the Ministry to define the delivery of assistance, but we are also resuming institution-building where it is important."
"We are trying to go for development assistance in order to give more hope to the population, but it is true that a lot of political courage and political will is necessary, first and foremost on the part of the parties to the conflict. we members of the Quartet can only support them, we can push them, we can encourage them and this is what we are trying to do, but we cannot, unfortunately, take the decision for them."
"That is the limit of our action."
"I hope that the next meeting in the region will be a positive one and will be the trigger to this political vision and political horizon that we all have so much in our minds."
"We hope and plead for the release of all the political prisoners. That means the abducted Israeli soldier and the BBC journalist Alan Johnston, but also all the members of the Palestinian government and all the others that are still imprisoned."
"I think this would be very good momentum that could be brought about in order to find the next steps towards this two-state solution that we all so clearly wish for."
"Mr President, I am not going to repeat what I and others who have contributed to the debate have already said."
"I would first of all like to thank all the Members of Parliament who contributed, those who are still here and those who have left."
"I think it has been a very interesting debate, and I would like to make an observation on it."
"When I come to the European Parliament to discuss the Middle East, I have the feeling that emotions run high, starting with my own."
"But I think that our debates have to be about the events which are important at a given time."
"Today we are in a very difficult situation, but at the same time, as has been said, it is a time of hope, which did not exist for a long time."
"I have been involved in the Middle East for many years."
"I was at the Madrid Conference and at the last Conference at Camp David."
"Not since Camp David have I perceived us to be any closer than I feel we are today to the beginning of real, meaningful communication and exchange and therefore the beginning of a political horizon, and a debate and negotiations about that."
"There are three reasons for this."
"One is that the Arab League Initiative is something that was missing at the time of Camp David."
"We have it today, and we have the engagement of the Arabs to embrace whoever the Palestinian negotiator is going to be, in order to sustain him and to give the support which, as you know, was not there at the time of Camp David."
"Secondly, 40 years have elapsed."
"I think everybody is exhausted: psychologically, physically and politically."
"Out of this exhaustion I think that we have to muster new psychological and political energy in order to move forward."
"Thirdly, we have a mechanism - the Quartet - and sometimes we do not realise how much effort goes into that."
"For the first time we have the United States and the European Union at the same table negotiating with the parties, which has never happened before."
"We have to recognise that."
"This is the first time that the European Union has been at the negotiating table."
"The Russian Federation was in Madrid and then disappeared."
"There was also the Secretary-General of the United Nations - imagine for a moment what that means - the United Nations negotiated in this conflict."
"It was impossible to imagine at that time."
"I believe that to a certain extent all these elements change the horizon of what can be done now."
"We must now try to move on, try not to falter and try to continue working in that direction."
"Conditions have changed and therefore we have more hope that it can be achieved."
"Will it be achieved in 24 hours?"
"No."
"If you think that we will find the solution to all the problems by the end of this month, you are wrong: we will have to wait a bit longer than that."
"But let us see whether we have the opportunity to move the process forward."
"As a final thought, I would like to stress that we are Europeans here."
"Everyone here is a member of the European Union."
"Sometimes we have to be a little proud of what we do."
"If you go to Palestine, as you do, you hear the criticism."
"But probably, if you really talk in depth to the Palestinians and Israelis, you will find a growing sympathy and understanding - you have to agree with me about that - for the way in which Europeans are doing things."
"I think that we Europeans have to recognise that every now and then."
"Otherwise we will never move forward collectively, as we need to do."
"Moving this process forward is not an effort for one or two: it is an effort for everybody."
"We have an opportunity."
"Let us see whether next time we meet we see progress."
"We will not see the solution, but let us see whether we make progress."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (PT) This week marks the 40th anniversary of Israel's illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, the (now violently under siege) Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, the Syrian territories of the Golan Heights and the Egyptian territories of the Sinai Peninsula, which Egypt has since recovered."
"40 years of..."
"violations of international law and non-compliance with countless UN Security Council resolutions by the Israeli authorities;"
"criminal and brutal occupation, colonisation and repression, and denial of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights by the Israeli authorities;"
"oppression, plundering, exploitation, unemployment and poverty, the imposition of the most degrading humiliation and inhuman living conditions on the Palestinian people by the Israeli authorities;"
"actual support and collaboration, or at least connivance and tacit acceptance, by the USA and its allies in Europe in the face of the Israeli authorities' considerable responsibility."
"June 2007 is a time to reiterate the call for an end to the occupation of the territories that Israel occupied in 1967, for compliance with international law and for the implementation of the relevant UN resolutions, such as the Palestinian people's inalienable right to a viable, sovereign and independent State."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, the Six Day War took place in 1967 and it had its winner."
"In the last 40 years the loser has been human dignity."
"The humanitarian crisis in the Middle East is one of the most tragic in recent history."
"There is a vicious circle of violence in the region which no one has yet been able to break."
"Generations of Israelis and Palestinians have lived with instability, violence and war."
"Crisis management has been the tool used in practice to seek a solution to the Middle East conflict."
"Step by step the aim has been a move towards permanent peace."
"A ceasefire has been reached which will soon have collapsed and a new conflict begun."
"It is difficult to believe in a successful path as long as the parties fail to understand that each act of violence destroys the future of a section of its own people."
"There is also a lack of comprehension among the Palestinian groups."
"There is a civil war going on in Gaza."
"Scores of Palestinians have died in clashes between Fatah and Hamas."
"Israel's military actions and human rights violations are to be condemned."
"Each country must comply with international obligations and international law and should respect human dignity, something that can never be surrendered."
"We cannot demand Israel's immediate withdrawal from the Palestinian territories, however, as long as the Palestinian authorities do not recognise the state of Israel."
"The Quartet, the United States of America, the United Nations, the EU and Russia, must obviously continue with their efforts to achieve a lasting peace."
"Parliament's job is to demonstrate European consistency and support the Commission and the Council."
"There is one thing we surely cannot do: we cannot make the parties accept our desire to achieve a lasting peace."
"We can encourage and put pressure on them, but we cannot force our will upon them."
"United Nations Human Rights Council (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the fifth session of the UN Human Rights Council which will take place in Geneva on 11-19 June 2007."
"Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, from the very outset the European Union welcomed the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2006 but has always emphasised that it expects the Council to be an efficient and credible body making a genuine contribution to the global protection and promotion of human rights."
"At the previous sessions of the Human Rights Council, the European Union has also attached importance to substantive debates on human-rights issues as well as to dialogue and close cooperation."
"During the fourth regular session, the European Union and the African Group succeeded in securing the adoption by consensus of their resolution on Darfur."
"This was the result of sustained efforts on the part of the European Union, and the outcome reflects not only the mandate of the Council but also the level of responsibility it should be expected to exercise."
"The capacity of the Human Rights Council to fulfil its mandate is inextricably linked to its composition."
"Allow me to recall once more that the General Assembly of the United Nations expects the member nations of the Council to observe the highest standards of human rights."
"It has also called on all UN Members to elect to the Council only those nations with good human-rights records."
"Although this ideal is still far from having been achieved, I should like to express the satisfaction of the European Union that the election of Belarus to the Human Rights Council was successfully thwarted in May."
"This success was due in no small part to the opposition of the European Union to the candidature of Belarus."
"Although it is in a minority in numerical terms, the European Union nevertheless plays a leading role in the Council and has established itself as a major player."
"In spite of some encouraging developments, such as the adoption of an International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, more action is needed to equip the Human Rights Council with the working practices and instruments it needs to live up to the expectations of the international community and particularly those of the European Union."
"The European Union attaches top priority to the institutional establishment of the Council."
"It is therefore making strenuous efforts to ensure that this institution-building process is successfully completed by the end of the first year."
"The forthcoming fifth session will therefore be crucially important."
"At that session the Council will take its concluding decisions on the establishment of the institution and will thereby ultimately determine its own efficiency and credibility for the next five years."
"The European Union is currently cooperating closely in Geneva with all participants in order to achieve an outcome that will enable the Human Rights Council to make full use of its mandate."
"In the Presidency's contacts with the President and the other delegations of the Human Rights Council, we are trying to establish a central role within the United Nations system for an efficient and credible Council."
"To this end the European Union wishes to insist on the creation of an effective and universal periodic review process and on the preservation of issue-based and country-based mandates."
"The planned code of conduct for special rapporteurs must not impair their independence; on the contrary, it must guarantee that independence and focus on the obligations of the states with which the rapporteurs cooperate. Moreover, we are pursuing the aim of establishing a suitable process for the selection of national representatives which will ensure that they possess the requisite expertise as well as guaranteeing their independence."
"We are aware of the difficulties involved in the pursuit of these objectives."
"Let me assure you that we will not relax our efforts to achieve them."
"It also remains the firm hope of the European Union that the Human Rights Council, with its sessions held at regular intervals throughout the year, its new and improved set of instruments and its continuing commitment to the present dialogue with special rapporteurs and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, will develop into a cornerstone of the human-rights system of the United Nations."
"It is now up to all members of the Human Rights Council to act responsibly and to work towards the achievement of these goals."
"Mr President, President-in-Office Günter Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, since it was founded, the European Union, as you know, has been one of the main driving forces for the protection of human rights and has therefore played an active role in pursuing the aims of the Human Rights Council and ensuring that the new body represents a real improvement on the Commission on Human Rights."
"The initial aims have therefore been to ensure that the Council sessions deal with urgent human-rights issues in the context of actual occurrences, to improve coordination within the EU and to step up the Union's outreach efforts, in other words its attempts to sensitise non-EU governments to human-rights issues."
"In these respects real progress has been made, allowing us, on the one hand, to make a coherent and credible stand in the Human Rights Council and, on the other hand, to enhance our cooperation with partners in other parts of the world through bilateral meetings as well as in multilateral forums and through a broad-based campaign to raise awareness in many of the world's capitals."
"Among the priority tasks in the course of the first year have therefore been the safeguarding of the mandates and mechanisms of the Human Rights Council in the framework of the review process and the establishment of the new system, known as the universal periodic review, for the monitoring of the human-rights situation in all countries."
"The general compromise package presented only yesterday by the President of the Human Rights Council certainly points in the right direction; while it needs improvement, from our perspective it is nevertheless a very good initial basis for negotiation."
"Next week's fifth session of the Human Rights Council therefore assumes very special importance as a key to the future of that body."
"This is another reason why I am particularly pleased that a delegation from the European Parliament will be attending the session as part of the delegation from the European Communities."
"What is the verdict on the performance of the Human Rights Council to date?"
"It is impossible to provide a clear-cut answer, but in my view the Council should be an ongoing project, a kind of work in progress, as it were."
"Let me make a few brief comments."
"The first Council sessions were certainly rather disappointing."
"The old behaviour patterns resurfaced."
"We were already familiar with them, of course, from the Commission on Human Rights."
"The sessions on the Middle East in particular were truly marred by an uncooperative attitude on the part of the very states that had convened them."
"The result was unbalanced draft resolutions which we in the European Union were unable to support."
"Let me therefore make it clear that, while confrontation on human-rights issues may well be necessary on occasion when people's fundamental rights are at stake, it is a different matter when human rights are used as a cover for the pursuit of a primarily political conflict."
"Just like the Council Presidency, however, we too have observed that the very good resolution on Darfur which was recently adopted there has mitigated these unfavourable impressions."
"I firmly believe that it is the most important resolution the Council has adopted."
"It was closely coordinated with the African Group in very protracted negotiations and was ultimately adopted by consensus."
"That was a considerable achievement when we consider what a sensitive issue it addressed, coupled with the fact that the EU can now be easily outvoted in the Human Rights Council."
"The monitoring body of five independent UN rapporteurs that was established by the resolution will present its first report to the Council in the next few weeks, most probably next week."
"And let us not forget that the International Criminal Court recently indicted two Sudanese suspects."
"In short, there is at least movement on that front in Darfur."
"We very much hope that this will set an example as well as setting standards for the future work of the Human Rights Council."
"Lastly, the interactive dialogues with the High Commissioner and the UN's special rapporteur have proved to be a very useful development."
"They have enabled us to approach the human-rights situation in individual countries - often in connection with more general human-rights issues - in a highly visible as well as far less confrontational manner."
"Our next step, however, is to find more ways of ensuring that these dialogues can be followed by practical progress on the ground."
"However impatient we may be for rapid progress in the UN Human Rights Council, I would warn anyone against snap judgments on the Council at this stage."
"All we can say so far is that there have been bright and dark sides."
"We are convinced that the EU will continue its efforts to build on the encouraging developments that have undoubtedly taken place and to nurture, in the framework of an intensive dialogue with its UN partners, an effective UN Human Rights Council and above all one that acts in the interests of the people concerned."
"It remains the main international forum for the treatment of human rights, and we in the EU have a responsibility to make active use of it to reinforce our values, our ideals and our interests."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (LT) First of all I would like to thank Council and Commission representatives for their reports about the first working year of the United Nations Human Rights Council and for the fifth United Nations Human Rights Council session."
"Tomorrow the European Parliament will vote on a resolution concerning this issue, which sets out all the basic problems, such as our aspirations for the Human Rights Council's modus operandi, its mechanisms, special procedures, special rapporteurs, universal periodic review, and the role of the European Union."
"The European Parliament has undoubtedly expected and still expects a lot from the Human Rights Council for the simple reason that human rights are a matter of particular importance, since respect for human rights and their defence are a fundamental part of EU ethics and statutes, and in general they are the foundation of Europe's unity and integrity."
"The United Nations Human Rights Council can provide excellent possibilities for effective action in defending and safeguarding human rights, and for promoting them on behalf of the United Nations."
"In this regard the fifth session is particularly important, since one year of activity of the Human Rights Council has revealed problems and shortcomings, which can and must be fixed straight away."
"This is necessary so that the Human Rights Council can become a truly reliable structure - able to react adequately and, when required, quickly to breaches of human rights in any country of the world, and capable of finding effective means to influence the governments of those countries where human rights are being crudely violated."
"The first year of activity of the Human Rights Council has permitted us to ascertain whether, in applying its planned procedures and mechanisms, the Human Rights Council will be able to implement the ambitious programme that it has adopted for itself."
"The first year's experience, resolutions on Darfur, Iran and Uzbekistan, the application of confidentiality requirements when human rights abuses in the latter two countries were being discussed, as well as other decisions, have demonstrated that the procedures of the Human Rights Council must be maximally transparent, and that the special rapporteurs and experts need to be truly independent."
"Furthermore, it is essential to apply clear criteria when choosing members for the Human Rights Council: simple logic indicates that countries, in which there are gross violations of human rights, should not be chosen as members of the Human Rights Council."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I believe that we can be pleased with the consensus that has been achieved amongst the groups in the House in relation to the text that we are going to put to the vote tomorrow for the fifth session of the United Nations Human Rights Council."
"Since this Council was created, it has not had a very easy time."
"It is therefore important that the European Parliament should once again show consistency in terms of how to proceed with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and, specifically, how to facilitate and improve the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council."
"On assessing its activities, it appears that there are certain deficiencies that need to be resolved and which are based on two fundamental problems."
"On the one hand, the weakness and insufficiency of the responses to dramatic and urgent situations that require much more vigorous action."
"I am referring primarily to the dramatic situation in Darfur, something to which everybody should be paying the greatest possible attention."
"Secondly, the need substantially to improve the Council's internal mechanisms and to improve the dynamics of the relationship between the member countries for the sake of more effective and ambitious work."
"There is a fundamental problem underlying both issues, and Parliament and the European Union can do significant work in this regard. I am referring to political differences, which must not hinder the crucial common efforts to substantially reduce the vulnerability of the world's peoples to abuses and violations of human rights."
"This aspect is vital, since Europe must be at the forefront in terms of treating all countries equally when it comes to dialogue on human rights."
"We believe that this philosophy must be extended to the Council and that the next Romanian Presidency of the United Nations Human Rights Council can offer a good opportunity for these essential improvements to become reality."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, respect for human rights is of universal value and importance and is of course a fundamental principle of the EU."
"This House, not surprisingly, pays particular attention to this principle, as shown by the regular production of reports and resolutions dealing with human rights violations around the world."
"It was with great sadness that for years we watched the rather ineffective work of the Human Rights Commission, and it was with much relief that we welcomed, approximately a year ago, the replacement of the Human Rights Commission by the Human Rights Council."
"In the words of a Human Rights Watch representative, the Human Rights Commission in effect became the abusers' club, because abusive governments were eager to be part of it in order to block action on themselves and on countries elsewhere."
"Unfortunately, our hopes for changes for the better were somewhat shaken after the Council elections, when Angola, Egypt and Qatar gained seats."
"Those three countries have a well-known, atrocious record of human rights abuses."
"The non-election of Belarus to the Council was a relief, although this occurred only by a tiny margin."
"During the Human Rights Council's first year, we have seen some changes which have improved its function, but it has to be said that these changes were not spectacular."
"We expect and hope that more promising improvements are on the way."
"The Geneva-based Council has so far shown eagerness to deal with worldwide problems promptly and repeatedly if necessary, but the effectiveness of its work has to be looked at more critically."
"An example is the fact that last year the Council adopted no less than eight resolutions criticising Israel for its military actions in the Palestinian territories in Lebanon."
"These resolutions had some, but not much, usefulness in practical terms."
"This is not the fault of the UN Human Rights Council, but that Council has to assume some responsibility for not finding ways to make its voice heard more seriously."
"Other examples include the Council's problematic dealings with Uzbekistan and Iran."
"As the next session of the Council is due to ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union has now taken over from the United States as the guardian of human rights in the world."
"Of all our many policies, this is the one that gains us the most popularity on a global level."
"Unfortunately, the European Union is not always able to occupy its rightful place at meetings."
"At the World Conference on Climate Change last November, for example, the Union's delegation sat in Finland's place, as Finland held the Presidency at the time."
"We need to be able to occupy our rightful place as the EU to ensure our voice is heard clearly as we deal with the many problems in our contemporary world."
"One area of concern is the Middle East, where Hamas is threatening to destroy Israel, whilst the Israelis are already engaged in destroying the Palestinian nation."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) The Human Rights Council was created as a replacement for the Human Rights Commission and was faced with the by no means easy challenge of not falling into excessive politicisation and governmental interference in such an important area as overseeing universal respect for human rights."
"Nevertheless, the progress made so far, at least in this field, is worrying to say the least."
"Just yesterday we heard Jody Williams - the Human Rights Council's special rapporteur for Darfur - complaining about the immense pressure upon her to make her report acceptable to everybody."
"We all know what that means."
"It means removing, or at least toning down, the criticisms as far as possible in order not to upset anybody."
"The most serious thing, however, is that these requests were made in order not to jeopardise the continuity of the Council."
"Things are going badly if a structure such as the Human Rights Council puts its own survival before what should be its primary and main responsibility: to ensure the protection of human rights in the world, which involves, amongst other things, identifying the people responsible for violations, even if they are governments, or particularly if they are governments."
"During this first anniversary of the Council's existence we must bear these risks very much in mind if we do not want this Council to become just one more structure whose only purpose is to hide the shame of those who constantly violate the most fundamental human rights inside and outside of their borders."
"By means of this resolution, on which there is consensus in the European Parliament and I am pleased about that, we call upon, and encourage, the Council to take on a strong leadership role at the fifth session of the Human Rights Council, and we know that that will not be easy."
"But there are at least two issues that we would like it to prioritise."
"Firstly, the guarantee that special rapporteurs are selected on the basis of their independence and abilities and that they are able to continue operating as independent rapporteurs."
"Secondly, that the periodic universal reviews also include the participation of independent experts."
"That is the only way we can guarantee the credibility of this Council."
"(FI) Mr President, the results of the work of the UN Human Rights Council in its first year are under scrutiny."
"The expectations of the international community have not yet been met."
"The most regrettable example is probably the resolution on the situation in Darfur, whose content was watered down partly as a result of the continuing compromises."
"The work has, understandably, been hampered by the fact that the operation and practices are still being developed."
"Our proposals for a resolution highlights, as it ought, the problem areas in the work of the Human Rights Council."
"Two matters in particular need to be paid attention to."
"Firstly, we have to learn from history."
"The work of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), as the representative of the Human Rights Council, lost credibility, as sitting on the Council were countries which have glaringly violated human rights."
"The EU must continue doggedly to push through the condition that membership of the Human Rights Council is based on an objective criterion and that requirements for membership are sufficiently strict."
"The concept of human rights covers a very wide area."
"Certain fundamental human rights must be unconditionally incorporated in the conditions of membership."
"I think that the countries where Sharia courts are part of the judicial system are especially problematic."
"The EU must fight to ensure that this Human Rights Council does not become a club for abusers of human rights, in the way of the body which precedes it."
"The other matter relates to the relationship between the Universal Periodic Review mechanism and the special procedures employed in individual countries."
"The EU needs to insist strongly that the work of the special experts in individual countries in the UN will in future be kept separate from the UPR and genuinely independent of governments."
"I regard it as worrying that Member States could use the indirect right of veto in the UPR in connection with a debate on the situation in a country, so that they fail to produce their country-specific report."
"I understand the limitations the Human Rights Council assembly puts on the EU's powers of influence."
"Just the countries of Africa and Asia together can, with their 29 seats, steer the Council's work in a direction which differs from the aims of Western countries in the area of human rights."
"The EU must now demonstrate real leadership and a strong will."
"We should try and use the talks to break any regional blocs."
"I wish to thank the German Presidency, which has shown exemplary firmness in its call for prohibiting the death penalty."
"(PL) Mr President, it is now more than a year since the European Parliament cautiously welcomed the creation of the UN Human Rights Council to replace the discredited Commission on Human Rights."
"We hoped that the new Council would become an institution that would help reform the UN and that it would make a determined effort to ensure greater respect for human rights the world over."
"The European Union, the Member States and European Parliament delegations have all been actively involved in the work of the Council."
"It is now time to assess the first year of the Council's operations."
"Unfortunately, it has to be recognised that so far the creation of this new Council has not marked a turning point in the UN's activities in the area of human rights."
"The interests of various countries still take precedence over the defence of threatened fundamental rights and freedoms."
"This can best be illustrated by the Human Rights Council's inability to respond appropriately to the situation in Darfur."
"A report on the tragic situation in that region was adopted in March, yet the Council as a whole was unable to draw logical conclusions from that report and deal with the problem of the Sudanese authorities' political responsibility for the political situation in that country."
"It is also the case that the Council has condemned Israel eight times."
"This demonstrates the imbalance in the Council's work and its political bias."
"The fifth session of the Council is due to commence in a few days' time."
"A European Parliament delegation will be present."
"The Netherlands, Slovenia and Italy have now joined the Council."
"Another European country to become a member is Bosnia-Hercegovina."
"Belarus, currently governed by Mr Lukaszenko's authoritarian regime, has not been elected to the Council in order to avoid controversy."
"We should ensure that Member States of the European Union become more involved in the work of the Council so that the latter is transformed into a body truly devoted to achieving respect for fundamental freedoms."
"At stake are an effective human rights policy in the contemporary world and UN reform. So too is the credibility of the European Union itself, and we would do well to remember that."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has always followed the United Nations reform process constructively as an advocate of effective multilateralism."
"We want a strong UN, we want security and stability, we want an incisive war on poverty, and we want effective protection of human rights."
"As chair of the working party of the European Parliament on relations with the UN, I also have a very personal interest in the achievement of these aims."
"When the Human Rights Council was established as a new UN instrument, we warmly welcomed its creation, because it came with a set of very enticing promises: genuine election of members, rational working methods and the universal periodic review of all members."
"And today?"
"Our resolution is highly critical: Angola, Qatar and Egypt have come on board to join nations like China and Cuba, and elections with a choice of candidates are virtually non-existent."
"We only just managed to prevent the election of Belarus."
"Members of the Organisation of Islamic Countries are in the majority in both the Asian and the African regional groups."
"This means that they control and effectively block the activities of the entire Council, from country reports to the universal review."
"I am on tenterhooks, Commissioner, regarding the fate of the package that was presented yesterday."
"I hope we have grounds for optimism."
"One of your remarks was particularly significant."
"You said that the European Union can easily be outvoted."
"This raises the question whether the West has done its homework."
"This is a question for the Council or, even better, the Member States."
"They were short-changed at the negotiations and did not even notice."
"This was clearly down to a lack of work on the part of our governments."
"But we parliamentarians must also ask ourselves whether our scrutiny, and that of our national counterparts, was strict enough."
"I believe it was not."
"This further reinforces the point that we parliamentarians must not leave the United Nations to our governments."
"We must strengthen the parliamentary dimension of the UN."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I am delighted by your critical appraisal of the first year of the Human Rights Council, because that body did not fulfil the hopes which were placed in it."
"But the fact is that the institution exists and is still the main international forum."
"We must work on that basis, and I hope we shall succeed in backing the Council out of the present dead end."
"Lastly, I am glad that we are having this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I only intend to sum up briefly, because we are in agreement on the objectives."
"I can understand your disappointment, Mr Lambsdorff, about the things you have just enumerated."
"You are not the only one who is disappointed either, for all of us had quite different expectations."
"I share the view of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who said that the Council had been in existence for a year, that we had imagined everything would be different but that we should not make snap judgments about the Council."
"I urge us not to drive a wedge now between parliaments and governments."
"That is not helpful - quite the contrary."
"Even though there is room for improvement in this or that area, the European Union - and the national parliaments, the European Parliament, the governments and the Commission are all part of the Union - must stand together and send a clear signal that we are too firmly committed to human rights to let anyone sow division among us."
"I can only hope that progress can be made in one area or another during the second year, even though a sobering interim assessment is in order after one year."
"But I am spreading the word that we shall succeed together with you, who so fervently champion the cause of human rights."
"I hope we can draw a more favourable conclusion in next year's report than we were able to do today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the Human Rights Council as a body in its infancy that is still experiencing certain growing pains."
"It is not easy for the European Union to achieve any real progress in asserting our human-rights standards in the UN framework today."
"Why?"
"Because we have few permanent allies."
"The support we receive usually comes from Canada, Switzerland, Norway, the countries applying for EU membership and individual countries covered by our neighbourhood policy, to name a few of the main sources."
"This list is not exhaustive, but we are often faced with a united front of G77 countries, and we can rarely achieve anything if a confrontational approach is adopted."
"We must draw our own conclusions from this."
"Where does the problem lie?"
"What can we do?"
"We could, for example, strengthen the Special Rapporteur, support the High Commissioner for Human Rights and introduce universal reviews, but we could also condemn the most serious cases and denounce the most flagrant violations."
"In other words, in specific instances we must continue to do some very plain talking on behalf of the victims of abuses."
"I often wish we could respond and react more quickly to developments."
"From the very beginning, for example, I have been calling for a kind of warning mechanism."
"I very much hope that we can move gradually in that direction."
"In the longer term, however, the achievement of the aims of the Human Rights Council will depend on the establishment of a new approach to human rights within the United Nations."
"The transition to this new approach, indeed, was at the heart of the resolution on the creation of the new Council."
"The resolution states that the work of the Council 'shall be guided by the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and cooperation'."
"We must also be aware, of course, that there will never be an apolitical UN forum."
"It therefore goes without saying that we must not only promote our values but also defend all of our interests."
"I have received two motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Management of Europe's maritime borders - European Solidarity and protection of migrants' rights (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the management of Europe's maritime borders, European solidarity and protection of migrants' rights."
"Mr President, may I, on behalf of the Presidency, state very clearly that the latest reports on migrants who have lost their lives when their boats have foundered in the Mediterranean, the reports of tragedies that have occurred there, remind us of the responsibility that we as Member States have in this domain."
"Regardless of all the tenets of immigration policy, when there is a real and present danger to life and limb, the protection of human life, as the supreme value, must have absolute priority."
"This principle is not only enshrined in a number of international conventions; it also accords with our common understanding of the values on which the European Union is based."
"Irrespective of the question of legal jurisdiction, the European Union undoubtedly bears political responsibility, and we should shoulder that responsibility together."
"This is why the Presidency, by agreement with the Commission, has decided that the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers should debate this issue at their next meeting on 12 June."
"We cannot close our eyes to the fact that there have been problems in the past in the interpretation and application of international conventions and that these problems still arise today."
"We as Member States must recognise the responsibility we have to prevent such human tragedies, and the Hague Programme rightly and explicitly emphasises the need for close cooperation among all states as well as for solidarity and shared responsibility."
"Besides the need to save human lives, the decisive message is that we must not let it come to the point at which unscrupulous criminal organisations put these people's lives in danger by trying to transport them illegally to Europe."
"This is why it is important that, as part of a general strategy for the resolution of the migration issue, we also achieve better cooperation with the countries of origin and transit."
"It is essential to step up this cooperation in the framework of the political dialogue on migration issues with the governments of these countries, especially in the context of the Euromed partnership and the follow-up process to the EU-Africa migration conferences in Rabat and Tripoli."
"We believe that our efforts of the last few months and the debates at all Council meetings during the Finnish and German presidencies have been a first step towards ensuring that the European Union will be able to deal with these tragedies more effectively and convincingly in future for the sake of the people concerned."
"Member of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Altmeier, has said a great deal and I agree with the position he has taken."
"I shall certainly emphasise one essentially political aspect of it, which is the requirement to tackle the immigration issue by combining the need to stop the traffic in human beings and any kind of illegal activity with the absolute need for solidarity, and solidarity means first and foremost saving human lives in danger."
"When we are faced with the risk of losing even a single human life, as has quite rightly been mentioned and as we emphasise in our joint statement, strictly legal questions concerning the implementation of international conventions on maritime law - which also needs to be done rigorously and thoroughly - take second place."
"Human lives in danger need to be saved first."
"Of course, solidarity is not just that."
"Solidarity lies at the basis of the global approach that the Commission is taking, in the wake of the unanimous support given by the European Council last December and in strict collaboration with the German Presidency of the European Union in this first half of the year."
"First and foremost, there must be solidarity among the EU Member States, which means that every State in the Union, even those that are convinced that they are less affected by the daily immigration tragedy, must understand that the problem is also theirs and concerns the whole EU, with no exceptions."
"It would seem to be an obvious decision, then, to provide patrols in the Atlantic Ocean to support Spain, which would otherwise have to face the enormous flow of migrants to the Canary Islands all alone, or a patrol in the Mediterranean to meet the demands of countries like Malta or Cyprus, the smallest Mediterranean members of the EU, not to mention the larger ones."
"All the Member States must play their part in the patrols, and I shall very amicably tell all the ministers next week that not enough has yet been done or is being done, after the commitment to make equipment available."
"That is the first aspect of solidarity among the Member States."
"Then there is a financial aspect to solidarity."
"The sums needed to introduce the patrols and to offer people in difficulty protection and a decent reception need to be shared."
"In that respect, ladies and gentlemen, I am forced to appeal to you as well, with my usual sincerity."
"This Parliament is still holding in reserve EUR 12.7 million that is vitally needed right now, not in a week's time, if the Frontex missions are to continue."
"I respect this Parliament's decisions, but I must say quite frankly that if the reserve, which is due to be examined on about 24-25 June, is only released at the end of this month, we run the risk of having to stop the Frontex missions in the central Mediterranean and the Canaries owing to lack of funds."
"Immediate steps are needed to release the funds, which are available but have been put on one side."
"There is another matter that has to do with solidarity: our commitment to the other countries involved."
"We have promised to work more closely with the countries of origin and of transit."
"We have said very clearly that we want them to contribute effectively and that we are ready to help the countries of origin through a system of legal, regular and monitored immigration."
"We put forward a clear proposal on this subject two weeks ago."
"At the same time we are asking for support from the countries of origin and of transit to prevent human trafficking and to explain very clearly to all those who want to set off across the Atlantic or Mediterranean that they will be embarking on a journey not to riches but into serious danger."
"What is needed before anything else, therefore, is political cooperation, not police cooperation, so as to create the conditions for providing even clearer information on this issue in the countries of origin, information that is currently lacking."
"Conversely, Europe is ready to welcome people who want to work honestly and within the law."
"As we all know, such people are needed in many Member States where there is a shortage of labour."
"That is another aspect of solidarity."
"Then there is an important form of solidarity in receiving immigrants, including illegal ones."
"It is my conviction that every Member State has a duty to do all it can to save human lives at sea, but it is also necessary for the other Member States to realise that we cannot leave Malta, for example, to bear the whole burden of receiving all the immigrants saved in the middle of the Mediterranean by Maltese vessels."
"The situation requires solidarity and also a politically based outline agreement to determine where we can receive the immigrants that arrive in the most exposed countries."
"This is another face of solidarity: offering to receive immigrants in a broader range of Member States, and not just in those that are in the front line."
"That is another point on which we have to find an agreement in principle, which sadly has not yet been found."
"I think we will have to address a further issue at the Council of Ministers next week: who is responsible for patrolling the search and rescue regions on the high seas that come under third-country responsibility?"
"The case of Libya has been mentioned."
"According to international conventions, every country has a region of the open sea where it is responsible for search and rescue on the high seas."
"What happens if a non-EU country like Libya does not carry out its search and rescue duty at sea?"
"What can we Europeans do to intervene in that region?"
"Who should take responsibility?"
"These are rules that need to be established and do not yet exist."
"The problem concerns the implementation of international conventions, not of European laws."
"The time has come, however, to address this subject within the EU, and I think it will be a good idea to start debating this as well at the Council of Ministers next week."
"Finally, where does the responsibility lie and what kind of solidarity is needed for the initial reception of immigrants when they first arrive and have to be received in conditions commensurate with human dignity, which are inalienable and non-negotiable?"
"Who should take the responsibility and how should we share out the tasks among the Member States?"
"Again, can we expect a small country in the middle of the Mediterranean to do it all alone?"
"That would not be an example of solidarity among the Member States, so that is another aspect with which we should be concerned."
"The European Union can do a great deal in that respect: it can help to fund and organise repatriation operations in the countries of origin in compliance with the rules that guarantee the absolute dignity of everyone being repatriated."
"Of course, all immigrants, even illegal ones, have every right to respect for their human dignity, but we cannot impose our views if there are any Member States that refuse to play their part."
"That is the solidarity to which I am referring, and those are the guiding principles to ensure that the tragedy that occurred a few days ago - it is not a question of accusing or blaming anyone for it, but of learning a tragic lesson - can never happen again."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (MT) Mr President the worst thing we could do would be to point the finger at one another instead of working together to find a solution to this serious problem, a problem that, as has been said, does not simply pertain to one country, but to all countries."
"To point a finger at Malta in connection with the incidents that occurred in Libyan waters and therefore not under Malta's responsibility is wrong and unfair."
"Malta is well aware of its obligations and is honouring them while maintaining full respect for human life."
"So much so that the majority of immigrants who arrive in Malta every year and who are picked up from the sea are saved from death's door."
"However, the burden Malta has to carry is already disproportionate."
"To cite an example, Mr Altmaier: the maritime area that Malta is responsible for monitoring is about two thirds the size of Germany or almost three quarters the size of Italy."
"We are responsible for the whole of that area."
"Until now Malta has patrolled this area single-handedly because Frontex has not even begun its rounds as yet."
"Commissioner, this Parliament is so eager to get Frontex's operations started that it has doubled the Frontex budget."
"However, up till now Frontex has proved to be completely ineffective in the Mediterranean."
"Therefore, the fact that Malta has to shoulder the blame for incidents that take place in Libyan waters is unjust and unfair."
"Instead of accusing one another, we must work together to come up with a solution."
"Indeed, the solution, if we want it, is a clear one."
"Seeing as this is not the problem of solely one country, the burden constituted by the immigrants rescued from Maltese waters ought to be distributed between everyone: - yes, between the 27 Member States of the European Union."
"This is perfectly clear."
"What is not clear, Mr President, is whether national governments are willing to shoulder this responsibility and share out the burden."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, it is absolutely intolerable that, every summer, we witness human tragedies on the borders of Europe."
"In spite of our indignation, every year these tragedies are repeated."
"How can the European Union leave these people alone faced with their despair at the gates of Europe?"
"The Commission must ask for commitments from Member States at the next Justice and Home Affairs (JAI) Council: we must ensure that no events of this kind can ever happen again."
"It is intolerable that we should be debating the responsibilities of individuals while there were people in danger at sea and they were not rescued."
"Malta bears a large part of the responsibility, that is sure."
"Giving assistance to people in distress is a duty and not a choice, but they were left to die."
"I believe, however, that we are all responsible for this tragedy."
"I received messages from many Maltese who are people who care and who are distressed at seeing immigrants treated in this fashion and their country in this situation."
"At the same time, however, they are aware that their little country has been abandoned."
"I should like to say here that these events demonstrate the lack of European solidarity in relation to the management of borders and the reception of emigrants."
"It is intolerable that the burden should rest essentially with the countries of the South and East of Europe."
"Europe must show its solidarity and take action so that costs and responsibilities are shared by all Member States."
"That is why I call on Member States to grant more resources to Frontex so that maritime missions can begin before the end of June and be broadly developed, particularly in the Mediterranean."
"I was satisfied to learn that the evaluation of the Dublin II regulation is to be presented to us in the days to come."
"That is what we have been told recently."
"We have been asking for it for several months, even though now it is no longer an evaluation that is needed but a swift revision."
"The Dublin II regulation is obviously not appropriate, especially for a small country like Malta."
"Finally, we ask the Commission where the discussions with Libya have got to concerning immigration."
"Recent events have shown Libya's inability to give help to migrants and people in distress."
"We have already said it and we repeat: the European Union must not shrug off its responsibilities and pass them on to a country that does not apply appropriate standards in relation to the protection of fundamental rights."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, illegal immigration should be addressed as a matter of urgency, because that is what it has been for a while."
"The first hesitant steps have been taken."
"This does not alter the fact, though, that in 2007, there is still much interference on the line where the issue is concerned of who is responsible for rescuing people from drowning, whether they are legal or illegal."
"Staggeringly, it appears that not everybody takes the moral and lawful duty equally seriously."
"Of course, as Mrs Roure pointed out a moment ago, Malta has a difficult job where the large influx of illegals is concerned."
"This is beyond dispute."
"We should therefore get this so wished for and much-discussed solidarity underway as quickly as possible."
"It also strikes me that the swift introduction of a burden sharing-mechanism is called for."
"This reality, though, does not in any way justify the way in which Malta thinks it should handle its moral and lawful duty."
"After all, we are talking about an EU Member State, which means that we as a Union are responsible."
"While Malta and Libya cannot agree on the precise location of 27 people drowning, they hang on to fishing nets for three days."
"This is not an isolated incident, unfortunately."
"Absurd."
"We all know that Libya is not exactly renowned for being the paradise of human rights or humane opinions, far from it."
"The fact that the Union is at risk of adopting the same view on these drowning people is an outright scandal."
"Yesterday in my discussion dossier for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I came across a study on illegal immigrants at sea, the actions proposed in which should be implemented as a matter of priority."
"Commissioner Frattini will need to join forces with Commissioner Barrot in this."
"Money alone is not enough."
"You know very well that it is precisely the Council that has the key where the conditions regarding the return of illegal immigrants are concerned."
"Let it at the same time and above all be clear that nobody, yes nobody, should hide behind so-called legal loopholes in international maritime law, for example."
"Where there is a political will, there is definitely a way."
"I should like to finish off with a comment to the Council. Presidents of the Council, you can include Berlin declarations, in which European values are central, until the cows come home."
"If nothing at all is done in practice, however, then reality gives us a totally different picture and you as President of the Council are putting the EU's credibility in the balance."
"Translate the fine words you so like to proclaim, and which you did a moment ago, into action."
"I would urge you to fulfil the ambitions you enshrined in the Tampere and The Hague programmes, among others."
"Deliver on your promises."
"With all due respect, a debate next week is fantastic, but is really not good enough."
"The issues are not new."
"Action is what is called for right now."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I think many of the recent incidents and the shocking pictures that we have seen of a small boat towing people in its net, are the result - as we have been hearing - of a catalogue of failures, many of them absolutely avoidable with a bit of forward planning."
"We assume that the next Justice and Home Affairs Council will be doing some of that."
"It would have been avoidable if Member States had delivered on their promises regarding logistical and other support for Frontex and other measures promised in the wake of the experience in the Canaries, Lampedusa, Malta, Cyprus, etc. It would have been avoidable, as Commissioner Frattini said, if Member States had prepared a plan B for when Libya fails to carry out its obligations."
"Indeed, it appears that Libya has not clearly defined its maritime rescue area, so why are we negotiating in an emergency when we know there is already disagreement and we could have planned ahead?"
"I agree with Mrs Roure: we need to beware of the agreements we negotiate with a country which has such a poor record on human rights."
"That covers many of the transit and origin countries too."
"Such agreements have to be in the public domain, whether multilateral or bilateral, and this Parliament has yet to receive documents promised by the Italian authorities after our visit to Lampedusa."
"My group believes we need an asylum agency to organise expert teams to help countries under stress assess claims."
"With reference to Dublin II, we are also aware that the fear of consequences makes some states reluctant to act and assume responsibility because they feel they are on their own."
"But there is also an issue about the reception and procedures directives and the quality of their implementation."
"The EU must again provide support to ensure a quality procedure: another task for an asylum agency."
"But we also have to provide back-up in other countries to deal with the processing of arrivals."
"We also need to be clear that we do not penalise those who carry out rescues, so we have no more Cap Anamur-style prosecutions."
"We are told that the law of the sea is clear: people in distress should be rescued regardless of their status."
"I am absolutely certain that, had those people pictured in our media been cruise-line passengers, they would have been picked up far more quickly than was the case."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Frattini was right to talk about solidarity, but for us the first solidarity that we should show is to the families of the people drowned in the Mediterranean, solidarity to explain to ourselves as well that we should stop calling them illegal immigrants but should probably refer to them as shipwrecked people."
"That is in fact what they are: people - men and women - who drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe and who were not even given a chance of being saved or rescued at sea, but were actually left for three days clinging to a tuna net."
"It has to be said quite plainly: someone has to take serious responsibility for that!"
"Mr Frattini said so clearly in an interview to an Italian newspaper, when he mentioned the serious responsibility of the Maltese Government."
"That needs to be repeated here in this Chamber, as well as the fact that they did not even have the decency to bury those people; even the idea of taking them in after death was rejected."
"Therefore we ought seriously to consider the fact that, although Frontex may have a specific task to perform, its priority must be to rescue people at sea."
"That is something we said a short while ago when we were debating the Rapid Border Intervention Teams."
"This, sadly, was by no means the first tragedy; over the last ten years more than 9 000 human beings have drowned while trying to reach Europe, but this was the worst tragedy in the last ten years."
"We should also carefully consider the need to expand the legal channels for people to enter legally and also the possibility of reviewing the Dublin II regulation in order to prevent what has been happening."
"Look, in my view something serious is taking place: we are losing sight of the guiding principles of Western civilisation, which is based on hospitality and the right to burial."
"As the great tragic playwrights of ancient Greece taught us, we ought to start afresh from that point, not least so that we can develop a new idea of reception and hospitality for Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, it is important to recall today the pictures we have all seen in the newspapers and on television."
"A boat would be spotted from the air, and by the time the local rescue operation was launched, the boat was no longer there, and 53 to 57 people had drowned."
"We are talking today about other cases too, in which almost everyone found on these boats was dead. We are talking about children, about babies, about many unknown people - in short, about an appalling tragedy which must surely horrify us."
"Allow me, therefore, to say first of all on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that this issue goes right to the heart of Europe."
"It is about fundamental rights, about the very foundation stone of our values, namely the right to life."
"Today's debate is not about the immigration argument, about whom we let into Europe and whom we exclude, but about quintessentially humanitarian matters."
"I must therefore stress that values do not stop at borders; we Europeans believe that values are indivisible, and we must apply them."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise that, as many of my honourable colleagues have said, there is now a pressing need for European solidarity."
"Leaving a tiny country like Malta and other countries along our southern rim to their own devices and then pointing an accusing finger at them is not the way to act."
"No, this is a European issue."
"I find it a great pity that this tragedy has had little media impact in central and northern Europe and that people in those parts have shown no interest in it."
"Action is needed now."
"For that reason, Commissioner, I gladly embrace, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, the idea that we should discuss a spending freeze if funds are needed for this purpose."
"I ask the Council through you, Peter, not only to adopt decisions but to take long-overdue action now."
"Decisions will not save people's lives; only practical measures can save lives."
"That is why I am calling quite specifically for this humanitarian disaster to be one of the main items on the agenda at next week's meeting of the Council."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have once again had pictures shown in our homes of desperate situations and deaths of emigrants."
"These pictures once again show the most dramatic and visible face of illegal immigration."
"They once again illustrate a repeated humanitarian emergency that requires an immediate and vigorous response."
"This situation will not come to an end on its own."
"More than 9 000 people have already died trying to cross the Mediterranean and, with the arrival of the good weather, this figure will continue to grow."
"Last week, the authorities of a Member State failed to comply with their fundamental international obligations with regard to the rescue and reception of shipwrecked people."
"Well, it is not sufficient to condemn that State for its unacceptable attitude and ask it to take on its responsibilities in order to ensure that that situation does not arise again."
"Nor can we delegate the fight against illegal immigration to captains of fishing vessels."
"We are not talking about a Maltese problem."
"It is a European problem that requires a generalised response based on solidarity amongst all of us."
"I shall insist: all of the Member States, shared responsibility, transparency and mutual trust."
"For all of these reasons, I would like to call upon the Council, the Commission and this House immediately to adopt specific measures to put an end to this unacceptable situation."
"Frontex must cease to be a mirage and it must be provided with the resources necessary for joint monitoring patrols to operate permanently throughout the year in the high-risk areas."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we Europeans cannot carry on debating and squabbling amongst ourselves while immigrants are still drowning."
"Let us act now."
"(ES) I would like to begin by congratulating the Commissioner on taking on her responsibility in relation to this issue."
"I hope that they are not just words, though it is of course good to begin with words."
"It is absolutely intolerable that we should leave a group of human beings to die while the governments and bureaucracies of various Members States argue about who is obliged to rescue these shipwrecked people who are dying from starvation, from drowning, from exposure to the sun ..."
"Malta has its obligations and its attitude has been intolerable and deserves to be condemned."
"The Union, however, must of course be in a position to support Malta today, Spain, in the Canary Islands, yesterday, and wherever else tomorrow, when it comes to saving the lives of people who wish to enter the European Union."
"The summer is beginning and, with it, we are once again seeing the human flow of people who wish to live out their dreams in London or Hamburg, but who are destined to die on the beaches of the south."
"That is the message that we must send."
"We are currently in the midst of a debate on the future of Europe, on what we want and what we can do together."
"Well, it is in fields such as this that the European Union can find its legitimacy."
"I am not just talking about credibility. I am talking about legitimacy."
"The European Union can also lose its legitimacy in this area, however."
"What kind of Union do we have amongst us that can organise and regulate all sorts of things - some of which many of our citizens consider to be absurd, and even idiotic - but which is incapable of organising things in such a way that people who are trying to reach our borders do not die, that people trying to reach our castles are not doomed to die at the castle gates?"
"Mr Vice-President, you have an historic challenge, a political and historic challenge."
"You have the responsibility to promote solidarity, but if solidarity does not emerge, you have the responsibility to impose it."
"You have the power to do so."
"If solidarity does not emerge, you will have to impose it. Impose it politically, shaming those States that do not take on their responsibilities, and impose it by force by means of legislative proposals so that everybody assumes their responsibility towards the present and the past, with so many deaths attributable to governments that do not play their part."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, every day more would-be illegal immigrants try to reach the European continent, and every day we experience intolerable situations and intolerable tragedies in southern Europe."
"The European Union has created Frontex."
"The European Parliament was prepared to double the annual budget for border surveillance."
"Frontex now has a budget of 35 million euros."
"Nevertheless, more illegal immigrants are entering the European Union daily."
"The plain and simple fact is that border surveillance is not working."
"The assistance to Member States and the coordination that Frontex is supposed to provide are not working."
"If the coordination is defective, the work of Frontex invites criticism."
"If, however, the Member States do not deliver the manpower and equipment they promised to provide, it is they who must be held to account and made to honour their obligations."
"In no circumstances should we put the entire onus on the countries of southern Europe."
"In this context I have a question to put to our Commissioner."
"In a press release on 24 May, the Commission reported that the number of aircraft, ships and other items of equipment made available to date had been satisfactory."
"Today, in another report from the Commission, we learn that it is criticising the Member States, which have delivered only a tenth of the promised aircraft, ships and helicopters."
"So which version is correct?"
"Can you please put the record straight, Commissioner?"
"If the Frontex agency has been set up by us and is so well funded, it must perform."
"If that is not the case, let us please abolish it and explore other avenues."
"One way or the other - and I appeal here to everyone in a position of responsibility - the European Union, as well as monitoring our own borders, must provide assistance for the establishment of a functioning system of border surveillance in the transit countries - that is a form of local assistance which will help us in turn - as well as granting stabilisation aid and conducting local information campaigns in the countries of origin."
"It is certainly high time we took action instead of continuing to discuss an intolerable situation."
"(IT) Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse what Mr Frattini has said here today and in the interviews he has given in recent days, but someone who does not endorse them at all is the Maltese Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"In a statement this afternoon he explained that Malta cannot take charge of illegal immigrants who legally do not come under its jurisdiction."
"Twenty-one people who drowned are not a legal matter, and somebody at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers, either the Presidency or the Commission, needs to explain to the Maltese Government the difference between illegal immigrants and shipwreck victims."
"Somebody needs to remind the Maltese Foreign Minister that a fishing boat flying the Maltese flag decided to leave 27 people clinging to a tuna fishing line because they thought it was more important to save the tuna they had caught than human lives."
"Somebody needs to explain to the Maltese Minister and all the rest of our ministers that humanitarian law has nothing to do with legal obligations or the conventions signed by our countries."
"Since I believe that it is important to put words into deeds, I agree with you, Mr Frattini, that the Frontex funds need to be released and that all countries need to take this requirement on board but, at the same time, allowing Frontex or the European repatriation fund to receive these funds must be made conditional on fulfilling their duty to assist anyone in distress at sea, in whatever circumstances and no matter what the legal status of the shipwreck."
"That is one of the working hypotheses that can be used to tackle this problem over the next few days with the other ministers."
"(MT) Mr President, it is a disgrace that, once again, so many people had to lose their lives before the European Union's lack of concrete action on immigration was exposed."
"Although I believe that all the Member States must shoulder their burden of responsibility, especially when it comes to life or death situations, the Commission and, especially, the Council must also share part of the responsibility."
"In my opinion, the Commission and the Council are not treating the situation with the urgency it deserves or giving it the commitment it merits."
"Looking back at what has been done during these past four years, it is easy to see that, if you eliminate the meaningless buzzwords of 'solidarity' and 'mobilisation', few measures have actually been taken to address this alarming situation."
"We expect immediate action to be taken on the burden-sharing principle, on the revision of Dublin 2 and on logistical and administrative assistance in order to effectively coordinate the joint patrols, which up till now have been practically ghost-like and which were promised to us long ago by Frontex."
"Until now, it seems that Frontex has simply been an agency that has been too stunned to take action, due to the enormity of the crisis facing it."
"Yet, no country can go on trying to cope with this tragedy alone, especially one as small as Malta and one that is already carrying a far greater load than it can bear."
"At this stage the priority should be the actual crisis and not identifying those who are to blame."
"We have to carry out an emergency Marshall-type plan before we find ourselves obliged to repeat the same speeches again when another tragedy takes place."
"We have no time to lose; too many lives have been lost."
"I hope that the definition of solidarity given by Commissioner Frattini will in fact be implemented."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with all those who have said that we need action rather than mere words."
"And the Council has indeed been taking action in recent months."
"The Council ensured that the centralised record of available technical equipment, the Frontex toolbox, was stocked up and that Frontex, at least in principle, has more than 100 ships, aircraft and helicopters at its disposal."
"With the support of this Parliament, the Council ensured that the Regulation on the RABITs, the Rapid Border Intervention Teams, could be adopted."
"There will be a Frontex operation in the waters around Malta, where we shall try, with the assistance of experts from the Member States and the support of helicopters from the Member States, to put an end to this human tragedy."
"I must say, however, that it would have been better if we had been able to launch these operations a few weeks earlier."
"That is a responsibility we must all accept collectively."
"In the past few months we also agreed, in response to a proposal from the Commission, to implement regional protection programmes in countries of origin and transit."
"We took positive action by agreeing on the conclusion of partnership agreements and by discussing incentives for legal immigration and circular migration."
"We are engaged in negotiations on the subject of readmission agreements with countries in Africa and elsewhere."
"All of these things are taking us in the right direction."
"It is nevertheless true that many of these measures have come too late and that it would have been better for the people concerned if more rapid and efficient action had been taken."
"(NL) Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, I think this is also attributable to the lack of efficiency in the Council's decision-making procedure."
"It is unfortunate that the European Constitution has not yet entered into force, because the European Constitution and the reforms it provides for would enable us to take the necessary decisions much more swiftly and much more efficiently."
"In the coming days and weeks we shall have to ensure that we live up to our humanitarian responsibility for the people in distress."
"We shall also have to ensure that we do not leave Malta in the lurch."
"Malta is a small country with a great responsibility in the area in question."
"For this reason Malta is entitled to the solidarity of the European Union."
"Thirdly, we shall have to ensure that none of the action we take creates new pull factors that lead to more and more people trying to make their way to Europe, because we shall otherwise run the risk of multiplying rather than alleviating the human misery."
"This is why I firmly believe that the Council will summon up the strength to send out a clear signal at its meeting next week."
"Member of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse what Mr Altmaier has said."
"Next week the Council of Ministers will certainly address this issue candidly in a truly political debate."
"I shall not, therefore, repeat the references to the many positive measures that have already been taken."
"All of you will remember that just two years ago there was not a single document on joint European action on immigration; today we are talking about how to apply the documents and principles that have emerged from a political consensus that used not to exist but now does."
"Steps forward have been made, but not everything has been done as quickly as it should have been."
"As somebody mentioned, we have had a major increase in funding for Frontex: EUR 35 million for 2007."
"However, EUR 13 million of that has been withheld and therefore cannot be used, and the corresponding spending cannot be undertaken."
"I am grateful for what has been said about Parliament's commitment to getting this sum released to Frontex straight away."
"The toolbox made available to Frontex has been sufficient."
"I said the same thing a few weeks ago, after reading the commitment statements by the Ministers for Internal Affairs of at least 19 European countries."
"What I said then, at the end of May, was that for this summer we have over 100 boats, over 100 patrol vessels, 25 helicopters and 20 aeroplanes."
"What I have said today, however, is also true: since the formal commitment was adopted until now, we have only received one tenth of the equipment promised."
"I shall tell the Ministers and their colleagues in the Council quite amicably that what they committed themselves to providing needs to be made available straight away."
"Had we had not five but 50 patrol vessels, perhaps a vessel might have arrived sooner to save those people from drowning."
"An Italian vessel could have intervened, and then a French one to recover the bodies of the victims and take them to France."
"Perhaps if we had had a greater presence we could have dealt with it sooner."
"That, you have to admit, would be solidarity in practice."
"We also have to remember that in the areas where Frontex has operated - I mean in the Canary Islands last year, for example - it has had a positive effect overall."
"I cannot forget that the Spanish Minister for Internal Affairs stated at the end of autumn last year that migration to the Canaries had fallen by about 30%, thanks to Frontex patrols in collaboration with a third country, in this case Senegal."
"When the operations work, the results are obvious."
"As regards the central Mediterranean, Libya had a visit from us a few days ago."
"A Frontex mission went to Libya to explore the possibility of providing aid to Libya to control its southern desert border with Niger."
"We told Libya quite clearly that we expect it to carry out more controls and above all to observe its territorial search and rescue region on the high seas, which Libya is bound to observe, like any other country."
"The mission will be called Nautilus II and will be sent to the central Mediterranean; it will depart as planned within a few days, and of course I hope as many Member States as possible will take part in it, not just the Mediterranean countries."
"The German Government has indicated that it will take part in the central Mediterranean mission, even though it is not a Mediterranean State, and then there will be some Mediterranean States too."
"I would like to see my country, Italy, take part for example, although so far it has not given any indication that it wants to take part in this mission, which is going to operate precisely in the area between Sicily, Malta and Libya."
"This is a concrete example of the appeal for solidarity that I shall, of course, make to the Ministers, but I am also appealing to you."
"The final topic is the Dublin regulation, which was mentioned by Mrs Roure, among others."
"The report was published today and has been adopted by the Commission."
"It shows how well the Dublin regulation mechanism has worked."
"The regulation has worked properly, but the Commission suggests certain additions."
"It suggests considering whether the principle whereby only the country of initial destination is required to receive immigrants can be the only fair solution or whether a better way of sharing the burden could be incorporated."
"That is also the subject of a proposal adopted today by the Commission, a Green Paper on asylum policy from now to 2010, as this Parliament requested."
"The proposals are there, and I am still expecting a gesture of solidarity."
"Clearly, if a large majority of the Member States says that the system is working well as it is, that means that the country of first destination will still have to bear the whole burden, and that is not solidarity."
"That is another example of how even the Dublin regulation needs to be interpreted correctly, not to point the finger at anyone, but to ensure that everyone works together."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) How many corpses will we have to fish out of the Mediterranean Sea before effective solutions are put in place?"
"Let us stop pointing the finger at small countries like Malta that can no longer manage the constant flood of immigrants who are washed up daily on their beaches."
"This is not the way to fight illegal immigration."
"There is no barbed wire, no barrier that will stop these men and women, who are prepared to do anything to provide life's essentials for their families, from crossing the seas."
"In September 2006, Parliament launched an appeal to Member States and to the Commission in a resolution adopted by all the political groups."
"We were insisting on the need for strengthening partnerships and dialogues with the countries of origin."
"We also asked for revision of the Dublin II regulation which puts too heavy a burden on the countries in the South and East of the Union."
"It is of the utmost urgency to establish a fair mechanism for solidarity and for sharing responsibilities between all the Member States."
"What is more, we have to recognise the lack of results from Frontex."
"Genuine political willingness is fundamental if Member States are to give adequate resources to this agency to enable it to function effectively in the future."

"The first of these matters is the Prüm Convention, an international agreement that was originally concluded by a small number of Member States - there were initially seven, but a further ten states have subsequently acceded to it."
"The Convention paved the way for Europe's first network of national DNA and fingerprint databases and vehicle registers."
"In this way we laid the foundations for a modern information exchange for police forces in Europe while applying high standards of data protection."
"This Convention that was concluded by some of the Member States is now to become an EU-wide instrument."
"It is to be incorporated into the legislative framework of the European Union, and its core provisions will apply in all 27 Member States."
"We are thereby contributing to the security of the people of Europe, because DNA-matching among a small number of countries has already resulted in the identification of criminals and in convictions for serious crimes."
"We are also helping to enhance the capacity of the European Union to act, for it is only right that this Convention should no longer be treated as an instrument of international law but as part of our common European legal framework."
"I should like to thank all Member States, as well as the European Commission and the Members of the European Parliament, for having helped to clear the way for the replacement of the Convention in spite of a very tight time frame."
"In converting the Convention into a Council Decision and in implementing that Decision, we shall also take due account of the opinions of the European Parliament."
"We shall decide next week on the visa-information system on which we reached political agreement with the European Parliament back in May."
"Now that an agreement has been reached in Coreper, there is a good chance that the Council will confirm the decision on access next week."
"A formal agreement will then be concluded once the wording has been checked by the lawyer-linguists."
"The visa-information system is a particularly important means of consolidating the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It will mean that alphanumerical and biometric data can be stored and retrieved during visa procedures."
"This will help to ensure that we are able to combat multiple visa applications, identity frauds and other forms of deception more effectively than hitherto."
"The decision on access to the VIS will also enable security authorities to search the VIS for the purpose of preventing, discovering and investigating terrorist crimes and other serious offences."
"These new research facilities for the security authorities will be a vital step forward in efforts to protect the public, especially from terrorism and organised crime."
"Let me stress that the agreement we reached with the European Parliament is a very balanced and sound agreement which reconciles the diverse arguments that have been advanced."
"If we manage to improve police cooperation in Europe as these two measures are designed to do, thereby creating more security for our citizens, we must also ensure that data protection is given a high profile in the European Union and that the abuse of data transmitted between Member States is prevented and effectively combated."
"For this reason I am delighted that major progress has been achieved in recent weeks on the assignment of the framework decision on data protection to the third pillar, that we were able, with the agreement of the rapporteur of the European Parliament, to deal with a new draft in two readings within the Council working group and that we have sharply reduced the number of the reservations which have been a barrier to rapid progress in the past."
"This new revised draft guarantees a high level of protection."
"The protection level prescribed by Council of Europe Convention No 108 of 1981 and by the additional protocol of 2001 will be fully guaranteed."
"On the issues of the scope of the decision and the rules relating to non-EU countries, we shall also find sound solutions."
"The European Parliament has made a very important contribution in this respect, and I should like to thank you most sincerely again on behalf of the Presidency for your extraordinarily rapid treatment of the revised draft."
"Particularly with regard to the adequacy of the protection afforded by states outside the Union and the inclusion of a provision on the forwarding of data to non-public bodies, we are on the way to finding effective solutions."
"I also believe that the evaluation clause proposed by the European Parliament with regard to the scope of the decision is a thoroughly constructive solution, and we shall use the remaining term of the German presidency to achieve further progress."
"With his fifteen principles for data protection, Commissioner Frattini helped to ensure that we were able to frame the key provisions in this area."
"At the Council meeting we shall propose a Council statement and press for due adherence to these principles in subsequent deliberations."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have much to add after the considerations put forward by Mr Altmaier on behalf of the Council."
"Concerning the first of the topics being debated, we have from the outset supported the German Presidency's initiative to transfer most of the third-pillar provisions of the Prüm Treaty into European legislation."
"That will facilitate and strengthen cross-border cooperation among police authorities and will certainly facilitate one factor that is absolutely essential if we want to enhance security in the European area, and that is the exchange of information needed to prevent and suppress crime."
"This exercise is of course also based on the fact that the provisions of the treaty have been shown to be useful where they have already been applied."
"We have had the opportunity to read an interesting report supplied by the Presidency on how application of the Prüm Treaty between Germany and Austria has produced some positive and surprising results."
"It has led to the detection of serious criminal acts precisely because certain provisions of this treaty have been used."
"There is an important aspect to this: the application of the principle of availability - that is, the exchange of information, which promotes a flow of information - has to be accompanied by adequate protection of personal data."
"In the event of improper use, there need to be clear rules on prevention that can stop all that happening once and for all."
"In my view, it is vital that the Council's decision, already given by the Presidency, is confirmed, and I strongly hope it will be."
"I am confident that it can be adopted in Luxembourg next week."
"It contains a clear reference to personal data protection, because unfortunately we do not yet have a framework decision on data protection in this area."
"This Council decision transferring the articles of the Prüm Treaty into the European acquis therefore clearly has to deal with data protection, as a precondition for making the exchange of information compatible."
"A final aspect of the decision concerns periodical assessment."
"This will be an important assessment of both operational effectiveness - in other words, how this series of measures will work - and the operation of the safeguard clauses."
"The assessment will also be useful for Parliament, which will of course receive a copy of it."
"On the Visa Information System, I have to congratulate the rapporteur, Baroness Ludford, and the Presidency, and also commend them on their joint efforts to reach a good agreement."
"A good agreement may in any case be useful to ensure that both the security requirements demanded by many governments and the demands for personal data protection are met."
"These are non-negotiable rights for the European Union."
"In our consulates and at our border posts we will have better instruments that will work more effectively and will be made available to honest travellers, while they will also enable the police to detect serious infringements of the law."
"Data protection rules have been firmly incorporated into the VIS."
"These rules, including those on fingerprints, were absolutely crucial."
"Thanks to this agreement the Commission can now develop the technical application that will be needed, because, as you know, our aim is to have the VIS up and running by the spring of 2009 as planned."
"There is a specific requirement regarding the operational management of the system, which is that the operational management should be entrusted to a technical body, after an impact assessment has been carried out."
"This technical body may be proposed operationally within the first two years of operation of the VIS, either because of the economic implications that are yet to be assessed or because of the technical impact assessment that is to be performed."
"I can give you my personal assessment now: if there is going to be an operational management body, it should not be limited just to the VIS, but there should be a single operational body managing both SIS II and VIS together, so as to make the best use of the resources and its capacity for work."
"The third topic is the framework decision on data protection."
"Here again I must thank Mrs Roure for her report, which gives the Council some encouragement."
"I put forward the proposal way back in 2005; since then I have appealed to the ministers in Council on several occasions; and today we are getting close to a joint solution."
"On one aspect, I shall repeat my views, which are well known: I would have liked these data protection rules, which are under the third pillar, to apply to the Member States' internal legal systems and not just to cross-border exchanges of data and cross-border cooperation."
"I therefore agree with Mrs Roure's proposal that, no more than three years after the framework decision is adopted, we should re-examine the purpose and scope of these rules and therefore perhaps also the possibility of extending them to the countries' internal legal systems."
"Three years is a long enough time."
"Mrs Roure mentions an assessment, precisely the one that we are talking about, in order to harmonise the rules on data protection even more."
"One thing does not rule out the other: both can be done if we use the report which, three years after the system enters into force, should say whether the mechanism is working, where it can be improved and where further harmonisation is possible."
"We all ought to agree on one thing, which is the need to rule out any use of the data for purposes not specified in advance; in other words, personal data may be used for police and security purposes only if the categories of purposes for which the security authorities may use them have been set out first."
"That is a key principle, on which we should stand firm."
"A debate has yet to be held on the data protection supervisory authorities."
"Some very careful consideration will certainly be necessary, because the current authorities and the future European authority will have very different attributes, and so more thorough deliberation is probably needed."
"I have put forward an idea of 15 basic principles to help facilitate agreement."
"I am very pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council considers the exercise of examining the 15 basic principles that I have proposed to be useful."
"To conclude, we can make up for lost time, but on this topic we are a long way behind."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to make a few brief personal observations on the Prüm Initiative, which Parliament is debating and scrutinising today and tomorrow, and on which I was rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The Council's proposal, presented by Parliament three months ago in almost forensic detail, was debated and analysed with bewildering speed by the committee."
"To this end - with the constant and total commitment, skill and dedication of the Committee's secretariat - the idea of a public hearing was proposed, involving all public and private actors, in order to gain a suitable understanding of their concerns."
"This is a process that seeks to strike the right balance between the demands of effective police cooperation and the defence and promotion of fundamental rights."
"This exercise in reflection is extremely important given the nature of this proposal, which establishes mechanisms facilitating action on criminal matters and criminal investigations, but which is potentially damaging to the citizens' rights and freedoms, an aspect that cannot and must not be overlooked."
"As rapporteur dealing with an initiative of such importance and visibility, my main concerns were, accordingly, to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the demands of effective policing in the fight against the main threats to the very foundations of the EU, namely terrorism and crime, and, on the other, the protection of people's fundamental rights."
"Clearly, striking such a balance and transposing it into a text to be accepted by an overwhelming majority of MEPs represented in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who come from a range of political backgrounds, was no easy task, but was certainly a rewarding one."
"I honestly believe that the proposals to be put before this Chamber substantially improve upon the draft submitted by the Council."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the amendments we agreed on, which were the result of a broad consensus among the various groups represented in Parliament and of close collaboration between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, were adopted almost unanimously by the committee, with just one abstention."
"I now hope that they will receive a similarly positive response from this Chamber."
"Among the amendments that have been tabled, I should like to highlight the following amendments for their importance to the economy as distinct from what I feel should be subject to a formal framework decision: greater harmonisation of the conditions of access to biometric databases, ensuring that such access is limited to investigations, and, in the case of fingerprint data, to the prevention of serious criminal offences; clear definition of rules applying to joint operations; establishment of strict necessity criteria so that the transmission of personal data is legitimate, especially when it comes to the most delicate situations, major events and preventing terrorist attacks; extending the scope of the chapter on data protection to all forms of processing data, ensuring compliance with all recommendations put forward by the European data protection supervisor; implementation of a maximum period for keeping personal data; establishment of specific safeguards prohibiting the processing of sensitive data that may be used for the purpose of ethnic profiling; strengthening Parliament's role in following up the proposal for a decision, in particular when implementation and assessment measures are adopted; and lastly, clarification of the relationship between this proposal for a decision and the proposal for a framework decision on data protection under the third pillar, the latter always being a general regulatory framework in the matter, in any situation."
"Lastly, I should like to acknowledge the importance of integrating intervention mechanisms introduced by the Prüm Treaty - undeniably important mechanisms in the fight against terrorism and organised crime - into the EU's body of law."
"I must say, however, that I am worried about how the Council will vote on Parliament's opinion."
"I should like to conclude by saying that the adoption of the framework decision aimed at stepping up cross-border cooperation, in particular in the fight against terrorism and crime, will clearly lack democratic legitimacy if Parliament's role is either partially or totally ignored."
"That would do nothing to enhance the citizens' trust in the Union when it comes to the process of building the Community; in fact, it would have quite the opposite effect."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you will allow me, I would like to point out that a group of guests have been in the gallery, a group of men and women who are known in my country as 'war children'."
"They were children who, between 1936 and 1939, fled Spain, the fascist bombardments, who were evacuated and who found solidarity and care in families in Belgium and the United Kingdom."
"Today, with all of them over 75 years old, they have come to visit Parliament, to be amongst us, and it is very important and very moving for us to pay tribute to them and, in particular, to pay tribute to the solidarity of the British and Belgian people, who took them in and provided them with the families that they had been denied in their own country."
"Baltic Sea cod (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Zdzisław Kazimierz Chmielewski, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks - C6-0281/2006 -."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Chmielewski, and to both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the report."
"The objective is to have the proposal agreed at the June Council next week."
"During discussions held in the context of the Council preparations, many changes have been introduced to the original proposal, some of which go in the direction of your suggested amendments."
"As you are well aware, both cod stocks in the Baltics suffer from over-exploitation, with the eastern cod stock falling so far below safe biological limits that it may be in risk of collapse in the near future."
"At the same time, ICES has indicated that misreporting of catches occurs in 35 to 45% of cases in the eastern Baltic, which not only results in an additional unaccounted fishing impact on the stock but also affects the accuracy of scientific advice."
"The current situation not only harms the cod stocks in the Baltic but is also threatening the fishing sector reliant on this resource."
"Cod is one of the most important fish stocks for the industry in the Baltic."
"It is therefore crucial, not only from an ecological but also from a social and economic perspective, to bring fishing into balance with resource availability as soon as possible, so that fishers can once more count on stable and high catches."
"The multiannual plan presented by the Commission has been developed on the basis of past experience with managing cod fisheries in the Baltic and on several consultations held with stakeholders, Member States and scientists."
"It aims at rebuilding the stocks not only towards safe biological limits but even beyond, to levels that will provide the highest sustainable catches, thus providing stability in the long term for the fishing sector concerned, by reducing total allowable catches and fishing efforts step-by-step to the levels corresponding to this objective."
"Turning now to the report, the recitals of the plan correspond to the measures that are later outlined in the actual provisions."
"I can therefore only accept Amendments 1 and 5, which correspond to the provisions of the plan, such as the request to specify the status of the eastern cod stock in the first recital."
"Amendment 4 is acceptable in principle. However, the split into western and eastern parts is determined by scientific evidence that there are two separate cod stocks in the Baltic, and not by the ecological features of the two areas."
"The report proposes several amendments to the rules outlining the procedure for reducing total allowable catches and fishing effort to sustainable levels."
"Amendments 8 to 11 would result in a mitigation of the reduction process and would limit its application."
"In view of the serious situation of the stock and the need to limit all types of fisheries catching significant amounts of cod, I cannot accept these amendments."
"I am, however, aware of the need to define a system that the industry can deal with."
"The Commission has therefore changed its plan by combining the summer ban and the days absent from port."
"This will increase flexibility for the industry, and will thus particularly benefit small-scale fleets, for which a fixed and rigid system is more difficult to work with."
"Moreover, an article on the European Fisheries Fund has been included in the plan to ensure financial compensation for the industry."
"Changes to the effort system mean that several of the provisions on control and monitoring have also been changed."
"The margin of tolerance has been raised to 10%, except for cod, and the rules on discharging have been deleted, which should correspond to the provisions of Amendments 14 and 16 of the report."
"Concerning Amendment 15, the rules on entry and exit from the area have been changed as well, meaning that the specified requirements apply only where the vessel is leaving the area in which it has been fishing."
"As misreporting is presently one of the key problems in the management of the Baltic cod fishery, it is crucial to improve these rules to monitor comprehensively how much is taken from which cod stock, and when."
"For similar reasons, I cannot accept Amendment 13, which limits the requirement for a log book to vessels with a special permit for cod fishing."
"The report proposes to reduce the valuation period from three to two years and to introduce a provision on the monitoring of the socio-economic impact of the plan in Amendments 17 to 19."
"New cod recruits enter the fishery at the age of two to three years on average."
"If an evaluation began during the second year, it would be very difficult to detect any effects on the stock and, consequently, on the industry."
"The Commission is, however, planning a project that will monitor not only the ecological but also the socio-economic impact of the plan as a first step towards the impact assessment to be made in the third year of the application of the plan."
"Finally, I turn to the three amendments tabled by Mr Schlyter last week. They are not acceptable to the Commission for the following reasons."
"The objective of the basic regulation for the common fisheries policy is to ensure sustainable management in ecological, social and economic terms. It is therefore the Commission's responsibility to strive for a balance between these three pillars, albeit based primarily on scientific advice regarding the stocks."
"I thus consider a gradual reduction of TACs and fishing efforts until target levels are met, as advised by ICES, to be a good balance in this respect."
"ICES also recommended using relative targets such as fishing mortality instead of fixed ones such as biomass, because they are less sensitive towards scientific uncertainty and the environmental variations affecting the stock."
"In the current situation whereby a high level of misreporting is interfering with management and scientific advice and in view of the possible upcoming revision of the biomass reference points for the eastern stock, the inclusion of biomass targets is not appropriate."
"However, as an expected outcome of the plan is the improvement of the basis of scientific information, the inclusion of biomass reference levels could be considered in the course of the revision of the cod recovery plan, which is envisaged to take place after the plan has been in force for three years."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, the Council regulation which is the subject of this report is a long-awaited important legislative proposal, and constitutes an attempt to deal with the very considerable needs of the fisheries sector in one of the most significant bodies of European water."
"This in itself is good reason to congratulate those responsible for the report."
"They have tackled the difficult challenge of drafting a long-term programme for the regeneration and catches of Baltic cod."
"Cod is a fish that provides many families with their livelihood."
"It is the most important fish in the Baltic and therefore generates great interest amongst those involved in fisheries."
"Emotions are running high in the Baltic region concerning Parliament's opinion and subsequent Council rulings."
"A report referring to verified data taking scientific forecasts on the development of cod stocks and fishing possibilities as a content-related starting point represented an opportunity for achieving satisfactory compromises in these circumstances."
"It was essential for the Committee on Fisheries to intervene with regard to the Council's legislative proposal because it was necessary for the document to take account of the inevitable socio-economic consequences of the planned catch restrictions."
"I am glad the Commissioner mentioned this."
"One of the amendments adopted was tabled by the rapporteur and bound the European Commission to monitor these consequences and propose essential management measures to Parliament."
"Another amendment adopted involved reducing the restrictions on fishing days laid down in the regulation from 10% to 8% and increasing the so-called reporting limit from 100 kg to 300 kg."
"I am referring to the Committee on Fisheries."
"The Committee on Fisheries also adopted the suggestion made by the Council of Ministers regarding adjustment of the margin of error in fishing log book entries from 8% to 10%."
"The proposal on increasing the minimum size of cod caught in the Baltic to 40 cm was endorsed too."
"It is difficult to avoid the impression that report was strongly influenced by the view that the fishing capacity of the Baltic cod fleet is currently far too large in relation to the available fishing quotas."
"There is still no proposal for a systematic resolution of this problem at the level of the Union and the individual Member States."
"Stronger and stronger warnings are being voiced urging great caution with regard to automatic decisions on scrapping the fleet."
"It would be preferable to seek solutions allowing the fishing capacities defined to be retained until stocks are replenished."
"We shall obviously need something to fish with when that time comes."
"I believe that sooner or later the issue of the length of the summer bans will become part of the debate on the plan for rebuilding cod stocks."
"The Commissioner referred to the bans today."
"It should be noted that a tendency to favour so-called days absent from port rather than the bans used to date is gaining strength in those Member States seeking ways to further reduce the fishing effort by introducing additional days when fishing for cod is banned."
"The scientific advice accompanying the general discussion on the Council regulation has indicated the need to review the assessment of biological reference points used to date, and I am glad the Commissioner mentioned this today."
"It should be added that none of the Baltic countries queries the introduction of fishing mortality as a method of defining the achievable aims of the multiannual plan for rebuilding Baltic cod stocks."
"I refer to Article No 4 of the plan."
"It does seem essential, however, to launch an in-depth debate on the subject of appropriate values of biomass reference points adjusted to the actual state of the stocks and the current general situation of the Baltic Sea ecosystem."
"This will be in line with the Community's commitment to introducing the ecosystem approach to fisheries management."
"I refer to Recital No 5."
"I should emphasise that the biomass limit values currently in force were adopted in 1998 on the basis of data gathered in the 1960s and 1970s."
"They cannot therefore be appropriate to the current condition of stocks."
"In conclusion, it should be pointed out that the intention of the earlier Council Regulation 2371/2002 mentioned in the document dealt with in the opinion was to retain the precautionary principle in connection with the introduction of fundamental changes to the fisheries policy."
"The precaution applied to both management of the stocks and assessment of the socio-economic impact of the changes."
"This principle should remain in force following the accession of the four Baltic countries to the Union."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President."
"As the person in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety responsible for cod fishing, I wish to begin by complaining that so few of our views are included in the report on which we are to vote tomorrow."
"We have a shared responsibility for ensuring that it is possible to fish for cod in the Baltic Sea in the future too."
"The situation where cod is concerned is a serious one."
"In spite of reduced quotas, cod stocks are close to critical level."
"If we are to prevent stocks from collapsing completely, we need still stricter distributions of quotas."
"These quotas need to have a scientific foundation rather than be based on long drawn-out political wrangling, as the focus in fishing must in the first place be on the environment and on a long-term approach, not on short-term labour market policy objectives."
"I am only sorry that the Committee on Fisheries appears to think in precisely the opposite way."
"The Commission's proposal for reduced fishing quotas is a step in the right direction, but it will be of no help if we do not make sure that it is complied with, because the greatest among the many threats to cod is illegal fishing."
"It is said that between 35% and 45% of the total share of cod landed has been fished illegally."
"What is most important, therefore, is not new rules but guarantees that the existing rules are complied with."
"It is therefore incomprehensible to me why the Committee on Fisheries refuses to accept, for example, my demands that strong measures be taken against those countries that close their eyes to illegal fishing."
"What, moreover, is most terrible of all is that we know which countries they are."
"I am convinced, however, that, in the long term, we need an entirely new system for fisheries policy - one that makes fishermen themselves have a sense of responsibility for the survival of cod."
"One system that has shown itself to be effective is that involving individually transferable fishing quotas."
"Fishermen should be given an incentive of their own to take responsibility for the survival of the stock."
"I believe that, in that way, we can obtain a better fisheries policy in the EU."
"Annoying as it is that the Committee on Fisheries does not appear to want this system, it is gratifying that the Commission seems to take a positive view of the possibility of introducing individually transferable quotas."
"In conclusion, I would just point out one thing I do like about the report by the Committee on Fisheries, namely that it incorporates my proposal for an increase in the minimum size of the cod that is caught."
"This would give the fish more scope to reproduce and would make for more stable stocks."
"In common with my fellow Swedish Conservatives, I unfortunately cannot, however, vote in favour of the report before us today."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, against the backdrop of the decline in Baltic cod stocks identified in the ICES studies and of demands from the relevant fishing crews for operating conditions that will enable them to preserve their livelihood, I would like to commend the work of my honourable colleague, Mr Chmielewski."
"He has had to do the splits in order to reconcile the Commission's proposal and sustainable fisheries on the one side with the resolute demands of the fishermen on the other."
"If sustainability is to be more than an empty word, however, it must be reflected in working practices on fishing vessels and in personal attitudes to scientific prescriptions."
"Accepting catch quotas is one side of the coin."
"In particular, this means not only fulfilling the prescribed basic conditions but also supporting the new measures to improve stocks and more effective supervision by the Member States."
"Unfortunately, supervision is a weak point in some Member States."
"There is sufficient untapped potential in this area."
"The involvement of regional advisory bodies is not only helpful; it is also an urgent necessity."
"The proposal from the Commission therefore points in the right direction, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports both the proposal and the rapporteur's efforts to strike a fair socio-economic balance."
"I appeal to all those in positions of responsibility to take good heed of the information provided by ICES and other scientific bodies when fixing the total allowable catches and quotas for cod and devising measures to halt the decline in cod stocks."
"The Baltic is a sensitive sea, and we should bear that in mind whenever we consider any measure."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President."
"The situation for cod in the Baltic Sea is a very serious one."
"For 2007, the ICES has recommended that no cod be fished in the eastern part of the Baltic, yet in spite of these recommendations a considerable quantity of cod will be landed."
"Where western stocks are concerned, 30% more than the recommended number will be fished, and in addition there will be unreported and illegal fishing."
"The Committee on Fisheries is trying to water down the Commission's proposal, which basically does not consider the consequences for biological diversity, either."
"As always when fisheries issues are debated in this House, the socio-economic consequences of fishing are referred to."
"Certainly, a ban on fishing for cod may harm professional fishermen."
"However, overfishing means that, before long, there will be no fish left to catch."
"In the era of globalisation, it is necessary to be flexible and to be prepared to make structural changes in society."
"Tomorrow, I shall vote against Parliament's proposal, even though I believe that the Commission's proposal is unsatisfactory too."
"(SV) Mr President, I myself live on the Baltic Sea and have therefore been able to monitor at close quarters how bad things are there."
"The situation not only causes a deterioration in people's quality of life, but also, as Commissioner Joe Borg himself pointed out, threatens economic development along the whole of the Baltic Sea coast."
"People throughout the EU expect us, in this House, to make vigorous efforts to save the eco-systems in our seas."
"I should therefore ideally have liked to have seen the House support a ban on cod fishing, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in its opinion."
"A ban would also have made it simple to get to grips with the illegal fishing that quite a few Members have talked about."
"There is obviously no majority in favour of this in the House at present, but I nonetheless hope that a majority is able to support Amendments 20 to 22, one of the provisions of which is that the largest permitted catch shall be based on advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea."
"That really should go without saying."
"The fact that we do not act on the basis of existing scientific knowledge is one of the reasons for the current threats to cod and to the whole of the Baltic Sea's eco-system."
"(ET) The Baltic Sea is an inland sea and, thanks to its poor connection with the open seas and oceans, it is a very distinctive sea."
"The limited water exchange with the Atlantic Ocean unfortunately also means that the Baltic Sea is very vulnerable - the sea lacks the ability to dilute large quantities of pollution and, what is more, fish stocks recover very slowly there after overfishing."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we discussed at great length the topics of overfishing for cod and illegal fishing in the Baltic Sea."
"The committee agreed that cod fishing should be prohibited for some time in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea or that a zero fishing mortality rate should be established."
"The objective of this would be to permit cod stocks, which are in very bad condition, to recover, so that they might later be managed sustainably once again."
"I regret that the Committee on Fisheries has not taken that one key position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety into consideration in connection with managing the cod stocks of the Baltic Sea."
"It should also be in the long-term interests of fishermen to halt fishing at the moment, so that cod stocks, which are in a critical condition at the moment, might recover."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank you for the number of points that have been raised."
"I think it is clear that we share a common objective, that of ensuring the long-term sustainability of cod stocks in the Baltic and thus the livelihood of the fishers in the region."
"While we may differ on the means of achieving this objective, I have no doubt that our aim is the same."
"On the specific points raised, I would like to make the following points."
"Firstly, we must propose schemes for effort limitations and take into account the effort exerted by small-scale fleets since their catches represent around 50% of total catches."
"We are, however, ready to consider flexible mechanisms in order to enable them to apply the plan without it being too much of a burden."
"I would like to stress that the eastern cod stock has been declining continuously over the last decades, as has the average catch size."
"The serious situation of this stock is therefore self-evident and, while it is crucial to take account of the socio-economic perspective, it is primarily the ecological status which requires recovery, that is of paramount importance."
"In this regard, an annual reduction of 10% has been identified as the minimum in order to be able to detect changes in the development of the stock status or the sector deriving from the plan."
"A decrease of the annual reduction would also confront the sector with a longer reduction period and therefore delay the benefit of bigger and more stable catches and would make it unlikely that the MSY levels can be reached before 2015, as is required under the Johannesburg Commitment."
"Finally, it is important to underline that control is the key issue, particularly in this fishery."
"We hope to reach a solid and workable solution to this issue in the Council next week."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Specific rules as regards the fruit and vegetable sector (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the report by Mrs Salinas García on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific rules as regards the fruit and vegetable sector and amending certain Regulations. C6-0075/2007."
"Mr President, we are currently in the final and decisive phase for the approval of the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector."
"We launched the debate on 24 January 2007 and since then we have received lots of very valuable input, not least from the European Parliament and the report of Mrs Salinas García."
"I thank you for this and for your constant support for the general objectives and the general principles of the Commission proposal."
"When considering the substance of your opinion, I have chosen to focus on a few issues to which you have given very special attention."
"Firstly, on producer organisations, it is clear that both the Commission and the European Parliament believe that producer organisations should be maintained and even further reinforced in order to increase the degree of the concentration of the supply."
"This is absolutely fundamental if the sector is to match the huge concentration that we see these days in the retail sector."
"As you know, we have proposed a number of new initiatives in order to make our producer organisations much more attractive."
"We have proposed additional Community financing of 60%: firstly, for mergers between producer organisations and associations of producer organisations; secondly, for regions where the level of the concentration of the supply through producer organisations is below 20%; thirdly for organic farming; fourthly for new Member States and, finally, for the outermost regions."
"I am aware that you have requested even more action to be included in the additional Community financial assistance of 60% to the operational funds, such as joint action between producer organisations or integrated production."
"However, what we have proposed will already make a very positive difference."
"I should like to stick to these measures in the first place."
"As you surely know, we also need to be attentive to the budgetary constraints."
"On crisis prevention and management, I agree with you that it is one of the most sensitive points of the reform and I should like to thank you for the ideas that you propose in your opinion."
"However, I cannot accept the idea of a separate fund for crisis management and the need to define what we actually mean when we talk about a 'crisis'."
"A separate fund would result in a substantial budget increase and, moreover, will not contribute to further simplification."
"With regard to the use of a percentage of the national reserve for crisis management, this is not acceptable either."
"The national reserve was created at the very beginning to accommodate particular situations in the framework of the single payment scheme and it is not appropriate to devote this budget to another objective or other measures."
"However, I understand your call for more flexibility in order to facilitate crisis management."
"Rather than making a completely separate structure, I should therefore positively consider adding more flexibility to the structure proposed in our initial Commission proposal in order to make the scheme as efficient as possible and to avoid a major decline in prices."
"Nevertheless, I want to underline that we also need to bear in mind that any modification of the current proposal has to respect the overall budgetary constraints, as well as the need for simplification."
"On the inclusion of fruit and vegetables for processing in the single payment scheme, you have requested an optional transitional period, in particular for tomatoes."
"You are also in favour of a separate payment for tomatoes for historical producers in the new Member States."
"I am open to accept a short transitional period in which Member States could decide to grant aid per hectare."
"Nevertheless, one should bear in mind that full decoupling must be both the precondition and the end goal - so final decoupling at the end."
"I am also aware that the soft-fruit sector is facing difficulties."
"The Commission analysis has shown that fragmentation of both production and marketing has contributed to the difficulties faced in recent years by the soft-fruit sector."
"On the basis of this report we have considered that the best way to address the problem is to add incentives to increase the number of producer organisations in the new Member States, which is what we did in our original proposal."
"Nevertheless, taking into account the sensitivities of this soft-fruit sector, I am open to considering specific smaller support, but I want to make it absolutely clear that it must be transitional and limited to certain products."
"Finally, on promotion of fruit and vegetables, I fully agree with you that this issue is of huge concern not only to agriculture but also to health and to consumer policies."
"We produce plenty of high-quality fruit and vegetables in the European Union, but our citizens do not consume enough of them, with growing consequences for their health."
"I would be in favour of a school fruit scheme to be implemented in line with the position taken by the Commission on 13 May 2007 in the White Paper on a strategy for Europe on nutrition, weight and obesity-related health issues."
"However, before doing this we would need to carry out the necessary impact assessments of such a measure."
"I have asked my services to undertake such work immediately."
"Those are my first comments and I am looking forward to a constructive discussion with the honourable Members of the European Parliament."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking you, not just for being here, but also for your cooperation and willingness to work with me."
"The truth is that we are dealing with the reform of a very important sector, which you know very well."
"It represents 17% of our end agricultural output, but it only receives about 3% of the aid."
"It is true that the sector that we are discussing today is very dynamic."
"It is also, however, a very fragile sector, with structural problems, exposed to increasing external pressure and the pressure of large-scale distribution."
"The report that we are debating today and that we will vote on tomorrow is the result of a long period of work."
"It is an open report, and I believe that this Parliament's position has always been open with regard to the Commission."
"We have always sought agreements, but at the same time it is a realistic report."
"It is complicated, because we are dealing with forty different products for twenty-seven countries."
"It is no surprise that it received more than 380 amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but it is also the case that there were only two votes against it."
"Not everything in your proposal, in the Commission's proposal, seems to us to be negative, by any means."
"It is very important that producer organisations should be seen as the cornerstone of the reform from the outset."
"The truth is, however, that in Parliament, and in the whole of the European Union's sector, there are certain problems that, in all of the Member States, we have seen as priorities within the reform."
"Firstly, the decoupling of aid for processed products, as the Commissioner has quite rightly pointed out."
"The second problem is the lifting of the ban on growing fruit and vegetables in areas eligible for the single payment."
"And, above all, we in Parliament would stress the lack of a genuine crisis management mechanism."
"I believe that the European Parliament has made a great effort to achieve consensus with a view to reaching agreements on these three issues."
"Firstly, we are in favour of maintaining the current marketing rules."
"It is true that they should be rather simpler, but we are in favour of maintaining those marketing rules."
"Parliament has expressed, and will express tomorrow, its opposition to the lifting of the ban on growing fruit and vegetables in eligible areas."
"At least until the Commission presents an impact study, as demanded by the Court of Justice."
"We are calling for the strengthening of producer organisations, in the way that has already been mentioned: increasing their funding to 6%."
"And in cases of the 60% increase in assistance, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, I hope that certain requests will be taken into account, such as integrated production or designations of origin."
"Where we have achieved a great compromise, because it is very important, because it is a fragile sector, is on the need to create the Security Fund for crisis management."
"Having heard what you have said, I believe that, right now, this is where Parliament's almost unanimous position differs most from that of the Commission."
"We have expressed our support, and we continue to do so, for a crisis Security Fund that is open to all producers - including non-associated producers - and two-thirds funded by the European Union and a third by producer organisations."
"We also stress the need for a price observatory."
"Our future in this sector does not lie in subsidies, but in the market."
"And we must have reliable and up-to-date information on the evolution of the markets."
"Finally, decoupling, I am delighted to hear that there is at last a glimpse of the possibility of a transitional period."
"There are certain dual-use products, such as tomatoes and citrus fruits, which, under the initial proposal, could lead to the abandonment of production."
"We therefore firmly advocate a transitional period, and let us hope that it is not as short as has been suggested here this evening, but sufficient for the sector to be able to continue adapting to the single payment scheme."
"I hope that that voluntary transitional period can allow for some kind of partial decoupling that could be a transitional measure."
"We also stress the need to strengthen aid for red fruits."
"I am also delighted to hear what you have said, because I believe that this is clearly a need that Parliament has indicated and the Commission has considered."
"I would like to end by thanking everybody who has helped me during this year of work, the shadow rapporteurs and all of the officials from the European Commission for their contributions, for cooperating with me, the committee secretariat and everybody, because I believe that the report that we will vote on tomorrow, which is the result of a broad consensus, has also been enriched by the contributions of the other groups and of the whole of society."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Ladies and gentlemen, today, the fruit and vegetable sector is one of the most dynamic sectors of European agriculture, thanks in particular to the efforts of the farmers, the producers, to improve the marketing networks and to increase the quality of their products and concentrate supply."
"In no way can it be argued that the fruit and vegetable sector relies on aid from Brussels."
"In fact it succeeds in a very aggressive market, owing to the fact that the people participating in it work hard, and the money they receive represents no more than 1% of the turnover of farms."
"The great majority of these producers are not currently asking for subsidies or early retirement aid."
"What they are asking for and demanding are mechanisms for tackling the current problems, which can only get even worse in the future."
"I hope you will allow me to remind you all that the fruit and vegetable sector is the great bargaining chip in the European Union's agricultural negotiations within the World Trade Organisation."
"In the future, the current pressures in the market will get worse as the existing tariff barriers are dismantled."
"I would therefore like to call upon the Member States to draw up appropriate crisis management mechanisms within the context of the reform of the sector that will probably be adopted next week at the Council of Agriculture Ministers."
"As the rapporteur has already said, and as many of you also know and acknowledge, crisis management is a fashionable topic and it will be important in the future for all of the sectors of the common agricultural policy as a result of the dismantling of intervention measures."
"In the case of fruit and vegetables, however, this problem also needs to be resolved urgently in view of the strong competition from third-country imports and the pressures resulting from large-scale distribution."
"An imaginative solution needs to be found to help the sector to deal with the critical times ahead, and this Parliament is offering the solution in the report by Mrs Salinas."
"This involves a specific fund for serious crises intended for the implementation of certain actions such as pension funds and to which the whole of the sector would have access. This would represent a very positive step, bearing in mind that we are not deviating from what we have done until now, which is co-responsibility for the producer."
"I believe that, for the fruit and vegetables sector, this report proposes a pioneering form of crisis management that other sectors will have to copy in the future."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables is one of the last to be undertaken."
"It has still not been covered by the 2003 reform."
"It is also one of the most significant market reforms in the current Financial Perspective."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Salinas García on a very objective report, which covers many issues of importance for both old and new Member States."
"As my colleague has already dealt with all the points we wished to make in the House, I shall refer only to the soft fruit sector, which is of vital importance for the new Member States."
"The reform must include effective solutions for this sector, bearing in mind the need to ensure that growing this fruit in the Community will remain profitable and that Community growers can obtain a suitable level of income from it."
"Soft fruit is a delicate product and should be dealt with in the same way as other Community products considered delicate."
"It is essential to apply different payments to the soft fruit sector beyond the SAPS financial envelope."
"Such a payment would be directed exclusively to soft fruit producers."
"Support in the form of separate area payments would lead to restructuring and improve the effectiveness and competitiveness of this sector."
"It would therefore stabilise the income of soft fruit growers."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur."
"I admire her for the way she has fought her way through the many amendments that have been tabled."
"We as the ALDE Group support the result as a whole, and hence the gist of the Commission proposals."
"Making producer organisations stronger is a good thing."
"The market of horticultural products is increasingly being dominated by large supermarkets and other trade organisations, and producers must combine forces in order to form a counterweight."
"Most of the ALDE Group would beg to differ with the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the already much-debated crisis fund and crisis management in general."
"We think the Commission proposals are better."
"For starters, I would not know where the money would come from."
"Also in the long term, it is impossible to assume that any authority could be responsible for crisis management."
"The authority will always make a contribution - this has been provided for - but the producers will need to shoulder the lion's share of the responsibility."
"If, moreover, we encourage crisis management to be taken care of via the producer organisation, this will also draw in more members, which will at the same time mean that producer organisations will gain more power compared to traders and supermarkets."
"Our vote will therefore be different from what the Committee on Agriculture proposed in this respect."
"I should once again like to stand up for quality policy."
"The Commissioner knows that this is a subject that is very close to my heart."
"After the last conference on this subject, I left in a frame of mind that was anything but optimistic, but I am heartened by the fact that an amendment concerning the need for a quality label for horticultural products, tabled by the ALDE Group, was adopted unanimously in the Agricultural Group by all parties."
"This is quite unique."
"With this support from the Committee on Agriculture, the Commissioner may therefore want to reconsider a quality policy for certain agricultural products, because we still believe that this is called for."
"I am unaware of the latest developments as regards school fruit, but we thought the Commissioner's idea in this respect was endearing."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, this reform is justified but it is unfair."
"The principles laid down five years ago at Copenhagen are unfair to the new Member States."
"It was established that farmers in the new countries would receive several times less aid than those in the old Union."
"We agreed to this hoping that we would come to receive equal treatment in due course."
"Subsequent reforms of the common agricultural policy have perpetuated the division into more and less favoured countries, however."
"The reform of the fruit and vegetable market is one example of this."
"The old Union was receiving hundreds of millions of euro and will continue to do so."
"The new Union receives token sums."
"Allow me to pose the following questions: where is the actual aid for soft fruit producers in the new Member States to be found?"
"Why has the Commission not responded to the European Parliament resolution of October 2006?"
"Much has been said about supporting the European Constitution and the danger that failure to do so will lead to the emergence of a two-speed Europe."
"In fact, as far as agriculture is concerned we already have a two-class Europe, namely the more favoured old Union that retains the status it created for itself in the past and the less favoured new Union that cannot expect equal treatment."
"We tabled an amendment that would include cherries and apples for processing in the reform of soft fruit production, accompanied by a EUR 148 million increase in the national envelopes."
"I call on the House to support this amendment."
"At the level of the Union as a whole, it does not represent much money. It is a matter of principle, however, not of money."
"There must be an end to this division into better and worse Member States."
"We respect the Accession Treaties, but new principles must be introduced, transcending the division into 15 more favoured Member States and 12 less favoured ones."
"All 27 Member States must enjoy the same rights."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group, bringing together members from both old and new Member States, is resolute in its demand for this."
"We call for a reform that is not only justified but also fair."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I in turn must especially thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur of the report that we are about to examine in this Chamber, but my group is unlikely to vote for it because of two points that I should like to highlight."
"The first is that this reform, which is so important for a sector that employs thousands, if not millions, of workers in both agriculture and processing, may change the landscape completely once we have directives on climate change."
"If it is true that Europe is rightly starting to expand alternative forms of production - biodiesel, biofuels, and the production of mass and biomass from wood - then it means that several million hectares will be taken out of agricultural and food production for human and animal consumption."
"That is already happening in large countries like China: it was in the news a few days ago."
"The second point is the fact that the reform in question does not address one of the problems raised in this Chamber, which is that in recent years the profit from agricultural production has all gone to commercial businesses and large multinationals."
"According to some statistics, between 60% and 70% of agricultural profit is kept by the distribution chain."
"The reform we are examining does not address this problem."
"Those are the basic reasons that we want to raise, and we are therefore unlikely to vote for the report in this Chamber tomorrow."
"(SK) I would like to praise the efforts of my colleague, Mrs García, in drawing up her report into the proposal for a Council regulation for establishing specific provisions in respect of the fruit and vegetable sector."
"The heated debates within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development about this proposal identified certain risks associated with the substance of the proposal and, in particular, risks arising from the philosophy behind this piece of legislation."
"The most serious risks concern the early practical implementation of some of the regulations and the low level of EU budget participation."
"At stake is a mere 3.1% of the budget, while the sector accounts for 17% of the EU's total agricultural output."
"In marketing terms, lettuce, radishes and small fruits - virtually the entire fruits and vegetables mix - are the most sensitive of agricultural commodities, and ensuring their smooth transfer from the farm to the table is a daunting logistical task."
"Therefore, the European Commission should not delude itself into thinking that in future it might be able to transfer to farmers the entire responsibility for fruit and vegetable CMO."
"Another major risk of the proposal under consideration is the fact that it puts the new Member States at a disadvantage."
"The problem is that the new Member States do not have functioning producer organisations, and it will take several years for them to become fully operational."
"Fruit and vegetable producers in the EU-15 have over the decades gradually learned to interact with trading systems and have become trading partners of equal standing."
"One can reasonably expect that if the proposal were implemented in its present form, the output of the new Member States, already massively reduced, would shrink still further."
"This is why I believe that the outlined risks should be addressed as a matter of priority when amending the proposal."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me add my thanks to the rapporteur, for the reform of the fruit and vegetable sector was truly not an easy subject."
"As the previous speakers have pointed out, fruit and vegetables account for a very large share of our agricultural output."
"These reforms will enable us to take a major step towards the modernisation of European agriculture in this sector too."
"Particularly in view of the increasingly fierce international competition resulting from globalisation, it must be our prime objective to enhance the competitiveness of European fruit and vegetable growers while safeguarding the availability to consumers of high-quality European produce at reasonable prices."
"One means of doing this is the creation of producer organisations, which enable growers to market their products more effectively."
"Measures to promote fruit and vegetable consumption are particularly worthy of support, because they are also beneficial to public health."
"Mrs Gräßle of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will table an oral amendment tomorrow in which she will ask the Commission not to wait until the scheduled date of 2013 before compiling an initial report on the execution of the title covering producer organisations, the operating fund and the operational programmes."
"In fact, we want to have that first report by the end of 2010, followed by progress reports at three-yearly intervals."
"We seek transparency, and we would also like to be sure that support is actually reaching our intended targets."
"Seven years is too long to wait for that assurance."
"It is therefore our responsibility to safeguard the future of Europe's fruit and vegetable growers by creating a safety net with the aid of targeted assistance in order to combine sustainable production with high quality and a healthy environment."
"(EL) Mr President, first I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Salinas Garcia, on her exceptional report, and the Commission, which truly has made a serious and brave proposal in the fruit and vegetable sector."
"I say 'brave proposal', because it is a sector which has a clear structure with the producer organisations and operational programmes and the main issue raised is that of decoupling."
"I should like to highlight, both at a personal level and on behalf of our group, the two basic issues which we shall support."
"Firstly, a stable financial budget and, secondly, a stable timeframe for reform up to 2013."
"Subversive policies seeking a transitional reform period in fruit and vegetables, which is something which has not happened in any other product, will I am absolutely certain - from the point of view of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - not be accepted."
"I have just two comments: you know very well, Commissioner, that Mrs Salinas's proposals are not a very far cry from the Council's proposals and I shall come to the specific issue of the crisis management fund, which I would like you to think about much more positively."
"The crisis management fund does not need additional resources, but it does need to be outside the operational programmes, otherwise there will be total confusion."
"(LT) It is understood that reform of the common agricultural policy is essential; however, implementation of the reform is being applied to EU Member States with different levels of agricultural subsidies."
"New Member States, which get almost three times less in payouts than the old Member States, and having significantly worse exit situations, are obliged to reform their agriculture by further worsening the state of it."
"A general payout scheme is being offered as a proposed solution for reform of the fruit and vegetable market."
"For the new Member States this will mean even smaller subsidies than there have been to date, and even less chance of competing in the market."
"The requirement for fruit and vegetable producers to establish producer organisations in order to receive EU subsidies seriously distorts the fruit and vegetable market."
"Retail networks may dictate their terms and refuse to accept for resale the produce of small producers."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that the regulation proposes to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables by encouraging their use among certain sectors of the population - young people, school-age children and teenagers."
"What about the rest of the population?"
"(PL) Mr President, some appropriate action has at last been taken with regard to the situation in the fruit and vegetable sector, which is generally perceived to be unfair."
"Following lengthy discussions, an anti-dumping price for Chinese strawberries was introduced."
"It was unfortunate that it only applied to such a short period of time though."
"Next, a minimum price was introduced."
"Again, it is unfortunate that this price was so low."
"We are now presented with an opportunity to allocate additional payments to cherries and sweet cherries, and also to soft fruit such as raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrants and gooseberries."
"Without these payments many growers affected by the severe frosts will most certainly be bankrupted."
"In its Amendment 116 to the regulation the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development suggests aid amounting to EUR 120.77 per hectare."
"In my view this is too low a figure."
"It will not deal effectively with the growers' problems."
"Aid should be increased to EUR 400 per hectare."
"Apple orchard owners were affected by the severe frosts too."
"Their predicament is also a difficult one, and they are hoping for some aid."
"That is why I urge the House to adopt Amendment 113, which constitutes a response to all those hoping for aid."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted that you are here and I thank you for the efforts you are making."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a job very well done."
"The fruit and vegetable sector is extremely important for us."
"However, I should like to highlight certain points:"
"Firstly, in a sector such as the fruit and vegetable sector, which includes the most sensitive agricultural products, financing crisis management is extremely important."
"If it is to be integrated, it should not be included in the operational programmes and be cofinanced by producers; it should be financed from additional Community resources and be extended to the field of prevention, as I also requested as shadow rapporteur when we debated future support measures for agricultural production eighteen months ago."
"Secondly, the obligatory inclusion of agri-environmental actions in the operational programmes of producer organisations, as a precondition to their approval, is a positive move."
"However, setting compulsory expenditure at one-fifth of the budget for the actions is excessive and should be reduced."
"Thirdly, we should at some point perhaps turn our attention to small crops, to small-scale producers, such as those growing saffron and mastic in Chios."
"We must also look at small-scale producers."
"Fourthly, for producer organisations, financing at a rate of 60% in under-organised areas is positive, but capping at 4.1% of the value of the marketed production is marginal and will not allow them to honour the new, important duties they are taking on."
"On the same subject, we should also refer to the difficulties faced by the Aegean islands, which is why they need to be treated with a certain degree of flexibility."
"Fifthly, information and promotion campaigns aimed at our youth in the European Union are not just to increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables; we have a very poor diet and our youth must adopt a healthier diet."
"Finally, I have the following to say: I should like to point out that we are totally against the oral amendment which may be tabled tomorrow calling for a report to be drafted in 2010 on the operation of the new COM, because this means a different approach to fruit and vegetables, while the other COMs have been regulated quite differently."
"This is unacceptable under the principles of the European Union."
"(HU) The excellent report by Mrs Salinas García indicates that this is fundamentally a good report."
"I will mention four positive points: the national envelope system, support for producer organisations, risk management and the school fruit scheme."
"This would be a very good reform if I did not come from one of the new Member States."
"But this reform is discriminatory in several areas against the new Member States."
"On the one hand it is discriminatory as regards direct payments."
"For example, Hungary provides 2% of the Union's vegetable production, and receives 0.61% of the costs of vegetable production."
"The other area of discrimination has to do with processed products."
"Neither Polish berry fruit, nor sour cherries, nor the products of the new Member States have been included among the produce that is to be processed."
"And now these monies will be distributed on a historical basis, and it will be primarily three of the old Member States who will receive 800 million of the 1.4 billion."
"This is a very great injustice toward the new Member States, and I ask that it be rectified."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Salinas García's report is very significant for the agricultural production sector. Unfortunately, however, it does not apply equal terms to producers in the old and new Member States."
"Supporting farmers by way of direct payments is particularly important for countries where the structure of agriculture is fragmented, with small holdings and monoculture, and where the income barely suffices to sustain farming activities."
"These holdings operate in a traditional and environmentally-friendly manner."
"The amended regulation should even out the opportunities for payments to farmers in the old and new Member States."
"It is hard to anticipate the effectiveness of fruit and vegetable production."
"Products of this nature can easily be damaged, prices fluctuate and there is competition from third countries."
"Climate change and increasingly frequent natural disasters also impact on effectiveness."
"By way of example I could refer to the spring frosts in Poland which affected 70% of currant, plum, pear and sweet cherry blossom."
"Polish fruit growers and market gardeners estimate that this year's losses will amount to 60%."
"Amendments 6, 7 and 12 to the regulation concerning Recitals 11, 13 and 18 and also Amendment 113 are particularly worthy of support."
"(PL) Mr President, today's debate on the report concerning reform of the fruit and vegetable market and tomorrow's vote on the matter bring to an end several months of work within the European Parliament."
"I believe that during this period we have succeeded in raising awareness of the problems affecting the Polish soft fruit market and convincing most Members of the House of the need to introduce appropriate support mechanisms."
"Such mechanisms would serve to restructure the sector and improve its competitiveness."
"Two features of this sector in the new Member States are the fragmentation of production and the fact that there are no strong groups or associations of producers."
"In addition, the sector is particularly vulnerable at times of crisis."
"The existing support instruments and those proposed in the draft reform of the COM of fruit and vegetables do not provide sufficient aid and do not offer effective solutions to the problems arising in those markets."
"We are therefore requesting special payments for growers of soft fruit and cherries intended for processing, so as to improve incomes and stabilise the fruit and vegetable market."
"I urge the Commissioner to study Amendment 132, which I tabled jointly with Mrs Herranz García on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I also ask for support for Amendment 122, on aid for the market of tomatoes for processing in the new Member States under the SAPS system."
"Adoption of this amendment would ensure that tomato producers in those countries retained the aid they are currently receiving."
"Commissioner, there are two issues Polish soft fruit growers cannot understand."
"The first is why they have to wait so long for relevant proposals."
"The second is why the Commission cannot even come up with a few tens of millions euro to support the soft fruit sector, when it has an annual budget in excess of EUR 1.5 billion."
"Strawberries, raspberries and currants are just as important for Polish farmers as oranges, mandarins and figs are for their opposite numbers in southern Europe."
"Commissioner, we earnestly hope that at the forthcoming Council of Agriculture Ministers of the 27 Member States of the European Union you will propose appropriate support for this group of farmers."
"I trust the negotiations will prove fruitful."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the support given by Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to the proposals contained in the Salinas García report is proof of, firstly, the rapporteur's excellent work - and I add my own congratulations - and, secondly the very positive spirit of compromise displayed by MEPs from almost all of the political groups."
"I particularly welcome Parliament's recommendations on crisis management and on strengthening producer organisations."
"I welcome the adoption of my proposal to establish a transitional period aimed at ensuring the continued viability of tomato cultivation in some Member States, in particular my country, Portugal."
"I hope the Commission will take this on board."
"I am disappointed, however, that it was not possible to go further on other equally important issues, such as greater flexibility in the management of financial resources earmarked for operational programmes and positive discrimination, which should have been given to the Member States in which those programmes are particularly poorly organised."
"Your speech at the start of this debate, Commissioner, made me fear that the aspect of Parliament's political support for the proposals has not been correctly interpreted, but I trust that common sense and a spirit of compromise will ultimately prevail in the Council and the Commission."
"- (PL) Mr President, the fruit and vegetable sector is very important for the agriculture of the Union in general and of countries like Poland in particular."
"Unfortunately, the proposed solutions are not beneficial for us."
"Firstly, as part of the significant changes to be introduced in this sector, it is proposed that the existing support for the old Member State be maintained, but the new ones are to be treated as if they were not actually Members, but still mere applicants."
"Supporting the national envelopes of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain with sums of between EUR 316 million and EUR 167 million, whilst Poland's envelope is to be increased by barely EUR 6.7 million even though it has a large fruit and vegetable sector must surely run counter to the principle of European solidarity."
"Secondly, there is no tradition of producers' groups in the new Member States."
"This is bound to mean that a sum of almost EUR 700 million a year will go mainly to producers' groups and associations in the old Member States."
"Finally, the reform fails to deal with the issue of the Union's market becoming increasingly open to imports of fruit and vegetables from third countries."
"The European Union has an annual trade deficit in excess of EUR 8 billion in this sector."
"These imports are often sold at dumping prices, which is detrimental to the production of fruit and vegetables within the European Union."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report."
"From my point of view there are still some outstanding issues to be clarified."
"We must be able to ensure that the impact within different regions in Member States is not too harsh."
"The mechanism of this proposal is complicated for those regions that applied the hybrid area-based model for the single farm payment, including my own area, and this, in particular, must be resolved."
"This is a difficult, complex area that must be addressed."
"There are many different outside pressures that impinge on the marketing process."
"High among those is the purchasing power of the large supermarket chains, where one supplier or producer is put against another to drive the price down."
"There are also those who import cheap produce, turn it around and add value to produce of unknown origin."
"We seem to be unable to stop this."
"I am now going to be rather parochial."
"Last week I led a delegation to my local minister in Northern Ireland to raise the plight of mushroom growers in that area."
"Four years ago in Northern Ireland we had over 226 mushroom growers, today we have 40 - an 80% drop in those involved in the industry."
"I have to ask whether anyone cares, and I have come to the conclusion that the answer is no."
"Farming families have been destroyed and their incomes done away with."
"They have been totally disregarded by those capable of importing cheap mushrooms, adding value and selling them to the supermarkets, which pretend that they are local."
"If we stand back and allow such a situation to continue in this and other areas, we will totally destroy the fabric of rural society as we know it."
"These commodities keep families and communities together."
"We destroy them at our peril; we must defend rural society."
"Mr President, my thanks to the rapporteur."
"My colleague Mr Nicholson has not exactly stolen my thunder, but I want to repeat some of his thunder, and the Commissioner will know that I am like a long playing record."
"I support the idea of producer groups but I am not at all convinced that we will ever have the matching power of the retail sector."
"I have said it before and I repeat it now that the Commission is unwilling to take on the elephant in the room, i.e. the very powerful retail sector in Europe which is particularly powerful in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland."
"After you launched your debate on this particular subject we had farmers in Ireland on television declaring that they would no longer grow fruit and vegetables because there was no profit to be made in it because they could not get the prices they needed."
"However, let us see what happens from this reform."
"I hope that this report which we propose for 2010 will look at the impact in terms of the balance of power, which currently lies in the wrong direction."
"The idea of consumption and health is a very positive one but I think every time we tell the European public that it is healthy to eat fruit and vegetables they seem to eat less of them, so we need to think of a different message."
"I like the idea of school fruit schemes and I would ask that your impact assessment take into account the many pilot projects."
"There is one in particular in Ireland that works and you probably have details of it, but good luck with it and I hope it works for the fruit and vegetable producers of Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to conclude quickly, because it is late."
"I would like to stress again the very constructive cooperation that we have had on the food and vegetable reform."
"I think your opinion supports the general line of the Commission proposals and the improvements that are being contemplated."
"I would like to make a few comments because I am sure that some Members of this Parliament did not listen to my first speech, when I talked about the soft fruit sector."
"I made it clear that I am aware of the difficulties in the soft fruit sector within the European Union."
"I am ready to take into account the sensitivity of the sector and to try to find money within the budget to support this sector for a transitional period."
"But do not expect the figures that you mentioned."
"I think you said EUR 800."
"This cannot be achieved within the budget."
"However, I have clearly said that I will do my very best to find a solution."
"I believe that the anti-dumping measures taken in April have clearly been a step in the right direction."
"Problems faced due to frost will be handled separately."
"It is possible to deal with specific situations involving climatic catastrophes within the state aid rules, so we will try to handle this issue separately."
"A question was raised on funding."
"In my opinion, trying to create a fund outside the producer organisations is not really simplification."
"As you know, simplification is very high on the Commission's agenda."
"It will be a very complex instrument and we have to take into account the fact that we have to act within an annual budget."
"We could lose quite a lot of money on the fund's construction because it is multi-annual, but I am sure that we will find a decent solution and a crisis management tool that can work efficiently."
"I hope that it will be possible to achieve a political agreement at the Council meeting next Monday and Tuesday."
"I am quite sure that we will manage to find a political agreement that will benefit the whole fruit and vegetable sector within the European Union, so that it will have a sustainable future, which, I presume, is what we all want."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) It is now three years since the new Member States acceded to the European Union, but they are still being discriminated against in terms of budget appropriations for the fruit and vegetable market."
"This is clear from the size of the payments allocated per hectare of land devoted to growing fruit and vegetables."
"In 2005, the old Member States (EU-15) received EUR 561 per hectare, whilst the new ones (EU-10) only received EUR 20 per hectare."
"The poorer countries therefore receive 28 times less support than the richer ones."
"There is no reason for such discrimination."
"The new Member States have introduced many important and specific products into the Union."
"At the same time they experienced and are continuing to experience problems regarding the profitability of these types of products."
"Amongst other reasons, the problems are due to cheap imports from third countries and the fragmentation of production."
"The new countries therefore had good reason to expect that their difficulties would be recognised and that they would be able to benefit from the same wide range of support as the old Member States."
"The European Commission has conducted missions and undertaken a series of consultations and studies."
"Nonetheless, the Commission's proposal for reform of the market still discriminates against the new Member States."
"The Commission has also disregarded Parliament."
"In its resolution of 11 May 2005 this House called for Union support for soft fruit, cherries, sweet cherries and apples intended for processing to be provided at the earliest opportunity."
"Discriminatory action against the new Member States on the fruit and vegetable market is detrimental not only to growers in the new Member States, but also to the Union as a whole and to its consumers."

"rapporteur. - (PT) Just three brief remarks if I may: a thank-you, a warning and a point of information."
"I should like to thank all those MEPs from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and all the political groups, whose goodwill enabled this report to be adopted quickly."
"I should like, too, to thank the Portuguese Government - and in particular Secretary of State José Magalhães - for taking the initiative and putting forward this system whereby new Member States that fulfil the Schengen assessment criteria do not have to remain unjustly suspended and can join the system immediately."
"Secondly, speaking on behalf of Parliament as its rapporteur, I would like to sound a warning to the Council and the Commission."
"In our opinion, this transitional measure must never be allowed to hinder the rapid conclusion of SIS II, which must not be delayed and must remain a priority in view of the value-added and important innovation it encompasses for our collective security."
"Third and lastly, a point of information."
"I should like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the need to exert pressure on the Member States."
"Each Member State is responsible for getting ready to enter the system and to remove internal borders."
"Entering the Schengen system means that we have mutual trust when it comes to monitoring our external borders."
"During this Schengen assessment process there is no place for political agreements between governments to water down criteria and requirements."
"This is not an exercise in sympathy."
"This is about our shared security, and the security of Europe's citizens is not something to be dealt with lightly."

"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I would like to make a point of order based on Rules 166 and 167 on the admissibility of part of a resolution."
"Parliament's Legal Service has said that we cannot use a non-ratified Treaty as a reference in our reports."
"This applies to the first indent of the Barón Crespo/Brok report."
"(Applause from the IND/DEM Group)"
"I would like you to delete the reference, if the House should be so unwise as not to adopt our alternative resolution, which could solve the problem of inadmissibility much more easily."
"May I also ask you to change all other reports referring to the proposed Constitution or the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"According to Eurolex, 117 adopted legislative acts now include such references to the Charter."
"There are seven references to the Constitution."
"This information comes from Commission President Barroso, in an answer to a written question."
"Mr President, I am sure that you and Mr Pöttering, in particular, as a skilled and very well educated lawyer, are the right people to establish law and order in our House."
"The Constitution has only been ratified by 16, not 18, of the 27 Member States, representing 37% of the citizens."
"This is still far from the unanimity required to make it a legal-base reference point."
"Your Legal Service is entirely right."
"(Applause from certain quarters)"
"Mr Bonde, the interpretation of the Presidency, which, as you know, is responsible for interpreting the Rules of Procedure (with the greatest of respect for the Legal Service, of course, but it is not the Legal Service that interprets the Rules of Procedure, but rather the Presidency) ..."
"As I was saying, the reference to a document that exists, regardless of whether or not it has been ratified by all of the Member States, and which has been signed by all of the Heads of State or Government, regardless of whether or not it has been ratified by all of the Member States, can be quoted as a reference in the motion for a resolution."
"The Presidency's interpretation, therefore, is that your objection is unfounded."
"(Protests and applause)"
"(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 21:"
"Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, we suggest replacing the word 'possible' with 'reasonable' so that it would read: 'Emphasises that everything ""reasonable” must be done to avoid the creation of a two-speed Europe'."
"That is possible, but not reasonable, and as we are very reasonable people, we think we should say 'reasonable'."

"- Report: Gibault"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say that I have had great pleasure in drafting this report and that I am grateful to all my colleagues and all the shadow rapporteurs."
"This report was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education on 7 May."
"I am tabling two new amendments today that I devised with eminent colleagues who have been ministers of culture."
"I would emphasise the fact that the measures that they contain will be submitted to the Member States in their definitive version only when we have the results of a study that I request in my report and that will be entrusted to the Commission."
"In the light of the elements that will subsequently be communicated to us, we will have an opportunity to analyse together the advantages and disadvantages of these measures and to take the most appropriate decision."
"I should like to say that I was very shocked when, yesterday, a lobbyist, whom I find pretentious, woke up - even though he had had my report for two months - and took the liberty of calling my colleagues to ask them to vote against these two amendments."
"I find this attitude unacceptable and I hope that all those who have supported me on the occasion of this report will not let themselves be influenced."
"As I see it, our honour as MEPs is at stake, and I hope that you will put your trust in the artist that I am and that you will support the two amendments that give hope to European artists."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, as someone who was not phoned by the lobbyist but is delighted to vote against these amendments, I was just wondering what the point was of having a Legal Service at all."
"The two amendments that my colleague is suggesting are well beyond the bounds of what this House can do: they are, indeed, ultra vires."
"I am sure that under the Corbett reforms that we voted on in our previous term there was meant to be some sort of impact assessment and common sense applied to amendments that we are trying to pass through this House, which obviously has not happened in this case."
"For example, I believe there is a call for a European social security card in this report, which really should not be allowed through this House at this stage."
"19."
"Draft estimates of the European Parliament for 2008 (vote)"
"- Report: Itälä"
"That concludes the vote."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"The purpose of this Commission proposal is to incorporate into the Community acquis conservation and enforcement measures adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO), to which the Community is a signatory."
"In keeping with the simplification of other legislation, the Commission has taken the opportunity to update and bring together in a single legislative document all of the rules spread across several regulations."
"The rapporteur has updated these rules with other texts adopted following the Commission's proposal, as part of the regulation on total allowable catches and quotas for 2007."
"The simplification proposal is, in itself, a good thing."
"We feel, though, that the consequences of some of the measures incorporated for the long distance fleet, for the fisheries sector and by extension for national economies should be pre-empted and managed."
"I wish to point out that Portugal was one of the founding Members of NAFO, represented by the Community when it joined in 1986. This has not brought us any great benefits - quite the opposite in fact, as evidenced by the difficulties facing the Portuguese long-distance fleet."
"in writing. We have problems with the SIS and particularly the planned SIS II, which will create enormous databases with too few guarantees to protect the privacy of citizens."
"However, this report does not change the nature of the current system, just extends it to new Member States."
"Without access to SIS, the citizens of these countries will not be allowed to travel freely in the rest of the EU."
"For these reasons we voted in favour of the report."
"The legislative resolution of the European Parliament on which we have voted today, which Parliament has already adopted and which I also backed, is a major milestone in the enlargement of the Schengen area."
"This resolution will contribute to the speedy implementation of the acquis communautaire as it applies to the SIS in Slovakia and the other Visegrad Four countries, as well as in the Baltic States and Slovenia."
"Some time ago all of the Members elected from Slovakia urged the Council to refrain from postponing the Schengen area enlargement date until 17 December 2008, which we found unacceptable."
"It appears that this intervention was a factor in the reassessment and acceleration of a process which will now, I believe, make the Schengen area a reality for Slovak citizens before the end of 2007."
"I welcome the fact that the implementation of technical assistance, as well as the SIS, SIS II and SISone4ALL, will proceed on time; and that the European Parliament has gone to great lengths to ensure agreement during the first reading, thus avoiding risk of Parliament causing any delays in the implementation of SIS II."
"The citizens of the new Member States are looking forward to the enlargement of the Schengen area, an act generally perceived as the genuine, definitive and complete accomplishment of EU integration."
"in writing. (SK) The free movement of persons in the Schengen area is a visible and practical exercise of the basic rights guaranteed under the European Community Treaty."
"To our citizens, the free movement of persons, unimpeded by passport checks, is a concrete example of the benefits associated with EU membership."
"Thanks to the Portuguese proposal, the European frontier of the Schengen area will, from 1 January 2008, move east from the Czech-German border to the Slovak-Ukrainian one."
"The interior ministers of the Member States agreed on this enlargement date after many months of negotiations and innumerable discussions."
"In 2004 the European Commission announced that, due to technical delays, it had to propose a new timetable envisaging an operational SIS II as of 17 December 2008."
"The risk was that the original enlargement date might be put off until 2009."
"I have voted in favour of the report by the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on the proposal for a Council decision on the application of the Schengen acquis in respect of the Schengen Information System of the newly acceded Member States."
"I believe that the new Member States will meet all the essential requirements for securing the external Schengen border as recommended by the EP rapporteur."
"Even though it has not proved possible to launch the new SIS II according to plan, the provisional integration of the new Member States into the current system, SISone4ALL, will provide adequate time to accomplish the SIS II."
"I am convinced that meeting the Schengen area enlargement deadline will contribute to the greater confidence of citizens in the European project as a whole."
"I have chosen to abstain in the final vote on Mr Coelho's report today."
"The fundamental criticism of the Schengen system continues to be highly valid when it comes, for example, to personal privacy and the ability of refugees to claim asylum."
"The continued construction of 'Fortress Europe' must cease as soon as possible."
"I do, on the other hand, of course recognise the right of individual Member States to join the system if the countries in question are anxious so to do."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed colleague, Mr Böge of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, with a sum of around EUR 24 million being granted to our Hungarian and Greek friends, following the floods suffered by these Member States and their populations in March and April 2006."
"Even though we must deplore the delays, many of which were due to the Member States themselves, we should be pleased about the usefulness of this fund, which is endowed with a maximum annual sum of EUR 1 billion."
"Given the deadlock in the Council on reviewing the Solidarity Fund, the mobilisation of the Fund to help the victims of natural disasters in Greece and Hungary in 2006 is an opportunity to reiterate the need to ensure that regional disasters remain eligible for the Fund, and to adapt it so that it corresponds most effectively to what the victims of this type of disaster need."
"It is also an opportunity to reaffirm our opposition to the ideas of extending the scope of the Fund without raising its financial ceiling and of lowering the threshold to mobilise the Fund, in such a way that the EU Member States with the highest GDP stand to gain the most from it."
"We should also like to highlight our proposals, adopted by Parliament, aimed at acknowledging the specific nature of disasters in the Mediterranean region - and adapting the Solidarity Fund to timeframes and eligible actions, and to the specific nature of natural disasters such as drought and fire - and at looking into the possibility of setting up a farming disaster fund."
"The purpose of Draft amending budget No 2/2007 is to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, with a view to granting financial assistance to Hungary and Greece to help repair the damage caused by the floods of March and April 2006 in those countries."
"Apart from the delay in activating this EU financial assistance, the cause of which must be investigated, one of the most striking points is the paltry amount in relation to the estimated losses directly sustained."
"The overall amount of Community financial aid for these disasters is some EUR 24.4 million to a loss totalling almost EUR 900 - EUR 520 million in the case of Hungary and EUR 372 in the case of Greece."
"This is another example, in other words, of the discrepancy between the volume of losses and the amount offered by the Community. This calls into question the idea of effective solidarity with the people living in the affected regions."
"The current Solidarity Fund therefore needs to be reassessed in order to adapt eligibility criteria so that the Fund corresponds better to the needs of disaster victims."
"(SK) Yes, Mr President, I have voted in favour of the European Parliament Regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and certain other substances to foods, which lays down the procedures for exercising the executive powers transferred to the Commission, and I support the Council decision of 17 July 2006 in the matter of commitology, which can be summarised as 'regulatory procedure with scrutiny'."
"The European Parliament has adopted a text enabling the transfer to the Commission of the power to take quasi-legislative measures where necessary, the measures in question being those provided for in Article 2 of Decision No. 468/1999, as amended by Decision No. 512/2006, which lays down the procedures for exercising the executive powers that have been transferred to the Commission."
"In this case the decision is a step in the right direction."
"In general, however, it still applies that the European Parliament should leave to its Members the power to decide democratically on legislative procedures."
"I voted in favour of the Scheele report because I feel that the excessive ingestion of vitamins and minerals can be harmful to health and because it is crucial that information is easily understood by all consumers."
"The difficulties raised by various national laws are now reduced by this proposal via harmonisation of the Member States' legal, regulatory and administrative provisions on the addition of vitamins, minerals and other substances."
"I voted in favour of the Bortone report on the proposal for a regulation on nutrition and health claims made on food. It is based on greater information and protection for the consumer, and seeks to ban misleading nutrition and health claims, thus minimising their harmful effects and delivering greater consumer protection."
"Food is the very foundation of health."
"The concept of health is not solely confined to the absence of disease; it also encompasses the person's physical and emotional well-being."
"It is therefore essential, in my view, that health claims be scientifically proven following assessment by the European Food Safety Authority."
"in writing. - (EL) Following the vote in favour of the Prüm Treaty, the follow-up version of the Schengen Treaty, the SIS II information system and the decision on the uncontrolled and unimpeded collection and exchange of personal data, including on political, ideological, philosophical and religious beliefs, the European Parliament has now approved the Visa Information System (VIS)."
"This system, which legalises the collection, processing and exchange of personal and biometric data on any foreigner applying for a visa for any country of the EU, to which the prosecuting authorities and secret services of each Member State have access, adds yet another link to the chain which the EU is using to throttle individual rights."
"The EU aims for the VIS to be the biggest biometric database in the world."
"These measures increase repression and the mechanisms used to impose it to gigantic proportions and institutionalise the potential to keep records on every inhabitant of the planet."
"The ΕU is gradually turning into a barrack/fortress for its peoples and the citizens of third countries."
"However, as capital extends measures to repress and throttle the rights of the workers in order to consolidate and safeguard its sovereignty, so too will the waves of resistance and disobedience and the inevitable fight to overturn the power of the monopolies and their reactionary Union."
"in writing. (SV) When it comes to the opportunities under this proposal for foreign authorities to get access to data in Swedish registers, we would make it a precondition that such access be preceded by a request to the Swedish authorities and subsequent approval."
"In the light of this, we are opposed to what is known as a 'hit-no hit' system."
"in writing. Whilst Conservatives support co-operation between police forces, we cannot support bringing the provisions in the Prüm Treaty into the EU framework."
"We have grave concerns, as does the European Data Protection Supervisor, with regard to the requirements on the collection of data on individual citizens who are neither suspected nor who have committed a crime."
"In addition, the issue of ""hot pursuit"" without authorisation by other Member States police forces is a source of great concern."
"Conservatives believe that intergovernmental co-operation in the field of counter-terrorism and serious criminal cases is essential but feel that there should be an ""opt-in"" clause to allow Member States the freedom to maintain their traditional systems of justice."
"I voted in favour, because the report is aimed at the approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States, which will lead to closer cross-border cooperation between police forces through exchanges of information and research on criminal offences."
"One of the EU's objectives consists of giving the citizens greater levels of protection, freedom, security and justice."
"Effective international cooperation by means of exchanging data, while guaranteeing the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, will help meet this objective."
"The Prüm Treaty was signed, outside the EU's legal framework, on 27 May 2005, by seven Member States, with the aim, as they put it, of 'cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime'."
"Since then, nine more Member States, including Portugal, have stated their intention to ratify it."
"This Treaty forms part of the securitarianism that has been brought in under the cloak of the so-called 'fight against terrorism', entailing serious risks to the citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"What is at stake is the establishment of a framework for police cooperation - joint operations, mutual assistance and even the possibility of the police force of one Member State taking action on the territory of another."
"The latter appears to have caused controversy in the Council. The exchange of a wealth of information contained in personal data has proved similarly controversial."
"It is particularly significant that the majority in Parliament rejected our group's proposal, whereby 'it will be forbidden to process personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a political party or a union or relating to health or sex life.'"
"Hence our vote against."
"in writing. - (FR) On the subject of the fight against terrorism, it is most unusual that it should still be so difficult, today, for the national police forces and the anti-terrorism authorities of the various EU Member States to cooperate together and to exchange information."
"However, what we now know for certain is that the attacks of 11 September and those of 11 March in Madrid were planned, at least in part, on EU soil."
"These attacks demonstrated the ineffectiveness of Europe's instruments and policies for combating terrorism."
"Terrorism knows no bounds; the fight against terrorism must know no bounds either, and intergovernmental cooperation in this area must be stepped up as a matter of urgency."
"The same goes for the controls at the Member States' borders: they must be reintroduced as quickly as possible, because they are the bare minimum when it comes to combating terrorism effectively and efficiently."
"As a final point, I should like to emphasise a reality: that of the Islamic nature of terrorism in its new guise."
"A new political and religious ideology is gaining ground in Europe and in the Muslim world."
"It represents a fearsome breeding ground for terrorism."
"in writing. I voted against amendment 43 relating to so-called 'measures in the event of imminent danger' in the abovementioned report as I believe that measures put forward do not represent an effective means of combating cross-border crime."
"in writing. - (EL) The European Parliament today gave the go-ahead for the integration of the most basic provisions of the Prüm Treaty, known as Schengen III, into the so-called acquis communautaire and into the national legislation of the Member States under a simplified procedure, in other words without the signing and ratification procedures required under international treaties."
"These provisions oblige the Member States to create DNA files and permit the collection, processing and automated exchange of DNA data, fingerprints and other records and information by the repressive mechanisms, including on persons who they suspect will commit a criminal offence or jeopardise public order and security."
"It expressly provides that the purpose of exchanging such information is to safeguard public order at international demonstrations, especially in the run-up to EU summits."
"That is why it grants the right for joint operations and full powers, including the use of firearms, to foreign police forces."
"The Greek Communist Party has condemned the further criminalisation of civil and trade union action, preventive personal records and the stepping-up of the preventive repression of grassroots movements promoted by the provisions of the Treaty."
"The peoples must condemn this Treaty, which is dangerous to individual rights and democratic freedoms and step up their fight against the stepping-up of autocratic measures and the anti-democratic and anti-grassroots policy of the EU in general."
"The German Presidency is seeking to transfer some parts of the Prüm Treaty to the third pillar."
"The objectives of this text, which is aimed at combating terrorist threats and protecting the public, are of the highest importance."
"Consequently, I must highlight the fact that the course of action chosen by the Council - namely demanding an emergency opinion from Parliament - has hampered the normal functioning of interinstitutional relations."
"Parliament has always held a clear, responsible position on terrorism and cross-border crime. It has supported the creation of conditions for cross-border cooperation and the exchange of information between bodies responsible for prevention and investigation into criminal offences."
"This is the only way that we can hope to prevent terrorist threats effectively."
"The establishment of procedures enabling the exchange of information to be prompt and effective is clearly of the highest importance. I therefore support the report."
"It is both urgent and vitally important that this framework decision on data protection be adopted."
"A new global legal framework on data protection under the third pillar comparable to the rules in force in Community law is a vital factor in guaranteeing the same level of protection."
"I therefore welcome the fact that a political agreement has finally been reached, and I wish to pay tribute to the rapporteur Mrs Roure for her outstanding contribution to achieving this outcome."
"Improving data protection under the third pillar presupposes that this framework decision should apply to the entire pillar, including Europol, Eurojust and the Customs Information System, which already come under the third pillar."
"As such, I welcome this extension and the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, in particular the insertion of an assessment and revision clause so that the Commission can submit proposals for improving the framework decision after three years."
"I also endorse the 15 general principles presented by Mr Frattini, which reflect the thrust of the acquis in the area of personal data protection processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"in writing. - (EL) The Greek Communist Party voted against the report because, despite the individual improvements that it proposes to the new version of the Council's framework-decision, it fundamentally adopts in its entirety its basic philosophy, which is the unrestricted and - in practice - uncontrollable facility for the repressive mechanisms of the EU and the prosecuting authorities both in its Member States and in third countries (such as the USA) and even private individuals to collect, process and exchange between each other all the personal data of every citizen of the EU, including data relating to their political and trade union action and ideological, philosophical and religious beliefs."
"The sights of the repressive mechanisms are now set on every citizen of the EU, given that the collection and transmission of everyone's personal data is permitted, even if they are hardly even suspected of any act, purely and simply for reasons of public order and security."
"The addition of 15 guidelines for the protection of personal data is nothing more than a wish-list and exposé of ideas, without any possibility of imposing compliance with them in practice by the repressive mechanisms."
"In reality, there is absolutely no protection, in that the exceptions from this protection are becoming the rule, with the simple and uncontrolled citing of reasons of public security, while data protection is the exception, which it is almost impossible for anyone to impose."
"In the era of terrorist threats, the balance between privacy and protecting the citizens is becoming a constant challenge that we can only overcome with clear, responsible measures."
"The rules on data protection used for judicial and police cooperation must be drawn up in such a way as to strengthen the principle of mutual trust between the authorities involved, enabling more effective European cooperation and the highest possible protection for the citizens when it comes to the use of this data."
"The measures to be taken should therefore be accurate and complete. They should protect fundamental rights and comply with the articles in the Charter of Fundamental Rights covering privacy and the protection of personal data."
"I therefore welcome the political agreement reached with the Council, which will lead to the rapid adoption of this proposal for a framework decision."
"Creating the conditions for recovering fish stocks, in this case cod, is vital not only in terms of protecting marine biology resources but also keeping fisheries activity alive."
"The objective should be to fish less when according to scientific research and to fishermen themselves, stocks are in need of recovery if fishing is to take place - perhaps on a bigger scale - in the future."
"We must bear in mind, however, that these recovery plans, whereby fishing is restricted, have a serious economic and social impact that must be weighed up and taken into account."
"Against this backdrop, we support the proposals in this regard contained in the report."
"What is needed is for the sector to be compensated for the economic and social consequences of this break in fishing, and there should be a Community compensation fund specifically for this purpose. In other words the common fisheries policy must take on its responsibilities."
"Our vote against Amendments 20, 21 and 22 was based on our view that decisions on total allowable catches and quotas should not be automatically linked to the opinions of the Council for the Exploration of the Sea."
"Other factors, economic and social factors for example, should be taken into account, as evidenced by representation in the Regional Advisory Councils."
"in writing. (PL) Despite the restrictions on fishing quotas introduced in recent years, some Baltic cod stocks are now below acceptable biological limits."
"The report wisely proposes an 8% reduction of the number of days at sea using fishing gear, more rigorous inspections, and in particular raising to 300 kg the limit above which fishing vessels must obtain permission from the competent bodies at the point of unloading."
"In addition, it proposes increasing the minimum size of cod fished in the Baltic to 40 cm."
"The rapporteur also rightly refers to the issue of dividing the Baltic into an eastern and a western area, as these are two quite distinct ecosystems."
"Different fishing quotas should therefore be laid down for each of these areas of the Baltic."
"Priority should be given to the east as stocks there are now below acceptable biological limits."
"The plan to prepare a report on the social and economic impact of implementation of the proposed regulation on the sector deserves our support too."
"The report should focus in particular on the employment structure and the financial situation of fishermen, ship owners and enterprises involved in cod fishing and processing."
"Mr President, I just wish to say that the Irish delegation and my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group voted in favour of this report."
"We are happy with its emphasis on the role of producer groups and crisis management."
"However, we have a problem with two amendments, 11 and 111, which were voted through together."
"These two amendments will pose particular problems for potato growers in Ireland who are currently losing significant entitlements to the single farm payment to the national reserve because the land they use for growing potatoes is not eligible for the single farm payment as things stand."
"We welcome the Commission's proposal to remove this exclusion and to change this anomaly, and we hope that the Commission's proposal is ratified by the Council, not the one as amended here this morning."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Salinas García report on market reforms in the fruit and vegetable sector."
"The Commission believes that reform in the sector is needed, and this is a view I share."
"What the Commission is proposing, though, is not reform."
"What is needed is to end the unnecessary regulation of the entire sector, to remove export subsidies and to abolish quotas completely."
"This, however, is not what the Commission is proposing."
"Instead, it is proposing minor, cosmetic changes that retain the regulatory nature of the whole policy."
"Neither I nor the other MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS) support this approach and we have accordingly voted against the report."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the bulk of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Salinas García, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific rules as regards the fruit and vegetable sector."
"This important sector, which represents around 17% of the Union's agricultural production, is, in reality, very varied, fragile and confronted with structural problems, at the same time as being exposed to growing external pressure."
"It deserves to be supported, not only for producers but also for public health reasons - the health of European consumers - and for our food processing industry."
"The European Commission proposals are an initial basis for work that will have to be adjusted and improved in many areas."
"Nevertheless, I welcome the specific attention paid by the Union to this important sector."
"Following the reform of the CAP, which introduced the principle of single payment and which paved the way for the decoupling of production aid, the Commission now feels it is the turn of fruit and vegetables."
"Using the old arguments of competitiveness, market forces, the WTO and so on, the Commission has put forward proposals that will, if the governments of the Member States agree to them, lead to more abandonment of production and more unemployment in the future, and will link aid to 'historical' payments and to the single payment scheme, and we are opposed to this."
"In Portugal, the industrial tomato sector is under threat."
"It is a sector in which there has been a great deal of investment, one that has developed, that has produced quantity and quality, and one in which the overwhelming majority of production provides work for many small and medium-sized farmers, family farming and many workers linked directly or indirectly to the agri-food industry."
"If the Commission's proposal were to go through, thousands of jobs in agriculture and industry would be put in jeopardy, even if in the short term there is still a payment to farmers and a transitional period."
"Although the report introduced several measures that we welcome, it does not substantially change the Commission's proposal and as such we could not vote in favour."
"in writing. (SV) The proposed addition to the Commission's proposal put forward by Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is beneath contempt."
"We firmly reject the proposals to subsidise growers of cherries and berries, mushrooms and fruit, to introduce area payments for garlic, to investigate the possible introduction of an EU quality label, to introduce an EU quality control agency for fruit and vegetables from third countries and to introduce a security fund for the said sector of cultivation and wordings relating to export refunds and the like for processed tomatoes, et cetera."
"The June List observes, once again, that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision in respect of the EU's agricultural policy. Otherwise, the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to all the various groups within the agricultural industry."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
"in writing. - (EL) The purpose of the proposed review of the regulation on fruit and vegetables is to adjust to the new CAP, the EU financial perspective and the WTO."
"Decoupling subsidies from production, substantially reducing Community support and abolishing the remaining traces of export subsidies will result in increased imports and a reduction in exports, will shrink the manufacturing industry and turn certain factories into packaging units for imported raw materials and will result in drastic cutbacks or the abandonment of certain crops, the subsidies for which make a significant contribution to farmers' incomes."
"In Greece, the worst victims are mainly growers of juicing oranges, industrial tomatoes and sultanas, which are our country's main products."
"The result will be the concentration of the production of fruit and vegetables in few hands, the mass destruction of small and medium-sized farms, using decoupled subsidies as bait, and an increase in the profitability of commercial industrialists, with guaranteed cheap raw materials, both domestic and imported."
"As far as producer organisations are concerned, their role is being upgraded, even using anti-democratic changes, so that even those who do not want to are forced to join."
"However, the unwillingness of farmers to join producer organisations derives from their role as mediation bodies between farmers and commercial industrialists, for the benefit of the interests of the commercial industrialists."
"We MEPs of the Greek Communist Party have voiced our opposition and voted against the report, because the proposed changes are yet another blow to small and medium-sized farms."
"in writing. (SV) This report sets right, to a certain extent, the market in fruit and vegetables, which is brim-full of excessively detailed regulation, and phases out export refunds for this sector."
"I am not, therefore, voting against the report, but the improvements to it are not great enough for me to vote in favour of it, so I am abstaining."
"I voted to abstain and against the amendments proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"These amendments moved away from the principle and practice of reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"I abstained where there was no clear implication for UK interests, but where there were clear concerns for continental Member States - 'hot pursuit' being that particular vote."
"I also voted against eight amendments, which, when taken in combination, actually increased funds to fruit and vegetable sectors, which is against the UK Labour Party's view that support spending should be reduced and contradicts CAP reform."
"(PL) Mr President, Montesquieu remarked that democracies are based on law, monarchies on honour and dictatorships on fear."
"As we are a democratic institution, I should like to say that I do not agree with legal acts referring to other legal acts that are not binding."
"I share the view expressed by Mrs Bonde on the subject."
"In that connection, I should like to point out that I voted against Amendment 25 to the report by Mr Crespo and Mr Brok."
"If by some mistake it appears that I voted in its favour, please note that my intention had been to vote against."
"(PL) Mr President, I have today voted against the report calling for work on the new Union treaty, the new Constitution for Europe, to begin as soon as possible with a view to adoption of the draft document."
"The League of Polish Families to which I belong is opposed to the creation of a new European super state and to all measures aimed at depriving nation states of their sovereignty."
"We trust that the attempt to draft a new treaty based on the draft Constitution for Europe, which has been pushed through so forcibly by certain Members of this House, will end in failure."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the previous speaker, the Pensioners' Party is highly in favour of the existence of a Europe that is also political and that heralds benefits for citizens, in particular for citizens who want a future, because they are working now, and for citizens who want a present, because they are now retired and have the right to a better life than that experienced by the elderly and retired in the past."
"Thus they look to Europe for security, because all too often, if not always, States ignore the real everyday issues that matter to citizens, such as how to survive in a global society that focuses purely on the 'god of money' and not on human beings at all stages of life, from the cradle to the grave."
"We therefore hope that the European Constitution will be adopted as soon as possible."
"in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of this report, which is basically a sound one."
"We wish, however, to offer a number of clarifications."
"We voted in favour of what is stated in paragraph 8 as we are in favour of strengthening the common foreign and security policy."
"It is important to point out, however, that we are not in favour of common defence."
"Point 12 highlights issues such as Social Europe and the struggle against climate change that are important to Europeans."
"However, we are opposed to incorporating the Copenhagen criteria into the Constitution."
"We believe that the Copenhagen criteria are important, but we do not want them to be written into the Constitution as this would make it harder to continue enlargement."
"For the same reason, we are also opposed to other obstacles being placed in the path of the candidate countries."
"We furthermore reject the preferential position proposed under paragraph 18 for religious communities in comparison with the rest of civil society."
"in writing. The Constitutional Treaty is a landmark document which provides a blueprint for a more dynamic and effective European Union, strengthens the democratic character of an enlarged Union and enhances our decision-making capacity and ability to act on the world stage."
"We are committed to preserving to the greatest extent possible the substance of the Constitution."
"We support this report."
"We reject the concept of a two-tier Europe."
"However, we have voted against paragraph 11 regarding the diminution of the protection of the rights of citizens because of its vagueness."
"How is this decided and who decides that the protection of rights of citizens has been diminished?"
"We have also voted against paragraph 20, which demands that all Member States coordinate their ratification procedures in order to allow for simultaneous ratification."
"How can we coordinate between different systems of Member States particularly when some require ratification by referenda and others by Parliament?"
"We need to respect the ratification system of each Member State."
"Saying this, we encourage governments to come together and decide on as short a timeframe as possible for agreement and ratification of a Treaty according to their national requirements."
"We voted in favour of CA28 as the language is more reflective of the reality than that of the PSE amendment regarding ratification in France and the Netherlands."
"(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - (FR) I abstained during the final vote on the Barón-Brok report on the roadmap for the Union's constitutional process."
"Indeed, the rejection of the European Constitutional Treaty by two Member States in fact nullifies the proposal submitted for ratification by the Member States in 2005."
"This established fact must therefore be taken into account by the Heads of State or Government who cannot keep the initial text even 'in a different format'."
"Equally, the process of drafting a new treaty must not take place at the expense of European democracy by means of a mere intergovernmental conference."
"in writing. The Socialist group has approved this resolution by an overwhelming majority."
"I should add on behalf of the Labour MEPs that the EPLP fully supports the main conclusion of this report, namely ""a commitment to calling an Intergovernmental Conference and the definition of a roadmap containing a procedure, a clear mandate and a clear objective of reaching an agreement before the end of this year""."
"However, we thought that it was inappropriate to single out some - but not other - elements contained in the Constitutional Treaty as being essential, as the new treaty will only see the light of day if it is acceptable to all 27 member states."
"I voted in favour because I feel it is crucial and increasingly urgent that we find solutions whereby we can overcome the problems and challenges facing the EU, both internally and externally."
"This report is well-balanced and represents an important contribution to resolving the institutional deadlock in which the Union finds itself at the earliest opportunity."
"The Union must be given adequate resources to meet the citizens' concerns regarding the challenges of globalisation and climate change, thereby contributing towards strengthening the democratic control over its decision-making processes."
"The new Treaty, regardless of the name and the structure it is eventually given, must retain the thrust of the text already ratified by a number of Member States and at the same time incorporate the amendments needed to obtain the consensus it cannot do without."
"With the right legislative and budgetary procedures for giving the EU the maximum amount of decision-making ability and for making its policies as effective as possible, the new Treaty may help resolve some of the serious problems that Europe is facing."
"The adoption of this report is definitive proof of the flagrant disregard for the sovereign decision made by the people of France and the Netherlands, demonstrating once again that Parliament's concept of democracy does not extend as far as respect for the sovereign decisions of people expressed via referendums."
"This decision taken by the majority in Parliament demonstrates that the 'period of reflection' was nothing more than a means of overlooking the negative result of the two referendums and of preventing others, in which there could be further rejections of the so-called European Constitution, from being held."
"Two years on, more pressure is being exerted to step up the capitalist penetration of the EU, the neoliberal policies, the ever-faster militarisation and the centralisation of power into the hands of supranational institutions, which are becoming increasingly distant from the citizens and dominated by the major powers."
"It is unacceptable for Parliament to confer on itself a legitimacy it does not have, which is precisely what it is doing in its attempts to interfere with the timetable and content of the process, that is to say, in the sovereign decision of different countries, and to coordinate ratification processes."
"We are in favour of a more democratic, fairer Europe that is characterised by solidarity, a Europe that promotes peace and cooperation with people from all parts of the world, a Europe that complies with the principle of sovereign States with equal rights."
"in writing. (SV) The federalist majority in the European Parliament are not ideologically representative of their electorates as far as matters pertaining to the EU Constitution are concerned."
"At present, everything possible is being done to avoid asking the voters for their opinions on Europe's future via referendums."
"We are in favour of arranging referendums on such matters, but we do not believe that the European Parliament is the proper body to push through referendums in the Member States."
"The federalist majority would now like to secure as much as possible of the supranationalism from the old draft Constitutional Treaty by means of simply changing the title of the draft EU Constitution."
"We have therefore voted against the report submitted by Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The Union needs a treaty that builds on the self-determination of the Member States and through which, together, we regulate how cross-border issues are to be managed."
"One only has to read point 6 to justify rejecting the Resolution."
"According to Point 6, the Resolution 'reaffirms its commitment to achieving a settlement of the ongoing constitutional process of the European Union that is based on the content of the Constitutional Treaty, possibly under a different presentation ...'"
"These few words lay bare the true intention of the current (cosy) negotiations taking place in the Council - in other words, between the governments run by the Portuguese Socialists, the German Christian Democrat/Social Democrat coalition, and so on - which are purely and simply an attempt to (re)impose the thrust of the Treaty rejected by France and the Netherlands."
"This is indicative of deep disdain for the democratic sovereign will expressed by the people of these two countries in national referendums."
"During the debate, did anyone actually ask whether they 'take people for fools'?"
"Yet it is precisely because they do not 'take people for fools' that the political forces of the right and the social democrats, in cahoots with one another, negotiate 'behind closed doors' and keep their cards close to their chests so as to preclude the risk of failure."
"The German Presidency moves full steam ahead, claiming it has a 'mandate' to 'preserve' the content and 'substance' of the so-called 'European Constitution' in the 'new' draft Treaty to be presented by December 2007 (!) and ratified by 2009."
"In a word, unacceptable."
"in writing. (DA) The Danish Social Democratic delegation in the European Parliament has voted in favour of the own-initiative report on the roadmap for the Union's Constitutional Process."
"We should like to emphasise in this connection that the issue of how and when the individual Member State chooses to ratify a new Treaty should continue to be a matter for itself as a sovereign nation."
"We think it sensible, however, so to coordinate the ratification process that, irrespective of the forms it might take in individual Member States, it is conducted in such a way that it will be possible formally to complete it in all the countries simultaneously, as indicated in paragraph 20 of the report."
"in writing. - (FR) I believe that the majority of the European Parliament has not sought to respond to the message sent out by the EU populations that rejected the Constitutional Treaty."
"By rejecting Amendment 1, Parliament has refused to allow the people to be consulted by referendum on any new treaty."
"The fact is, this element is crucial because the opportunity for them to impose social policies or policies matching their aspirations depends on it."
"This is a major shortcoming of the European Union."
"That is why I shall vote against this report."
"in writing. I voted against paragraph 20 (original text) in the above-mentioned report as I believe that the proposal to hold a ratification process simultaneously across all EU Member States is impractical."
"in writing. - (EL) The report endeavours to resuscitate the European Constitution."
"The European Parliament is insultingly ignoring the rejection and condemnation of the 'European Constitution', through referenda, by the French and Dutch people and by the other peoples whose governments have deprived them of the right to express themselves."
"The familiar coalition of the political spokesmen of capital (conservatives, socialists and liberals) and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is calling on the governments of the Member States to come to an agreement before the end of 2007, to adopt and enforce the 'European Constitution' before the European elections in 2009, with the same reactionary content, perhaps packaged differently, in order to deceive the peoples."
"There can be no progressive 'European Constitution' of the imperialist EU of capital."
"Any 'Constitutional' Treaty will be a treaty which safeguards and promotes the interests and ambitions of big, Euro-unifying business, just like the current treaties of the EU and, previously, of the EEC."
"The European plutocracy, the imperialists and their servants need a European Constitution, in order to shield their power, in order to safeguard the capitalist system, in order to strike at the rights of the working class and the peoples of Europe, in order to repress the grassroots movements and in order to step up their aggressive policy of intervention and war."
"It is in the interests of the people to bury the 'Constitutional Treaty' and the EU itself once and for all."
"in writing. (SK) Critics frequently describe the EU as a strong organisation which meddles in too many areas."
"As an MEP for Slovakia, a new Member State which has only recently acceded to the Union, I feel that we should have a stronger Europe capable of greater action."
"For this reason I believe it is essential to adopt a revised constitutional document, that is, to have clear rules of the game."
"The Union needs to reform the founding treaties in a way which would enjoy broad public support."
"I appreciate the efforts by Chancellor Angela Merkel to lead the Union out of its constitutional crisis by introducing a road map offering appropriate solutions for the problems that the European Union is facing both internally and externally, as well as the problems associated with the expansion and deepening of the EU's political dimension."
"An enlarged EU needs tools and means to operate efficiently, to strengthen its role in the world, and to address the concerns of its citizens against the background of challenges brought about inter alia by globalisation, climate change, the need to ensure energy supply and an ageing population."
"Many of the issues which provoked some of the greatest concern among the European public, such as the directive on services in the internal market and the financial framework, have since been resolved."
"As reiterated in the Berlin Declaration on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, we must build the EU on a renewed joint foundation and we must do so before the 2009 elections for the European Parliament."
"This is why I have voted in favour of the report by the rapporteurs Enrique Barón Crespo and Elmar Brok."
"Had a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty taken place in Portugal, in the wording and circumstances of two years ago, I would have voted 'yes'."
"Among other things, the institutional stability that would have arisen would have been beneficial to the EU."
"As events turned out, precisely as stipulated, two countries exercised their right to a veto, which represents a considerable change in circumstances. We must now respond to reality, not in spite of it."
"I still believe that the institutional architecture needs to be adjusted to accommodate the reality of 'Europe' enlarged to 27 and as such I feel that the best solution is the maximalist solution to overcoming the difficulties arising from this new set of circumstances - if only to ensure that the solution reached is a stable one - but a minimalist solution to introducing amendments that, no matter how much the authors of the proposed Treaty would like, were rejected."
"Realism is no less virtuous than idealism."
"Lastly, I feel that as regards the referendum, and the possibility of holding one in Portugal, the further away the solution is from the Constitutional Treaty, the less the need for a referendum; and vice-versa, of course."
"in writing. (SV) I abstained in the vote on the roadmap for the draft Constitutional Treaty in respect of an amendment stating that all countries 'shall' hold referendums."
"I am in favour of referendums, but this is something that each Member State must decide for itself."
"The German constitution, for example, does not recognise the instrument of referendums."
"in writing. I, along with my EPLP colleagues, voted to abstain on critical issues of this report, which, even as an own-initiative endeavour, is inappropriate on certain levels."
"Paragraph 5 is an ambiguous reference to the Member States that have not put the text to ratification yet."
"There are also issues where inappropriate demands are made on a list of issues or concern idle threats to reject Council negotiations."
"Alongside this is a request to hold simultaneous ratification, which could present serious problems in many Member States."
"However, there were other serious issues which could be supported and where I could support them, I did."
"in writing. (PL) This is a very significant report, which will enable the European Parliament to make its views on the action plan regarding the European Union's constitutional process heard at the forthcoming June European Council."
"Every effort should be made to preserve the content of the treaty, whilst at the same time including in the text provisions on the new challenges facing Europe."
"I could mention climate change, social Europe, the war on terror, inter-cultural dialogue and economic management."
"It is also important to point out that the so-called mini-treaty does not seem to provide a solution to this difficult situation."
"The European Council should convene an intergovernmental conference as soon as possible and reach a compromise before the end of 2007, so that decisions on the ratification process can be taken by the end of 2008."
"This would allow the incoming Parliament elected in 2009 to operate within the framework of the new Constitutional Treaty."
"The debate on the definition of the functions of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) comes through clearly in Parliament's resolution, and in the conclusions of the Council. It is abundantly clear that attempts are being made to control and manipulate the UNHCR."
"It is in this context that one must understand the criticism and pressure from the EU, regarding, firstly, the manner in which some countries have been elected to the body - the EU opposes the so-called 'clean slate' principle and favours the introduction of eligibility criteria; secondly, the 'special procedure' for increasing the mandates per country and the possibility of creating new mandates by simple majority - and the absence of a 'code of conduct' for this mechanism; and thirdly, the modalities of the 'Universal Periodic Review'."
"In other words, what is needed is, on the one hand, to continue to monitor the development of the UNHCR, especially given the USA and its allies are known to manipulate it, and on the other hand, to support our proposals to promote fundamental freedoms, rights and guarantees, social progress, peace and solidarity, the rejection of the use of human rights to disguise a policy of interventionism and aggression towards sovereign peoples and States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a representative of the Pensioners' Party I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Gibault on artists' working conditions and pensions."
"There are artists who become very famous and certainly do not need the European Parliament to facilitate their movement and pension conditions, but there are also excellent artists who unfortunately do not have great success; such artists, and there are many of them, are nonetheless human beings - workers and pensioners who deserve the same respect as all other citizens."
"There are artists who live a life of work and poverty, unprotected by regulation and without being shown respect."
"This is all the more serious when the person to whom a lack of respect is shown has a sensitive soul, as artists have."
"That is why I voted in favour, and I hope that Europe will do more for artists all over Europe and throughout the world."
"(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of Claire Gibault's report on the social status of artists."
"I want to support her commendable work in this area, as she, an artist herself, cares about European artists' livelihoods."
"We of course know that many artists today depend for their livelihood on very short-term contracts in different countries in Europe."
"It is therefore very relevant to ensure that artists in Europe also enjoy proper social status and receive social security, and thus in time a pension, because it is a fact that we in Europe want to promote education and culture."
"We want to promote the European cultural arena because we know that it is the most important area in decision-making in Europe."
"If that is healthy, we can then also build both a single market and a foreign and security policy upon it."
"I actually voted in favour of this report as a European, as a Finn and as a member of the Finnish Centre Party, Keskusta, which also represents the Finnish cultural movement."
"I voted in favour of this report because I feel it is important that European artists can benefit from an appropriate level of integration in their professional activities."
"European standards must be applied with a view to having a dynamic and innovative European cultural policy in all branches of the arts, enabling us to offer artists the social guarantees enjoyed by all other European workers."
"We know that this report addresses issues that need to be treated with special care."
"Yet there are two points that must be made. First and foremost, it is necessary to confer on artists labour and social rights, in view of the specific nature of their activities and in compliance with the freedom of expression and creation."
"We therefore feel it is crucial to take account of the activities of those working in creative arts and to improve their social status. We are critical, however, of some of the proposals in this report on which Parliament has voted."
"We know that cultural democratisation can only take place under the right conditions and that these times in which we live, characterised as they are by ever deepening neoliberalism, are not conducive to improving the working conditions and the creativity of most artists."
"In Portugal, the situation in this area is complicated too, with attacks on the rights gained and cuts in cultural and artistic activities, in which everybody - the artists and the population as a whole - loses out."
"We hope, however, that something can be done to give more visibility to these issues."
"in writing. (SV) The ability of artists to make a living is an important issue, but it is one that the Member States have responsibility for resolving politically in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
"in writing. (PL) Mrs Gibault's report aimed at improving employment conditions for artists deserves strong support."
"Most of the difficulties encountered by artists working in Community countries other than their country of origin are not due to cultural issues."
"They relate for example to mobility, visa policy, health policy, social security, unemployment and pensions."
"The report urges the Commission and the Member States to introduce a European Professional Register for artists."
"This would contain information on the status of each artist, the nature and duration of contracts, together with information on employers."
"The register would make it possible to transfer pension entitlements and social benefits acquired by artists in third countries when they returned to their country of origin."
"It would also allow experience gained whilst working in a Member State to be taken into account."
"The challenge facing European cultural policy is the creation of a dynamic cultural environment that is creative and innovative with respect to all types of art."
"By supporting this report we are committing ourselves to providing artists with the social guarantees enjoyed by all other European workers."
"in writing. (CS) I shall be voting in favour of the adoption of the report on the social status of artists."
"I feel that this will be a step towards resolving this problem, albeit one that merely scratches the surface and that will require further work."
"I feel that the report implicitly places the emphasis on performing artists and rather overlooks literature, which is a highly creative and important branch of the arts."
"As far as the report is concerned, writers are mere amateurs whose work is rarely classified as 'professional artistic activity'."
"As for the conditions that exist in, say, the Czech Republic, I know of only one solitary author who is 'allowed' to be a professional artist."
"Furthermore, there is clear and convincing evidence that the Unie českých spisovatelů (Czech Writers' Union) - a left-leaning Czech writers' organisation - has for years been silenced and segregated by the Czech Culture Ministry."
"This only goes to show the sorry state of support for the art of writing."
"The report also fails to define what is meant by the term 'European artist' even though it uses the term on a number of occasions."
"Do writers come into this category?"
"If so, I feel that they cannot be measured in the same way as so-called performing artists."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this report but with a cautionary note in terms of the proposed increase in spending on information, as it would relate to a proposal to bring local journalists here to Brussels."
"We would need to be very clear about what we are going to do with the local journalists and ensure that we make information that is available here relevant to the people who read and listen to local media."
"I do not think we have done that particularly well in the past, so we need more details on this issue."
"(LT) Mr President, today Parliament adopted a resolution concerning the United Nations Human Rights Council and its fifth session."
"As one of the authors of this resolution, I am very pleased that all political groups have agreed on an assessment of the first year of operation of the United Nations Human Rights Council, and which shortcomings it needs to attend to."
"They have also authorised a European Parliament ad hoc delegation, which will participate next week in the fifth Human Rights Council plenary session - a session, which is particularly important for the future of this organisation."
"As one of the authors of this resolution and a member of the delegation, I would like to thank Parliament and my colleagues for supporting the resolution."
"With regard to Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for 2008, we wish to highlight just two of the many aspects worthy of consideration."
"The first concerns the plan to earmark EUR 10 300 000 in 2008 for 'an awareness campaign in view of the 2009 European elections' and EUR 900 000 for implementation of the Parliamentary Television Channel."
"This is a matter of particular concern given that no detailed information or justifications have been given regarding the use of these financial resources."
"For example, how will they be used, and by whom?"
"What are the actions to be funded?"
"Who is to decide how they are to be used, and according to what criteria?"
"Might it be that this 'awareness campaign' is being used, rather like the referendums on the lapsed Constitutional Treaty, as a covert way of using Community money, scandalously, to fund propaganda campaigns to promote the content of the Treaty?"
"The second is the effective guarantee and exercise of multilingualism in the European institutions and, in this case, Parliament."
"We wish to highlight the fact that the increasing outsourcing of language and translation services, and other types of unstable contract, inevitably affects the quality of the service and undermines the rights of those providing this service."
"in writing. (SV) In the first amendment, Mr Lundgren points out that the travelling circus moving between the three different places of work results in absurdly high costs."
"With that much I agree."
"The problem lies with the accusation, which finds its way into the third amendment, that the EU would be going in for questionable property speculation."
"The opposite is, of course, true: the European Parliament saves money by owning its buildings."
"Because there were parts of the proposal I agreed with, I abstained from voting in the first case and voted against in the second."
"In the second amendment, Mr Lundgren expresses the view that the EU should refrain from conducting centralised campaigns."
"In this matter too, I am in agreement: it is unlikely that Europeans would have a more positive attitude towards the EU as a result of the Commission's communications strategies."
"I would have difficulty, however, objecting to the EU choosing to invest resources in providing information about its activities in the run-up to a European Parliament election."
"It is by working constructively, notably in our own countries between elections, that we are best at providing information at local level."
"It is when we engage in constructive politics that we are best at communicating policy."

"The final draft of the agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 14 June 2007 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested a statement by the President of Parliament on the situation in Palestine, followed by short speeches by the chairmen of the groups."
"I suggest this statement be made at 9 a.m. tomorrow, as the first item on the agenda."
"Are there any objections to this?"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this is not an objection, but just a suggestion: perhaps representatives of the Commission and Council could make a brief statement on this very precarious situation."
"After all, these two bodies have an overview of the situation. Since this is an exceptional situation, it should be possible for the Council, too, to make a statement."
"Is that the case?"
"We can request it, although I am doubtful whether there will be anyone from the institutions you mention available tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"We shall try, however."
"Parliament adopted the motion."
"I have not received any amendments for today - Monday."
"Tuesday:"
"I should like to pass on a message from the Council: it cannot be present tomorrow afternoon for the statements on the conclusions of the G8 Summit."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I think that that is very regrettable, to put it mildly."
"The Council was asked as long as a month or so ago to be present without fail at this debate, and we were even promised that it would be."
"I do not understand why there is no minister or other representative of the government of the country holding the Council Presidency who is able to be present."
"In my opinion, you should make it quite clear that we are very disappointed about the situation."
"Mr Swoboda, I, too, have only just found this out."
"We shall make our message suitably clear."
"Wednesday:"
"No amendments have been received."
"Thursday:"
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested postponing the vote on the motions for resolutions on the Middle East until the July part-session."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you."
"Given the recent developments in the Palestinian regions, it is more important, as we see it, that we indeed hold a brief debate tomorrow morning to discuss the situation, the new developments, the challenges being faced and then follow this up possibly with a resolution in July where we can take all new developments into consideration, rather than the other way round."
"My group fully supports the proposal of having a debate tomorrow, as you suggested, Mr President, and of taking the time to propose a more well-founded and, above all, a more up-to-date resolution by the next part-session."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this has the full support of our group."
"The situation is so confusing, and the things we say today may no longer apply as soon as tomorrow or the day after."
"Therefore, it undoubtedly makes sense to take account of the situation now, and then adopt such a resolution in July."
"(Parliament adopted the motion)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents decided unanimously last week to hold a major debate on Cuba in autumn, as there is no current occasion for a debate on Cuba."
"Yet the General Affairs Council has been discussing Cuba today and yesterday and has issued conclusions showing the Council's position in a slightly different light."
"For example, the Council invites a Cuban delegation to Brussels for exploratory talks, and declares its willingness to conduct comprehensive, open dialogue with the Cuban Government on all issues of mutual interest."
"This constitutes a current occasion, and so we should be much obliged if, despite last week's discussion by the Conference of Presidents, the subject could now be placed on the agenda after all."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, attended this Conference of Presidents, and the proposal to hold a comprehensive debate on policy on Latin America, in which Cuba is to play a special role, in autumn was my motion on behalf of my group."
"Mr Nassauer is an extremely honourable, proper MEP, and what I am about to say does not apply to him, as he joined us in voting in favour of the proposal for an autumn debate at this Conference of Presidents."
"Nevertheless, as we know, some members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats took the view - not in response to today's decisions by the General Affairs Council but as early as last Thursday, immediately after the Conference of Presidents - that that was not on; that Cuba was at all events to be discussed immediately under urgent procedure."
"We also know who this was: it was chiefly the Spanish delegation in the PPE-DE Group."
"We have been wondering for some time whether 'PPE' stands for 'Partido Popular Español'. One thing is completely clear: it is these people in the PPE-DE Group who are responsible for the fact that every opportunity is taken in this House for domestic Spanish idealogisation."
"I repeat, therefore: there is absolutely no point in debating Cuba under urgent procedure on Thursday afternoon."
"The debate would attract maybe 15 people."
"The European Council's decision today to invite a Cuban delegation is a confirmation that it makes perfect sense to await this dialogue before we hold a debate here in autumn, for which we shall then be properly prepared: this is respectable politics."
"What we are seeing here now is domestic Spanish manoeuvring; that is what this is."
"(Applause)"
"(Parliament approved the motion by electronic vote.)"
"(Uproar in the Chamber)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is the result of your vote."
"(DE) Mr President, I think that was a technical error - I am truly sorry."
"During the vote, the lights went out on a large number of machines, for example those of Mr Karas and Mr Nassauer, who then wished to complain to you, albeit unaware of the actual result - which I can understand."
"I therefore formally request that you repeat the vote."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, please, let us not quarrel over such an issue; there is enough discord in Europe."
"It was a very close result, and it is true that some machines did not work, including those of Mr Nassauer, Mr Swoboda and others."
"Therefore, I request your consent to repeat the vote."
"(DE) Mr President, I would refer to the standard procedure, whereby anyone whose voting machine has failed to work can place his or her position on the record without the need to repeat the vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the close outcome of the vote and the fact that some machines did not work, I recommend that the vote be repeated."
"(ES) Mr President, the vote has been carried out properly and on time and, as far as I can remember, Mr President, I have never known a vote to be repeated in this House as a result of a machine failing."
"I have never seen that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a consensus was required for the vote to be repeated, and I recommended doing so, but regrettably we have been unable to reach agreement."
"Unfortunately, it has not been possible to obtain your consent."
"According to the legal situation, then, the vote has taken place."
"Nevertheless, I give you the floor, Mrs Scheele."
"(DE) Mr President, the light was on when we voted, and suddenly all the lights disappeared."
"This is different from when machines are not working and we have to inform the technicians."
"The question is whether majorities have to be obtained in this devious way in such an important matter."
"We could carry on discussing this for hours."
"I shall now read out what has been written down for me:"
"The technical people tell us that there was a technical problem."
"In fact they closed the vote a bit earlier than I announced it was closed."
"If the technicians say they closed the vote before the President announced it was closed, I have to declare it invalid."
"We shall therefore repeat the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the motion)"
"(The agenda was therefore adopted)"
"Definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Horst Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks C6-0440/2005"
"Mr President, honourable Members, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, who wishes to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, and the members of the various committees involved in drawing up this excellent report."
"She also wishes to express her appreciation for the good cooperation between all involved in Parliament and the Council, and to thank the Council for its work."
"As a result of this cooperation, the work has moved smoothly and steadily towards achieving the result of which we are all aware."
"On 15 December 2005, the Commission submitted a proposal for a new regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks."
"Since then, a whole series of discussions have taken place: a public hearing took place in Parliament on 20 July 2006; there were reports from the Committee responsible, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; there were opinions from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"This process has been very intensive and constructive under the codecision procedure."
"A series of informal trialogues took place which led to the Council's general approach, which not only accommodates most of the Member States' concerns, but also reflects the European Parliament's powers of codecision by taking the vast majority of its proposals on board."
"One proposal in particular that has been taken on board is the abolition of the initial proposal for the categorisation of spirit drinks; secondly, the introduction of a strong quality policy for spirit drinks; thirdly, the withdrawal of the proposal to allow flavours to be added to eau de vie; and fourthly, the strengthening of the powers of the European Parliament by introducing the regulatory committee with scrutiny procedures in most of the cases for which provision is made for comitology."
"Those are just a few of the essential amendments which were introduced on the initiative of the European Parliament."
"During this whole procedure, my colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, has played a constructive and pragmatic role with a view to finding a result that we hope the European Parliament will be able to endorse."
"In line with the international obligations deriving from the TBT Agreement and following the Council's request of 23 April 2007, the Commission sent the file to the WTO, setting a two-month period for comments."
"This notification was formally made on 1 June 2007."
"As regards vodka, the Commission still has some reservations at this stage, which are primarily of a legal nature. The Commission has always taken a clear stance that it must ensure that a definition of vodka is compatible with EU law and fits the WTO context."
"The definition of the raw-material bases for this popular product - which is enjoying considerable market buoyancy worldwide - has been subject to considerable debate in the last month."
"The general approach of the Council distinguishes the labelling of vodka between one group based on potatoes and cereals, and those products which are derived from other raw materials which shall bear the indication 'produced from' and list the products that go into it."
"The Commission's legal service has expressed concern about the compatibility of this solution both with EU law and with WTO obligations."
"Any restriction of the present legislation needs to be duly justified and proportionate; the least intrusive way has to be found to serve this goal."
"So my colleague would like to conclude with these words: 'For the time being, let me congratulate the Council Presidency and Parliament for their very successful collaboration, which I hope will be endorsed as a first-reading agreement by Parliament in view of a final adoption once the WTO notification procedure has been brought to an end in two months' time'."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you all heard what the Commissioner said, which, I can honestly say, expressed my feelings exactly."
"All of us in this room heard it, and we shall take it into account during tomorrow's vote, too."
"What was the starting point?"
"When we held the hearing on 26 June of last year, we soon found that there were very great differences in the implementation of the Regulation."
"The Council was divided, Parliament was divided, and we really wondered how all this was to be overcome."
"I regard the fact that we have before us today a compromise involving the Council, the Commission and sections of Parliament - after first reading, mark you - as rather sensational, considering the starting situation."
"It is a result for all those involved, and so I should like to thank the Commission, the Council and those fellow Members who have helped to work on it: Mrs McAvan, Mr Schlyter, and Mr Maaten of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to name but a few."
"Not only did this come together at the drawing board, it was also the result of a clear vote in committee: 58 votes in favour to only 2 against, with 2 abstentions - that was a result we could build on."
"As the Commissioner said, many of Parliament's proposals have been implemented."
"We already agreed back then that the quality of the Regulation had to be improved, it had to include more consumer information, and it had to be brought into line with the internal market."
"This Regulation was necessary. There had been two regulations and many Acts of Accession, but they could not achieve all this."
"How wonderful - there is no system of categories."
"We are not classifying spirit drinks according to quality - that would have been a very bad thing - but in the field of quality we do have a ban on flavouring spirits."
"This means that it is forbidden to add flavourings to spirits."
"I once said, exaggerating somewhat, that I wanted to see spirit drinks falling under the Regulation on spirit drinks, not containing so many chemicals that they ended up under the Regulation on chemicals."
"What is important, however, is the protection of producers who use proper methods, and we cannot allow - to exaggerate - the production of spirit drinks to become the preparation of toxic cocktails."
"The issue of sweetening is another that was pushed through by Parliament."
"I should like to say to the Commission now that, when we discuss sweetening under the extended comitology procedure, we shall take great care that the addition of sugar is kept within reasonable bounds."
"Figures have been mentioned: 20 grams per litre, which corresponds to five teaspoons."
"I have to say that tea with five teaspoons of sugar added starts to lose its appeal!"
"We shall keep an eye on this."
"The methanol content of 50 grams per hectolitre in the old Regulation has been reduced to 10 grams per hectolitre."
"This had been a health problem."
"The hydrocyanic acid content of stone-fruit marc spirit has been reduced by 3 grams to 7 grams per hectolitre of pure alcohol."
"These are achievements that cannot be praised enough."
"The new proposal also reflects traditional methods."
"We have been at pains to ensure, in particular, that traditionally produced products can continue to be produced."
"That is a very important point."
"Moving on, now, to vodka: a very contentious issue."
"I could have lived with the Commission proposal that the raw-material basis of vodka always be included on the label; but the traditional producing countries, for example Poland and Finland, objected."
"I took account of these objections, which related to traditions, and said: in that case, we shall exempt potatoes and cereals from the labelling requirement, and only the other agricultural raw materials used to produce vodka must be stated."
"That was the right solution as, when I look at the amendments that have been tabled and hear what the Commissioner has to say, I can already tell that all the amendments stating otherwise will fail to gain any support from within the Council, the Commission or the WTO."
"We are right to exempt these two products from the labelling requirement, in order to take account of traditions in Poland and Finland."
"We must not be tempted to introduce legislative amendments banning the manufacture of products when there is no basis for this in either health considerations or internal-market rules or consumer-protection rules."
"That would be taking things too far."
"We have always done things that way in previous legislation, too."
"Therefore, I would appeal to you to support the compromise tomorrow."
"There is no alternative compromise."
"Failure to adopt the present proposal will render all the other parts of the compromise invalid."
"The Commission will then try again to enforce its ideas, which were strongly contested, the Council will start quarrelling again, and we shall have no regulation for the coming years."
"I should like to point that out so that no one tries to say later on that they would have voted differently if I had only told them that."
"That is the reason for my request."
"I look forward to the discussion."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his patience above all else."
"The spirit industry is extremely important to us, creating jobs, status, export and tax revenue."
"Therefore it has been important to update the 1989-1990 regulations, to bring greater clarity and greater legal certainty to improve the definition of the main spirit drinks and to resolve any problems with spirits with a quasi-geographical indication status."
"What we now have is a proper registration system for geographical indication, which is important, and I am glad we have got rid of the three categories of spirits."
"We have now ended up with something that is compatible with the WTO and TRIPS, which ensures smooth running in the internal market, prevents fraud and counterfeiting, protects the consumer and does not underplay and undermine solid, long-established industries, such as the second biggest vodka producer in Europe - the United Kingdom - where in Scotland vodka is such an important industry."
"That is why we must support these proposals."
"I think the Commission proposal was better than the compromise, but it is important to move forward with the compromise on vodka, bearing in mind geographical indications will protect forever Polish vodka, Finnish vodka, Swedish vodka, Lithuanian vodka, and so on."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we have to take decisions about food legislation and end up encroaching on territory which people and Member States believe to form part of their own individuality and tradition, then it has never been easy to reach sound agreements."
"The fact that Mr Schnellhardt has managed to do exactly that for this regulation on spirit drinks deserves the respect of us all."
"We need a fresh regulation, because the present one is no longer up to date, technologically speaking and because it requires clarification in the area of the WTO rules and also further to the recent enlargement."
"Mr Schnellhardt has achieved a widely supported agreement in this House and with the Council, which will bring us better consumer protection, allow our European products to occupy a clearly defined position on the global market within the WTO framework and also promote the smooth running of the internal market."
"Moreover - and this is not insignificant - it recognises, by means of labelling and the system of geographical designations among other things, the specificity of each product, although there are still doubts among some, not least in our group, about the vodka provisions."
"Here too, though, the rapporteur has done a sterling job by requiring that, if vodka is made from raw materials other than grain or potatoes, this raw material should be indicated on the label next to the product name."
"In doing so, we are using techniques that have been used before with great success."
"Years ago, in relation to beer and chocolate, we held a similar discussion on traditions, values, interests of suppliers of raw materials and of large and small producers; when those discussions were over, we reached a compromise much like Mr Schnellhardt's present compromise with the Council."
"This is why I would urge all those doubting Thomases among you to revisit the compromise and to give it your backing if possible."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the Socialist Group will be supporting the trialogue compromise and all its elements, as outlined by the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt."
"I should like to thank him for all his hard work and, like Mr Titley, his patience, because this has become a very complex dossier and one on which emotions have started to run high."
"We are supporting this compromise because we want the European drinks industry to have high-quality products for consumers and we want to protect our industry on the world markets."
"What we do not want to do with this legislation is to give one country's type of production an advantage over another country's type of production."
"That is not the aim of the legislation."
"There is room for all European producers, as long as they meet high quality standards."
"That brings me to the vodka compromise."
"I think it is a good compromise."
"Why?"
"Because, as Mr Schnellhardt has said, for the first time it recognises that there is a special place for traditional manufacturers using cereals and potatoes."
"But, at the same time, it allows other long-standing producers of vodka to continue to market their products on the European market - and they will be labelled."
"We cannot have a situation as proposed by some of the amendments which seek to take certain European producers off the market."
"That would never get a majority in this House and would never get a majority in the Council."
"Everybody has to work in a spirit of compromise and what we have got on the table has something for everybody."
"We have also got to work with facts."
"It is simply not true that the compromise on vodka would allow you to make vodka, for example, from animal waste, as has been circulated again in this House today."
"That is not true."
"It is made from very high-quality agricultural products."
"I want to say something to the British Conservatives about vodka."
"I understand from their press release last week they are not supporting the compromise now and they have accused Labour of selling the British vodka industry down the river."
"I have to say that this is vital for European jobs, it is vital for the drinks industry, which employs 60 000 people, and has the support of British industry as well as European vodka producers and other drinks manufacturers."
"I can see surprise from some Members."
"I hope we will have this clarified because I have the press release here."
"Finally, it is not just about vodka, it is about high-quality drinks."
"Many colleagues from different countries have come to Mr Schnellhardt, myself and other colleagues and asked for certain changes because of their traditional production."
"All those things have been met."
"The Council and the Commission have been very helpful and I very much hope that tomorrow, after, as Mr Titley has said, 18 years have passed since we started trying to get this legislation on the statute book, we just go ahead and do it and protect European jobs."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the discussion on the Schnellhardt report is being hijacked by the discussion on vodka, which is unfortunate, because it is a report that says so much more in many areas that are so crucial to Europe and to this industry in Europe."
"This is why I should like to single out a number of those other points."
"The directive's first concern is, of course, the quality of the European drinks industry."
"It also says something about Europe, because wherever you go in the world, we see European drinks, distilled in Europe, available in all shapes and sizes, and with a recognition of the quality which we produce in Europe."
"This is important in a situation in which not everything that is said about Europe is always positive, because this is something in which Europe excels."
"What the rapporteur has done is to reinforce this very element, more so, it has to be said, in his original report than in the compromise which was eventually struck with the Council."
"It is, to my mind, a fantastic achievement and something we should hold onto."
"Distillation is a craft, a truly traditional craft."
"Anyone who visits distilleries - and I recently visited some gin distilleries in my own country - can see for themselves that it is a craft."
"It is an art to make these products well and in a way that the quality is retained at all times."
"This is without a doubt the most important element in this report."
"Rather than adding sugar or flavourings at random, we have clear definitions for these drinks, even very strict definitions, not least at the industry's request."
"This is how consumers receive sound information about the product."
"They know what they buy, and can rely on the fact that what they are getting is quality."
"This directive also allows the European drinks industry, thanks to this quality, to remain a strong contender in the competition."
"It also says something about Europe, namely about the regional origin of many of these drinks."
"In this respect, this directive is almost like a microcosm of the European Union, as it demonstrates the diversity of the European Union and how we together, in this very diversity, can all still be European."
"This too is very important to my mind."
"I will now briefly turn to the subject of vodka, on which the rapporteur has tried to reach a compromise which received my wholehearted support during the discussion."
"He has, as I see it, made a valiant attempt at trying to strike a sound compromise between the old vodka industries in the European Union, which existed at the time the definition was drafted - even before Sweden, Finland, Poland and all the other countries joined the Union - and these more recent Member States, and has done a reasonable job of it."
"Despite this, most of my group are in favour of a much stricter definition of vodka, and I have to say that their arguments are valid."
"This is why it is good that this issue is on the table, so that it can be thrashed out."
"Firstly, as regards consumer information, my group takes the view that every consumer must be able to rely on the fact that vodka is made from potatoes or cereals - these are of the essence - and sugar beet perhaps."
"As the majority in my group see it, consumers should be able to take this as read."
"It goes further than this though."
"This is not just about the product."
"There is also a discussion about the individuality and identity of the countries where it is produced."
"After all, what would our reaction have been if this discussion with these countries had been held before?"
"Would we have said: for the sake of consumer information, it is also possible to introduce onto the market cognac made from potatoes or whiskey made from grapes?"
"No, of course we would never have done this, and my group wants us to be consistent in the case of vodka too."
"They have a point, of course."
"I would like to see us reach agreement at first reading."
"I welcome the fact that this argument is on the table, and in this respect, I support my group's amendment."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, objections have been raised concerning the proposal for a regulation on spirit drinks for a number of reasons."
"First of all, broadening the definition of vodka to include spirit drinks based on raw ingredients other than those traditionally used infringes the law and is damaging to the economic interests of current vodka producers and consumers."
"Secondly, as a result of the proposed changes, the new Member States will yet again lose out."
"Poland, one of the main vodka producers in the European Union and the world, will be particularly affected."
"Thirdly, this move will be yet another blow for farmers who grow cereal crops, potatoes and beet."
"They will not have the slightest chance of compensating for their losses with other crops."
"Fourthly, the name 'vodka' is a trade name, linked with a specific product that is manufactured according to a specific recipe and using specific ingredients, namely grain, potatoes and beet molasses."
"Any product made from other raw ingredients will be a different product."
"Therefore, it cannot be labelled as 'vodka'."
"It has to have its own, distinct name."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, I wish, above all, to thank Mr Schnellhardt for the piece of work that we now have and that demanded so much patience."
"What patience we have all shown towards the lobbyists of the spirits industry!"
"It will be a great relief to be rid of them."
"This package is really all about we politicians regulating sales advantages through origin marking and similar measures."
"That being said, I nonetheless think that even when it comes to spirits - which are not in themselves useful products that politicians should encourage - origin marking and similar measures may have a large role to play in defending local patterns of production against unfair competition."
"What I think we have so far forgotten to talk about in the debate is the work we have done to reduce the sugar content of spirits and the use of synthetic flavourings and colorants."
"That is also an important aim of the compromise: to produce a smaller quantity of synthetic spirits."
"We now move on to vodka."
"Incidentally, I have tabled an amendment, number 149, designed to stop all traditionally unsweetened types of spirit from being sweetened."
"Let us return to vodka, however."
"The compromise arrived at states that grain and potatoes are the basis for vodka and that the product should be labelled accordingly if it is made of anything else."
"If producers begin to cheat where labelling is concerned and try to evade the issue and sell non-traditional vodka as ordinary vodka, we shall have to come back to this issue, as it is not intended that they should do that."
"If vodka is made of anything other than grain or potatoes, this must be stated on the bottle."
"Sugar beet has been added in the amendments designed to afford still more protection to vodka."
"It is not traditional in my country to make vodka from sugar beet."
"Why should I support amendments that add sugar beet and put it on a par with grain and potatoes?"
"I am therefore voting against those amendments."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his sterling efforts in drawing up this report."
"I feel that he was able, despite initial difficulties, to strike a balance, and reach a compromise in terms both of technology and of the various national interests."
"I should like to highlight two points, the first of which is the definition of vodka."
"In our proceedings in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety I have already said that we should not succumb to the pressure that has been brought to bear by the so-called traditional producers."
"It is my firm belief that the argument so often put forward that we should have the same precise definition of what raw materials vodka can be made from as we do for whiskey and rum, is not entirely valid."
"After all, the technology of vodka-making is completely different."
"I therefore feel that the current definition of vodka is workable and sufficient."
"With regard to the current situation and to the opinions of the traditional producers, I feel that the compromise definition in point 145 of the report could be a solution, and as shadow rapporteur I recommend that at least some MEPs from my group should support it."
"I cannot finish without mentioning the definition of slivovice, a specific issue for the Czech Republic."
"Mr Schnellhardt knows that there was a technical oversight, and that the Committee on the Environment..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on the compromise that is before us."
"It has been some time coming, but with this result, there is a good chance of an agreement at first reading."
"I am delighted that the point that I have mentioned during the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has been accepted."
"It concerns the ambiguous clause of creating the impression that there is mention of a certain age on the label."
"I am pleased that this clause has now been scrapped, because in this way, the Dutch young gin and old gin remain safeguarded."
"Indeed, this indication of gin refers to the preparation method of the gin and not the age."
"I should like to finish off with a brief comment about vodka."
"Whilst I, as a Dutchman, am not used to drinking much vodka, I do sympathise with my Eastern European colleagues."
"This is why I have decided to back the vodka definition in which only potatoes, cereals and sugar beet can be used as raw materials."
"Further to the rapporteur's appeal, I will give this matter some more thought."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, I welcome the fact that our discussion here and now on labelling, designations of origin and the production of spirit drinks is based on a workable compromise that is clearly suitable for preserving tradition and the typical national means of producing spirit drinks across Europe."
"However, I should like to make a few observations on a related problem."
"The age at which people are starting not only to smoke but also to drink alcohol has fallen."
"In the case of the former, the EU has already brought itself to undertake common action and also campaigns to strengthen young people's self-confidence."
"It is time we did the same in the case of the latter, in my opinion."
"What a drink is called is probably of secondary importance as far as young consumers are concerned, and will probably not make any difference to the problem."
"For example, the introduction of a special tax on alcopops only led people to switch to beer and to wine-based pre-mixed drinks, which explains why the number of young people drinking themselves into a coma has not gone down."
"Young people are probably not drinking any more than before; the reasons for alcohol consumption have not changed."
"What are significant, however, are the break-up of social structures such as the traditional family, the increasing isolation of young people in front of the television or computer screen, and often the lack of alternatives."
"High-quality production of spirit drinks across Europe is an important matter."
"On the other hand, however, there is no doubt that the protection of young people from related problems is just as important."
"(SK) First of all, let me express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for his work on this topic."
"I would also like to praise the work of several Polish Members in connection with the drafting of amendments aimed at protecting the vodka tradition, which has long been a speciality of Eastern European countries."
"These amendments were also aimed at protecting customary, time-honoured methods of production which date back to the 15th century, and which should be employed in accordance with the traditions of the countries that were the first to produce such beverages."
"The biggest 'apple of discord' in this report is the definition of vodka, namely what ingredients the beverage must contain in order to be designated as vodka."
"Throughout the centuries, vodka has been defined in Eastern European countries as a spirit made from grain, potatoes or sugar-beet molasses."
"To reiterate the point, since vodka is a speciality of the countries of Eastern, rather than Western, Europe, I would ask my colleagues from other countries to respect the definition and not to expand it to include citrus-flavoured spirits, etc. These and different spirits, which are the specialities of other countries, need another designation, primarily to prevent attempts at misleading customers."
"(SK) Member States rightfully take pride in the fact that long-established methods of production and processing raw materials are respected, recognised and protected when applied to traditional designations, such as cognac, champagne, Scottish whiskey, rum, port wine, etc. These are conventional terms, and it is natural that manufacturers have clear definitions of the technological processes used in production and, similarly, of the primary raw materials."
"It is only natural that manufacturers from traditional countries of origin jealously and carefully guard these definitions."
"For that reason, Slovak producers, for example, had to replace the word 'rum' with a different designation, because the Slovak beverage was not made from sugar cane using the original method."
"In other words, manufacturers from the new Member States paid their harmonisation dues long ago."
"Now we are facing a situation where it is mostly the EU 15 Member States that must show that they can behave in a fair and proper manner and consistently comply with the same requirements that in the past were imposed on us."
"The matter at hand is vodka, as has been discussed here."
"All of a sudden we are witnessing a requirement to designate as vodka second- and third-rate spirits made of bananas and other fruits."
"Consumers will then be misled into believing that they are drinking vodka and will stop buying the genuine product."
"This will harm the bona fide producers that follow the tradition and make vodka exclusively from the appropriate raw materials."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in Finland, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and all other Scandinavian countries, the designation vodka may traditionally be granted only and exclusively to a product made from either grain or potatoes."
"Therefore, I ask you to take this into account and to subscribe to these arguments during the vote."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss the report on the labelling of alcohol, we should take into account not only the technical aspects and the need to ensure the transparency of the European market, but also the fact that the production and drinking of alcohol is often linked to local traditions and customs."
"European legislation should therefore not in any way restrict these traditions and customs and certainly not prohibit them."
"In my country, the Czech Republic, slivovice is one of the traditional drinks."
"Maintaining traditional methods of producing slivovice is guaranteed under the country's treaties of accession to the EU and should therefore not be undermined, certainly not by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I should therefore like to call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support Amendment 144 tomorrow in the vote, and to rectify the mistake that has crept into the report."
"Please lend your support to this tradition, which is not just a Czech and Moravian drink, but also a wonderful European one."
"(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two reasons why it is important to preserve the traditional definition of vodka: the historically significant regional aspect and the consumer aspect."
"In the Nordic countries and in many of the EU's new Member States, we have a long, Slavic-inspired history and tradition of vodka production, in which alcohol is manufactured from potatoes and grain."
"Champagne and cognac are strictly defined."
"It must be possible for the same rule to apply to vodka - the spirit produced from grain or potatoes."
"If no one knows what vodka is, we cannot make informed choices."
"Consumers are entitled to expect vodka to be based on certain ingredients, just as we all expect wine to be produced from grapes, and gin from juniper berries."
"If we agree that any old alcohol produced from, for example, bananas or grapes may be called vodka, the consumer knows that ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, today, after many months of work and lively debate involving representatives of alcohol and raw ingredients producers, as well as distributors and consumers, we are discussing Mr Schnellhardt's report."
"Unfortunately, the solutions put forward in this report have been universally criticised, and satisfy no one."
"Products have been artificially divided into three categories, where the vodka category contains no vodkas."
"Instead, this group includes brandy, whisky, rum, aquavit, and could easily also include our bootleg or moonshine vodka."
"Splitting alcohols up according to specific names gives the impression that we are involved in subliminal advertising rather than trying to find a solution to this problem."
"There is no logic in how this matter is being dealt with."
"As a result, and in spite of my sincere wishes and best intentions, I have to agree with the dissenting voices in this House and vote against this report."
"Mr President, as a Scots MEP I have an obvious interest in any regulation that relates to whisky."
"However, we also have other national drinks, including a very significant economic interest in vodka and gin distillation and bottling."
"The debates in which I have taken part in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have been interesting, at times heated, and I have argued strongly for a flexible definition of 'vodka'."
"Some say that spirits should be treated the same, but vodka and whisky are not the same, and this proposal simply has to recognise that fact."
"Vodka has traditionally been made from different ingredients in different areas;"
"Scotch whisky is a product of centuries of traditional practice, by contrast."
"The first reference to Scotch whisky in Scotland was in Exchequer records in 1494/95."
"The first taxes were imposed in 1644."
"Some spirits have traditionally been rounded off using sugar."
"Scotch whisky has not, and this regulation must not allow that to happen."
"Protecting the term 'Scotch whisky', as well as the methods of production under geographic definition, is extremely important for Scotland for obvious reasons."
"Some details still have to be underlined in the technical files, and I look forward to that."
"However, this first-reading compromise - the product of lengthy and very heated exchanges - is something that, in the spirit of that compromise, I am now prepared to accept, and I hope that the House will accept it tomorrow."
"(SV) We are now to adopt a definition of vodka."
"My question is: why?"
"As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I wish to devote all my time and energy not to defining varieties of spirit but to working for a better environment and better public health."
"Public health is genuinely threatened."
"Europe is far and away the continent on which more alcohol is consumed than anywhere else in the world."
"In my own country, Sweden, consumption has increased by more than 30% since we became Members of the EU."
"All that a definition sanctioned by the EU will do is paint a picture of vodka as something desirable."
"It is not desirable."
"Vodka is a form of alcohol, which is dangerous in unduly high quantities."
"If there is to be a definition of vodka, cannot the industry itself come up with it?"
"With all due respect to the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, the business of coming up with a definition of vodka should be referred back to the place where most of it is produced and where the manufacturers can sit and produce as many definitions as they like."
"We politicians have other things to do."
"Mr President, I would like to put aside my prepared text and respond to some of my colleagues who spoke earlier in the debate."
"Mrs McAvan tells us that this measure is designed to protect jobs, yet to the extent that it either bans or qualifies the use of the word 'vodka' for existing brands and existing manufacturers, it seems likely to have exactly the reverse effect."
"Mr Maaten asks if we have not been to see a distillery which is a craft industry."
"Well, Mr Maaten, yes I have."
"I worked in the industry for several years and I can tell you that a malt whisky distillery is indeed a craft industry, but a vodka or grain whisky distillery is an industrial process and the process for producing vodka produces pure alcohol whether you make it from sugar or from potatoes or from anything else."
"All this talk about consumer protection is nonsense."
"The product is identical and the reason we should not compare vodka with whisky - or brandy, as has been rightly pointed out by my colleague on the other side of the Chamber - is because in those products, the ingredients significantly affect the flavour."
"Whisky is only whisky if it is made in the proper way, but vodka is based on pure alcohol."
"If I may make a general point, we should not be seeking to change the established meanings of words by legislation."
"However, in this case the compromise proposed by the rapporteur seems to be the best outcome on offer so I suppose that we must reluctantly support it."
"As happens so often in the European Union, we have to make the best of a bad job."
"Mr President, as Mr Helmer has pointed out, and just to clarify for the House, the UK Conservatives are indeed supporting Mr Schnellhardt's amendment on vodka."
"The issue which our Scandinavian and Polish colleagues appear to be banking on now is the old equality-with-whisky argument."
"I have heard people in the House this evening saying that that we could possibly have a situation where whisky is going to be made out of grapes."
"Well I have to say that these arguments are completely bogus."
"We are trying to define these products for the benefit of consumers to ensure that what is in the bottle conforms to their expectations of what a whisky or a vodka should be."
"As distillers will tell you, if you distil at a lower alcoholic strength, more taste comes over the still."
"Spirits like whisky are distilled at a low strength and derive their taste from the raw materials."
"Other spirits like vodka are distilled at a high strength and may then even be filtered through charcoal to remove the taste of the raw materials."
"Our Nordic colleagues and their allies are trying to have it both ways."
"They are asking us to define a product not by reference to its characteristics or by reference to what the consumers expect, but by reference to the raw materials that their producers currently use."
"It is interesting that they have not sought to include sulphite waste, which was the predominant raw material in Sweden in the 1920s, nor apples, nor coal and yellow turnips, which have all been used in Poland in the past."
"Parliament should not be in the business of defining products so as to exclude producers and distort competition."
"We should be protecting the consumer, and it is for that reason that we support the approach being taken by Dr Schnellhardt, which avoids artificial restrictions on production while ensuring that consumers are adequately informed."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his outstanding report and to commend all those who helped improve on the Commission's proposal to update the law on spirit drinks, with a view to making the text clearer, simpler and easier to implement for companies and consumers needing more and better information in order to make informed choices."
"The two regulations currently applicable must be brought under one regulation, in order to simplify the law and to adopt a clear policy on spirit drinks. Regulations must be adapted to the new WTO requirements, and criteria for the recognition of the new geographical indications must be defined."
"Lastly, I should like to say that the new regulation, with the contributions from Parliament, which I hope will be adopted, will help extend international knowledge of drinks that help reinforce the identity of many European regions. In particular - if I may say so - the regulation will enhance the quality and value of European rum from overseas territories and Madeira, allowing promoters ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, would the French agree to Champagne made from plums?"
"Would the British be pleased if they were permitted to make apricot gin and peach whisky?"
"Of course they would not."
"That would be tantamount to heresy."
"Therefore, I am not surprised that the Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Swedes, Finns and Danes do not want to recognise as vodka some waste products from the manufacture of wine, whisky or gin."
"Let us call a spade a spade."
"Is the European Parliament to be held hostage by powerful lobby groups representing alcohol manufacturers from southern Europe or the United Kingdom?"
"Do we want public opinion in our countries to decide that our Parliament serves as a 'transmission belt' for economic lobby groups from various countries and sectors?"
"If we do not want this to happen, let us not agree to this ridiculous, broad definition of vodka."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Schnellhardt for his excellent work."
"I think he has really produced a workable compromise that we should all support tomorrow."
"We should bear in mind that this discussion is not about old versus new Member States."
"Nor is it about good versus bad alcohol, or about capital versus labour."
"It is about our producing a new version of the Regulation on spirit drinks to adapt it to the current state of affairs."
"This means we want our consumers to be offered good, correctly labelled products."
"If the discussion is now reduced to the vodka issue, we must ask ourselves, firstly, if this is justified and, secondly, what is behind this."
"It is very presumptuous, however, to assert that, if alcohol is distilled so much that it loses all taste, the starting point of the raw materials is crucial to the product's designation."
"Therefore, we would do well to simply adapt to the state of affairs prevailing in Europe - that vodka is already being produced everywhere, even if it may have had its origins in Poland - rather than throwing out the baby with the bath water."
"We should bear in mind that we have achieved a great deal."
"We have improved consumer protection, and we have also, for example, made it possible for traditional products to be labelled more appropriately."
"That is why I am convinced that this is a really good compromise."
"My thanks once more to Mr Schnellhardt!"
"We should all support this tomorrow."
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, wish to congratulate the rapporteur."
"The compromise ensures that spirit drinks will be less synthetic in future, which means that we shall see higher quality in the various spirit drinks."
"The compromise also takes account of national interests: as an Austrian, 'Jagatee' is of course a particular concern of mine."
"No one in this House can escape the discussion on the definition of vodka."
"I have yet to grasp why many speakers have been acting as though there had been no definition of vodka up to now, and the term 'vodka' were now too broad."
"The opposite is the case."
"The European Union does already have a definition of vodka, and Parliament's compromise, for which the rapporteur is primarily responsible, is accommodating towards traditional vodka producers - if just a few countries were concerned, which, as we have heard today, is not the case."
"The House should bear that in mind when it comes to tomorrow's vote."
"(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 1989, when the definition and labelling of alcoholic beverages was introduced, there have been many changes."
"Some traditional spirit-producing countries have become members of the European Union."
"First there was Sweden and Finland, and now the countries of the second-to-the-last round of expansion - the Baltic countries and Poland."
"It is from the North that the name vodka derives from, and the traditional methods for manufacturing this spirit."
"Traditionally, vodka has always been manufactured from grain."
"In some places it is also made from potatoes and sugar beets."
"Now that traditional vodka-producing countries have become EU members, we would like to see that namely alcoholic spirit beverages made from grain, potatoes and sugar beets be called vodka and be labelled as such."
"A consumer needs to know what whisky is, and what it is made from."
"A consumer has the right to buy a product made according to the original and traditional recipes and from traditional ingredients."
"If this is applicable to whisky, then why can it not be applied to vodka?"
"I urge my colleagues to vote for a fair compromise: vodka - only from grain, potatoes and sugar beets."
"(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the debate on the labelling of alcohol I should like to inform the House of a problem that is overshadowed by the debate over vodka, but that has particular significance for the citizens of the Czech Republic in economic, political and cultural terms."
"I refer to slivovice a traditional Moravian alcoholic drink made from fruit, most commonly from plums."
"This drink came under threat when the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Feed Safety most unfortunately meddled in its definition, which is enshrined in the Accession Treaty of the Czech Republic."
"I feel that this was done by mistake rather than deliberately, but it is an unfortunate example of politicians' meddling."
"Because mistakes must be rectified, I would call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the amendment on slivovice, on which I worked with Mr Horst Schnellhardt and which almost all groups have said they will support."
"I should like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his willingness to reach solutions that would return the definition of slivovice to a model that corresponds to its traditions."
"In the same way that Scandinavians closely follow the development of vodka, it is a priority for Czech people that slivovice should continue to take the form of a pure fruit spirit so that the characteristic flavour is not distorted by the addition of various ingredients."
"Last but not least, there is a political dimension to all of this which should not be overlooked and which arises from the fact that the definition of slivovice became part of the accession negotiations and was enshrined in the Accession Treaty."
"The violation of an Accession Treaty would undoubtedly lead to a breakdown of trust between the EU institutions and the Member State concerned, not to mention the fact that a dangerous precedent would be set, which, in some cases, might affect other Member States."
"Given that our citizens take a lively interest in the fate of slivovice, our lawmakers should show a similar interest."
"Let us therefore take a much-needed step towards protecting slivovice by adopting the amendment in question."
"(PL) Mr President, although the report on the labelling of spirit drinks deals with over 30 different kinds of beverages, I would like to focus on the most controversial issue, namely that of the definition of vodka."
"The currently binding definition of vodka was drawn up many years before the main vodka producers joined the European Union."
"Thanks to them, the European Union is the third largest vodka producer in the world."
"Parliament should therefore adopt a definition of vodka that would secure the reputation and leading market position of this spirit drink."
"Maintaining the current definition of vodka and allowing it to be produced from waste material will lower its quality and have a negative impact on its reputation."
"The trade name 'vodka' should be reserved only for vodka that is produced from traditional ingredients, namely grain, potatoes and beet molasses."
"This was the definition adopted by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Vodka made from ingredients other than the ones traditionally used should be given a specific market name, such as 'non-traditional vodka', 'vodka-style spirit drink' or 'non-standard vodka', with the name of the raw ingredients used in its production clearly stated on the label."
"If this is not done, we will be cheating both ourselves and the consumers."
"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to invite you all to today's food and wine tasting event to promote Polish organic foods, including cold meats, juices and vodka made from grain and potatoes."
"(FR) Mr President, since a lot has been said about whisky and vodka, I shall say something about rum, which is produced in only two places within the European Union, those being the French overseas départements and Madeira."
"Since a great deal of it is drunk throughout Europe, it is imported from numerous third countries, primarily from ACP countries which enjoy special treatment under the 2000 Cotonou Agreement."
"Rum is one of the overseas départements' main export products, and the sugar cane rum industry alone accounts for over 40% of the value of exports from Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion, and for 40 000 jobs created there."
"Where the Community's definition of rum is concerned, then, a great deal is at stake; rum from the French overseas territories needs to be defined in a way that makes it possible for it to be better distinguished from its third-country competitors, specifically by describing it as 'agricultural rum' derived exclusively from sugar cane juice, something that consumers recognise as a sign of quality."
"It is no less important, in the eyes of the ACP countries, that this definition be consistent with the EU's overall approach to their rum industry if their growth is to be sustained and if the progress made to date by the Caribbean producers is not to be jeopardised."
"It was with this in mind that the professional bodies representing producers in the French overseas départements and in the Caribbean countries agreed, in October 2006, at La Barbade, on a common position on the Community definition of rum, taking as the basis for it a generic definition and going on to draw progressive distinctions between traditional rum, agricultural rum and rum refined from sugar."
"I would like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for taking on board my request for an adequate definition of agricultural rum and for finally deciding to include in his report the definition of it already to be found in the Council's compromise text."
"It has been a considerable amount of work, over a long period of time, on the part of the whole industry that has made it possible to promote the production of agricultural rum, so that the denomination, today, is one of the principal guarantors of this French overseas product's entry onto commercial markets, and it is this that makes it possible to hope that the compromise submitted today for this House's approval will be adopted at first reading."
"(SV) We Swedish Social Democrats support the compromise on the definition of vodka, and for the same reasons that the Swedish centre-right government does so in the Council of Ministers."
"We do so because it is the best solution available to Swedish consumers and producers in that it accords an exceptional status to vodka produced in the manner in which we Swedes expect it to be produced, namely from potatoes or grain."
"If the compromise disintegrates, there will be no special status accorded to vodka made from potatoes or grain, and consumers will still be unclear as to what they are getting when they buy vodka."
"People may be wondering why the EU has to decide on how vodka should be marketed."
"We do, of course, have a common internal market in the EU, and we therefore also have common rules governing what may be sold in this market and in which ways."
"Democracy should set limits on the market, including on the ways in which different products may be marketed."
"However, I deeply regret the fact that not even a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety could support my amendments with regard to putting warning labels on alcohol."
"I intend to return to that issue."
"Mr President, I have two points and one surprise."
"The vodka belt has three arguments."
"The first is culture and tradition: we have made vodka out of potatoes and grain for over 500 years."
"The second is equal treatment: when we joined the Union in 1995, we were told that vodka would have a tight definition, just like rum, whisky or grappa, or in line with some of the more traditional geographic definitions, for instance, of champagne and cognac."
"We therefore want equal treatment for vodka."
"We do not want it to be some kind of alcoholic waste basket."
"The third is consumption and production: we know what we are talking about - seven countries produce 70% of the vodka and consume 70% of the vodka."
"To Mr Stevenson, who told me that we are just driving the industry in our own country, I would point out that Mr Helmer is defending the same position as the Labour Party, so, Mr Stevenson, do not tell me that you are not driving some kind of grape-vodka industry here!"
"Tomorrow, as a defender of vodka, I will vote for Mr Schnellhardt's overall compromise, but against his compromise on vodka, and for my own amendment on a tighter definition, or indeed for the Liberal ones."
"I hope that all traditionalists will do the same."
"Now we come to my surprise."
"I must admit that I am not a big fan of Poland's Kaczyński brothers."
"However, they have done a wonderful job in this vodka debate."
"They have defended vodka heroically and I hope that this little token of appreciation I am going to send them - a bottle of vodka - will make them soften their position on the Constitution!"
"Thank you very much."
"You have added another element to this multi-faceted, at times technical, and impassioned debate."
"I do not feel that I am the most appropriate recipient of this gift, but I thank you nevertheless."
"(HU) The production and consumption of alcohol are probably as old as humanity itself."
"Hieroglyphics 4-5 000 years old in Egypt and clay tablets in Mesopotamia prove how active the ancients were in this area too."
"Following on from the Greek god Dionysus and the Roman god Bacchus, the tradition of spirit production was given a new boost during the Middle Ages by Christianity."
"The technologies used have improved, while the concepts and labelling have become more precise."
"In my country, Hungary, pálinka, a 100% fruit brandy, was already established as part of our gastronomy at the time of the Renaissance."
"In fact, those technologies and products, the unchanged combination of which we can still enjoy today, were already established across Europe roughly 2-300 years ago."
"However, over the last 50 years, business, advertising and, later on, consumer society itself have completely muddied the clear picture we had up until then."
"The chemical and distilling industries nowadays are continually creating new tastes and aromas, offering an amazing selection of drinks."
"At present, you can basically make everything from anything."
"This has also been accompanied, of course, by traditions being watered down."
"There are already fewer and fewer people who know what it is worth drinking, why and when."
"Ladies and gentlemen! I am conservative when it comes to my political views and gastronomic habits too."
"I like things to be exactly what they are, and not what adverts want you to believe they are."
"This is why I am in favour of a strict definition for every drink, including vodka as well."
"Pálinka is made from fruit and vodka from grain, potatoes or sugar beet."
"It is all perfectly clear like this."
"If we blur the defining lines, we are not just affecting quality, development and our traditions, but we are clouding further the already murky picture."
"In that case, we can easily take the approach George Orwell's hero did in '1984', when he cannot say what he is actually drinking."
"Like everyone else in the book, he too calls that horrible-tasting, foul-smelling dishwater gin."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal aimed to bring about simplification, to combine the two previous regulations into one: and it has done so."
"The second aspect - adapting the regulations to new technical requirements and to the requirements of the WTO and of TRIPS - will also be a success."
"The third objective - the continued validity of existing geographical indications, which can continue to be supplemented in future by additional designations - will also be achieved."
"With some give and take on the part of the individual Member States, that, too, will provide clarity in future."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for the effort he has put into the many difficult negotiations."
"In the dispute over 'Jägertee' or 'Jagertee', Germany has compromised and accepted the term 'Hüttentee' as the German designation."
"All parties must be prepared to take a step closer to one other."
"A great deal of tradition is involved, but mutual tolerance is required."
"By way of explanation, the term 'Champagne' refers to the designation of origin - that is, the regional origin - and has less to do with the ingredients."
"In Germany, we order a 'Klarer'. By this we mean a spirit made from agricultural produce: fruit, grain or potatoes."
"We have taken steps towards ensuring the clear nature of this product, and towards maintaining the economic base of the traditional, often small, distilleries."
"I believe that this, too, will succeed."
"The addition of sweeteners must be regulated, and must be clearly visible on the label."
"For centuries, our distilleries have been producing top-quality spirits without adding flavourings or sugar."
"Labelling constitutes consumer information and ensures a level competitive playing field."
"This also goes for the raw material."
"We made very heavy weather of the definition of 'vodka'."
"The solution - labelling everything that is not produced from potatoes or grain - is a workable compromise and provides clear information, and I ask you to support this compromise."
"(PL) Madam President, first of all, perhaps I can provide you with some information which has not been presented to the House."
"Last week, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejected the compromise proposed by the rapporteur."
"Why was the proposal rejected?"
"The reason was that the group did not agree, by a small majority but a majority nevertheless, with the proposed definition of vodka contained in this proposal."
"By the same token, there was majority support for acknowledging that vodka is traditionally produced from grain, potatoes or beet molasses."
"This was the amendment that I tabled together with my colleague Mr Stubb, and I appeal to you to support it."
"Why this talk of tradition?"
"I would like remind you that countries, or representatives of countries, which have nothing to do with the tradition of vodka production, cannot behave like the conquistadors who came to South America and stole Mayan gold."
"This is our tradition, the tradition of the vodka-producing countries, and it should be acknowledged in the regulation."
"We should be aware that the Council has also put unprecedented pressure on the European Parliament."
"A high-ranking official sent a letter to the representatives of 24 Member States and not only referred to the position of the influential lobby group the European Vodka Alliance, but also failed to send this letter to the representatives of two of the countries most involved in this dispute, namely Poland and Lithuania."
"The opinions of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Economic and Social Committee were not taken into account."
"COPA - COGECA, the European Union farmers' organisations, and the European Union farmers themselves, all support the traditional definition of vodka."
"Why is this the case?"
"The reason is that European potatoes and grain, as well as five hundred years of tradition, should define the value of this product."
"It should not be changed simply due to pressure from lobby groups."
"We demand equal treatment."
"Traditionally produced vodka cannot be compared to other similar spirits."
"That would be contrary to the basic operating principles of the European Union."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"I consider it to be an excellent piece of work."
"This report and this debate have, to say the least, provoked a considerable disagreement between many Members, between groups and within groups."
"I believe that we should support the compromise that has been reached."
"There are other proposals, but they cover what one specific viewpoint holds to the detriment of the other."
"The bottom line should be the quality and the standard of the product."
"Additives are and must be controlled, but you cannot ban products that have been used for a long time."
"We have to be aware of the needs of the spirit industry, as well as of consumer protection."
"As some have said, this has turned out to be a complex report, with some very strong and different points of view, but we must have an acceptable agreement."
"Compromise agreements sometimes dilute the original intention of the directive, but on this occasion I believe that this is the best we can achieve at the present time."
"This is a very important and serious subject and we must get it right."
"The debate on what vodka is has removed some of the importance of this directive and that is unfortunate, but that sometimes occurs in politics."
"I listened to the different contributions and to my two colleagues from Scotland who protested that they have the longest-standing whisky."
"Where I come from in Northern Ireland we have a little product called Bushmills and we would probably have a good debate as to who actually owned the oldest whiskey on the island of Ireland!"
"I shall conclude on that note."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (DA) Madam President, Commissioner, I am draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which has been the advisory committee for this proposal."
"We were almost unanimous in adopting a clear definition to the effect that vodka should be produced from potatoes and grain."
"It was also the intention that there should be extended cooperation on this matter between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that this is not something we have seen much of in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Vodka is a quality product with a very long history, and this is something we should safeguard."
"We should safeguard vodka production in exactly the same way as we safeguard the production of whisky, cognac and all other spirits in Europe."
"What I fail to detect in this Parliament is any respect for those people and countries possessing a culture that includes vodka production."
"It must also be on the basis of short-term interest that vodka is manufactured as an undefined product and as a dumping ground for surplus ingredients."
"The notion, current in recent years, that consumers are indifferent to the ingredients from which vodka is produced is misconceived."
"Consumers want information, more information and yet more information."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday 19 June 2007."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FI) The debate on the Regulation on spirits has culminated in an issue which the Commission pooh-poohed in its proposal: the equal treatment of vodka alongside other strong drinks."
"It would be more accurate to say, however, this is about the equal treatment of European cultures."
"Apart from the fact that the debate on now reminds us of the existence of a European multiculture, it also at the same time shows that there is still much work to be done in the name of unity which respects differences."
"The definition of vodka we are wrangling with is in fact a technical amendment to something we already knew about and found to be good: for centuries vodka has been manufactured almost entirely from grain and potatoes."
"In the EU 90% of all vodka has also been produced from these raw materials."
"When it comes to defining the ingredients, it is therefore not just a question of the interests of manufacturers and artificial market barriers, but of tradition."
"The vodka-producing countries, in which 70% of vodka is produced and consumed, do actually know what they are talking about."
"The compromise by the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, which in practice would permit the manufacture of vodka from any agricultural product, as long as there is a small mention of it on the label at the back, is inadequate."
"If we have to end up with a compromise, it should give greater support to the traditional manufacturing method."
"The EU's common identity and the legislation that supports that notion must be built on mutual respect, where historical facts are recognised."
"Our current legislation on spirits is from a time when the vodka-producing countries were not members of the EU, and so it needs to be updated."
"During the accession negotiations which Finland, Sweden, and countries which joined the Union later on, such as Poland, were involved in, the definition of vodka was passed over and promises were made to put that right in the near future."
"Now is that time."
"Competition Policy 2005 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs E. Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Competition Policy 2005."
"I have been informed that the rapporteur has had problems with transport and will be arriving late."
"I propose, therefore, that we start with the Commission and then continue with the other speakers."
"As soon as the rapporteur arrives, she will be given the floor."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, and the committee for this excellent report."
"Once again, this annual report proves the added value Parliament brings to competition policy development, and I am grateful for that."
"As you rightly point out in the report, an effective competition policy plays a key role in achieving the Lisbon Strategy goals."
"To remain effective, competition policy needs to keep up with the evolving world around it."
"I am very pleased that Parliament supports the Commission's efforts to modernise competition policy, and in particular the work we did in 2005 to pursue a more refined economic approach."
"I agree with the report on very many issues, so I shall just mention three points where your comments really struck me."
"First, as you note, state aid control is essential to maintain a level playing field in the internal market."
"Through our ongoing reform, we are redesigning our rules to make them more simple, more transparent, more user-friendly, more coherent and more predictable."
"Our rules focus on the areas where limited amounts of aid can have most added value - competitiveness, the environment, training, regional cohesion, research, development and innovation."
"We have made good progress with the reform, but Member States must also do their share, as you say, particularly when it comes to recovering illegal state aid quickly and effectively."
"The second point that struck me was that 2005 was the year we launched two major sector inquiries."
"I agree with you about the value of these tools for a forward-looking policy."
"In the energy sector, you are right to be concerned that the facts show serious barriers to competition."
"The Commission will continue to pursue individual competition cases, working in cooperation with our colleagues in the national competition authorities."
"Regulation in this sector needs to be improved, with the requirement of ownership unbundling a priority."
"Third, you are right that, in today's globalised world, competition authorities need to cooperate more than ever before."
"Europe has a key role to play in encouraging strong competition cultures elsewhere in the world."
"At the same time, Europe needs to be able to respond to unfair foreign subsidies."
"The common commercial policy - rather than matching aid - is the proper tool to address this."
"Subsidy competition would undermine Europe's cohesion, create damaging subsidy races within our internal market, and bring serious risk of WTO litigation."
"I am looking forward to the debate."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, this meeting between the European Parliament and the Commission is an important event in terms of competition policy, for it is the time when we evaluate one of the most important policies in the Commission's hands, whilst defining only the general outline for the others, on the basis of which you will take this or that decision."
"While the report that we are putting forward this year is a balanced one, it does need to be completed by an answer to the question as to what is meant by 'fair and undistorted competition', as the Treaty itself puts it."
"In fact, the situation in the business world, in which there is an increasing and underhand trend towards a way of working in which, no doubt for the sake of flexibility, trainees' contracts are renewed month after month and, for the sake of providing the trainees with access to professional training, the difference between them and those subject to labour law is accentuated, is a real issue in terms of competition, and one that you need to consider closely."
"We in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are also concerned about the conclusions that are going to be drawn from the sectoral surveys that you have been carrying out, and specifically in connection with the potential impact on the structure of this or that segment of the market."
"I am thinking, for example, of the situation of local banks, or of mutual banks in relation to the retail banking sector, but we would also like you to consider other sectors, which may well be more difficult to tackle."
"Three sectors about which we are particularly concerned are investment banks, rating agencies and auditors' firms."
"We think that, if competition is to be required to be free and undistorted, one must also be bold enough to take a look at these sectors in the same way as the Commission has sometimes done with actors of equally considerable weight."
"If this takes place, you can count on our support, although you must never forget that competition policy can never be an end in itself, but is in the service of a strategy of the European Union which is, today, defined not only by the Lisbon Strategy, but also by the objectives set out on 8 March 2007, those being the fight against the effects of climate change and the will to endow the European Union with the capacity for shaping its own independent energy policy."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, first of all, I should like to pay tribute to the absent rapporteur who has, as I see it, compiled an excellent document which meets with broad support in our committee."
"I should also like to give Mrs Kroes credit for what she has done, because, as Mrs Berès said a moment ago with very good reason, competition policy is not an end in itself, and I think that the European Commission, precisely under the guidance of Mrs Kroes, has launched a new pragmatic approach, something which we greatly appreciate."
"Sometimes, people overlook the fact that competition rules are not there to bully businesses or thwart national governments."
"Competition rules are designed to ensure that the same rules and equal opportunities apply to everyone who operates in the internal market."
"These competition rules are therefore there to ensure that Europe can adopt a strong position in the world, in the face of global competition."
"As such, we should not compete with each other, but instead ensure that we create an internal market that functions well."
"I too am a staunch supporter of the sector inquiries, and where energy policy is concerned, you can count on this Parliament's support."
"I should nevertheless like to make one observation."
"At the moment, everyone in the Member States is busy preparing for the summit that is coming up this weekend, where once again, energy policy will feature as one of the new key areas on the agenda."
"One of the few positive points in the whole discussion."
"At the same time, I have noticed that, whilst the leaders of the national governments are saying that we should have a common energy policy, they are not prepared to stop protecting their national favourites."
"Perhaps they should practise what they preach."
"With regard to state aid, as rapporteur for state aid for public services and for innovation, I can say that we have discussed this subject before."
"Actually, I cannot wait to see if there is a first assessment of the impact of these exemption regulations and if, more generally, an assessment is being made of whether state aid is suitable or not."
"Finally, as for the matching clause, this too has been the subject of previous discussions."
"It is, of course, a problem if generous levels of state aid are made available outside of the European Union."
"At the same time, I would prefer to reinforce Europe's competitiveness by other means."
"It is highly improper, to my mind, to start giving out generous levels of state aid and subsidies, whilst we have not yet sorted out other measures, including patents, making the labour market more flexible, opening up the market for services and many other measures of this kind; mistakes like this cannot be put right with state aid."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, it has always been my contention that, far from encouraging competition, the EU in its drive for the mythical 'level playing field' wants to stamp it out altogether."
"This report does little to change that perception."
"Paragraph 13 supports a common consolidated corporate tax base, which is another step towards a compulsory EU-wide corporation tax, which is fundamentally anti-competitive."
"This idea is enthusiastically supported by France and Germany, two countries with higher corporate tax rates, which must be salivating at the idea of getting everybody else's rates up to their level."
"One of the most stupid pieces of EU jargon that I have ever heard is 'unfair tax competition', which is what this clause is all about."
"There is nothing unfair about some Member States having more business-friendly taxation regimes than others."
"This encourages competition."
"State aid gets a bashing in this report, as you would expect, but the report makes the false assumption that all state aid is bad."
"In Britain, because of EU state aid restrictions, we are rapidly losing the Royal Mail postal service, to the detriment of consumers, particularly in remote areas."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, in my speech I plan to use the so-called case method, that is to say, I am going to try to draw conclusions from a single specific event that may be applicable in a general sense."
"As the honourable Member knows, on several occasions I have concerned myself with the issue of the takeover bids that have taken place in Spain against the Endesa electricity company."
"My fellow Member from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has referred to national champions and I believe that this case fits perfectly within that context."
"As you know, the current Spanish Government did everything it could to prevent a German company, E.ON, from acquiring a stake in Endesa, and that conduct has already led the Commission to open up two procedures."
"One against the general decision empowering a particular committee to lay down specific conditions, and the other relating to those specific conditions."
"The Commissioner is perfectly aware of what I am talking about."
"Then a stake in Endesa was acquired by an Italian company, which is partly public, incidentally."
"I put a question to the Commissioner and received a reply today in which she says that the restrictions to the right to vote laid down by the Spanish Government are being investigated."
"The third chapter in this case is that the person responsible, the President of the National Energy Commission, the Spanish regulatory body, appointed by the Socialist Government, has handed in his resignation to that same Socialist Government, in protest against what he considers to be violations of his independence."
"That is what he explained to the Spanish Parliament."
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to get him to explain it in this Parliament, although I have not given up hope that there will be full and open transparency here as well."
"I would like to know whether the Commissioner, the Commission, is worried about this issue that affects the proper operation of the entire European market, and is an issue for the whole of Europe, and which, if you will allow me, also affects legal security, the good name and good credit in the international markets of my country, and please believe me, Commissioner, that is what is of most concern to me."
"I would like the Commissioner to tell me whether she has carried out any investigations, whether she intends to do so, whether she intends to address this problem with the Socialist government and whether she intends to carry out reforms with a view to combating it."
"Thank you, Madam President, I have exceeded my speaking time somewhat because my spokesman, Mr Evans, has not been here and I felt that I could make use of his time; in any event I would like to thank you."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, I am as impressed with the report as everyone who has already spoken."
"I greatly appreciate the report itself, but I appreciate even more the annual debates, particularly with the honourable Members present at this sitting."
"The report itself makes a vital contribution to the further development of this policy."
"I would like to assure you that I am not only listening to you, but am taking many of your remarks - which make a lot of sense - into account."
"Indeed, if competition policy is to really deliver in creating growth and jobs in Europe, we need to continue working together."
"That means involving all the stakeholders - Parliament as well as the outside world - and taking into account the point touched upon by Sophia in 't Veld."
"It is not a matter of making fun of anyone but rather to set a level playing field in which everyone, both the consumer and the business world, may finally share the advantages."
"I would like to respond to a few specific issues raised in our debate this evening."
"Mrs Berès had some interesting ideas for new sector inquiries and I will indeed consider the subjects she touched upon: rating agencies, auditing firms and large investment banks."
"We have not yet made up our minds and are still discussing the matter, so I will put this on the list."
"It is more a matter of resources than a lack of sectors in which it might make sense to start a sector inquiry."
"At present the Commission has no grounds for a wide-ranging review of competition in these particular sectors, but this does not mean that we cannot take a couple of thoughts out of it."
"I would welcome further discussion with Parliament on these issues."
"Of course, the Commission is always ready to look carefully at any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour which is brought to our attention in individual situations."
"Mrs Berès also spoke about competition on non-traditional grounds, for example salaries."
"The report also mentions tax."
"I note that many of you are concerned by so-called tax competition among the Member States."
"It is correct that the Commission has powers to assess tax measures affecting competition."
"However, and I would like to make this quite clear, that is the case only when these measures are considered to be state aid and essentially when they are selective in nature, meaning that they do not constitute general measures."
"I now come to the point that Sophia in 't Veld touched upon."
"For the last 10 years the Commission has been reviewing potentially harmful tax schemes."
"We have challenged a series of national measures targeting, amongst others, offshore intragroup activities."
"As regards salary competition, my answer is quite clear: if measures relating to salaries can be considered as state aid, the Commission will use its powers."
"Turning to state aid issues, in particular in reply to Sophia in 't Veld, state aid is in principle, as we are all aware, banned by the Treaty to avoid distortions of competition in our single market."
"State aid can indeed be a legitimate tool to deliver outcomes which are in the general interest, for example regional cohesion, research and development, as well as innovation and high-quality public services which markets themselves will not deliver."
"That is why our approach is to design a new set of state aid rules, which we did with the review."
"It uses a more economic approach to assess where market failures exist and to target appropriate aid measures on them."
"That is a balanced and a realistic view."
"It reflects the need to help Member States get the best out of taxpayers' money - state aid is, at the end of the day, taxpayers' money."
"The Commission publishes its state aid scoreboards twice a year."
"As you are aware, this presents data and analyses of Member States' expenditure on state aid measures."
"It includes a focus on Member States' progress towards the Lisbon goals of less and better aid."
"The next edition will pay close attention to the question of recovery."
"In addition, a series of indicators and statistical tables on our Europa website gives scope for further discussion."
"But Sophia in 't Veld is right: we need to do more to evaluate the effects of state aid, whether it makes sense and how."
"That is how the new more economic approach could help us."
"I can be brief in response to Mr García-Margallo y Marfil: we have discussed this before and we know exactly what the dossier is about."
"We have taken the Member State concerned to Court for not respecting our two Article 21 decisions under the Merger Regulation."
"My colleague, Charlie McCreevy, is taking parallel action under the internal market rules."
"I am always open to your suggestions for further improving the way in which competition policy makes markets function better."
"I badly need your ideas and your creativity."
"We are doing our utmost to complete this process, and I am grateful for your continued support and valuable contribution."
"We are not there yet but are on the right track."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 19 June 2007."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Parliament's report on Competition Policy 2005, we acknowledge the efforts made by the Commission to modernise competition policy."
"I should like to highlight the main recommendations of the report."
"In the crucial area of energy, we support the Commission's action on ownership unbundling."
"We reiterate the call on the Commission to clarify at Community level the public service obligations to which operators of services of general economic interest should be bound, with regard to strategic security and universal coverage."
"We also believe it is important to ensure that the EU's external dimension is consistent with competition policy when it comes to negotiating bilateral trade agreements."
"In spite of the Commission's efforts at harmonising practices and guaranteeing transparency, it is a fact that there is competition in terms of incentives between EU regions and Member States, which, along with the absence of tax harmonisation, foments the artificial relocation of companies."
"These and other challenges illustrate the need to strengthen the EU's ability to deliver effective competition rules and to improve flexibility of response to new challenges."
"Hence the importance of continuing to give the European Competition Authority the resources it needs."
"Cat and dog fur (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council banning the placing on the market and the import of, or export from, the Community of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur - C6-0428/2006 -."
"Madam President, we have had the opportunity in the past to discuss this proposal in committees and intergroups."
"I am sure you will understand that I am very happy to be having this debate with you tonight."
"First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the work of all Members of the European Parliament, especially that of the rapporteur, who has done a very good job."
"I would also like to thank the draftswoman and draftsman of the other committees, Mrs Lucas and Mr Stevenson."
"It was a real challenge for me when I was first confronted with this issue after taking up my post."
"For me, the most frustrating part was that we had an issue which was very close to the heart of European citizens and which had the support of the Council and, clearly, of the European Parliament but also of the Commission, yet we still had problems in proceeding with this proposal."
"The problems were, of course, legal and not the result of a lack of political will."
"I am happy that we have now reached a point where, using some imaginative and constructive approaches, we have managed to find solutions, and that we are now able to have a first reading agreement, which is very important to me."
"We are all familiar with the issue and know that the disturbing evidence of barbaric treatment of cats and dogs, which are bred and killed mainly for their fur, especially in Asia, has provoked a strong call for the Commission to take action."
"As I have said, we had to find ways not only to express tangibly the political will of all the institutions involved and the citizens, but also to do so in a legally sound way that would ensure that this will could face and withstand any challenges arising in the future."
"I am very happy that, through the proposal and, in particular, the various trialogues, we have managed to reach a compromise."
"This compromise is legally sound and will ensure that the ban will be effective in practice."
"For us, it is important to have results, not just to issue a political statement or express political will, which would eventually become ineffective."
"It would be correct politically, but it would not produce the results that we want: the protection of cats and dogs and, even more importantly, of European consumers who do not want to be offered the fur of cats and dogs, which they consider their pets."
"I would like to mention two of my colleagues by name, Mr Mandelson and Mr McCreevy."
"Both were very supportive of our work in this area."
"As you know, the legal basis we have been using relates to the internal market and trade."
"This was necessary, because, unfortunately, there is no legal basis in the Treaty that would allow the EU to adopt a legislative initiative to ban a particular trade based on animal welfare or ethical concerns."
"Furthermore, there is no legal basis for animal protection as such in the Treaty, so we had to use these two legal bases, and my colleagues have been very supportive of this work."
"We also had another legal challenge: the issue of proportionality."
"For reasons of proportionality it was necessary to consider including a provision that would allow for possible derogations to the ban."
"None of us was happy with this idea and, as I said, the only reason was to make this proposal more legally sound."
"I believe that we have managed to reach a proper compromise."
"As you know, this approach was also clearly supported by the legal services of all three institutions, the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"But the compromise we have today is the right one."
"It contains the possibility - and I emphasise the word 'possibility' - to derogate exceptionally from the trade ban for taxidermy or educational purposes."
"We have used the legal bases described and we know that this approach will benefit not only European consumers but also animal welfare, especially since we cannot introduce our animal welfare rules outside the European Union."
"We cannot promote them internationally, but, by closing the market to the unscrupulous people who practise this trade, we are not only sending a clear message but also helping to stop this practice."
"Finally, Parliament, the Council and Commission have worked very hard to get the legislative proposal to the present stage and to reach an acceptable compromise."
"I very much hope that the vote tomorrow will reflect this positive and constructive attitude, so we can put this legislation in place as soon as possible."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow when we vote on this report, we shall have the opportunity to make great efforts to put a stop to the dreadful cruelty sometimes suffered by dogs and cats - animals of which we often make pets."
"As the rapporteur responsible for this matter, I am both pleased and satisfied with the report on which we - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - have now agreed."
"I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation."
"I also wish to thank the Chairwoman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mrs McCarthy, together with my fellow Members."
"I wish to thank Mr Stevenson who, I know, has worked for many years in order to achieve progress on this matter."
"Everyone has shown a lot of commitment and a desire to obtain an outcome that is good for dogs and cats."
"The work has been extremely interesting, particularly in view of the interest shown by the public in this issue."
"I am completely convinced that the opinions widely held among the public and among animal rights organisations have contributed very significantly to our reaching this agreement."
"I want to say a big thank you to all those committed people who have added names to petitions and participated in a variety of campaigns."
"They have shown that we no longer accept such cruelty to animals."
"Thank you, everyone. Your protests have borne fruit."
"Many of us have seen documentaries, films and pictures showing dogs and cats having their fur removed even when they were still alive."
"It is enough to see just one picture or documentary showing such cruelty to animals to realise that everything must be done to put a stop to it."
"The Humane Society estimates that more than two million cats and dogs are kept prisoner under disgusting conditions before being killed for the sake of their fur."
"The fur and skins are then sold under false designations such as 'China wolf' or 'Asian wolf' and used, for example, for cuddly toys for children, decorative objects, clothes and handbags."
"We must now put a stop to this trade, above all because of the extreme cruelty involved in fur production."
"That reason is enough, but nor - I might add - is there any need for cat or dog fur in any product at all, because synthetic materials can be substituted for it."
"False descriptions extensively deceive consumers."
"Unsuspecting consumers can buy toys for their children in good faith and without having the slightest idea that a cat may have been skinned alive in order to be used for that very toy."
"It has been maintained in the debate that we need the skins in question in order, for example, to relieve joint pain, in other words for medical reasons."
"My answer to that is that, in 2007, no patient is prescribed cat skin to combat rheumatic pain when he or she visits the doctor."
"We have progressed beyond that."
"I, as rapporteur, together with everyone committed to this cause, had great hopes, then, when the Commission's proposal was accepted."
"We believed that we needed a total ban, but the Commission's original proposal made certain exemptions possible, for example when the label stated that the fur came from cats or dogs that had not been bred or slaughtered for manufacturing purposes or when the skins concerned were personal belongings or household objects."
"My view throughout has been that the regulation would be an empty gesture if scope were allowed for such exemptions, as the situation would be quite impossible to monitor and the exemptions would pave the way for continued trade and for the dreadful practices described."
"It was not a regulation of that kind that people were requesting or demanding of the EU."
"I am therefore now pleased to be able to say that we have a proposal for a total ban following discussions with the Commission and the Council."
"I hope that Parliament will support the proposal tomorrow by voting in favour of the amendments to which the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has unanimously agreed."
"We also have proposals concerning the way in which the rules would be applied in the Member States, and we propose that the Member States should also have to report to the Commission on the way in which compliance with the rules is monitored."
"I am convinced that the public will be watching us carefully when we vote tomorrow, as there is a real demand for measures to be taken on this issue."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - Madam President, I should like to really warmly welcome Mrs Svensson's report and to congratulate her on her excellent work."
"She has been a brilliant rapporteur and we have got a very positive result."
"It is very clear that Parliament is united in saying that there should be no derogations that would compromise the integrity and the effectiveness of a ban."
"However, I must say that, in terms of this legislation being forthcoming from the Commission, we have had to wait quite a long time."
"I remember writing to Commissioner Byrne back in 2002 calling for a ban on cat and dog fur."
"We were told simply that it was a very complex issue and the Commission was reflecting."
"What worries me about that is that in a sense this slowness is being repeated on another issue that I want to turn your minds to, which is the issue of banning imports of seal products."
"Again, Parliament is being told that it is a complex issue."
"Exactly the same language is being used again now, when it comes to seal products, as was used back in 2002 about cat and dog fur."
"As the draftsperson in the Committee on International Trade, I tabled amendments to the cat and dog proposal, not suggesting that we try to include seals - that would be too much - but at least asking the Commission to bring forward similar legislation to deal with imports of seal products."
"This was agreed by the Committee on International Trade."
"The Commissioner said earlier that there was no lack of political will when it came to dealing with the cat and dog issue, what was lacking was an imaginative legal base."
"I urge the Commissioner and his services to be extraordinarily imaginative and to recognise that Europe's citizens feel the same revulsion about cat and dog fur as they feel about imports of seal products."
"We must have legislation coming forward very urgently on that issue as well."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Madam President, I wish to begin by expressing my very warm thanks to Mrs Svensson for a brilliant piece of work and a brilliant report."
"I also wish to thank Mrs McCarthy for her dedication and commitment to steering this very important report through Parliament."
"However, most of all, I am grateful for the great courage of Commissioner Kyprianou, because, as Mrs Lucas has just said, the previous Commissioner told us that it was impossible and there would never be a legal basis."
"I remember Commissioner Kyprianou saying to me, 'As a lawyer, if I went round telling clients that things were impossible, I would never make a living!'."
"He has fulfilled his pledge."
"It is music to my ears to hear this debate this evening, because it has taken eight years to get this far, with the help of Humane Society International."
"Betsy Dribben, who used to work for Humane Society International, has flown over from Washington and is in the public gallery tonight, and many thanks are due to her for her dogged campaigning."
"Humane Society International estimates that, every year, about two million cats and dogs are killed in China alone to supply the fashion market in Europe with items like this little toy, which the rapporteur mentioned - little cats, which mums and dads buy for their kids because they are cat and dog lovers, not realising that they have been made out of real cat and dog skin from animals that have been brutally killed."
"The trade buys these cat skins to make collars for trim for parka hoods and ski boot and ski glove linings and all sorts of fashion items."
"This has been a fraud perpetrated on the public."
"The public are never told that they are buying items made of real cat and dog fur."
"Sometimes it is even dyed to look like fake fur and given false labels to fool the public."
"I am glad that, at long last, there will very soon be a regulation on the statute books in all 27 Member States banning this evil trade."
"I thank the Commissioner and everyone else who has been involved in achieving that."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, banning the trade in cat and dog fur in the EU is important for a number of reasons."
"The first is the completely unacceptable so-called cat industry in Asia supplying Europe with a reported 2 million cats a year."
"It is outrageous that animals are skinned alive for their fur."
"This is the cheapest and most appalling method."
"I am aware that an EU regulation cannot bring about a change of behaviour among industrial breeders in third countries, but it can substantially reduce the volume of animals traded."
"The second reason is that European consumers do not know that they are buying these products."
"If they knew they would not buy them."
"Cats and dogs are thought of as domestic pets in Europe."
"Most Europeans have no idea that cat and dog fur contributes not only to the more expensive furs of other animals but also to artificial fur."
"These products are not properly labelled."
"This is not an ethical problem, as opponents of this regulation would have it; rather, it is a matter of misleading the consumer, either intentionally or otherwise."
"The Union has a major obligation to prevent this."
"It is of course necessary for customs services in the Member States to employ effective means of determining, definitively and at reasonable expense, whether imported goods contain cat or dog fur."
"The main reason, however, for adopting this regulation is the fragmentation of the market."
"Almost half the Member States have laws regulating or banning the trade in cat and dog fur whereas the rest do not."
"These regulations, with their lack of harmony, are exploited by traders on the European market, who transport goods made of cat and dog fur to the European countries where these goods are not yet banned."
"This regulation will substantially improve the enforcement of this law."
"Parliament has amended the Commission's text so that the only exception would be the use of fur for non-commercial purposes."
"This is because we do not want to bring about a nonsensical criminalisation of ordinary citizens."
"I call on all of you who believe that the Union has no power to intervene in these matters to see that this is simply not the case."
"Article 95 authorises the EU to take action in such matters because we have a common interest in the functioning of a European market with legitimate commodities."
"I am grateful to the Commission and applaud the rapporteurs for their work."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, in fact Mr Stevenson is right: eight years ago Labour MEPs were calling for an end to the cruel trade in cat and dog fur."
"Commissioner, you will probably remember that the late Phillip Whitehead, the former chairman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, asked you as a Commission to take action."
"On 30 December last year, I received a petition on behalf of concerned citizens signed by over a quarter of a million people calling for us to bring in that ban."
"We have acted, but I believe that it is the citizens, in their determination, and animal welfare campaigners who should take the credit for this new law and for helping us to persuade you, Commissioner, to give us the legal power to ban it."
"There is plenty of evidence of the inhuman treatment of cats and dogs bred for fur."
"Animal welfare organisations have been contacting my office and welcoming the law."
"Their only criticism is that it has taken us too long."
"But this law is also about protecting consumers who have unwittingly been deceived into buying clothes, toys and household products made from cat and dog fur."
"I would say that people power can win the day over bureaucracy and legal barriers."
"I want to stress to the Commission and to the Member States that the committee's negotiating team wanted the EU to adopt the highest international standards and best practices in ensuring we ban this obscene trade and that cat and dog fur products do not end up in the shops by the back door."
"So can I just be very clear: we insist no loopholes are created by not possible derogations, exceptional derogations."
"That is the language of the agreement we made with the Commission and the Member States."
"We insist on a report back on how the ban is being implemented and action if it is not working."
"We expect Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in both implementing and enforcing the ban."
"There must be tough and dissuasive penalties to deter the cat and dog fur traders."
"In short, a ban must mean a ban in principle and in practice - not a restriction enabling continuation of the trade by the back door."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I should like to thank Mrs Svensson for her commitment and the work she has done."
"We, as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, support this compromise."
"It has surprised me enormously why it has taken so long before we managed to strike this compromise with the Council and Commission, because we in this House had to do a huge amount of work to reach this compromise."
"I am pleased with the outcome, particularly the fact that we are assuming an exemption position that is compatible with that of the United States and Australia."
"This is how we, as the western civilised world, can stand united against the nasty way certain countries deal with their pets."
"I should like to endorse what Mrs Lucas said."
"When will there be a ban on seal fur?"
"I should like to take this one step further still, as I believe that there are many more things the civilised world should take to heart where animals are concerned."
"I do not want to enter into detail about it at the moment, but I think there is much to say on this subject, and the Commissioner may already have ideas on this for future proposals."
"Even though this ban may be at the expense of a number of Dutch expressions, such as de hond in de pot vinden [find your dinner in the dog] or de kat in de zak kopen [buy a cat in a sack], this does mean that we are keen to protect the animals that are dear to us, and it is unacceptable for our children to be faced with parts of their pets incorporated in their toys."
"Finally, I should like to stress that the ALDE Group supports the compromise proposal as a whole; we do not have any problems with it."
"I should like to mention the other side of the coin, though."
"In China, dogs are served up for dinner on a regular basis."
"To the Chinese, their fur is a residual product with economic value; this ban will have the effect that the economic value of the fur will take a significant nosedive."
"Taking this one step further, this means that if pork and beef are part of our staple diet, it should no longer be possible to use their skins/hides either."
"We may have to give this matter some more thought, to see what we can do about this in future."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I fully support the ban on imports of cat and dog fur."
"At the moment, it is the least that we can do to combat cruelty to animals."
"Dogs and cats have a particularly close bond to humans."
"They serve us and are devoted to us."
"Cruelty to these animals is particularly hurtful."
"We know that killing dogs and cats for fur is cruel and European Union Member States should not be indifferent to this practice."
"We cannot influence how animals are treated in other cultures, but we can at least say 'no' to goods bought at the price of unimaginable suffering caused to animals."
"We should say 'no' to any kind of cruelty, irrespective of the victim involved."
"Sensitivity is universal."
"A sensitive person would never condone the suffering of another being, whether it is another human or an animal."
"The Union will have a purpose when it becomes a community of people who are sensitive to all pain, to all suffering."
"I wholeheartedly support the rapporteur's position."
"At the same time, I would like to express my appreciation for her report and the work of the rapporteurs from the expert committees, Mr Stevenson and Mrs Lucas."
"Parliament is taking a significant step towards changing the way in which we treat animals."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner Kyprianou, ladies and gentlemen."
"I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur."
"It is thanks to Mrs Svensson's persistence that Parliament will be able to adopt, as early as tomorrow, at first reading, a Regulation banning the trade in and processing of dog and cat fur."
"In the trialogue with the Council and the Commission, Mrs Svensson successfully fought for a complete ban on the trade in and processing of this fur and thus said a clear 'no' to the derogations originally proposed by the Commission."
"We must now ensure that the Member States implement this Regulation properly."
"This represents a great success for animal protection."
"This Regulation will eliminate once and for all the situation in which millions of cats and dogs have been kept and killed, sometimes in atrocious conditions, so that their fur can be processed and exported to Europe."
"This is also a triumph for democracy in Europe, as numerous citizens have called for this ban in the form of signature campaigns and petitions."
"This Regulation is also in the interests of consumers, as many citizens were completely unaware when purchasing products such as soft toys, clothing or keyrings that these contained dog or cat fur."
"All too often, traders have circumvented the existing voluntary code of conduct and placed dog or cat fur on the market mislabelled or with no labelling."
"It is high time Europe took this important step for international animal protection, and thus followed the example of other countries, such as the USA and Australia, who introduced a similar ban years ago."
"Now, by means of tighter customs controls, new methods of analysis and criminal measures, we must ensure that the provisions adopted today are enforced effectively throughout Europe and all legal loopholes eliminated."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the choice has been put before us of whether to ban outright or restrict the trade in the furs of cats and dogs in the EU, and I congratulate and want to thank not only the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, but also the Committee on Legal Affairs, which, having been asked for its opinion on this matter, has plumped for the first solution."
"It was in fact high time that the Member States were reminded that dogs and cats are companion animals and that the trade in their furs and in products derived from them must not be accepted or even tolerated."
"Imposing, by law, such a ban in Europe, and making provision for effective and deterrent sanctions in the event of its being infringed, is the very least one can do today."
"There is no end to the fraudulent and deceitful practices that one finds going on, particularly in Asia, with the labels of most clothes made there - be they coats, hats, handbags, gloves, and shoes, not to mention toys, decorations and small leather goods - bearing the deceptive description of 'leather' or 'real fur'."
"If a stop is to be put to this ignoble trade, each and every European citizen must adopt a responsible and ethical attitude by demanding, specifically, the labelling of all leather, skin and fur goods and of all food and pharmaceutical products whose origins might be a matter of doubt."
"Let us unite in refusing to encourage those countries in which human rights and dignity are disregarded and which, moreover, have no sense of having a duty of care for animals."
"(SK) I would like to begin by observing that the fur industry has always been important in Slovakia, but it did not really start to expand until after 1990."
"Following Slovakia's EU accession, Slovak furriers have been exclusively importing fur materials from buyers in EU Member States."
"Being direct importers, these buyers can ensure the full legality and legitimacy of the imports, including the relevant certificates."
"I understand the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, and share her opinion that the large number of petitions and concerns expressed by consumers and citizens throughout the EU means that the Commission cannot remain inactive over the matter of banning the trade in cat and dog fur."
"It is indeed necessary to clarify existing legal requirements in all Member States."
"We must respond to the ethical concerns expressed by citizens over the possible presence of cat and dog fur in the Community, particularly in view of the indications that these animals may be being raised and killed in an inhumane manner."
"Consumers are concerned that cat and dog fur cannot be readily distinguished from other furs or synthetic materials imitating fur, and this may give rise to unfair and fraudulent practices involving fur products, including fraudulent or misleading designations."
"There is no tradition in the Community of breeding cats and dogs for the purpose of manufacturing fur, and in fact the vast majority of products from cat and dog fur present in the Community come from third countries."
"In order to protect the internal market, customs supervision over the movement of goods from third countries to the European Union should be tightened."
"Illegal imports could be addressed by stricter penalties against perpetrators, including heavy fines or the withdrawal of licences."
"I firmly believe that it is necessary to adopt European legislation that would unify market rules in the EU Member States At the same time, however, EU initiatives must not become a brake and cause the fur industry problems by disrupting legitimate fur trading."
"We must avoid putting up obstacles to the functioning of the internal market and ensure the free movement of legally traded fur and fur products in general."
"(DA) Madam President, like my fellow Members, I wish to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, for an outstanding piece of work and for her excellent cooperation on this matter."
"The regulation we are debating today is a good, important and very necessary piece of legislation."
"It is good legislation because it enables us to send a clear signal to the many EU citizens who have asked us to do something to prevent dogs and cats from being used for fur production."
"In this way, we are showing them that we are in actual fact listening to their concerns and making an active attempt to put a stop to cruelty to animals."
"It is also an important piece of legislation because it has emerged that we cannot stop the sale of dog and cat fur solely by means of bans in the individual Member States."
"During the committee reading of the regulation, Mr Stevenson of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection showed us many dog and cat skins bought in Europe, including a skin made from four golden retrievers and bought in my own home city of Copenhagen."
"In Denmark we already have a ban, but it is clearly not good enough."
"We therefore need an effective ban at EU level."
"The proposed legislation is also necessary because huge numbers of dogs and cats lead wretched lives that end in the most terrible suffering imaginable, and all because they have to provide fur for clothes and toys."
"By devising a common EU ban, we reduce the market for the sale of dog and cat fur and, at the same time, send a powerful signal concerning the repugnance we feel towards cruelty to animals."
"I am therefore delighted that we have managed to devise as strict and sound a ban as this."
"The exemptions provided for will be so rare that they will each have to be justified and approved individually."
"We are as close to a total ban as is legally possible at the present time, and that is to be welcomed."
"However, the legislative text is not enough in itself."
"It is crucial that we continue to work on developing methods to enable us more effectively to identify where fur originates and to stop the traffic in illegal fur, which shady and unscrupulous characters will otherwise not hesitate to sell."
"(SL) None of the assertions usually made as a justification for cruelty to animals can be made in the case of the trade in dog and cat fur."
"They are not being killed for clothing or food, and not even for the purposes of hunting."
"The incentive for this slaughter has been provided by the global market; in other words the demand of certain industries for raw materials that are cheaper than synthetic ones, since people living in extreme poverty on other continents receive very little for the sale of such items."
"The European market is now generating world supply through its demand."
"And it is time now for us to put an end to this, both for ethical reasons and also so that we can put an end to the deception of consumers, who do not realise that they are buying garments or toys made from dog or cat fur."
"It would be better if there were no exceptions to the ban on imports."
"Yet if we remain focused on the main goal, then a compromise also makes sense."
"Effective implementation of the regulation will be extremely important."
"Here we expect great things from the Commission and especially from Mr. Kyprianou, whom I thank, as I do the rapporteur Mrs Svensson, for their efforts."
"(SV) Madam President, thank you, Mr Kyprianou and my dear Mrs Svensson, for doing such a fantastic job."
"Most cats and dogs growing up in Europe can count on being stroked, fed, exercised and well cared for."
"However, those people who buy cuddly toys or fashionable handbags made of cat or dog fur contribute to a trade that causes animals to be tortured, beaten and flayed alive."
"This legislative proposal is unusual."
"Firstly, the EU has finally listened to the voice of the people, who wish to ban this repulsive trade."
"Secondly, the internal market was considered to operate best if we banned the trade."
"For once, animal protection has taken precedence over the internal market."
"I wish to emphasise the importance of not allowing the exemptions to undermine the ban."
"Finally, we have a precedent that points the way to trade based on values other than market fundamentalism."
"I hope and demand that, once we have brought this matter to a conclusion, the next topic will be a ban on the import of seal skins."
"Hundreds and thousands of seals are still tortured to death on the ice in Canada and Norway."
"(FR) Madam President, our further discussion of the importation of the skins of two million slaughtered Chinese dogs and cats is comparable to that which we had in the 1990s, when we returned on three occasions to discussing the importation from the Arctic regions of the furs of animals killed in leghold traps."
"On each occasion, whether we were talking about seals, dogs, cats or foxes, I am sorry to have to say that the Commission played for time and allowed the trade to continue to the greater glory of the Market Almighty."
"Let us never forget that, in March 1996, despite proof that mad cow disease was capable of being transmitted to humans, the Commission threatened four German Länder with sanctions for their refusal to allow the importation of suspect cattle."
"The lesson one can learn from all that is that the logic of the market demands that everything be capable of being bought or sold or used as a means to making a profit, whether it be dogs, cats, kidneys, eyes, women, children, slaves, or workers."
"That is why the economy must be subject to political constraints, in order that those great values that are beyond price may be re-established."
"Madam President, over one million Europeans have lobbied in favour of banning the import of cat and dog fur into the EU."
"The Commission listened to the European Parliament and reacted by taking legislative action to ban the import of cat and dog fur."
"I welcome this and hope that we will see an end to the barbaric trade which accounts for the slaughter of over two million cats and dogs each year."
"However, we do not just want warm words."
"Some constituents have raised concerns that loopholes in the Commission's proposal may allow imports via the back door."
"I recently tabled a written question asking the Commission about derogations that might allow the trade to continue."
"The reply that I received gave information on two derogations, one relating to fur that was part of personal or household effects being brought into the EU, and the other relating to fur or products containing fur that have not been bred or killed for fur production."
"I welcome the fact that the European Parliament report deletes these derogations and I urge colleagues to fully support this report."
"We want to be sure that cat and dog fur will not be imported into the EU."
"Madam President, I welcome the fact that several EU countries - France, Italy, Denmark, Greece and Belgium - moved unilaterally to ban the trade."
"However, there are differences in the approaches of other Member States, ranging from bans on rearing and slaughter to labelling requirements."
"These differences can cause problems for consumers, retailers and traders alike."
"That is why, as we all know, an EU-wide ban is so important if we want an end to this vile trade."
"We have already heard that 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their fur and that it takes at least 10 dogs and up to 24 cats to make a single coat."
"These animals live in horrific conditions and many are skinned alive."
"Since the US brought in a ban, more cat and dog fur is coming into the EU."
"The problem is that many customers do not know what they are buying, as cat and dog fur is quite often labelled as fake fur."
"It is also included in a variety of products other than clothing, such as some homeopathic medicines, children's toys and accessories."
"I welcome the debate tonight and the vote tomorrow and I congratulate the Commissioner on his commitment."
"Madam President, before making a few points, I should first like to briefly mention two practical issues."
"Firstly, I appreciate the need for monitoring and reporting, and that is why we are in agreement with Parliament on this."
"Effective and analytical methods are in place, which will be very helpful in implementing this legislation."
"Secondly, on labelling, it was always debatable whether labelling would be enough."
"We decided - and I think Parliament was in agreement - that labelling was not enough and therefore we proposed legislation."
"However, on the general issue of labelling, we are following very closely voluntary initiatives, programmes and schemes that already exist to cover other fur products and ensure that consumers are properly informed."
"On the issue of seals, I have to say at the outset that it is not my responsibility."
"My colleague, Mr Dimas, has already made a statement to Parliament on this issue."
"I was expecting this question, so I can tell you that EFSA has already been asked by the European Commission to provide a full objective assessment on the animal welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals, which was what Commissioner Dimas promised you."
"We expect to have this report in November, and based on that the Commission will assess in the shortest possible time the options to respond to this issue."
"I am sure my colleague will be very happy to discuss this issue with you once he has received the EFSA report."
"Allow me to make two or three points."
"I understand the frustration of many of you who were here before I was."
"You have talked about 'a long time'."
"I have been in office for only two and a half years and I have already produced a proposal."
"I do not know what happened in the past, but I think we would all appreciate that this Commission would not only make a commitment but also deliver this proposal within a reasonable time."
"I would just like to mention that."
"Secondly, I appreciate that the support of the European citizens has made a great impact; it was a great issue for us and it helped me convince those who needed convincing."
"However, you have all had a chance to talk with me privately on this issue and you know that I personally did not need to be persuaded or convinced about this."
"As soon as I was informed about this practice, I immediately gave instructions for my departments to start working on it."
"Therefore, credit me with the fact that I did not need any convincing as soon as I saw the films and knew what the practice was."
"Thirdly, let me mention the derogations."
"I know your views."
"From the very beginning I said that I was not happy with them either."
"However, you must realise that we started with a completely negative approach and then we managed to present a proposal."
"If the Commission wanted to allow loopholes, we would never have brought the proposal in the first place."
"We are just trying to find the best possible way to make it legally sound to be able to withstand any challenges before the court."
"That was our approach."
"We proposed several derogations; these were not agreed upon."
"We have found a very positive outcome with a compromise."
"Trust me, we never intended to allow any loopholes."
"What we were trying to do, based on legal advice, was to make this as effective and as solid as possible."
"The principle was upheld by the other two legal services."
"Therefore, I am very happy that we are having this debate and that we are competing with each other as regards who wants more - what more could one ask?"
"This is the right approach and your support gave me enough strength to convince whoever needed convincing."
"Therefore, I am looking forward to working with you on many other issues that touch upon animal welfare."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 19 June 2007."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FI) First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Eva-Britt Svensson, for having done a splendid job, and for having added certain elements to the Commission initiative, in particular that violation of the ban will result in prosecution and that derogations to the ban are unacceptable."
"She has been able to see through the entire process diplomatically, so that now we only need to adopt the long-awaited ban in plenary without further ado."
"The whole process has also been an exemplary indication of how decisions and legislation at EU level can be influenced by citizen action."
"There would hardly have been an initiative for legislation on the matter but for the petitions by citizens and active lobbying."
"I do hope that this example will encourage the citizens of the Union to take a more active part in EU decision-making."
"I welcome the Union's proposal on a complete ban on the trade in cat and dog fur because I believe that it is unacceptable that around two million dogs and cats are butchered every year for this purpose."
"12-15 dogs need to be killed to produce one dog fur coat and 24 cats for one cat fur coat."
"The vast majority of European consumers condemn the barbaric slaughter of our favourite domestic animals and do not wish to buy these products."
"This is why importers often give cat fur products various invented names to mislead the well-meaning customer."
"We need to have a comprehensive EU ban and put an end to this barbaric practice permanently."
"As so often happens, company self-regulation has proved to be ineffective in this case too."
"Retailers do not even label which animal the furs originate from."
"At the moment, fifteen Member States ban the trade in dog and cat fur, but there has been no general ban in the other countries until now."
"A comprehensive ban is an important step towards a more humane, animal-friendly society in Europe."
"Multiple sclerosis (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question by Marcin Libicki, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, to the Commission, on the Multiple Sclerosis Code of Best Practice - B6-0124/2007)."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, the European Parliament has dealt with health issues on a number of occasions."
"However, the view is often expressed that Parliament should focus on general health issues, such as medical treatment, insurance and appropriate care for those both ill and healthy."
"People sometimes say that it should not concern itself with specific diseases."
"However, I think that the disease being discussed today, namely multiple sclerosis, is a problem on such a dramatic scale that Parliament's involvement is justified."
"Neither is it the first time that the European Parliament is taking action in this field."
"A few weeks ago, on 29 May of this year, a conference was organised in Brussels by the European MS Platform."
"This conference was held under the auspices of the President of the European Parliament, Mr Hans-Gert Pöttering, for which we thank him, and was organised by Mrs Uma Aaltonen."
"I would like to remind you that Mrs Uma Aaltonen was once one of our colleagues."
"She was a Member of the European Parliament and a member of the Committee on Petitions, of which I am the chairman."
"Mrs Uma Aaltonen suffers from multiple sclerosis herself."
"She is a writer, a journalist and a teacher, and particularly supports this cause."
"I would like to remind you that the Committee on Petitions dealt with the issue of multiple sclerosis in petition 842/2001."
"As a result of this petition, the Committee on Petitions produced a report which was discussed in Parliament during the December plenary session in 2003."
"Thanks to our cooperation with multiple sclerosis associations in all the Member States and the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, a code of best practice was drawn up on the basis of this report and the resolution which accompanied it."
"The matter is really extremely important as the tragic situation facing multiple sclerosis sufferers is not reflected in statistics."
"As the participants at this conference pointed out, and as we heard during our previous debate on the subject, mortality statistics often state as the cause of death the failure of the pulmonary or the cardiovascular system, but do not mention that the primary cause of the pulmonary failure was simply muscular paralysis and that the patient suffocated, or that the cause of the cardiovascular failure was multiple sclerosis."
"Therefore, the statistics often do not provide us with the relevant information about how many people are seriously ill, how many suffer and how many die as a result of this illness."
"Multiple sclerosis sufferers are ill for many years."
"In the end, the cause of their death, statistically speaking, it pains me to say, is an entirely different disease."
"The Committee on Petitions met multiple sclerosis sufferers, we participated in these conferences and, during our mission to Berlin, we met the Minister of State of the German Government, Günter Gloser, with whom we discussed the matter, as the petitions committee of the German parliament is also dealing with the issue."
"Today, I would like to put a question to the Commission and to ask it to state the means, methods and efforts that it has undertaken to implement the European Parliament's resolution and the code of good practice that was drawn up on the basis of the resolution."
"I would be very grateful if the Commissioner could answer this question."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by saying that we acknowledge, understand and appreciate the seriousness of this disease."
"Not only is it a serious disease, but it also affects young men and women in Europe and all over the world in the most productive period of their lives; people who have usually already formed their own families, have young children, have all their life ahead of them and then have to go through these difficulties."
"Also, we appreciate the importance not only of the European Parliament's resolution but also of the code of best practice, which was drafted by the Platform."
"As I have already said, the Commission also participated in the first European conference on multiple sclerosis last month, and that conference was organised in the context of our public health programme."
"It was a project funded by the programme 'Multiple Sclerosis - the Information Dividend' and led by the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform."
"Of course, many of the aspects relating to this disease have to be dealt with by the Member States, so it is a gradual process that will take some time, but the Commission is there to help, support and encourage."
"At the conference, many essential points were presented concerning the follow-up to Parliament's resolution of 2003, especially regarding the discriminatory treatment afforded to people with multiple sclerosis."
"The Commission is taking action in the main fields covered by the proposal regarding a code of good practice on the right of people affected by multiple sclerosis to quality of life."
"Some actions target multiple sclerosis directly; others are of a more general or, let us say, horizontal or generic nature but, again, they are of benefit to the issue of multiple sclerosis as well, for example, the issue of equal rights and access to treatment and therapies for multiple sclerosis."
"The Commission, within its more general framework of safe, high-quality and efficient health services, is reinforcing cooperation between Member States."
"It is helping create reference networks for diseases, exchange of best practice and centres of reference, and the objective of these will be to ensure equal rights to patients and equal level of treatment all over the European Union."
"So, once these networks are established, they can cover multiple sclerosis as well, especially with centres of reference and exchange of best practices."
"On research, on the other hand, we have a more directly targeted agenda and initiatives."
"The seventh Framework Programme includes collaborative activities on research into brain-related diseases, human development and ageing, with particular emphasis on how to turn basic discoveries into clinical applications."
"One first call proposal for this topic was neuro-glia interaction in health and disease, which is of direct interest to the multiple sclerosis research community."
"Also, under the preceding programmes (the fifth and the sixth), the Commission funded 18 projects on multiple sclerosis, the largest of which, in the sixth programme, totalled EUR 11.4 million and related to neuro-protective strategies for multiple sclerosis."
"On the issue of employment and discrimination, which is important for us, Directive 2000/78/EC already prohibits discrimination based on disability in employment, occupation and vocational training, and requires employers to put in place reasonable accommodation tailored to the individual case to enable a person with a disability to work or undertake training."
"The Commission is committed to encouraging actions and promoting strategies for the adaptation, and reintegration into working life, of affected persons."
"On the issue of participation and empowerment, the project I mentioned earlier, 'Mutliple Sclerosis - the Information Dividend', will facilitate consensus on agreed European quality standards on information about multiple sclerosis, which has to be accessible, delivered in a timely manner by appropriately skilled and experienced professionals and provided in an equitable and efficient way."
"Finally, I would like to inform Parliament that the Commission intends to discuss with Member States a proposal for a large European consensus conference on neuro-degenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, to be held in 2009 or 2010, and the Commission will be able (on the basis of conclusions endorsed both by public and private stakeholders at that conference) to propose a communication or other relevant policy initiative, including specific actions in all the fields of disease prevention, research and management of this group of diseases."
"We will, of course, keep Parliament informed of all the next steps."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed three and a half years ago that Parliament, in a resolution to both the Council and the Commission, asked for important measures to support European citizens suffering from MS. As the Commissioner already pointed out, much progress has indeed been made."
"Whilst on behalf of Parliament, I expressed our support at this conference on 29 May, I would still like to put three specific questions to the Commission."
"The code of good practice should indeed be circulated and adopted in all Member States as quickly as possible."
"Is the Commission prepared to make information on MS available in a similar form on the EU's health portal for all patients?"
"My second question is about the MS concept project that was launched recently within the framework of the health programme and funded by the Commission."
"This project must lead to an MS register that can be used by everybody."
"Will the Commission be supporting this financially?"
"Finally, I should like to ask you whether the Commission will be taking any further initiatives in terms of framework legislation, in which priority is given to safeguarding MS patients' jobs?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Libicki for taking the initiative of bringing this matter before the House tonight."
"I welcome also my own opportunity to make a contribution to this debate."
"As regards the treatment of people with multiple sclerosis, and indeed the prevention of their marginalisation from society, there is a huge disparity in the way in which people affected by multiple sclerosis are treated across the European Union."
"Consequently, many thousands of people and their families suffer unnecessarily a poor quality of life."
"Access to essential drugs, therapies and services, are too often not driven by need, but by where a person happens to reside and whether their government invests sufficiently in those needs."
"It is a sad fact that it is not always the case of Member States not having the resources to provide such care and services."
"My own country, Ireland, is a prime example."
"We have had 10 years of enormous economic growth and wealth, and yet we still have one of the lowest ratios of neurologists to patients among the EU's wealthy nations."
"We need more research to advance our understanding of the illness and how best to treat it."
"Regrettably, in this House we constantly face opposition to such research, particularly embryo stem cell research, which offers the best hope for making advances."
"Finally, it is not appropriate to allow a situation to continue in which citizens of the European Union are treated unequally."
"While I acknowledge that it is primarily a responsibility of the Member States to deliver health care, it is also a responsibility of the European Commission to ensure that equality is applied across the board."
"I would like to see them sponsoring a 'race to the top' in terms of services for people with disabilities generally, but certainly people with multiple sclerosis."
"I believe publication of the progress being made by Member States signing up to this code of conduct would help drive that race to the top."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, there are approximately 400 000 people with multiple sclerosis within the EU."
"Louise McVay's petition brought our attention to MS in 2003 and it is only right that, three and a half years on, the Commission reports on the progress it has made in ensuring that the code of best practice, in particular, is implemented."
"The 2003 resolution called for equal access to health care for people with MS, but some drugs, like beta interferon, are still not uniformly available."
"In the UK we have a postcode lottery for this drug, with availability depending on where someone lives."
"In Poland only 1% of people with MS are treated with disease-modifying drugs, compared to 50% in Sweden."
"People with MS should be cared for in the best way possible, as called for by the code of best practice."
"It also calls for people with MS to be able to retain their jobs and obtain sufficient help and support to remain in mainstream society."
"That is why, as the Commissioner said, it is so important for the Employment Directive 2000 to be implemented equally across the EU."
"This year is the Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"Let us hope that it is also the year that we get a firm timetable for specific directives to outlaw discrimination in access to goods and services as well."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) This debate on measures to assist EU citizens with multiple sclerosis is of the highest importance."
"It is important to point out that measures have been taken on the basis of the December 2003 resolution aimed at giving greater visibility to the disease and at preventing discrimination against the 400 000-plus sufferers in the Community alone."
"It is vital that the Commission attach major importance to research aimed at speeding up the development of more effective treatment of all forms of multiple sclerosis and that it take into account the code of best practice on this matter drawn up by multiple sclerosis societies in the Member States and the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner what he intends to do to ensure equal opportunities for multiple sclerosis sufferers and to raise awareness among the Member States so that they pay greater attention to the problem."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, people who live with MS came to us in the Committee on Petitions to alert us to the discrepancies in treatment and opportunities for people with MS across the EU."
"Geography should not determine whether your disease goes into remission or progresses."
"In my own country of Ireland, we have one of the lowest ratios of neurologists to patients: 17, where we should have a minimum of 39, a fact that negatively affects the outcome for Irish patients."
"I would like to correct Mr De Rossa: stem cells obtained from the destruction of embryos have, to date, produced no treatments, whereas stem cells from cord blood have produced over 70 treatments, and it is to be hoped that, some day, there will be a treatment for MS."
"Finally, I would like to point out that, in spite of modern medicine and the abundance of food and water, the burden of disease in the EU is increasing."
"Why?"
"Because instances of MS and every other autoimmune condition, of which there are many, are on the increase."
"There is a widespread breakdown in the functioning of the human immune system."
"This is a crisis that we should not ignore."
"It is time to take an honest look at the unnatural and constant way in which modern life bombards the human immune system from its earliest stages, resulting in problems like poor immune development and immune collapse..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Madam President, in 2003, the European Parliament adopted, by a decisive majority, a resolution on the unequal treatment of multiple sclerosis sufferers in the European Union."
"At the time, the blatant discrimination affecting many multiple sclerosis sufferers in Europe resulted in Parliament asking the Commission to draw up a code of best practice to which all Member States should adhere."
"Four years have passed and the problem of MS has returned with double the impact as a result of the appalling situation facing sufferers in the new Member States."
"In terms of the number of MS sufferers living there, Poland ranks third in Europe."
"However, in contrast to the first and second place countries where 30% of sufferers have access to standard treatment only 2% of MS suffers in Poland have access to standard care."
"The situation is similar in Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary."
"If we also consider the fact that MS is an illness that affects young people and is the second most frequent cause of disability in Europe, the conclusions are obvious."
"I would therefore like to ask you to compare Parliament's common position on MS with the results of the Commission's work, particularly taking into account the situation faced by MS sufferers in the twelve new Member States."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, multiple sclerosis should - and must - be recognised through better support for sufferers and by finding practical solutions."
"This can be achieved through equitable access for citizens to health services and through the equitable provision of all effective means."
"There are broad differences between the Member States in the quality of care."
"The adoption of the Code of Best Practice proposed by the European Parliament is an expression of our political will to determine uniform methods of care and rehabilitation activities."
"This will support the right to an independent life, which depends on the provision of prompt and suitable health and social care for dignity and independence."
"At the same time, the aim is to have more, better coordinated research."
"The McBay case illustrated how even one citizen fighting alone is enough to turn the attention of the decision-makers to cases which may be unheard of sometimes or overlooked."
"The emphasis must be on joint efforts by the Member States and their experts to remove the obstacles, Commissioner."
"What role will the Commission play?"
"Madam President, almost everybody knows that true equality in the 27 Member States is but an elusive dream."
"This is particularly so in the field of health care, and it is most obvious when dealing with complex neurodegenerative disorders such as MS, which require highly specialised diagnosis and treatment centres."
"Yet, in this most important area for citizens' wellbeing, namely their health, our Treaties let us down disappointingly, as they place this area under the sole competence of Member States."
"Strangely enough, those responsible for making and maintaining the EU Treaties seem to care more about equality in business and marketing matters than about our health."
"Perhaps this debate on MS will lead to some wiser thinking and be the catalyst for changing this unsatisfactory and, in many respects, shameful state of affairs for the benefit of our citizens."
"(PL) Madam President, there are around 60 000 MS sufferers in Poland, which ranks Poland in third place after Germany and the United Kingdom."
"However, in those countries, around 30% of sufferers have access to immunomodulating therapy, whereas in Poland barely over 2% of patients can obtain this treatment."
"This is mainly due to a lack of funding and it is a problem that also affects the treatment of many other diseases, including cancer."
"MS is currently an incurable disease, resulting from an impaired immune system, which leads to damage of the myelin sheath."
"Immunomodulating treatment is expensive, as is physiotherapy."
"In Poland, any resolutions passed are not implemented mainly due to economic reasons and the crisis in the health service, the transformation of which has resulted in poor organisation and privatisation."
"The costs of medicines produced by Western companies are also prohibitively high."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament could try to influence these companies to prevent them from exploiting poorer patients and taking away their basic human right, namely the right to protect their health and to have access to medical treatment."
"Madam President, I would like very briefly to thank the Members for this interesting and very useful debate."
"It will give us ideas and inspirations on how we can proceed with this important issue in the future."
"I should like to give some information on the questions that have been posed."
"First of all, creating the link to the health portal is already under way; as we speak, it may have been done already."
"So, access to this information through the health portal will be made available to all citizens very soon, if it is not already available."
"The Commission will support the creation of a European register on multiple sclerosis, which will mostly be based on the existing registers in some Member States and expanded to include the other Member States."
"More importantly - because we have to be practical as well -funds to support this initiative will be provided under the seventh Framework Programme."
"On other issues, of course, many pieces of legislation are already in place, such as the issue of discrimination and access to work."
"However, based on the outcome of the conference which will take place in the future, which I mentioned in my opening speech, and on the discussion with the stakeholders, we will see if there is also a need for new legislative initiatives and consider what steps have to be taken."
"We will then, of course, be ready to proceed with new initiatives."
"Overall, as you know, we are dealing with inequality; it is a difficult issue."
"It was a priority of the UK Presidency and has been taken over by the Commission and the other Presidencies as well."
"But we have to live within the realities - the existing legal and Treaty realities of the European Union, the issue of competences, how much the Commission can oblige Member States in certain areas of health."
"Most is done through guidelines and recommendations."
"Even under the proposed Constitution as it stands, provision of health care remains the sole competence of the Member States."
"So, we try to encourage, coordinate with and support the Member States, and we will raise this issue with them whenever possible but, at the end of the day, this specific area of health care provision is the responsibility of the Member States."
"That does not mean that we will not continue encouraging them to proceed, to follow the code that has been mentioned and to take other steps, but I believe that, through our health service initiatives (we will be presenting a proposal before the end of the year), we will be able to tackle some of these aspects and, of course, I will be happy to continue discussing these with you."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"It is not easy to take part in a debate on a disease that affects over 400 000 people in Europe, with a new case every four hours."
"It is not easy because multiple sclerosis, the causes of which remain largely unknown, affects young people in particular, people of my own age who see their ambitions and dreams for the future crushed without warning, not to mention the impact on their daily lives."
"Today, however, there is tangible, genuine hope thanks to the important and encouraging progress made through scientific research, with determined work day after day taking new steps towards identifying causes, mechanisms and cures for the neurological collapse brought on by multiple sclerosis."
"At this stage our chief duty is to promote, support and encourage this research, including financially; it must be free from conditions and from limitations and fears, which are often bigoted and promote other agendas."
"At the same time, all the commitments made by the European Commission in its 2003 resolution must be honoured, in particular with regard to drawing up a code of best practice."
"I also believe that it is the specific duty of the Community institutions to promote and support the work of all associations, such as the AISM [Italian Multiple Sclerosis Association] in my country, which, with dedication and professionalism, do commendable work and provide targeted help for those affected by multiple sclerosis and their families."

"The situation in Palestine (debate)"
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have all been deeply moved and disturbed by the terrible events and tragic occurrences in the Gaza Strip over the last few days."
"As you know, I chose to make the Middle East the destination for my first official trip outside the European Union and visited the region."
"My meeting with Mr Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, was originally scheduled to take place in Ramallah, but, because of increasing hostilities between Fatah and Hamas, he asked me to visit him at his official residence in Gaza, where he was trying to mediate between the opposing factions, and that is what I did."
"It was exactly three weeks ago that I was having talks with President Abbas in Gaza, when I was impressed by the calm determination with which he explained his convictions to me, yet, once outside his official apartments, I could feel the tension in the air."
"My recommendation to you, Members of this House, is that you condemn the Hamas militias' violent attacks on the legitimate security forces and the institutions of the Palestinian Authority in the strongest terms, and it is out of the deepest conviction that I recommend that you express our support for President Abbas and our solidarity with him."
"We support the Palestinian President's decision to announce a state of emergency and appoint an emergency government in order to be able to resolve as soon as possible the political crisis in the Palestinian territories."
"The new prime minister, Mr Salam Fayyad, recently visited me in Brussels; we have great confidence in him and in his leadership qualities, and, should you mandate me to do so, I shall say so to him today."
"The new government has a difficult task; it will need active assistance from the European Union and from the international community, and I should like to say, following on from the conclusions adopted at yesterday's Council of Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg, that we in this House should act on our deepest convictions in supporting, in word and in deed, those who seek peace in the Middle East and are continuing to work for it."
"Yesterday, at the opening of our plenary session, this House decided to defer voting on a resolution on the European Union's Middle East policy until the July plenary sitting, and, given the continuing instability and the constantly changing situation in the region, I do believe that was the right decision to take."
"That does not mean, however, that we have any intention of being passive observers of what is happening."
"The European Union - and that means this House too - must be in the advance guard of those working for a renewed relationship with the Palestinian people and those responsible for representing it."
"We must shoulder our responsibility and act accordingly, doing everything in our power to get conditions throughout the Palestinian territories restored to those worthy of human beings; while we must support those who live there in meeting their most pressing human needs, we must also help to give them a real and long-term political perspective."
"Yesterday's Council of Foreign Ministers resolved to restore normal relations with the Palestinian Authority, and this is something we should welcome, together with the related decision to create the conditions needed in order to facilitate the resumption of efficient and transparent direct financial assistance and help with the development of functioning institutions."
"The mission under the Common Foreign and Security Policy, together with the police cooperation mission, are remaining in place, and, as a decision-making part of the EU's budgetary authority, this House should firmly support that decision."
"As well as taking these steps, though, we in this House should call on the Palestinians to return to the path of dialogue in order to achieve the reconciliation that is needed before there can be a Palestinian state covering the Palestinian territories as a whole."
"It cannot be in anyone's interest that the civil war should become more widespread or go on for any longer."
"It has to be said, though, that there can be no peace without Israel, which bears a great responsibility."
"When I paid a visit there - and especially when I addressed the Knesset - I made it quite clear that the European Parliament was and is calling on those in positions of political power in Israel to express their firm support for President Abbas."
"With that in mind, I would like, now, to reiterate my call for Israel to release to President Abbas the Palestinian customs duties and taxes - amounting to some USD 800 million - that it has been withholding for several months now."
"The Israeli Government has declared itself willing to do that, and should now actually do so with the minimum possible delay."
"The European Union must be an honest broker, and I see the European Parliament's role as being to play a responsible part in this."
"The peoples of Israel and Palestine are equal in dignity; they are entitled to live within secure borders."
"May the day come when Palestinians can live at peace with Palestinians and Palestinians with Israelis; a policy of reconciliation and mutual understanding along these lines may, today, appear to be a long way in the distance, but we in this House, being the representatives of the people of Europe, must support it as a matter of conviction and out of a sense of our own responsibility."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that our Parliament was right to alter the agenda in order to deal with the Middle East situation."
"Unfortunately, I am very doubtful as to whether our debate will help in the quest for a solution to the conflict, but we clearly had to hold it all the same."
"Just a few days ago in Brussels we held a debate on the situation in the Middle East with the High representative and Commissioner Ferrero in which we recognised the fortieth anniversary of the Six Day War, during which Israel invaded Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights."
"Today, 40 years later, we must accept that the situation is still in deadlock - as the French press reminded us yesterday - that it has not been possible to create a Palestinian State and that, unfortunately, there are effectively two governments in conflict with each other. Furthermore, there is an extremely serious political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis."
"You were asking, Mr President, what the international community in general, and the European Union in particular, can do, and what we clearly have to do, firstly, is support Mahmoud Abbas and the moderate government of Salam Fayas, the destiny of which is not just to be the government of the West Bank, but also of Gaza."
"We must also lift the international blockade - as you also pointed out, Mr President - imposed on Palestine since Hamas won the elections."
"We must therefore welcome the decision taken yesterday by the General Affairs Council to restore direct aid to the Palestinian National Authority, and we hope that the meeting that is to be held today in Washington between the President of the United States and the Israeli Prime Minister will take us in the same direction."
"It is also time, Mr President, for Israel to transfer the sums owed to Palestine in customs duties."
"While these are all necessary conditions, however, Mr President, they are clearly not sufficient, since we all know that the situation in Gaza is still one of violence and that, in reality, in the difficult equation of war and peace, progress can only be made in the Middle East through the renunciation of violence as a means of political action, through the recognition of the State of Israel and through any actions, such as the release of the British journalist Alan Johnston, that may contribute to the objective of peace."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all political men and women in this House, and we are perfectly aware that the highest of the political values is unity and that, without unity, it will not be possible to realise the dream of a viable Palestinian State living in peace with its neighbours."
"Mr President, as you have pointed out quite rightly, it is time for the guns to fall silent so that dialogue can prevail and peace can be consolidated, and it falls to the European Union, together with other players such as the United Nations or the Arab League or other members of the Quartet, to mobilise all of its efforts in order to contribute, intelligently and generously, in a manner that is consistent with its tradition and it values and, from the point of view of humanitarian aid, naturally, to a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we have to regard the events of the past few days as representing a nadir in the development of the region, I would see it also as representing a nadir in our own - the European Union's - role in its dealings with the Middle East."
"Yesterday, the Council of Foreign Ministers decided to resume sending aid."
"Why, though, did they wait to do that until after civil order had broken down?"
"(Applause)"
"You, Mr President, have just called for the payment of direct aid to Mahmud Abbas."
"I would ask whether it might be the case that it is too late for that."
"Is it not perhaps possible that the disintegration of civil order in the Gaza Strip - which is what is happening now - might have been prevented if the aid had been sent earlier on, and if we had not imposed on ourselves, as a matter of strategy, the rule that there were to be no talks with Hamas?"
"(Applause)"
"I do not myself know the answer to that question, and we are certainly not in a position to say that things would have worked out better if we had acted differently, but it is a question that we must at least be allowed to ask."
"Is it not also the case that we - that is to say, the European Union and the community of Western states - are now, once again, seeing that there is a process at work, whereby a people elects a government that we do not like the look of; we are happy with the elections - which our electoral observers confirm were unobjectionably conducted - but not with the result that emerged from them, and so we come to the conclusion that what is needed is a blockade, and a complete one at that."
"Why was it that we did not actually talk to those members of the government of national unity who are not members of Hamas?"
"There were many members of the government who were not members of Hamas, or of Fatah either."
"The forces with whom we find ourselves talking may not, for the moment, be to our liking, but dialogue is nevertheless the only way to reach peaceful solutions."
"I can remember - as you all can - how, when I was a young man, Yasser Arafat was seen as the world's number one terrorist; the man was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
"I was in favour of engaging in dialogue with him."
"History has shown that it was dialogue that provided a way out of violence."
"Today, Fatah is regarded as one of our partners; it was once seen as the terrorist organisation par excellence."
"That is why we have to learn from our own mistakes."
"If we consider things as they actually stand, then there is only one way we can go - that is what I still believe, that is what my group still believes, that is what the social democratic family of parties still believes - and it is that we have to try to get all the stakeholding forces and all the interested parties around one table."
"Anyone who talks to Syria is treated as an outcast, yet we ourselves know that the time will come and is not far off when there will be negotiations between it and Israel."
"Preparations for them are already in hand."
"We know that the Israeli Government, over the past year, has tried to establish contact with Syria."
"Let us be a bit more honest and say, yes, it goes without saying that Syria should have a place at the conference table, particularly if you want to have some influence over Hamas."
"There is surely no point in only looking back at the past."
"We have to provide whatever direct aid we now can."
"I do not know whether there is any chance of exerting some influence in the Gaza Strip, but, if there is, what this aid needs to be used for above all else is the creation of a state infrastructure, with support for the security forces who are actually making things safe rather than bringing insecurity, but most of all - and this is something about which not enough has been said in the debates over recent days - we in the European Union have to ensure that humanitarian aid is provided, for what we are now seeing happening is, among other things, a people who are already in need having - and not for the first time - yet more misery inflicted on them by radicalised armed forces on the fringes of society."
"The people who really suffer are the ordinary people who have no water supply, no electricity, no medical care, and cannot send their children to school, and it is only as and when we are able to deal with those things that we will get people to want Israel to have the security that it needs in order to be able to live in peace, for one thing that is plain to see is that it will not be able to live in greater security if people become even more radicalised and civil war breaks out."
"That will make only for even more instability."
"The fundamental precondition for social security is always that we can extend it and thereby create in a given region greater willingness to make peace."
"That is what the European Union's main task must be, rather than the sending of European troops, which is what I have heard advocated by not a few representatives of this Union of ours over the past few days."
"It is not conceivable that, for political reasons, there should be no money available to send humanitarian aid, but that the funds are there when it comes to sending troops."
"That it is, in any case, not our way of doing things."
"I hope that it will prove possible to resume the dialogue in the Middle East."
"(Applause from the left)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as Mr Schulz said, there can be no justification for the actions of Hamas militants, however badly the Palestinians have been treated."
"And yet, if one year ago the international community had not reneged on its commitment to democracy in Palestine, if we had not refused dialogue with Hamas moderates and suspended direct aid payments to a freely elected government, the situation would not be as bad as it is today."
"Financial sanctions designed to force recognition of Israel or to push Hamas out of power altogether have simply made the Palestinians more desperate and prospects for peace more precarious."
"A two-state Palestine is emerging, riddled by violence, sectarianism and fear, while a two-state solution to the conflict is moving further away."
"Liberals and Democrats are disappointed - though not surprised - by what has come to pass."
"A year ago, we warned that Palestinian suffering would lead to greater extremism, particularly in Gaza's prison conditions, where 1.4 million citizens have been systematically sealed-off and starved of their basic necessities."
"Last week's violent takeover of Gaza bespoke a lack of respect for the rule of law, which is a de minimis requirement for any legitimate government."
"If Hamas is not careful, it will have betrayed its cause and, in the words of Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, 'put the last nail in the coffin' of the dream of a Palestinian state."
"Unless we want civil war to triumph over unity, all sides must face the facts: their refusal of dialogue has got them nowhere."
"A heavy dose of pragmatism is now required - not condemnation, not sanctions, and certainly not a refusal to negotiate."
"That is the coward's option and one which will backfire."
"To that end, my Group welcomes Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's determination to restore security and President Abbas's commitment to dialogue."
"We welcome resumption of direct aid to the Palestinian Authority and the prospective release of up to USD 800 million in Palestinian tax revenues by the Israeli Administration."
"However, we caution against supporting the West Bank administration at the expense of Gaza."
"If you consider the strip a 'terrorist entity' - as Israeli officials have called it - you will not bring the region any closer to peace, you simply create more insecurity as a desperate people, deprived of food and other essentials, decides it has nothing left to lose."
"Hamas control of Gaza was the nightmare that became reality."
"However, the European Union must not be prepared to take a back seat and watch as Iran becomes a player in the contest."
"If this year has taught us nothing else, it is that politics - and politics alone - can create prospects for peace in the Middle East."
"While Parliament, at least, kept talking, the Council and the Member States took to the sidelines."
"It is now up to the Council and our Member States to put democracy, human dignity and the rule of law back at the centre of proceedings and work to foster peace in the region."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, the most important thing we have to remember here today is the people's lives that are affected by the new wave of violence in the Palestinian Territories."
"In particular, we must think of the women and children, whose suffering is not something that has occurred just because of the Hamas takeover in Gaza, or just because of a lack of negotiation between the Palestinian and the Israeli authorities, or just because of the cancellation of aid from the European Union and the US; their suffering goes back 30 years."
"Anybody you speak to from the Palestinian area will tell you that it has always been the women and the children who have suffered most, but they have also been the most resilient in trying to find a way forward to challenge the failure to negotiate, the failure to respect and the failure to find a solution; indeed, the failure of both Israel and Palestine to live up to their commitments, to agreements that they voluntarily signed up to, the failure of the United States of America and the European Union to live up to their commitments with regard to clear and open negotiations, the failure of other states bordering Israel and Palestine to take a more proactive and positive role with regard to, ultimately, achieving a two-state solution, which must be based on viability and equality."
"Colleagues will remember that, some weeks ago in the European Parliament building in Brussels, the President of Parliament invited a number of Nobel Prize winners to speak on the future of Europe and on areas and issues that they are concerned with."
"It is quite ironic that, when you read through the speeches of the people who were there that day, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, all of them said that the peace efforts they were involved in only came about through dialogue, respect for diversity, tolerance and equality."
"What we have seen in Palestine over the last 30 years has been a failure to meet any one of those four criteria."
"When Yasser Arafat was the leader of the Palestinian people, Israel said it could not deal with him, it could not negotiate with him."
"When a new President was brought in, Israel said it could not deal with him, it could not negotiate with him and they were backed up all the time by the Americans and by certain Member States of the European Union."
"To think that what happened in Gaza with Hamas was an accident is to misread, even with the gift of hindsight, our own failures in the European Union and in the US to deal properly with the solutions that may be required."
"Now we have been given a new opportunity to do something."
"Now we have been given a new opportunity to show courage in the face of death and disaster, to show humanity in the face of oppression and injustice, and to stand up and say what is right and what is correct: that we should give aid to the Palestinian people, we should insist that Israel negotiate with the democratically-elected representatives of the Palestinian people and we should back up the Palestinian Authorities to ensure that the rule of law applies throughout the Palestinian Territories."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we can all agree that what we have heard today is an analysis."
"Mistakes have, without a doubt, been made by interested parties on every side, and when I say that we are paying bitterly for them now, by 'we' I mean above all else the Palestinians, but also - or so I believe - the Israelis and all those with an interest in this region having, for once, something to look forward to - not just a peaceful future, but any kind of future at all."
"What can be done?"
"That is the question I would like to focus on."
"For a start, the European Union must at last wake up and do something about the mistakes that have been made here, and the reason why it is the European Union that must act is that it is the only political entity in a position to act as a mediator; the Americans cannot do it - the war in Iraq makes that impossible - and nor can the Russians or any of the others."
"Someone has to take the initiative in saying 'yes' - 'yes' to direct aid payments, 'yes' of course to support, 'yes' to contacts with Gaza and with Hamas in order to address the humanitarian problems in the Gaza Strip."
"That means not waiting for a declaration, but rather taking action and then getting a declaration - that is what is called for; it means going straight to the heart of the nation in the name of the European Union and carrying on straightaway with a European quintet - which is, in essence, what is being attempted even if it is not being called that - with a great big conference held in the region."
"Mr Schulz is right to say that we have to talk to Syria and with everyone we want to - and, in any case, must - negotiate with about the Golan Heights and the borders of Lebanon, and that has to be done now."
"Why?"
"Because that is the only chance that the region will have of renewed hope."
"It is renewed hope that makes political dialogue possible and not the other way round."
"We are always being warned against giving any one side preferential treatment; nobody in this region is going to be given any."
"That is what we have to learn from all this."
"That means without a doubt that humanitarian aid for Gaza must be forthcoming; it is in nobody's interest that the only humanitarian aid it gets should come from Iran, and if that happens, we will again shed tears and say that we did not want that."
"Well, if that is not what we want, let us prevent it, and if we want to prevent that from happening, we have to take action; that is what is needed, and right now."
"What Israel has to come to understand is that a policy of occupation founded upon a wall that is perceived as an injustice will not bring peace, and it will not bring hope either; they have to get that into their heads once and for all."
"For them, getting out of a worst-case scenario must mean doing what they have not done before, that is to say negotiating with the new government in Palestine the demolition of the wall and the establishment of a secure boundary on the other side of it."
"That means that financial assistance, humanitarian aid and political initiative are called for, and if those things are not forthcoming, then, month after month, there will be weepings and lamentations when we meet here."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, in the face of the tragedy that is unfolding in the Palestinian territories, appeals for the violence to cease are completely ineffective if we refuse to see how this predictable catastrophe came into being."
"This unprecedented explosion of violence is, firstly and above all, the product of those other acts of violence arising from 40 years of military occupation."
"It is the fruit of the impunity granted by the entire international community to the Israeli leaders, whoever they are and whatever they do, in utter disregard of international law."
"This violence is the price to be paid for the loss of all hope of a Palestinian State worthy of the name."
"What a heavy responsibility that is, then, for European leaders!"
"Europe, it is said, is the chief donor."
"All very well, but what is the point of giving aid if we allow the deadly poison of permanent humiliation to spread?"
"The situation in Gaza grotesquely illustrates this, and the continuing isolation of Gaza could only push it to the extreme."
"What a responsibility to have ruined historic opportunities such as the Arab League peace plan since 2002, the success of the first democratic process in Palestine in 2006 or, more recently, the establishment of a last-chance national unity government, all by aligning ourselves with the deadly strategy of the White House!"
"There are a certain number of us here, who raised cries of alarm time after time."
"The most recent being an appeal by more than 100 Members of the European Parliament to put an end to a policy that, through government boycotts and the withdrawal of direct aid, nurtures the despair of a nation on the point of imploding."
"We were answered with reassuring words about the intentions of the Quartet, that illusion manipulated by the Bush administration to cover up its non-intervention."
"Here, however, we have the UN special envoy to the Middle East delivering, in person, a clear indictment of all those, Europeans included, who practise what he calls 'self-censorship' with regard to the occupier and whose recent decisions to boycott and to freeze aid have had, he insists, devastating consequences."
"This historic failure and this repudiation on the part of the chief UN representative in the region call for a special debate at the highest level."
"From now on, if we no longer wish to make ourselves party to a new Iraq, we must demand, as a matter of utmost urgency, fundamental strategic revisions underpinned by the international law that should have been imposed on everyone for the last 40 years."
"History will be our judge."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, last week, the so-called Palestinian Fatah-Hamas unity government came to a violent end."
"As a result, this House is facing two Palestinian cabinets that deny each other's right to exist."
"Meanwhile, the Council and Commission have clearly opted in favour of the Salam Fayyad crisis cabinet on the West Bank."
"I should like to back this position all the way, because unlike the Fatah movement under the aegis of Mahmoud Abbas, the Hamas leaders persist in the denial of Israel's right to exist within and outside the Gaza Strip."
"On purely religious grounds, Hamas has turned against a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"This is an issue, the religious foundations of Hamas, which Mr Schulz ought to read up on some time."
"Given the permanent policy of regional destabilisation pursued by Damascus and Tehran, I can see how this destructive position adopted by Hamas is actively being fuelled by the Islamic republic and Syria."
"The fact, however, that certain MEPs and even groups in our House wish to trust as an equal interlocutor and pander to Hamas, which is after all Israel's arch enemy, totally baffles me. Even to this day."
"Does this mean that the two-state political solution has become nothing but absurd hypocrisy in this House?"
"Meanwhile, I warmly wish the Palestinian people a selfless leadership that, internally, shows evidence of a powerful government and externally, genuinely seeks the modus vivendi with Israel."
"The newly appointed Fayyad emergency cabinet offers this opportunity."
"In order to put this into practice, I am counting on the helping, motivating and controlling hands of all the European institutions."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Gaza Strip is not a new Palestinian state; far from it, it is a prison, a prison in which people - Palestinians, the Palestinian people, and women, children and old people in particular - are obliged to live in barracks, shut away from the world."
"The latest outbreak of violence, with the Hamas militias seizing power in the Gaza Strip, was of course made possible by wrongdoing on the part of European policymakers, American policymakers, Israeli policymakers and Fatah too."
"For it was Israeli politicians who refused the Palestinian Government its tax revenues and built a wall to keep the Palestinian people in their place; the Americans allowed that to happen and showed themselves incapable of forcing all the warring factions to sit down at a table together; and, finally, it was the Europeans, including us in this House, who were unable to give support to a democratically elected government, some of the elements in which we found uncongenial or disagreeable - and hence found ourselves denying support to the moderates and failing to encourage the growth, within Hamas and elsewhere, of those forces who could have been amenable to reason."
"It is they who are to blame for this state of affairs."
"We know that, now Hamas has seized power, it is one of the four radical elements in the Middle East, together with Iran, Syria and Hizbollah."
"We also know that radical Islamism of the kind preached by Hamas is very dangerous, that the elements associated with it are the forces behind global Islamist terrorism, and - of course - that we Europeans must defend ourselves against it."
"On the other hand, though, we have to stand up for the Palestinians' right to self-determination, which means that they should elect as their government the people they want rather than the ones we want, because we are not in a position to pick and choose them."
"It follows, then, that we must not repeat our former mistakes; we have to talk to, and support, those Palestinian forces that enjoy majority popular support."
"Important though the security of Israel is to Europe, the future prospects for the Palestinian people are no less so, and if we manage to give them hope for the future, we stand a chance of establishing peace in the Middle East in the longer term."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (SK) I have serious concerns over the current situation in the Palestinian territories."
"The Palestinian authority is split."
"Notwithstanding the outcome of the elections, the joint government of the Fatah and Hamas movements was doomed to struggle, and it was only a matter of time until the tensions erupted into a bloody conflict."
"Hamas takes pride in the fact that, in their founding documents, the movement set for itself the goal of destroying Israel."
"Judging by the current behaviour of Hamas, we can conclude they have never given up their terrorist actions and way of thinking."
"How are we supposed to work on helping Palestinian citizens who live in refugee camps, have no jobs and live in wretched living conditions, if the same Palestinians elect a movement which subscribes to terrorism and aims to destroy their neighbour, Israel?"
"How are we supposed to work on implementing the Oslo accords and the establishment of two equal states, Palestine and Israel, when one of the participants dreams of wiping out, through war and terrorism, the very existence of its neighbour with whom it should peacefully coexist?"
"As a member of the political section of Euromed, I call on Parliament to condemn all forms of terrorism in Palestine and any alliances with Hezbollah terrorists."
"The European Union must support the peace process in both Palestine and Israel."
"Last but not least, the EU humanitarian assistance there should not, via non-transparent means, end up in the hands of terrorist organisations."

"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the successor to Mrs Wallis as rapporteur for codification, I should like to draw attention to a problem that Mrs Wallis also had."
"The codification procedure is a simple, quick procedure."
"It is based on agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, and enables legal acts that have been amended several times to be consolidated into a single legal act."
"Substantive changes are explicitly exempted from the codification, which is why I broadly welcome the agreement on a fast procedure."
"Scrutiny is carried out by the legal services of the Council, Parliament and the Commission, which compare the revised legal acts carefully."
"The result is then presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur."
"I am an advocate of simplification and of better lawmaking, but with one reservation."
"As rapporteur, I receive the codified legal acts together with the result of the scrutiny by the legal services between one and three weeks before the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"It is impossible to scrutinise so many legal acts carefully in such a short space of time."
"There should be the option of careful scrutiny, however, when one is to subsequently vote on the legal acts in one's own name."
"I should like to request, therefore, that in future the codified version be sent to the legal services and the EP rapporteur at the same time."
"The simplicity of the procedure would not be affected, and the position of the rapporteur would be greatly strengthened."
"I think that this would be in the interests of the entire Parliament as well as the rapporteur for codification."

"I should also like to thank the Commission services and, in particular, Mrs Kroes for her openness, the personal interest she has taken in this matter and her readiness to engage in dialogue."
"It has become particularly important today for there to be cooperation between the European institutions and for Parliament to be strongly involved, at a time when European competition policy covers strategic sectors such as energy and services of general economic interest, when it encompasses new areas such as the environment and when much competition has acquired a global dimension."

"(For the results and other details of the votes: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (FR) Changing patterns in the world of work, the fragility of certain sectors such as industry, the explosion in the services sector and increased mobility of the work force are all phenomena making it necessary for the European Parliament to work towards greater protection for workers."
"As long ago as December, Mrs Bachelot's report set out to establish a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and it is this same concern to take account of the rights of workers that lies behind the Directive on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer."
"Every year, thousands of employees are deprived of income, sometimes for months, as a result of their firms becoming bankrupt, thereby resulting in hardship."
"This directive will allow codification of all the rules relating to the protection of the employee in the event of the insolvency of the employer, and it will apply to any employment relationship, whatever the type of contract."
"The completion of the internal market, which is sometimes wrongly accused of increasing insecurity on the labour market, may, on the contrary, give rise to genuine legislation and the creation of a system of protection for employees."
"This report, which I support, is evidence of this."
"in writing. (SK) I am very pleased that we have adopted the EP Directive on minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment."
"The codified version was drafted using a data processing system on the basis of the consolidated wording of Directive 89/655/EEC."
"It is very important that employers should always take necessary measures to ensure the safety and health protection of their employees by means of suitable equipment and conditions for their work."
"New employers in particular are sometimes prone to focus more on net profit, rather than spending on various safety equipment or creating work conditions; as a result, the health and occasionally the lives of employees may be jeopardised."
"Employers now face a clear framework of standards they must comply with; therefore I welcome the adoption of this text, which unequivocally strengthens health and safety protection at work."
"in writing. (SK) We have adopted a codified proposal based on the preliminary consolidated wording of Directive 83/477/EEC as amended."
"I am aware of the fact that improved safety, hygiene and health protection of employees envisages the elimination of asbestos and all asbestos-containing materials from the work environment, as these materials are extremely dangerous to human health, since they are associated with carcinogenicity."
"The consolidation of this directive produces a binding text which prohibits the use of asbestos and materials derived from asbestos for construction, demolition and remediation works, and will improve in all respects the situation of workers exposed to asbestos."
"I also welcome the preventive measures designed to protect health at work."
"This report concerns the fisheries agreement with São Tomé and Principe on Community fishing opportunities for four years, beginning in June 2006."
"Under this agreement, Portugal has five licences for tuna surface longliners."
"In this new agreement, there has been a 32% overall reduction in fishing opportunities."
"At the same time, the financial burden for shipowners - from EUR 25 to 35 per tonne of fish caught - has increased, while the financial burden for the Community has been reduced by the same amount."
"These are measures that, in view of their impact on the sector, give us grave cause for concern."
"At Community level, these conditions mean agreements with ever smaller fishing opportunities and with ever greater burdens and responsibilities for shipowners. The question is therefore that of how they actually contribute towards improving the economic situation for the fisheries sector in the various EU Member States."
"Lastly, we have our biggest reservations about Amendment 2 of this report, adopted by Parliament, which confers discretionary power on the Commission to withdraw licences in the event of non-compliance with obligations."
"In our opinion, the procedure in force for this type of situation must remain in place."
"The agreement before us lays down Community fishing opportunities for the next six years in the waters of Kiribati, by and large maintaining the conditions of the May 2003 Fisheries Agreement."
"The agreement, which is solely for tuna, retains the number of available licences for the Portuguese fleet, that is to say six licences for surface longliners, together with the distribution of financing, with shipowners contributing 35%."
"It is important to mention, however, the change in the sphere of reference: the old fisheries agreements with third countries, which were commercial in nature, has been replaced by the new Partnership Agreements, with fisheries protocols, which will effectively work more and more as development aid."
"I wish to point out, in this context, that fishing opportunities are diminishing all the time, while the financial burdens for vessels are increasing and the fishing rules are becoming increasingly tough, which means that most fleets will not be able to take full advantage of these opportunities."
"Furthermore, companies from EU countries in this sector sometimes relocate production."
"This is a series of issues that cause us to have reservations and concerns, and when these agreements are put into practice, these issues should be studied and evaluated in greater depth."
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking once more the rapporteur Mr Schnellhardt for negotiating an excellent compromise; one that, thank goodness, has also obtained the necessary majority in plenary."
"We Austrians were particularly interested in the issue of 'Jagatee'."
"Together with Ministers Pröll and Seehofer in the Council, we succeeded in reaching a compromise that we see as perfectly workable."
"Our German friends, too, now have a drink that they are allowed to produce exclusively under the name 'Hüttentee'."
"I believe that this issue has been resolved as well as possible and also amicably."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the fact that here in Parliament we are striving to safeguard Europe's cultural heritage."
"Across the political divide, we share the goal of ensuring that the traditional technical or geographical designations of spirituous liquors are accurate, and that no other products can use the same designations."
"Not only are we safeguarding cultural diversity but we are also protecting consumers' rights."
"I have voted the way I did so that all consumers, wherever they order a glass of vodka, whiskey, rum or Czech slivovice, can be sure that they are getting exactly what they want in their drink."
"I have voted, therefore, in favour of being able to distinguish from the wording on the label whether something is other than a traditional form of liquor."
"Spirits made from bananas, for example, rather than from potatoes, cereals or molasses, should not be called banana vodka, but banana drink or banana spirit."
"Perhaps it would not be so difficult to defend European vodka in the WTO."
"European consumers must be sure that what they are buying is what they asked for and not a fake."
"It is similarly important for the Czech Republic that the labelling of Czech slivovice, which is traditionally distilled from plums, cannot be used also for, say, European distilled spirits that are plum-flavoured because plum juice has been added to the spirit."
"Trust me, that cannot be compared to plums distilled in slivovice, and if anyone is unsure about that, I would ask them to come to my country and try some."
"I would ask my vote in favour in the last nominal vote to be recorded because my equipment was unfortunately not working."
"(PL) Mr President, unfortunately, the majority of Members supported a broader definition of vodka."
"This was a defeat for many centuries of tradition."
"The rapporteur, and the Members who supported the broader definition supported principles which will lead to the production of vodka that is of a poorer quality and tastes worse."
"This could, in turn, result in a vodka made from various agricultural products, including those of animal origin and post-production waste, which is dangerous to consumer health."
"Products such as vodka are associated with certain regions of the world, which often boast many years of vodka-making tradition."
"These are national products and we cannot tinker with them by introducing ambiguous definitions, which is exactly what we have done today."
"This decision is wrong."
"(SK) When Slovakia acceded the EU, local producers were required to make changes to the designation of alcohol and spirits."
"The producers were not overly enthusiastic, but they complied with the need for change in a disciplined manner."
"The 'rum' they had produced became 'um'; to have retained the designation 'rum' it would have had to be produced from sugar cane alcohol."
"For economic reasons, producers preferred to stick with alcohol produced from grain or sugar beet molasses."
"This is one of the reasons why in Slovakia we have 'um' instead of 'rum', the former being a spirit with a specific rum flavouring people consume because of its taste, which has evolved over generations and has not changed since EU accession."
"This is why I sympathise with my fellow Members from Poland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; this is why I have signed and voted in favour of the amendment demanding that there be a strict definition of vodka, which would regard grain, potatoes and, potentially, sugar beet molasses as the only acceptable raw materials."
"I do not consider the Schnellhardt compromise acceptable, since, although it would not change the labelling on vodkas made from grain, potatoes or molasses, it would involve products made from other raw materials being designated 'vodka made from ...' followed by the name of the original ingredient."
"This is such a simple matter, and EU definitions should be just as simple."
"Since the amendment was not adopted, I have abstained from voting on the report by my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt."
"(LT) Mr President, I would like to speak about the Schnellhardt document."
"I am not an admirer of vodka, and I have no desire to advertise the product; however, I believe that the compromise solution we have adopted today, likewise the one regarding the definition of vodka, is a step forward."
"I voted for it, although the country I represent - Lithuania - wanted a much more specific definition."
"I think the solutions we have adopted today do not fully satisfy the hopes of consumers and European Community vodka manufacturers, especially from our region."
"However, I voted in favour of the proposal on the understanding that it was a compromise solution."
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the Schnellhardt report, as all countries - including my own, Austria - have developed their own, often regional, specialities and spirit drinks."
"The issue of 'Jagatee' has already been mentioned."
"It was a very important one as far as we were concerned, as I believe that such traditions, including in the field of spirit drinks, are virtually part of a country's national identity."
"Protecting production methods also guarantees high quality and, of course, guarantees that established producers and production methods are protected."
"The fact that the 'vodka war', too, has now been ended was a further reason for my voting in favour of this report."
"The new regulation on spirit drinks will bring greater clarity to the definition of this kind of drink and to the methods used to produce it."
