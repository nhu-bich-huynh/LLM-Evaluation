"In my view, it would not be useful or appropriate for the international community to force yet another blueprint upon its citizens."
"We need consensus and a consensus-building political process in Bosnia and Herzegovina to achieve that objective."
"I can assure you that the Commission will play an active role in the region in order to sustain hopes for its future in Europe."
"I very much look forward to working together with the European Parliament and the Presidency to achieve that objective."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on relations between the EU, China and Taiwan and security in the Far East."
". Mr President, in the 30 years since the European Union established diplomatic relations with China, both the European Union and China, and indeed the EU-China relationship, have seen quite remarkable change."
"The European Union-China relationship is now as close as it has ever been."
"But now, more than ever it is crucial that the European Union adapts to the challenge of China’s political and economic growth."
"European Union economies need to be able to respond to the competition and the opportunities offered by China and other emerging economies in Asia."
"The European Union has many interests at stake in China and East Asia more widely, clearly a highly important region in the 21st century."
"It is vital that the European Union and China both work together, with other international partners, to tackle global problems."
"Discussion between the European Union and China is now rightly on a broad range of topics, including regional security, human rights, environment, education, migration, climate change and transportation."
"Just last week, the first EU-China Aviation Summit took place."
"All these discussions bring benefits to both parties."
"The European Union already has a lot of experience to share and often China is approaching problems in a new way and the European Union can learn from its fresh approach."
"The eighth European-China Summit in September in Bejing will be an opportunity to celebrate 30 years of official relations between the European Union and China and to look forward to the next 30 years."
"This will be an opportunity for the European Union and China to work together as global partners on global challenges."
"We look forward to this chance for the European Union and China to combine their efforts in order to address the challenges of climate change and energy security through dialogue and practical cooperation."
"Of course there are differences between us, but it is a sign of the maturity of the relationship that we can discuss these constructively, for example, through the EU-China human rights dialogue."
"Human rights are of course a fundamental part of European Union foreign policy."
"The European Union acknowledges that China has made considerable progress over the last decade in its social-economic development and welcomes steps towards the strengthening the rule of law and cooperation with UN human rights mechanisms."
"But much more is needed."
"The European Union continues to have serious concerns about human rights in China, such as freedom of expression, freedom of religion and freedom of assembly."
"Journalists, lawyers, and members of NGOs continue to be harassed."
"The death penalty continues to be used extensively; there is widespread administrative detention and we have serious concerns about the use of torture."
"The situation in Tibet and Xinjiang remain a concern."
"The Council welcomes China’s work towards the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and hopes that as this work continues there will be real improvements in the day-to-day lives of all China’s citizens."
"Another issue which China and the European Union discuss frequently is that of Taiwan."
"The last 30 years have seen tremendous change in Taiwan too."
"Taiwan is one of the most successful Asian tigers, experiencing an enviable 5.9 % economic growth just last year."
"GDP per capita in real terms is considered to be on a par with Japan and Hong Kong."
"But change there has not just been economic, but also political."
"Thirty years ago Chiang Kai-Shek died and his son Chiang Ching-kuo continued in power thereafter."
"It was not until 1996 that Taiwan had its first democratic presidential election."
"Now Taiwan is a full democracy."
"The European Union’s Member States have no diplomatic relations with Taiwan."
"Nevertheless, its economic and commercial ties with Taiwan are strong."
"Taiwan is of course a member of the World Trade Organisation."
"Taiwan and the European Union also enjoy solid relations in other non-political areas, such as science, education, culture and various technical fields."
"However, other aspects of the cross- Strait relationship are not so positive and this has consequences for regional security."
"In March this year China introduced its ‘anti-secession’ legislation with the intention, it said, of halting or deterring Taiwanese moves towards independence."
"It was largely a codification of existing Chinese policy but it made reference to China’s strong commitment to peaceful reunification and more disturbingly made reference to the use of non-peaceful means should circumstances warrant."
"The description of what those circumstances might be was rather vague."
"The European Union reacted by reaffirming its adherence to its one-China policy and its opposition to any use of force to resolve this issue."
"The European Union’s position has always been that the question of Taiwan should be resolved peacefully through constructive dialogue and it has urged both sides to avoid unilateral measures which might heighten tensions."
"In a statement at the beginning of this year, the European Union welcomed the agreement to cross-Strait charter flights over the Lunar New Year."
"It considered that this type of practical cooperation would help to promote dialogue and understanding between the parties and hoped that ways could be found to build upon it."
"We note the dialogue between the Mainland and visiting opposition Taiwanese leaders and hope that the Mainland will soon be able to commence similar dialogue with the elected leadership in Taiwan."
"On regional matters, China and the European Union share a common interest with others in a stable Korean peninsula."
"Given its influence with the DPRK, China has a key role in efforts to achieve a nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, a role which the European Union supports."
"The European Union remains keen to contribute to peace and security in the Asia and Asia-Pacific region."
"It is one of our key objectives."
"Speaking for the United Kingdom for a moment, we are keen to use the United Kingdom’s Presidency of the European Union to take forward work in this area."
"The European Union should aim to engage more actively in the political management of the regional security challenges."
"Among current concerns, the European Union has called for early and unconditional resumption of the six-party talks and for the complete verifiable and irreversible dismantling of any DPRK nuclear weapons programme."
"We need to look further at ways to strengthen the European Union’s contribution in regional fora such as ASEM and as a member of the ASEAN regional forum, the only Asia-wide multilateral forum on regional security."
"It also makes sense for the European Union to develop strategic dialogues with other key players in the East Asian region."
"The security of the region is not just a concern to those there, but to all of us."
"Since China’s reform of the economy which began in 1978, its economy has grown by almost 10% a year on average."
"In that time, Chinese-European trade has grown more than fortyfold."
"The EU is now China’s most important trading partner, and China is the EU’s second most important trading partner, after the United States."
"In 2003, China became the world’s fourth largest trader, and its foreign trade continues to grow by 37%, a growth rate unrivalled by any major trading nation. China has also overtaken the US as the largest recipient of foreign direct investment anywhere in the world."
"China has made considerable efforts to live up to its new role in the global economic system."
"To comply with its World Trade Organisation obligations and accession commitments, it has cut tariffs across the board and engaged in a thorough overhaul of laws and regulations."
"Nevertheless, concerns remain."
"The business environment in China is still a difficult one for the foreign businesses that operate there."
"For example, laws to protect intellectual property rights are not implemented vigorously enough."
"The WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong this year provides an opportunity for the European Union and China to work together once again to help achieve an ambitious and balanced outcome."
"With this tremendous economic growth in China has come change in other areas too."
"It was not until the mid-1990s that the European Commission drew up its first Asia strategy and China policy papers."
"This first policy paper attempted to define a long-term strategy to address China’s swift economic and indeed political development."
"At the same time, engagements stopped being rather haphazard and regular annual summits became the norm."
"In 1996, the first Asia-Europe meeting was held and two years later the first EU-China Summit took place."
"Against this backdrop of rapid change, the main legal framework for EU-China relations, the Bilateral Trade and Economic Co-Operation Agreement of 1985 is looking decidedly out of date."
"The European Union is looking forward to the introduction of a new framework agreement that is more in keeping with the multifaceted relationship we enjoy today."
"I hope that during the period of the United Kingdom’s Presidency of the European Union, progress can be made on this."
"We will also be looking for progress on a number of other issues, including climate change of course in this week when the G8 leaders gather in Gleneagles, and towards market economy status for China."
"Energy security is an issue of concern to all countries."
"It is a requirement of economic growth and development."
"Current global levels of energy production and consumption are already considered as having a negative impact on the global climate, and greenhouse gas emissions are expected to rise over the coming decades."
"The European Union and China face an important dual challenge, ensuring energy security and combating climate change."
"The European Union recognises its obligation to reduce its own emissions while at the same time assisting countries such as China to meet their growing energy needs in a sustainable manner."
"The European Union and China have significant and internationally respected scientific and technological expertise."
"There is therefore excellent scope for the European Union and China to significantly strengthen collaboration in this important field."
"The European Union and China do, of course, have differences."
"The agreement reached at the conclusion of the recent EU-China textile negotiations shows what can happen when we sit down to discuss those differences amicably and seek win-win solutions."
"China has acted, as the Commissioner for Trade, Mr Mandelson, said and I quote ‘as a responsible and valued partner’."
"The time available to me for these remarks to the Parliament today is too short to encapsulate relationships which have evolved over 30 years, but I hope that others will now be able to contribute their thoughts on this important evolving relationship."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Alexander in his new role, especially here in Parliament."
"We will have many debates together and it will be a pleasure to work with him."
"I am very happy about this debate, because the situation in Asia and also in East Asia is indeed a major strategic issue."
"Asia is today not only the continent with the largest population but also with the highest economic growth rate and the highest rates of spending for research and development."
"The Far Eastern countries invest in their future and Asia will, no doubt, be the continent at the centre of the world stage in the 21st century."
"We have to know that and prepare for it."
"Security in the Far East is a topic, therefore, of direct concern to European interests."
"It is part of the overall global responsibility for security and stability that lies at the heart of the European Union’s role in foreign policy."
"Moreover, stability in the Far East directly impacts not only on the prosperity and the well-being of our citizens but also of the citizens of this continent."
"China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are among the world’s top six economies, if the EU is counted as one."
"They also count among our major trading partners and are also key recipients of European foreign investment."
"Japan, for its part, is also a major source of investment in Europe, not least in some of the new Member States."
"In short, instability in the most dynamic region in the world would have serious consequences that would be deeply felt in Europe."
"What, therefore, are the European responses and what are the instruments at our disposal to address this issue?"
"I would like to tackle that question now."
"Let us look at the main issues at stake in East Asia."
"Over the medium-term future, three major policy issues will dominate the political agenda in East Asia."
"Firstly, how to respond to the rise of China."
"Secondly, ensuring stability on the Korean peninsula and, thirdly, a peaceful resolution of tensions between China and Taiwan."
"The proper handling of these issues will have major implications both for our regional and wider security."
"By contrast, the degree of economic integration in East Asia is also very impressive."
"However, this alone will not be sufficient to make East Asia more stable or more peaceful, particularly as the DPRK is still outside the emerging economic cooperation."
"Moreover, unlike in Europe in the later half of the 1980s, economic ties have not resulted in improved political relations."
"On the contrary, the economic rise of China and its assertive foreign policy have fanned concerns in some neighbouring countries that a more prosperous China could use its economic gains to pursue its national interests more forcefully and dominate the region both politically and economically."
"The China-Japan rivalry has surfaced earlier and more visibly than expected by many observers."
"A trend in all East Asian countries towards a more nationalistic orientation may set the stage for using bilateral conflicts as a valve for domestic consumption."
"In China, for instance, as part of the process to move away from ideological constraints, nationalism has been revived as a unifying theme."
"With a generational change in Korea, anti-Communism based on the traumatic experience of the Korean War has lost its appeal."
"The new leadership, in line with the views of the younger generation often appears to see a forceful policy vis-à-vis North Korea as more of a threat to peace than North Korea’s nuclear programme."
"In Japan, a nationalistic renaissance can be observed, not founded on a young generation movement, but on an elite’s wish to change a so-called ‘self-denigrating attitude’ in Japan."
"This tendency in all three countries to favour nationalistic policies does not bode well for solving the concrete political problems that will become more urgent in the years to come."
"Moreover, with the technological rise of China, the economies may, in fact, move from complementarity to more intense competition and thereby heat up the political environment rather than cool it down."
"Rising tensions are not a given, however."
"For instance, the meeting in Jakarta on 23 April between Japan’s Prime Minister Koizumi and China’s President – at which I participated – was held specifically to de-escalate the tension and that demonstrates that both sides understand that they would stand to lose economically from rising tensions."
"It is unfortunate, therefore, that the follow-up steps complicated rather than calmed down the situation when Vice Prime Minister Wu Yi abruptly cancelled a scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Koizumi."
"If nonetheless managed well, the Tokyo-Beijing rivalry could lead to constructive competition and thus would open the way to addressing long-standing conflicts, as witnessed, for instance, by the India-China rapprochement, followed by a visit of Prime Minister Koizumi to New Delhi and Tokyo’s increased interest in South East Asia."
"In this regard, it is very interesting to see the European example of overcoming war hostilities and cold war separation become a object of strong interest and study in East Asia."
"This provides us with an opening that we should use to foster relations with all regional players."
"We are taking a number of concrete steps to address the various issues at hand in order to clearly voice Europe’s views for a way forward and to express our concerns about the situation."
"There is a political dialogue."
"It is true that we are just celebrating our 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations."
"There is also a human rights dialogue and all the security issues are there and are being discussed."
"Indeed, at the next summit with China, which will be held in September, we will try to come up with the idea of a more comprehensive and more ambitious framework agreement, because the old one is no longer fulfilling our most ambitious goals."
"There are 20 sectoral dialogues with the various ministers at ministerial level to prepare China for its WTO trade obligations and also, for example, for its obligations as regards intellectual property rights and as regards labour protection, which our colleague also mentioned."
"The general idea is fully reciprocal two-way relations."
"On the China-Japan tensions, we have used recent high-level meetings – notably the EU-Japan Summit on 2 May in Luxembourg – to discuss stability issues in East Asia at the highest governmental level."
"In that context, we have agreed to intensify our political dialogue and we have said that energy issues in particular should be very high on our agenda, together with Japan."
"We want to do this, not least with a view to responding to Japan’s concern over a possible future lifting of the EU’s arms embargo on China."
"As a first follow-up, we held a ministerial Troika with Japan on 6 May in the margin of the ASEM meeting."
"In our political dialogue with China, we are also addressing the issue of Sino-Japanese tensions and calling for moderation and reconciliation."
"On the arms embargo, the European Council Conclusions of December 2005 clearly stipulate that there should not be any change in the quantity or quality of arms exports to China."
"Therefore, any possible future decision on lifting the embargo should not alter the security situation in East Asia."
"Moreover, the European Union has started a strategic dialogue with the United States on East Asia to address the security concerns of our partners, and information missions have been carried out to the US, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to explain our position."
"We are finalising the reinforced Code of Conduct on arms experts."
"Let me say two more things before the debate and then I will answer your questions."
"Regarding China’s Anti-Secession Law, in its statement issued on 15 March, the European Union clearly expressed its concern about this legislation."
"On that occasion, the European Union reiterated the principles guiding its policy, i.e. its attachment to a ‘one China’ policy and to the peaceful resolution of disputes."
"We have also called on both sides to develop initiatives for dialogue and understanding."
"It must be said that we were happy to see that Taiwan opposition leaders went to mainland China."
"We hope that in the future all parties will be involved in such contacts."
"I refer again to the DPRK’s nuclear programme."
"I would remind you that the European Union – and the Commission also – is a board member of KEDO."
"We have financially and otherwise supported this – currently suspended – activity with a view to finding a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue."
"We continue to give our full support to possible six-party talks as a way forward and have impressed our view very clearly on the North Korean Government on various occasions."
"I hear that a parliamentary delegation is going to North Korea."
"We will be very happy to listen to you and to learn from you when you come back."
"I will stop here."
"There is a lot to be said, because these issues, as I have said, are at the centre of our global policy for the 21st century."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we could actually do with a double allocation of speaking time in order to respond properly to the excellent speeches by those who have spoken to this topic so far, and it is for that reason that I have no option but to speak in summary form."
"I think we all agree that the tensions in the Far East have to be taken seriously, whether we are talking about the tension between Japan and China or that between North Korea and Japan."
"You can take that further, as far as Russia, if you want to include such issues as the four islands that have been occupied ever since the end of the Second World War."
"It is vitally important that this Europe of ours should make a proper contribution, not merely out of economic considerations, but also with political considerations in mind."
"After all, we all agree – and I assume that the President-in-Office does too – that we want to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and that we regard our work to these ends as a long-term basis for sound economic relationships."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner was right to mention the success of the May summit held between Japan and the EU in Luxembourg, but I sometimes get the feeling that members of the Council and the Commission visit Peking three times as often as they visit Tokyo."
"It would be no bad thing either for them to visit Taipei; after all, both Taiwan and Japan are countries with multi-party democracies, in which human rights are observed and the rule of law prevails."
"Neither of those things are yet the case in the People’s Republic of China, and there is only a very distant prospect of either of them being so."
"If we want to demonstrate the need for democracies to cooperate among themselves, then the numbers of visits and contacts would have to be more evenly balanced."
"What I would very much like the Council to tell us now is what position has been reached in the ongoing deliberations on the lifting of the arms embargo."
"We in this House insist on three things before this can happen."
"Firstly, we – like you – expect substantial improvements as regards human rights in China."
"Secondly, the stand-off between Taiwan and China must be brought to an end."
"With China threatening Taiwan with over 700 rockets stationed on its coast, this is a flash point to the like of which you do not deliver weapons."
"To the Commissioner, who, I think, was being rather evasive, I would ask whether the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is now to be legally binding, and if so, when."
"That, too, is something we regard as a if there is to be any sort of talk about lifting the arms embargo."
"We must do everything in our power to get the countries of Asia to where we are now: the state, sixty years after the end of the Second World War, of having been reconciled with one another."
"It is for that reason that we should encourage them to press on with the same process of reconciliation, without which there can be no stability and no security."
". Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Party of European Socialists."
"This compromise resolution is one that we support, because we believe that it is important that the European Parliament speak with one voice."
"However, understandably it does not exactly represent the views of my Group, nor for that matter those of the other Groups that have signed it."
"It is exactly what it says: a compromise."
"The Far East is an increasingly important region for trade and aid with increasing globalisation of both economics and politics."
"Security issues affect us all: now when North-East Asia sneezes, we all threaten to catch a cold."
"I would like to make three main points."
"First, with respect to the arms embargo with China, it was rightly imposed after the horrors of Tiananmen Square."
"We rightly still have concerns about China’s human rights record, but, as the Council said, things are moving in the right direction."
"For us, it is the lack of a full legal base for the code of conduct on arms that is as much a problem for the lifting of the embargo as the situation in China."
"Second, with respect to North Korea, as you have said, Commissioner, a delegation is leaving tomorrow, of which I am part, under the leadership of Ursula Stenzel."
"This will be the first meeting between a standing delegation of the European Parliament and the Supreme People’s Assembly of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea."
"This Parliament has made its position clear in the past and will reiterate it in the vote tomorrow."
"The European Union has contributed EUR 500 million to humanitarian aid, development and KEDO in North Korea."
"We believe increasingly that we should have a policy of ‘no say, no pay’."
"We will seek to continue critical engagement to bring North Korea back to the table, out of the cold and into the world, but we want a place at that table when they come back to it."
"Lastly, no country is immune from blame for the current tensions in this region: the China-Taiwan, China-Japan, Japan-South Korea issues and that of the Korean peninsula itself."
"There is a continuing need to come to terms with the region’s history."
"The countries might well learn from the historical Franco-German and German-Polish reconciliations here in Europe."
"As Commissioner Rehn said in a previous debate, ‘there is no lasting peace without reconciliation around truth and justice’."
". The European Parliament has declared itself in favour of retaining the arms embargo on China by a substantial majority."
"This embargo must remain in place as long as the reasons for its imposition persist. For example, as long as several hundred people who participated in the Tienanmen Square protest are still in jail."
"The examples show that economic relations are developing despite the embargo, so it clearly has no influence whatsoever on economic relations, but it needs to serve as a pointer as regards political relations."
"Personally, I trust the position of the British Presidency; in my experience, the stance of the United Kingdom is clear and unambiguous regarding this issue and I commend it for this."
"The other important issue: Taiwan has sought observer status in the World Health Organisation since 1997."
"Its application has been rejected every year, including this year, unfortunately."
"And unfortunately, the Member States have participated in turning down its application."
"It is my opinion, however, that Taiwan’s 23 million inhabitants have a right to the security and protection that the World Health Organisation has to offer, but the reverse is also true: we also need the knowledge and experience and – I have to say, the financial resources – that Taiwan has to offer."
"It is utterly incomprehensible why they keep rejecting Taiwan’s request."
"I have no desire to call into question the ‘one China’ policy, but this has nothing to do with that."
"Taiwan already participates in numerous areas of international cooperation."
"For example, it is a member of the World Trade Organisation; it participates in economic cooperation within APEC and is a member of other international organisations."
"At the same time, organisations such as the Holy See, the Knights of Malta, the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, and even the Inter-Parliamentary Union have observer status in the World Health Organisation."
"In the light of this, it is utterly absurd that Taiwan has been turned down."
"I ask the Presidency and the Commission to persuade the Member States to grant Taiwan observer status in the World Health Organisation next year."
". Mr President, China in fact plays a fundamental role, both in European foreign policy and in European commercial policy."
"That is why it is so important for the European Union to ensure that its policy on China contributes to improving social, environmental and human rights standards, and that it does not jeopardise regional stability and security."
"In this context, I agree that some of the recent actions of the Chinese authorities are worrying, such as the adoption of the anti-secession law in relation to Taiwan."
"We must also remember that the European Union will only be able to accept an agreement between China and Taiwan if it is the result of a peaceful dialogue between the parties and, in particular, if it respects the democratic progress achieved by Taiwan."
"Furthermore, as has already been said, with regard to the arms embargo, we must remember that it must remain in place, at least until there is significant progress with regard to human rights, which also includes the situation in Tibet, until what happened in Tiananmen is sufficiently clarified, and above all, in my view, until the European Union’s code of conduct becomes a legally binding text."
"I would therefore like to urge the representative of the Council to delight us in August by adopting a legally binding statute for the code of conduct, which would be warmly welcomed by this House."
". Mr President, for a long time, my group took a straightforward view of the People’s Republic of China and of the government that sits on the island of Taiwan."
"It was that, in 1949, an old and incompetent clique of profiteers, incapable of offering a solution to poverty and injustice, was sent packing by the people, and rightly so."
"They fled to an island where most of the people did not feel Chinese and which, up to 1945, did not belong to China for sustained periods of time."
"On that island, they set up a military dictatorship and tried to carry out attacks on the mainland, eventually forfeiting international recognition and being thrown out of the United Nations."
"Meanwhile on the mainland, all kinds of interesting experiments were going on, including the industrialisation of the countryside and a sweeping reorganisation of agriculture."
"The advent of factories, railway and dams helped the country move forward."
"Unfortunately, during those experiments, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, as a result of inexperience, serious mistakes were made which claimed many lives."
"That seemed to be the price they had to pay for a prosperous future."
"The situation now is that, led by the heirs to this revolutionary regime, China is still a country with a future, but our political line has changed completely."
"Despite enjoying exponential growth, the People’s Republic suffers from very pronounced inequality, imposes the death penalty, and lacks both democratic processes and freedom of organisation."
"For the moment, the model is reminiscent of what South Korea and Taiwan have rightly abandoned."
"Taiwan has developed from a military dictatorship into a democracy that can increasingly be compared with Europe and Japan."
"As a democracy, it aspires to become a non-Chinese, and therefore independent, Taiwan."
"In our search for a solution to a 56-year long division of what is internationally recognised as Chinese territory, we will need to take these new developments into account."
"Only in that way can we help find peaceful solutions for the future."
". Mr President, between China and Taiwan could considerably improve the security situation in the Far East, which at present appears anything but secure."
"The Council and Commission have the urgent task of promoting a more businesslike relationship between Beijing and Taipei."
"The strong European trading position with both countries not only offers an objective opportunity of doing this, but also means that such action must necessarily be in our own interests."
"One thing is clear, the Council’s positively premature intention to lift the arms embargo against the People’s Republic has, together with the recent Chinese anti-secession law, enormously increased tension in the region."
"It is difficult to tell what predominates here: a lack of strategic thinking or the disturbing lack of diplomatic straight talking within Europe, let alone of transatlantic consultation."
"I hope that the Council, under the British Presidency, will abandon this unsafe approach."
"If the European Union takes up its strategic responsibility towards the Far East, it will support flexible cross-Straits relations."
"Time has not stood still in Taiwan either."
"For years, it has developed its own national identity and has undergone an impressive democratisation process, both of which are at the heart of the Taiwanese conflict today."
"The Taiwanese are also, and understandably, very much aware of recent developments in Hong Kong."
"The Council and Commission certainly do not appear to be ignoring Taiwan commercially speaking, but they are, unfortunately, doing so on the diplomatic front."
"That is why I am happy to endorse paragraph 9 of the draft resolution."
"I urge you to support Taiwanese observer status in the World Health Organisation and give 23 million free Taiwanese a vote and a face in international fora."
"That is how the European Union can help establish the desperately needed inter-Chinese dialogue."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Alexander, the proclamation by the People’s Republic of China of an ‘anti-secession law’ is a key moment for security in the Far East."
"By enacting a bill that blatantly violates international law, the People’s Republic of China has made it clear to the rest of the world that the Peking regime is not becoming more moderate as had been hoped, even though the country has allowed market forces to operate in parts of its economy and the West has become more open to contacts with China."
"China knows that the Taiwanese will never voluntarily agree to unification, and so it is making preparations for an armed attack on this democratic and prosperous country."
"It is entirely up to us to determine the outcome of a process that began with spending on armaments, followed by the above-mentioned law, which is nothing short of scandalous, and which in turn has had a direct effect in that 600 ballistic missiles have been targeted at Taiwan."
"We are already familiar with the reactions of some EU Member States."
"While this provocation was going on, the President of the Member State that does the most trade with China, or in other words France, announced that there was no longer any point to the embargo on arms exports to China, and that this embargo was a manifestation of hostility."
"The German Chancellor has echoed his comments."
"This is the worst of all possible responses, and if we followed this advice, we could be providing arms to a country that makes no secret of its aggressive intentions towards its neighbours."
"Europe needs to respond differently to this ‘anti-secession law’."
"It needs to keep the embargo in place, and to step up its policy of active support for Taiwan’s position in the international arena, by acting in close cooperation with the United States."
"Our aim up until now has been to maintain the status quo, but the latter has been undermined unilaterally by the People’s Republic of China."
"If I may, I should like to make one final comment which occurred to me while listening to the debate, and which should not be taken too seriously."
"If there were an EU-wide ban on praise for totalitarian systems, I do not believe that the Members of this House from post-Communist countries would manage a single day out of prison, and there would be 50 fewer Members of this Parliament."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that China, because of its influence over North Korea, holds the keys to peace in that region of the world."
"However, the increasingly aggressive attitude of Communist China towards Taiwan constitutes a threat to this peace that is all the more serious because the leaders in Beijing have nuclear weapons."
"Ever since 1949, those leaders have never given up hope of annexing Taiwan, which has, thanks to the courage of its inhabitants, become one of the most dynamic economies in the Pacific and a model of democracy in a region where there are still many totalitarian regimes."
"This aggression will not be appeased by the shady deals in which some European leaders are indulging, foremost among them being Mr Chirac, who has gone as far as inviting the Chinese Communist dictator to his chateau."
"Only a firm, decisive attitude will bring the authorities in Beijing to make compromises and, in particular, to recognise the right of the Taiwanese to self-determination."
"Until they do so, the Member States of the European Union must maintain the embargo on exporting arms to Communist China."
"Were our governments to adopt a different policy, not only would they be betraying the values of freedom and democracy that they are always so proud of affirming, but they would also be seriously compromising the stability of the Far East."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I welcome the resolution on security in the Far East, and particularly the broad consensus on the part of all groups that underpins it."
"That being so, it will determine the political remit for the mission to Korea, which sets off tomorrow, and which I have the honour to be chairing."
"Although there have already been two ad hoc missions, this one, following on from the recent establishment of a Parliamentary Delegation for the Korean peninsula, is the first ever to both North and South Korea."
"Politically speaking, this trip is the expression of Parliament’s desire that the European Union should have influence, as a seventh negotiating partner, on the six-party talks."
"It is also in our interest that North Korea should emerge from its isolation and thus become able to receive from the EU the humanitarian aid that it needs."
"Its return to the negotiating table, its decommissioning of existing nuclear weapons and its abandonment of plans for new ones are essential preconditions not only for rapprochement between the two Koreas and for the resultant in the region, but also for its own access to more help from Europe."
"We will also be having the opportunity to meet representatives of the Foreign Policy of the Chinese People’s Congress, and here too, this resolution’s core statements will be our policy guidelines."
"Our primary aspiration is that the People’s Republic of China should exert considerable influence on North Korea’s attitude towards naming a date for the resumption of the six-party talks, which will make a political solution possible."
"It is towards this end that we, Europe’s parliamentarians, offer our good offices."
"In the interests of ensuring that security is maintained and development continues in the Far East, I would like to call upon the governments of countries where disputes over territorial issues still persist to resolve these as soon as possible by means of bilateral negotiations."
"In this day and age, the persistence of differences of opinion in connection with the Second World War is an indication that the region still needs to come to terms with its past history and work through it."
"One issue relating to security in the region is the ‘anti-secession’ legislation passed by the Republic of China in March 2005."
"I consider it important to maintain the in the region, and I support the peaceful resolution of the issue by means of dialogue between the parties, bearing in mind the ‘one China’ principle."
"I would like to express my dismay regarding North Korea’s announcement in February 2005 that it possesses nuclear weapons, and that it is pulling out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and suspending the six-party talks indefinitely."
"I would like to make it clear that I still believe the multilateral, six-party talks provide the primary framework for resolving the issue, and that an agreement in principle reached on this basis is needed to ensure a Korean peninsula free from nuclear weapons."
"I hope that North Korea will review its position as soon as possible, provide the appropriate international guarantees and return to the framework of the Treaty."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, members of the Council, the European Union has always laid great emphasis on encouraging democracy and the free rule of law and on worldwide support for human rights."
"These goals should be the strategic priority and a moral necessity for the democratic Europe, geared towards the reinforcement of civil society and democratic institutions in the world’s third countries."
"These aspects are what should determine our assessment of the relations between the European Union, China and Taiwan, as well as of security in the Far East."
"That is why I particularly call on you to bear in mind the circumstances in which the arms trade embargo on China was introduced."
"It is no secret that from an arms trade point of view, the embargo on China is practically inoperative."
"That is why the embargo should be evaluated not as a means of restricting the spread of weaponry but solely as a political instrument of the European Union for assessing the situation of democracy and human rights in China."
"Therefore a wish to lift the embargo suggests that the Commission is no longer concerned about the questions of democracy, freedom, the rule of law and human rights in China."
"Is that really so?"
"Is not this hypocrisy?"
"Do the Commission and the governments of France, Germany or the Netherlands really not see, in their search for business opportunities in China, that dissidents are still being suppressed, followers of Falun Gong are still being persecuted, democracy and freedom are being restricted in Hong Kong, that more than 700 Chinese missiles are targeted towards democratic Taiwan, and that authoritarian China passed a law this spring giving it the right to carry out a military attack on the developing democracy in Taiwan?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is an occasion for the European Parliament again to put on record that some individuals holding office in Europe and representatives of Member States are acting in accordance with double standards when pursuing narrow economic interests."
"They are emboldening China and showing a willingness to ignore democratic ideals."
"Such an attitude not only reduces security in the Far East but can also rebound like a boomerang in future and affect security and stability in Europe itself."
"Mr President, the arms embargo against China was imposed as a protest against the bloody crackdown on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989."
"Have any fundamental changes been made in the area of human rights in China in the subsequent 16 years?"
"None whatsoever."
"In fact, a huge portrait of Mao Tse-Tung, the biggest mass murderer of the 20th century, is still on display on Tiananmen Square."
"To this day, there are people in prison for being present at Tiananmen Square."
"Nor, in fact, are they the only political prisoners, for the so-called People’s Republic is still a Communist one-party state without any freedom of expression of opinion, freedom of the press or freedom of religion."
"Only the day before yesterday, for example, Bishop Jia Zhiguo, an underground Roman Catholic bishop in China, was arrested."
"He has already spent more than 20 years of his life in prison."
"Not only does the People’s Republic of China systematically and continually violate human rights, but it also forms a threat to regional stability and, by extension, to peace full stop."
"The so-called anti-secession law is like a knife held to Taiwan’s throat."
"The European Union is blowing hot and cold at the same time."
"On the one hand, it stresses that the human rights situation in China should improve, while on the other, it seeks to lift the arms embargo, thereby sending a message to the Chinese regime that it does not have to be too careful about human rights."
"Taiwan is given credit, and rightly, for its economic success and for real democracy, but it is not being spelled out to the People’s Republic that it is unacceptable to challenge Taiwan’s integrity."
"Under such circumstances, a strategic partnership with China should not be an end in itself, any more than the so-called One China Policy should remain an end in itself."
"If Taiwan ever declares formal independence, then Europe must recognise this without delay and our Member States must establish diplomatic relations with it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Presidency, the regular visits to Brussels and Strasbourg of Chinese officials and the meetings between them and representatives of the European Parliament highlight the interest in developing relations between China and the European Union."
"At the same time, however, they have also brought to light differences at political level which slowly but surely are leading both sides to an unavoidable and harmonious symbiosis, because the People's Republic of China needs the European Union and the European Union needs China."
"In addition, I do not believe that the presence of China and India in the area of international trade represents a threat, as recently maintained here, in his first appearance, by the President-in-Office of the Council, Tony Blair."
"On the contrary, one would maintain that it is a very good opportunity for between the peoples in all sectors of cooperation and friendly rivalry, a unique opportunity, during which at all levels will provide solutions even to outstanding issues such as those between China and Taiwan, which is seeking secession, the lifting of the weapons embargo against China by the European Union and the United States and, finally, the abolition of the illegal and indiscriminate export of goods, especially in the pharmaceutical, electronics and textile and clothing sectors."
"It is no coincidence that, in the face of the impasses, the Chinese are trying to compromise."
"The bilateral relations which China has developed with states throughout the world are increasing and extending at a rapid pace, from the United States and Latin America to Europe."
"Is this enough or is coordinated action needed on the part of the European Union so that these objectives are common, single objectives?"
"One of these major objectives was achieved last week, as we heard just now."
"The signature of the ‘open skies’ cooperation agreement increasing flights between the European Union and Beijing by the Vice-President of the European Commission, Jacques Barrot, is an example of goodwill."
"The European Union therefore needs to speed up procedures to settle outstanding issues with China."
"The wind which is blowing will soon reach incalculable speeds and then only a Wall of China will be able to restrain the typhoon called the People's Republic of China."
"To close, I wish London the same good luck for 2012 as Athens had with the 2004 Olympic Games, despite any doubts which London had at the time."
"Good wishes also because Great Britain has the capacity, in conjunction with Beijing in 2008, to strengthen relations still further."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, critics of Europe often claim that it is too self-absorbed, and that it takes a great deal of notice of what is going on in neighbouring countries while ignoring problems in other parts of the world, such as Eastern Asia."
"I believe that today’s debate will demonstrate exactly the opposite, namely that we are very much aware of the challenges emerging from Eastern Asia, of the growing importance of China and the role of Japan, North Korea and South Korea, and of course of the security problems that are rife in Eastern Asia."
"As far as China is concerned, I agree entirely with the current UK Presidency that global dialogue needs to be strengthened, that Europe and China are global partners, and that they must tackle global challenges such as security, energy security and climate change together."
"I too believe that this dialogue and partnership will be enshrined in the framework agreement, and that it will actually encourage dialogue on human rights rather than ruling it out."
"Previous speakers have already referred to Taiwan and South Korea, and these two countries are prime examples of the way in which a democracy can gradually be built out of a totalitarian and authoritarian country."
"In my opinion, a similar outcome could be achieved if we were to step up dialogue with China on human rights issues."
"Mr President, perhaps this policy under consideration is the best one at the given time."
"I am going to start by mentioning the political background."
"Our policy is based on the ‘one China’ principle, but this principle has deprived the people of Taiwan of another fundamental principle: that of self-determination."
"I might understand the pragmatism of the EU, but it should not be selective, as we have never spoken of a ‘one Korea’ principle, for example."
"My next comment is about the compatibility of China and Taiwan."
"I can hardly imagine two states under one political umbrella if they have such incompatible political systems."
"I see two options: we must either revise the one-China principle and adjust our policy in respect of it, or wait for an indefinite amount of time until China per se becomes a democratic state with a multi-party system, a rule of law and respect for human rights."
"The proposed policy stems from the second option, but it is by no means the best choice."
". Mr President, let me begin by thanking the honourable Members for their wide-ranging and thoughtful contributions to this important and timely debate."
"I also thank the Commissioner for her generous welcome in this Parliament today."
"I also look forward to our many debates over the weeks and months to come."
"Let me respond first to some of the main points raised during the last hour."
"Mr Jarzembowski spoke of the importance of the recent EU-Japan meeting."
"We clearly welcome and will work towards strong relations with Japan, and, of course, with China."
"He spoke wisely of the need for continued understanding and reconciliation within the region."
"Mr Ford recognised the interdependence that is surely one of the hallmarks of our globalising world."
"He also raised the issue of the arms embargo, as did a number of speakers, including Mr Szent-Iványi, Mr Romeva i Rueda, Mr Belder and Mr Kristovskis."
"Let me, therefore, take a moment or two to address the queries that have been raised."
"As Members are aware, a review of the European Union arms embargo was, of course, announced by the European Council in December 2003 and is presently ongoing."
"In June, the European Council also recalled its conclusions of 16 and 17 December 2004 and invited the Council to continue its work on that basis."
"No date was set for a decision."
"The Council also welcomed the launch of a strategic dialogue on Asia with the United States and Japan."
"We look forward in the course of our Presidency to taking this forward."
"No decision has yet been taken on lifting the EU arms embargo in China."
"The review launched in December 2003 is, as I have said, ongoing."
"In its conclusions in December 2004, the Council recalled the importance of the criteria of the code of conduct, which have been referred to by a number of Members today, including the provisions regarding human rights, stability and security in the region and the national security of friendly and allied countries."
"Mr Szent-Iványi also raised the issue of the European Union’s position on Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Organisation."
"There are difficulties over Taiwanese membership of the World Health Organisation."
"The WHO is a United Nations specialised agency where statehood is therefore a prerequisite of membership. The public health benefits to Taiwan from observer status appear limited, since the World Health Organisation and Taiwan already share information on an informal basis."
"The European Union made its position public on Taiwanese participation at the 2004 World Health Assembly."
"Ireland issued an EU Presidency statement that strongly supported the principle enshrined in the WHO Constitution that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being."
"It also expressed hopes that all parties will show flexibility in finding mechanisms to allow Taiwanese medical and public health officials to participate in these activities."
"At this year’s World Health Assembly, the issue did not come up for vote in the General Committee, but we understand that the WHO secretariat and China recently signed a memorandum of understanding on WHO technical exchanges with Taiwan."
"Mr Meijer offered his own distinctive views on Chiang Kai-Shek and on his successors in Taiwan."
"I would simply reiterate the point I made in my introductory remarks that today Taiwan is, of course, a full democracy."
"Mr Szymański and Mrs Dobolyi spoke of the anti-secession law recently passed by China."
"So let me say a further word on China-Taiwan relations and cross-strait tension."
"The European Union and the Council attach great importance to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, which is important for the whole region and indeed beyond."
"The Taiwan question should be settled peacefully, as I said, through peaceful negotiations."
"We welcome any efforts by both sides to lower tensions, such as, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the cross-strait charter flights and visits by Taiwanese opposition parties."
"We hope that both sides can find a mutually acceptable basis for a resumption of peaceful dialogue and avoid unilateral measures, which might heighten tensions."
"Luxembourg issued two Presidency statements this year on cross-strait relations."
"In February, a statement was issued welcoming the agreement to cross-strait direct charter transfer flights over the Lunar New Year."
"The second statement issued in March by the Luxembourg Presidency followed China’s adoption of its anti-secession law, which has caused so much commentary in the course of our debate this afternoon."
"That statement voiced concerns over the legislation’s reference to the use of non-peaceful means."
"It asked all parties to avoid any unilateral action that might rekindle tensions and also encouraged both sides to develop initiatives that contribute to dialogue and to mutual understanding."
"In his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Li on 17 March, almost immediately after the passage of the law, the High Representative, Javier Solana, expressed the European Union’s concerns about some elements of the anti-secession law."
"He acknowledged positive elements in the law, strongly supporting the call for cross-strait dialogue and cooperation, but made clear that references to a potential resolution of the issue by non-peaceful means was very much at odds with European Union policy."
"He clarified once again the position of the EU: first, full support for a one-China policy and, secondly, resolution of the situation through dialogue and peaceful means."
"Mrs Stenzel told us of her mission departing for the Korean peninsula tomorrow and this was also referred to by Mr Mavrommatis."
"I wish her and her colleagues well in this important work and I look forward to hearing a full report of her endeavours on her return."
"Mr Rouček mentioned the criticism sometimes directed at the European Union that it is too inward looking."
"I would simply say that those who make that criticism would have done well to listen to the calibre and contributions of the debate we have had this afternoon."
"I therefore welcome his endorsement of our approach, which recognises that Europe must look outwards and actively engage with the challenges and also the opportunities that our modern globalising world provides."
"Mr Kristovskis and Mr Claeys appropriately raised the issue of human rights in China."
"I can assure both Members that the European Union raises a lot of human rights concerns with the Chinese Government at the biannual European Union-China human rights dialogue, which is a regular high-level exchange."
"The last round was held in Luxembourg in February."
"The next round will take place in Beijing this autumn."
"The European Union also regularly engages Chinese interlocutors on human rights issues, including at the very highest levels outside these dialogues."
"The European Union also funds human rights projects within China."
"Let me say a word or two in conclusion."
"The Chinese presently have a target to reach per capita income comparable to that of today’s developed countries by about 2050."
"The significant development of economic strength was really the opening framework with which I approached this debate."
"That was echoed by the words of the Commissioner immediately following my contribution."
"Whether it reaches that ambitious target or not, the development of its economic and trade ties is already all but irreversible."
"China is also accepting the responsibility that economic strength brings."
"It has more influence on the world stage in such fora as the WTO, the G8 and the United Nations."
"This is all to the good."
"Many of the problems we face today, such as climate change, which will clearly be one of the significant items being discussed in Gleneagles over the days to come, can only be solved through action by all."
"The Council has a close interest in supporting China’s successful transition to a stable, prosperous and open country that fully embraces free market principles and the rule of law."
"For this reason, the European Union has a policy of strong engagement with China."
"This engagement is mutually beneficial and is not confined solely to matters of trade."
"The European Galileo programme will provide high precision global satellite navigation services, an area in which China is keen to develop links with the European Union."
"A cooperation agreement was concluded in October 2003, under which China has pledged to contribute EUR 200 million to this programme."
"Of course, we do not imagine that there will not be disagreements or that there will not be differences of opinion."
"We trust that our relationship with China is strong enough for us to be able to meet to address these challenges in the weeks, months and years ahead."
". Mr President, a lot has been said in this very interesting debate."
"I thank all Members for their interesting contributions."
"They have concentrated on a few topics."
"With regard to the arms embargo, my colleague has said almost everything."
"I should just like to answer Mr Jarzembowski, confirming that we are aiming at a legally binding code of conduct."
"It will depend on the Member States, but that is our aim."
"With regard to human rights, it was said by a few Members that we have not mentioned human rights."
"That is simply not true."
"On the contrary, human rights feature in all our political dialogues and great significance is attached to them."
"I recently met with Foreign Minister Li and I was also involved in a troika in China."
"The main topic there, apart from the arms embargo and some trade issues, was the human rights issue."
"We clearly said – and this went on record – that the Chinese should go on, for instance, with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and with releasing prisoners incarcerated after the Tiananmen Square protests."
"We have a human rights dialogue at least, where these issues can be clearly talked through and then, hopefully, taken up by the Chinese."
"I would also like to mention Taiwan."
"The European Union has advocated – and this is a unanimous policy – the one-China policy, which means that we do not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state and we have no diplomatic or formal political relations with Taiwan."
"Nevertheless, we have cultural and economic relations with Taiwan."
"Therefore, it is not for us politicians but for high officials to go to Taiwan, where they hold exchanges of views."
"We also do not support Taiwan's efforts to become a member in international fora because, if such membership implies statehood, that is not possible according to the consequent policy that we have."
"Taiwan was able, by contrast, to join the World Trade Organization because the WTO supposes that each member is a separate customs territory, thus making Taiwan's membership possible."
"With regard to the China-Taiwan question, the EU has been very explicit with both sides, consistently insisting on a peaceful resolution through dialogue, as I mentioned."
"We were indeed very pleased, and said as much, when opposition politicians went there."
"We said that we encouraged them to do such things with all other politicians."
"The whole question of the United Nations, of multilateral diplomacy, is very important."
"We stand before a reform of the United Nations."
"China will have a very important say there."
"We would like to work in a very constructive way."
"I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Stenzel and other colleagues for this interesting mission to the DPRK."
"It would be in all our interests if the six-party talks were resumed."
"If needed, we are always standing ready."
"There is no need for the European Union to come in, but if there is a need – we have always mentioned that to all the parties – then certainly we would be prepared and ready."
"I thank you for this highly satisfactory discussion."
"We must accept a China that will rise with or without us."
"Therefore, we must focus all our interests in shaping that rise to ensure that China emerges as an open society committed to the rule of law at home and abroad and also as a power that acts responsibly regionally and with regard to global security and, hopefully, in the future, democratically."
"It is now at a critical place in the global supply chain, meaning that the significant EU business and consumer interests also need to be consolidated and advanced."
"We need to influence the reform process in all areas of society and the economy."
"We try to do that in our bilateral talks, in our troika talks, within the framework of the different international organisations, or at the United Nations."
"I have received five motions for resolutions¹(1) to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on 7 July 2005."
"Security in the Far East is of crucial importance, particularly for those people who suffer from the lack of security in the region on a daily basis."
"I ask the House to imagine how it must feel to be a citizen of North Korea, condemned to endure the whims of Communist rulers; how it must feel to live in Taiwan, and to go about one’s daily life in the face of anti-secession efforts by the People’s Republic of China; or how it must feel to be a Tibetan, and to have become part of a minority in one’s own country."
"It is our duty to provide support to those in danger."
"The ‘One China’ policy is only acceptable so long as it does not involve violating the Taiwanese people’s right to self-determination, and Taiwanese citizens must not suffer from its enforcement."
"The People’s Republic of China may be an economic tiger, but in democratic terms it is unfortunately anything but."
"The principle of territorial integrity would be easier to apply if the country were a democratic state under the rule of law."
"Until the People’s Republic of China improves its human rights record, however, any pressure brought to bear by it on Taiwan will be unacceptable."
"Europe has succeeded in overcoming the political effects of the Cold War, whereas Asia has not managed to overcome the political, economic and social effects of a real war, namely the Korean War."
"It is debatable whether or not North Korea lost this war, but there can be no doubt that ordinary people did."
"These people are entitled to lead a normal life, instead of living in an open-air museum of Communist totalitarianism."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on a world without landmines."
". Mr President, I am honoured today to have the opportunity to open this debate on ‘a world without landmines’."
"Support for international mine action is one of the most important political priorities of the European Union and I am genuinely grateful for the efforts of the European Parliament in helping to ensure that this issue has not dropped down the international agenda."
"The European Union took an active role during the First Review Conference of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on their Destruction in November 2004, which was referred to as the 2004 Nairobi Summit on a Mine-Free World."
"The European Union considers that the First Review Conference of the Convention was an important milestone to take stock of what has been achieved up to now in implementing the Convention and identifying what needs to be done to renew the commitment of States Parties in eradicating the inhumane effects of anti-personnel mines."
"There is a risk that we may lose sight of the importance of this issue when debating safely today in the heart of Europe or, for that matter, in New York or Geneva."
"I would therefore like to set the scene for this afternoon’s debate with a reminder of the extent and the severity of the problem and why it is important that the European Union and the European Parliament continue to play such a leading role."
"It is estimated that between 15 000 and 20 000 people are killed or injured by landmines each year."
"These deaths and injuries take place in more than 80 countries around the world, from Angola to Zimbabwe and even closer to home in the Balkans."
"Astonishingly, this equates to more than 40 casualties per day, a figure which I am sure everyone here today will agree is simply unacceptable."
"The vast majority of these casualties occur in countries no longer in the grip of conflict."
"However, landmines do not recognise the end of hostilities."
"It is a horrible truth that millions of anti-personnel mines still exist and, in some parts of the world, are still being laid, affecting the poorest people in the poorest countries, the people least able to deal with the threat and the people most in need of our help and support."
"Anti-personnel landmines are merciless and indiscriminate."
"They cannot be accurately targeted; they do not distinguish between soldiers and civilians, adults or children."
"The injuries inflicted by landmines on those unfortunate enough to come into contact with them are truly horrific."
"This is no mistake."
"Anti-personnel landmines have been designed to maim rather than kill their victims."
"The victims of landmines suffer horribly, being literally blown to pieces."
"Put simply: landmines cause deprivation, random death and untold suffering in many innocent civilian populations."
"So it is right that the international community should take action and that the European Union should be amongst the front-runners."
"The Ottawa Convention or ‘Mine Ban Treaty’ prohibiting anti-personnel landmines has enjoyed wide international support and there are now 152 signatories."
"Much progress has been made to combat the scourge of these terrible weapons since the Convention’s entry into force in 1999."
"The Convention is a success story."
"Before the Convention, 34 nations were thought to be trading in anti-personnel mines."
"Now, apart from some illicit activity, virtually no such trading is taking place."
"54 nations used to produce anti-personnel landmines; today 15 nations are thought to have the capacity to produce mines, but most of these countries are not actually doing so."
"Seven years ago mines were used in 19 countries; now it is probably 5."
"Effectively, the ban on these anti-personnel mines is global because of the huge and appropriate stigma now attached to the use of these weapons."
"Over 37 million stockpiled anti-personnel mines have now been destroyed."
"Large areas of the world have been cleared of mines and made productive again."
"These are achievements that the international community can be proud of and would never have come about were it not for the Mine Ban Treaty."
"But that does not mean we should relent on our objective for a complete universalisation of the Ottawa Treaty and we must work towards an agreement to ensure that the comprehensive action plan at the Nairobi Review Conference is implemented fully."
"Standing here today before you, I am particularly proud and grateful for the role that the European Union has played in the fight against anti-personnel landmines."
"The European Union has helped maintain political cooperation as well as practical assistance."
"I fully support the European Union’s goal to ‘drastically reduce the lingering threat and impact of landmines in the context of increased local security and regional confidence’."
"Some may argue that the European Union’s target of ‘zero victims’ is too optimistic and is, indeed, unachievable."
"But it must remain our goal and we are committed to work towards reaching this target."
"The European Union’s 2005-2007 mine action strategy operates on the basis of three thematic objectives: to reduce the anti-personnel landmine threat, to alleviate mine-victim suffering and aid socio-economic reintegration and to enhance local and regional impacts of effective mine action capacity."
"In pursuit of our aims, we have demonstrated both political and financial commitment to making them a reality."
"We will continue to do so."
"The European Union has sought to promote all efforts likely to contribute to the goal of the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines, including through joint action and diplomatic démarches, dialogue with third-party countries, as well as activity in international fora."
"There is still much to be done."
"The European Union has and will continue to back policy in this area with resources."
"Financially it is projected that the total European Union assistance for mine action under our 2005-2007 strategy will amount to at least EUR 140 million, which will be linked to the European Union’s wider development goals."
"Member States are backing this up with additional bilateral funding to countries in need."
"It is clear that where there are landmines, there is little prospect for development."
"The very presence of mines exacerbates poverty by preventing the productive use of land and infrastructure, while the cost of treating injured survivors of landmine accidents drains the poorest nations of already scarce resources."
"This is why humanitarian de-mining is particularly important."
"We will continue to support mine action focused on the poorest countries."
"Future mine action will depend strongly on incorporating mine action into countries’ development plans."
"Failure to do so will adversely affect the hopes to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, which will be such a focus of the Millennium Review Summit in September."
"Let me conclude by saying that the European Union is determined to achieve the complete elimination of the threats posed by the landmines, by promoting universality, destroying stockpiles, clearing mines and assisting victims."
"We do so in close cooperation with the international community, be it governments, international organisations or, indeed, non-governmental organisations."
"Let us continue to take concerted action until the last anti-personnel mine is cleared from the face of the earth and the target of zero landmine victims is finally achieved."
". Mr President, besides being extremely important to the international community and to the European Union, the topic of landmines is also of great personal interest to me."
"During the war my father trod on a land-mine and had a leg amputated, so you can imagine that in a way that marked my whole childhood."
"I therefore, as Foreign Minister, felt very strongly committed to the fight against landmines and I think it is a centrepiece to our work on human security."
"As we have heard, landmines remain a threat in too many countries."
"Five years after the Mine Ban Treaty entered into force and after the successful outcome of the Nairobi Review Conference last year, the international community, with the European Union as a leading force, has achieved significant progress towards a world without landmines."
"To date 144 countries have ratified the Mine Ban Treaty."
"Whilst we have indeed achieved great successes, a lot remains to be done and there can be no long-term security without human security."
"Support for international mine action therefore continues to be amongst the most important political priorities of the European Union."
"Our efforts to combat landmines are an integral part of our foreign humanitarian and development policy."
"In response to the Nairobi Action Plan, the European Commission adopted the second Mine Action Strategy for 2005 to 2007 at the end of last year."
"Its overarching objective is a zero-victim target."
"What we want is a world where no-one will be injured or killed by landmines."
"This is not a remote political dream."
"It is an achievable goal."
"To make it reality, the Commission is further strengthening international assistance in mine action, by strongly encouraging States to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty and also by helping them implement it."
"In this regard, it is my pleasure to announce that, following the recent ratification by the Ukrainian Parliament of the Mine Ban Treaty, the Commission and the Ukrainian Government have just agreed the details of a major project for the destruction of land-mine stockpiles."
"We have explained to our Ukrainian partners that they needed to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty before we could release any funds."
"This is therefore an encouraging example of concrete cooperation that promotes universal adherence to the Treaty."
"Our strategy is supported by a budget of EUR 140 million, 10% more than for the 2002 to 2004 Strategy."
"This money is well spent, not just on marking, clearing and destroying mines, but on alleviating the suffering of the victims, socio-economic reintegration and the enhancement of local and regional capacity."
"To give you just one specific figure, in Afghanistan we shall have spent approximately EUR 40 million between 2001 and 2006, in order to make the country safe for the civilian population."
"I would like to stress that since the signature of the Mine Ban Treaty overall financial support from the Community and the Member States reached a record figure of over EUR 1 billion, almost half the global budget for land- mines."
"This proves that here too the European Union is a global actor that can make a difference and it also proves that the European Parliament and the Commission, together with the Council, are a strong team in foreign affairs."
"I very much welcome and support all your initiatives and thank you for having put them on the table."
"Finally, I would like to say that we currently face heavy weather, but that is no reason to become introspective."
"We must remain firm in pursuing our ultimate external policy goal and that is a secure Europe in a better, more secure world."
". Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for her remarks and commitment."
"I particularly welcome the British Minister of State for Europe, Mr Douglas Alexander."
"It is very nice to see him here."
"I have been involved in action against the scourge of anti-personnel landmines for some 10 years now."
"It is a pity that we still have to raise this subject."
"As the Minister has mentioned, many of the poorest parts of the world are still afflicted by these weapons."
"It is estimated that there are still about 15 000 mine victims every year and millions of mines are still stockpiled."
"The fact is the armed forces of afflicted countries are not involved enough in mine clearance."
"Too much is left to NGOs and the international community and there is a danger that the political campaign that supports mine action will head off in other directions instead of concentrating on what really matters: making safe those areas where the suspected presence of mines is a bar to normal life and economic development and assistance to mine victims."
"It is most important that the landmine problem is, to all intents, overcome by 2010, in just five years’ time, and does not become one of those problems that never go away."
"This requires accelerated commitment of political will and of resources by the international community and the affected countries."
"The Commission is to be congratulated for the size, quality and continuity of its contribution, but it needs to attach even higher priority to this problem and we need to ensure the right multiannual commitment of funds and ensure that money is well spent."
"It is also important that we remain sharply focused, taking account of the requirements of our own professional and responsible armed forces."
"Some seem to forget that it is not the western democracies that are the problem."
"For the most part, they are part of the solution."
"I refer to our own governments – the British and other European governments, and also that of the United States, which is among the world’s largest contributors to mine action."
"The PPE-DE Group is putting forward its own resolution and is not able to support the resolution by the other political groups, which emphasise widening the campaign to include anti-tank mines and other categories of munitions."
"This week attention is focused on Africa at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles and here in the European institutions."
"Let us remember that many African countries are amongst the most afflicted by landmines and their presence is a major barrier to the rapid development that needs to take place across the continent if the people of Africa are to escape from poverty."
"Let us renew our commitment to overcome the awful impact of anti-personnel landmines."
". – I too was moved by the interventions by the President-in-Office of the Council and by the Commissioner, who referred to an incident that must have taken place during the Second World War. Yet statistics still show that 20 000 people a year are victims of mines or abandoned ammunition, of whom 8 000 to 10 000 are children, who are killed or mutilated, usually by anti-personnel mines."
"These immoral weapons continue to have a social, economic, environmental and humanitarian impact on the population, and thus represent an intolerable threat to the human safety of whole communities."
"The Ottawa Convention is a huge step forward in the fight against this scourge, but much remains to be done, as we heard from Jody Williams and Ambassador Wolfgang Petritsch on the information day arranged here in Parliament on 16 June."
"Quite apart from the international obligations to which the States Parties are subject, the international community has a duty to eliminate once and for all not only anti-personnel mines but any mines or devices that may kill or mutilate indiscriminately."
"Countries such as my own which have placed mines in other countries in wars of a colonial nature, or otherwise, now have a special responsibility to help remove those mines and to support victim’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society."
"Europe in particular must continue to play a leading role in this field and must extend that role to other aspects of disarmament."
"The production, trade and use of anti-vehicle mines, cluster munitions and light arms present challenges that must be addressed without delay; if not, the momentum will be lost."
"Member States and Members of the Commission need to show a united front and to speak with one voice. They must speak more loudly and more effectively to promote the universalisation of the Ottawa Convention on all international fora and in relations with third countries, emphasising the need for it to be ratified and implemented."
"To this end, EU countries that have yet to sign or ratify the Convention must do so without delay, and join the 144 countries that consider this and other aspects of global disarmament to be key elements in the lasting stability of our planet and everyone’s security."
"As the Nairobi Review Conference concluded, the priority is to work towards a world free of mines."
"We owe that to the thousands of communities whose development has been undermined by these and other weapons that kill and mutilate at random."
"We owe it to them in the name of human rights, of human safety, of peace, of the very values on which the EU is based, and this is reflected in the resolution that we have tabled."
"Although a large number of countries have prohibited the use, storage, manufacture and distribution of anti-personnel mines and have committed themselves to their elimination by ratifying the convention, anti-personnel mines and other forms of land-mines continue to exist."
"Only yesterday a Slovenian military vehicle hit a mine in Afghanistan."
"They lie hidden in the countryside and around inhabited places, threatening humans and livestock, bringing death and inflicting physical and psychological damage with resultant social and other long-term consequences."
"The world has still not rid itself of the menace of this, the most inhumane of the weapons that pollute our planet."
"I understand the situation and the historical circumstances in the three Member States of the European Union that have still not ratified the convention, but now is the time for some changes."
"Other means should be used to prevent the danger of military conflicts in Europe."
"There are more victims of mines than we might think, or that we are aware of."
"The victims are not just innocent civilians, mainly farmers and their offspring, who, if they survive, are damaged both psychologically and physically, and marked for the rest of their lives."
"Their parents, their relatives, their neighbours and friends are victims, too."
"It is right and proper that in our resolution we also talk of money for the rehabilitation and reintegration of victims."
"Bringing such people back into society is a long-term and extremely demanding process if a complete and genuine rehabilitation is to be secured."
"However, any process of mine-clearing is much more valuable than dealing with the consequences of an explosion or rehabilitating the victims."
"In Southeast Europe, too, less than one thousand kilometres from Strasbourg, we are still registering new victims of mines, so we must continue the process of clearing mines until the last mine in Europe has been removed."
"If we do not do this more quickly, we will be faced with new victims, and we will not be able to act persuasively or successfully in other continents if we cannot put our own house in order first."
"Only a world without mines can allow the return of refugees and a regeneration of farming, which is a crucial economic factor, particularly in countries where wars have raged."
"Mr President, just a few weeks ago a bus in Nepal drove into an anti-tank mine that had been put on the road by rebels."
"More than 60 civilians died."
"That incident – just one among many thousands – highlights the appalling damage that can be caused by modern anti-tank mines."
"The ban on anti-personnel landmines set out by the Ottawa Treaty was an important first step."
"However, for a truly mine-free world, it is vital that we go beyond this and call for a comprehensive ban that covers all types of mines, including anti-tank mines and fragmentation bombs."
"I am sorry that the PPE-DE Group cannot join us on this."
"The horrific incident in Nepal illustrates the urgent need to allow specialist NGOs to involve non-state actors as well in cleaning mines from areas under their control."
"We must not forget the role played by financial institutions."
"I warmly welcome the initiative taken by private Belgian banks to stop investing in companies involved in the production of landmines."
"The EU and Member States should work hard to make this fine example of corporate social responsibility legally binding throughout Europe."
"I hope we will send a strong message tomorrow by adopting this excellent resolution and take forward the vital campaign to finally eliminate the scourge of mines, which has killed and maimed so many."
". Mr President, it is only right that we have had this important debate."
"I have appreciated the lively and thoughtful discussion we have had in the limited time available to us today."
"Indeed we have heard the moving personal testimony of the Commissioner and seen her personal commitment both to this issue and to this agenda."
"As we have heard, there is almost universal agreement on the need to tackle the terrible problems caused by anti-personnel mines."
"There is equally a recognition that people of our constituencies all across this continent expect nothing less of us."
"Let me respond to some of the main points that have been raised in the course of our debate."
"I begin by paying tribute to the long-standing work on this issue by Mr Van Orden."
"He spoke with real knowledge and a sense of urgency, given the scale of the challenge we face."
"I join him in congratulating the Commission for its work and paying tribute to the work that it has undertaken on this issue and recognise, as he made clear, the particular challenge faced by Africa in relation to the clearance of mines."
"All of us, with a sincere regard for the condition of that continent, recognise what a significant contribution the removal of mines can make to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals there."
"Mrs Gomes spoke in particular of the risks mines pose to children, while recognising the significant step forward represented by the Convention."
"I agree with the initial point she made, that Europe has a leading role to play in this regard."
"Indeed the European Union has been at the very forefront of the fight against anti-personnel landmines."
"I can assure her that we will continue to be so."
"Under the 2005-2007 strategy, we are aiming for the ambitious goal of a zero-victim target, where no one will be injured or killed by landmines."
"This strategy represents a common goal that all 25 Member States share."
"Mr Kacin spoke of the contemporary threat posed by landmines with reference to the recent incident in Afghanistan."
"On the issue of universalising the Convention, as part of the action plan agreed by the First Review Conference of the Ottawa Convention last December, the European Union is committed to promoting the universalisation of the Treaty and the international community is making progress: 152 countries have now signed the Convention and 144 have ratified it, so the Ottawa Treaty is now very much the international norm, although that does not mean that we should ease up on our efforts to universalise it."
"Mrs Lucas paid rightful tribute, I felt, to the important work of non-state actors in relation to the ongoing work both of universalising the Treaty and of continuing to make the case for further action to be taken."
"We have had the opportunity and indeed I believe that we now have the responsibility to make a real difference to the lives of millions of people around the world by taking action in relation to mines."
"This is an opportunity to help free them from the shadow of fear that anti-personnel landmines cast over their daily lives week-in and week-out and we have a responsibility to meet that challenge head on and deliver real results that will help deliver prosperity and security for future generations, not just on this continent but on all the continents of the world."
"I am grateful for the contributions that I have heard to the debate this afternoon."
"I have been heartened by the commitment of the Commission."
"I can assure you that the UK Presidency will continue to take action on this important subject."
"I have received six motions for resolutions¹(1) to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on 7 July 2005."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0247/2005)."
"We will be taking a number of questions to the Council."
"Fresh information concerning the unsatisfactory conservation and protection of the Parthenon friezes by the British Museum has been revealed in the UK press, refuting yet again the UK's argument that the friezes can be better protected in the British Museum."
"What initiatives will the Council take to implement Parliament's resolution (3 November 1998) on the promotion of our common cultural heritage?"
"Will the Council offer its good offices to persuade the UK to accede to the request to return the marbles?"
"Does it consider that an agreement to return the marbles would help enhance London's image in its bid to hold the Olympic Games in 2012?"
". Madam President, I am grateful for those words of welcome."
"The question raised by the honourable Member concerning the Parthenon marbles does not fall within the Community’s sphere of competence."
"This is an issue for the United Kingdom and Greece, which should be addressed bilaterally by their respective authorities."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I congratulate you on winning the 2012 Olympic Games and suppose that your government is interested in developing a spirit of ecumenicity with a view to organising these Olympic Games;"
"I therefore wish to ask the Presidency if it intends to offer its good services by communicating with the British Government. so that it makes a decision on what the European Parliament has been calling for since 1998: for the Parthenon marbles to be returned within the next few years."
". First, let me thank the honourable Member for his kind words of congratulation to the United Kingdom on securing the 2012 Olympic Games for London."
"I would have been delighted if any European city had secured those games, but I was particularly delighted that London has been successful today in Singapore."
"I hope that it will be a truly outstanding European event, and I am sure all Members of Parliament will be warmly invited, along with citizens from right across this continent."
"On the specific supplementary question that the honourable Member raised, I can assure him that the British Government is fully aware of the views of the Greek Government and the views previously expressed by this Parliament on the issue of the Parthenon Marbles."
"The United Kingdom Government considers that this is a matter for the trustees of the British Museum, who are, in the case of the United Kingdom, independent of government."
"I understand that the position is that the British Museum considers the British Museum to be the best place to house the Parthenon sculptures."
"I reiterate that this is not an appropriate matter for the Presidency to deal with; it is better taken forward by bilateral discussions between the Greek and United Kingdom authorities."
"While you are absolutely right to say that the issue of the Parthenon Marbles is a bilateral issue between Greece and the United Kingdom, would you not agree that there is a need to further discuss our common European heritage and to find ways of sharing, to the best effect, Europe’s valuable historic resources?"
". The point made by the honourable Member is an important one in terms of work that can be done collaboratively."
"I can assure him that, if one looks, for example, at some of the treasures from the art world that have been brought to the United Kingdom and taken to other European countries in recent years, it reflects that fact that there is much sharing of cultural heritage across European boundaries."
"That does not, however, diminish the points that I made."
"In this case, the matter is more appropriately dealt with bilaterally between the respective national authorities."
"I would also reiterate the point that the British Museum trustees are the appropriate body with whom these discussions should be taken forward, rather than it being a matter for national governments in the first instance."
"In the face of the absolute ban on torture and other forms of ill-treatment, states have defended the practice of transferring purported terrorist suspects to other countries, by insisting that they seek diplomatic assurances that detainees will not be tortured."
"However, there is mounting evidence that, both within and outside the European Union, certain states have seized and rendered terror suspects from one state to another, which is widely recognised as employing torture as an interrogation technique."
"Victims allege that they have been tortured and that the sending states actually provided the recipient authorities with lists of questions to be answered during interrogation."
"In the context of these reported practices, ‘reliance’ on diplomatic assurances constitutes a clear attempt to pervert justice that must be exposed and brought to an end."
"Given that the prohibition on torture and other forms of ill-treatment is an erga omnes obligation, what steps does the Council plan to take to prevent such violations and provide remedies once they have occurred?"
". The Council shares the view of the honourable Member that efforts must be pursued in order to make more effective the fight against torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world."
"Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, to which all EU Member States are a party, provides that no state shall expel, return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture."
"Regarding the assertion of the honourable Member that, both within and outside the European Union, certain states have seized and rendered terror suspects from one state to another that is widely recognised as employing torture as an interrogation technique, the Council is not aware of the ‘mounting evidence’ claimed by the honourable Member."
"It is for the Committee Against Torture set up by the Convention Against Torture to monitor the implementation of the Convention."
"The Council is, and will remain, actively committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other cruel and inhumane or degrading treatment, in line with the EU guidelines on this subject."
"I have heard the answer and am quite happy to forward evidence in my possession, through my office, to the relevant committee and, indeed, to the Presidency."
"It surprises me somewhat that they do not have that information."
"I can tell the House in very clear terms that there are disturbing allegations that EU Member States themselves have allowed their territory to be used as landing points for planes used in extraordinary renditions."
"Member States that allow their territory to be used in this way and allow flights to leave in such circumstances are colluding in serious and persistent breaches."
"What action does the Council plan to take to investigate these allegations and, if Member States are found to be responsible for such breaches, is the Council prepared to take action under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union and suspend certain membership rights of those states?"
". Madam President, in light of your direction, I shall keep this answer brief."
"I note the offer made by the honourable Member to pass on the evidence apparently in his possession to the Committee against Torture, which has been set up by CAT to monitor the implementation of the Convention."
"I would simply reiterate that the Council is and will remain actively committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, in line also with the EU guidelines on this subject."
"The European Council Declaration on Combating Terrorism of 25 March 2004 required Member States to implement four Framework Decisions and two Decisions essential to the fight against terrorism, by June 2004."
"It also called for implementation of a further framework decision and for ratification of the Mutual Assistance Convention and Protocol and three Europol Convention Protocols, by December 2004."
"One year on, can the Council confirm that all Member States have complied with these obligations?"
"If not, what action is the Council taking to ensure full implementation of these measures, and what conclusions does it draw on the gap between rhetoric and concrete progress in tackling security and crime threats?"
". The state of play of the implementation of the legislative instruments relevant in the fight against terrorism is set out in Document 8211/05 Add."
"2 Rev. 1, which will be distributed to the European Parliament."
"The tables indicate that, although not all instruments have been fully implemented, considerable progress has been made since last year."
"The Council plans to update the tables contained in the aforementioned document regularly and, on that basis, to discuss with all Member States the state of play with regard to implementation."
"In January the Commission reported that only three Member States had fully implemented the Framework Decision of June 2002 on joint investigation teams by the deadline, not including the UK."
"The Commission said it encountered many difficulties in gathering the relevant information."
"Is it not time to stop the tradition whereby the Council does not name and shame those countries not implementing the Framework Decision?"
"Is it not also necessary that the Council take advantage of the provisions in the current Treaty to convert the hopelessly ineffective as well as undemocratic intergovernmental provisions in the law enforcement area to Community competence so that suitable enforcements of the law are agreed by the Member States?"
"Otherwise, how are we ever going to combat crime and terrorism?"
". Madam President, I note the tenor of the question."
"The specific matter raised is an issue that I will certainly look into in the course of the Presidency."
"I would say, however, on the general question of why the European Union has not made further progress on counter-terrorism legislation, that substantial preparatory work on counter-terrorism legislation has been carried out under previous presidencies."
"We anticipate that we will be able to agree a framework decision on exchange of information and the European Evidence Warrant under our Presidency."
"The framework decision on data retention has been held up by concerns about its legal base and by the lack of a common understanding between Member States."
"The Turkish Supreme Court decreed on 25 May 2005 that the teachers' organisation Egitim Sen would be disbanded."
"The organisation will lose its right to represent almost 200 000 members in dealings with authorities or employers."
"The situation stems from Egitim Sen's support in its constitution and policy documents for the principle that all children should have the right to tuition in their mother tongue and that all individuals should have the right to personal development on the basis of their own cultural background."
"The Supreme Court considers this to be contrary to the Turkish Republic's Constitution, which stipulates that all education shall be in Turkish."
"The Commission has already acknowledged that Turkey maintains substantial restrictions on the right of association, the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike, and that Turkey still does not meet International Labour Organisation standards."
"What consequences does the Council consider this ruling by the Supreme Court will have for the country's hopes to become a member of the EU?"
". The honourable Member is undoubtedly aware that in deciding that Turkey fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria sufficiently to open accession negotiations, the European Council on 16 and 17 December 2004 clearly stated that the Union would continue to monitor closely the progress of the reform processes within Turkey."
"In that context, the specific case mentioned by the honourable Member is known and has been followed closely."
"Without going into the details of the ruling given recently by the Turkish Supreme Court, the Presidency can state that it has prompted some concern on the part of the Union with regard to respect for both freedom of expression and association, and for the cultural rights of minorities."
"The proceedings are still under way and the trade union organisation in question has also stated that it might appeal to the European Court of Human Rights."
"The Presidency can, nonetheless, assure the honourable Member here and now that, if need be, and while respecting the principle of the independence of the judiciary, the Union will not fail to raise this issue with the Turkish authorities, as it does regularly in the various fora for political dialogue as well as within the bodies of the Association Agreement regarding any problems that arise in implementing the reform process."
"I should like to thank the Presidency for its answer and, above all, for its promise to address the practical issue of this Turkish teachers’ organisation in direct bilateral contacts with Turkey."
"This very remarkable decision involves a violation of basic union rights and the right to organise."
"An infringement of freedom of expression and minority rights in Turkey also arises from one and the same decision."
"I therefore think that this case is incredibly central to Turkey’s democratic credibility."
"I also wish to put the following question to the Presidency: can negotiations concerning EU membership be entered into with Turkey as long as this type of decision is taken there?"
". Although I am respectful of the point made by the honourable Member, it is important to recognise that the Turkish Government has made enormous progress over the last couple of years through the adoption of a series of constitutional and legislative reforms."
"Major reforms include the abolition of the death penalty, new protections against torture, greater freedoms of expression, association and religion, ratification of international agreements on human rights, greater cultural rights for Kurds and others, and reduction of the military’s role in the government."
"The December European Council to which I referred endorsed the 6 October Commission recommendation that – and once again I quote – ‘Turkey has met the Copenhagen political criteria that accession negotiations be opened’."
"The Council’s conclusions welcomed the decisive progress made by Turkey in its far-reaching reform process and express confidence that Turkey would sustain that process of reform."
"Turkey’s human rights record will be the subject of intense scrutiny during the accession negotiations."
"We remain confident that all remaining concerns will be addressed during that accession process."
"Supreme Courts are by definition laws unto themselves and I think you are absolutely right to emphasise that this one unfortunate and unsupportable decision should not in any way impinge on the progress of Turkey towards membership of the European Union."
"They have, as you have outlined, made significant efforts to meet European norms and we should not blow this one incident out of all proportion."
"Does the Council agree?"
". I am happy to concur with the opinions of my fellow countrymen."
"I would certainly say on a serious basis that real and significant progress has been made."
"There is clearly further work to be undertaken, but it would be unfortunate if those who have wider objections to this issue did not recognise that this is a single decision within a process that is heading in the right direction, although there is a significant amount of progress still to be made."
"I also welcome the Council’s answer to the question, but I should like some clarification."
"Does the Council believe that the Turkish Constitution, as it has now been interpreted by the Supreme Court, is compatible with the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"I am thinking, in particular, here of Article II-72 on freedom of assembly and association, which particularly emphasises the freedom to form and join trade unions, and Articles II-81 and II-82 of the same Charter on non-discrimination and the need to respect linguistic diversity."
". We are clearly concerned that on 25 May the Supreme Court ruled that the Egitim Sen should be closed down on the grounds that its by-laws contradicted the constitution by advocating mother-tongue education."
"The decision is especially disappointing after the case had twice been dismissed by the Turkish Labour Court, which had noted that mother-tongue education is permitted under European law."
"Again I would reiterate the general point in relation to freedom of expression that free speech is beginning to take hold and beginning to flourish in Turkey."
"Recent reforms include allowing broadcasting and teaching in Kurdish and constitutional amendments strengthening the freedom of the press and recognising the supremacy of Turkey’s international human rights obligations."
"There is mounting evidence that the judiciary is now increasingly relying on the European Court of Human Rights’ rulings as a basis for its judgments."
"That is surely to be welcomed by all Members of this Parliament."
"When will the Council implement the agreement to open up direct trade with the North of Cyprus?"
". The Council has expressed its view on this matter on a number of occasions."
"In any event, it may be recalled that the Council has been steadfast in its support for the pursuit of efforts to achieve the reunification of Cyprus and in its desire to see all Cypriots living together as citizens of a reunited island within the European Union in the near future."
"It is against this background, and with this in mind, that the European Union has been examining measures capable of putting an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and facilitating the reunification of Cyprus."
"More specifically, as regards the Commission’s proposals relating to part of the instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community and the exchanges with zones where the Republic of Cyprus exercises no effective control, Council bodies have already carried out important work."
"The fact that certain difficulties – particularly as regards direct exchanges – remain to be overcome, means that these two proposals still cannot be adopted."
"However, the Council can use the Presidency’s good offices to assure the honourable Member that it will continue working to encourage the island’s economic integration and to improve contacts between the two Cypriot communities and within the European Union."
"I welcome the Minister to the House."
"I hope he is enjoying the experience."
"I wonder if he could tell me whether or not he agrees with the comments made by President Papadopoulos who said recently that proposals to open direct trade with Northern Cyprus would have no real or substantive economic effect but would amount to a political demand aimed at politically upgrading the north?"
"Would he agree with me that the treatment of Turkish Cypriots – who are after all EU citizens – by their neighbours on that island, which amounts to nothing less than economic apartheid, is unacceptable and must be stopped, and will he give some indication of the practical steps his Presidency will take over the next six months to bring this about?"
". I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question."
"In relation to whether I am enjoying the experience, I think it is still too early to say."
"On the substantive point of the need for direct trade with Northern Cyprus and the query that was directed to me in relation to the views expressed by others, the Council’s position remains that which has been previously stated."
"We continue to believe that direct trade will help to narrow the gap in economic development between the north and the south of the island, promoting economic cooperation and business ventures between the two communities."
"Assisting the economic integration of the island would also boost significantly the prospects for reunification, since it would make a settlement easier and, frankly, less costly to accommodate."
"In relation to the specific actions that will be taken under the United Kingdom’s Presidency, the Government wishes to see these regulations agreed as soon as possible, in order to fulfil the Council mandate to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots."
"So, in consultation with the Commission and other Member States, we will carry forward work on the dossiers left by the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Given the significant rise in attacks by the Burmese Army on Shan civilians and the severe abuses of human rights in Shan State (Burma), what concrete steps is the Council taking to put pressure on the Burmese authorities to end its brutality in the Shan province, and what measures are being taken to encourage the Thai authorities to face up to their responsibilities and provide vital protection and humanitarian assistance for refugees who are fleeing across the border into Thailand on a daily basis?"
". The Council has expressed its concerns regarding human rights in Burma at several meetings with Burmese leaders, most recently on 6 May, at a ministerial meeting with Burma held in the margins of the Asean Ministerial Conference in Kyoto."
"At the EU-Asean ministerial meeting held in Jakarta in March, the Presidency met with a senior Burmese official to inform him of the European Union’s concerns and to encourage his authorities to attempt to initiate a dialogue with all the country’s political and ethnic groups in order to facilitate reconciliation and democracy in Burma."
"On 17 June 2005, on the occasion of the 60th birthday of Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the Presidency made a declaration on behalf of the European Union in which it reiterated its concern at the current situation in Burma and the renewed tensions involving the nationalities, especially the Shan state and the Karen."
"In that declaration it was pointed out that the European Union is committed to supporting national reconciliation and respect for human rights and democracy in Burma and a request was made to the state Peace and Development Council to enter into a genuine dialogue with the NLD and with ethnic representatives to find peaceful political solutions that take into account their legitimate concerns."
". On behalf of Simon Coveney who raised this issue, the question to the Council has to be: given what you have just outlined, how effective has all of this been and what other steps might be taken?"
"I do not think anyone is satisfied that the actions so far have yielded any results."
". I am speaking to Parliament today as a representative of the Presidency, but I can assure you, not least from my previous work as a Foreign Office Minister in the United Kingdom Government, that I am fully aware of the efforts that have been made by the British Government, and by Europe more generally, to try and bring about the resolution that all of us would seek in the face of the present human rights abuses in Burma."
"Our commitment in Burma is to promote human rights, democratisation and sustainable development as far as we can, using all the tools available to us."
"The European Union remains, I am delighted to say, at the forefront of international efforts to press for improvements in human rights in Burma."
"Opposition groups, including the National League for Democracy, acknowledge and welcome the continued political and practical support of the European Union."
"Human rights violations have been highlighted in successive highly critical resolutions on Burma in the United Nations General Assembly and in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"The Burmese authorities can be in no doubt about our views."
"The EU troika expressed our deep concern over the situation in Burma directly to the Burmese Foreign Minister in Kyoto on 6 May."
"We continue to believe that it is essential for the regime to enter into a genuine and inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy, and with ethnic representatives."
"Only such a dialogue can promote a peaceful democratic future for all Burma’s people."
"I would, however, add this additional remark. While I am proud of the work that the European Union and European Member States have taken forward on this issue, I think it should be recognised that it is also important for other Asian neighbours of Burma to continue to take action and step up their efforts on the human rights abuses."
"The failure in previous resolutions before the United Nations to secure the active support of other Asian partners to the kind of initiatives necessary to bring this degree of pressure to bear on the Burmese regime was a matter of disappointment to us."
"So I can assure you that from the Presidency’s point of view we will maintain the pressure at European level, but we are cognisant of the responsibility of others outwith Europe as well to continue to make the case for change to the Burmese authorities."
"Does the Council intend to make any statements or include in its programme of work the protection of minorities in the EU and the future of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency?"
". The Council supports the establishment of an EU human rights agency, which will play a major role in enhancing the coherence and consistency of the European Union’s human rights policy."
"Following the adoption by the European Commission of the proposal to establish the fundamental rights agency, the Council will place the proposal before a working party for examination."
"As for the protection of minorities, the honourable Member is kindly reminded that legislation has already been adopted in an effort to tackle discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation."
"The European Commission is due to report in 2006 on the state of transposition of Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC."
"Furthermore, the Council takes note of the communication of the European Commission of 1 June 2005 on non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, a framework strategy, in which the Commission proposes to establish a high-level advisory group on social and labour market integration of disadvantaged ethnic minorities."
"Under the United Kingdom Presidency, the Council, as well as the European Parliament, will deal with the European Commission’s proposal for a decision on the European Year of Equal Opportunities For All – i.e. 2007 – built upon four key themes: rights – raising awareness of the right of equality and non-discrimination; representation – stimulating a debate on ways to increase the participation of under-represented groups in society; recognition – celebrating and accommodating diversity; and respect and tolerance, promoting a more cohesive society."
"The total proposed budget is EUR 13.6 million, which would cover preparatory actions in 2006, as well as the activities due to take place during the European Year itself in 2007."
"I hope it was not the Scottish accents coming across."
"The President-in-Office is extremely clear."
"I should like to welcome him to his office with no irony at all – as we have heard from one or two other Members – and thank him for that very positive answer."
"I would like to remind the President-in-Office that the United Kingdom has implemented all the directives that he mentions."
"We have taken a lead on this."
"Many Member States have yet to implement anti-discrimination legislation."
"Could I ask whether you agree with me that the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, which has broad support in this House, is something that could be strongly developed under your watch and that we should ask the Member States who have yet to implement anti-discrimination legislation to do so as quickly as possible?"
". I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question."
"I am respectful of the expressed desire that I speak slightly more slowly."
"I hope it was a reflection on my speed and not my accent."
"I can assure you that if I appeared speedy in my initial answers, it was only through my desire to reach as many questions as we can in the course of the limited Question Time available to us today."
"I am also grateful to the honourable Member for acknowledging the work of the United Kingdom Government on this particular issue."
"I personally judged that it would be deemed rather unpresidential for me to boast in that regard, but I note the comments he has made."
"I am grateful for his warm welcome to my speaking role today."
"The United Kingdom welcomes the Commission’s proposals, and the Presidency also does so, on the establishment of a fundamental rights agency."
"We are in favour of an effective, independent FRA, with well-defined work objectives that do not duplicate the work of existing bodies."
"That was the subject of a discussion that I held with colleagues in the Council of Europe this morning, just across the river."
"We believe that the agency should give priority to areas such as racism and xenophobia, building on work already done by the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia."
"We will work with other Member States to develop the details during the course of our Presidency."
"Without wishing to undermine the very serious question put by my good friend and colleague Claude Moraes, I notice that you welcome this particular agency."
"I wondered if you could share with us your thoughts on how many agencies you believe the EU should have and whether you would agree with me that the EU generally needs fewer agencies and more action?"
". I do not wish to break the consensus that appears to have broken out in the Chamber when answering the honourable Member’s question, but I have never seen a contradiction between the establishment of a necessary agency undertaking important work and action being taken by the European Union."
"Perhaps that is simply something on which we disagree."
"Minister, welcome to your debut in the European Parliament."
"On the issue of the Fundamental Rights Agency, I have deep concerns about the risk of duplication with the existing excellent work within our own Parliament in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the work of the Council of Europe and the UN’s Human Rights Commission."
"How can you ensure that there will be no be duplication and therefore no waste of EU taxpayers’ money?"
". I am certainly alive to the concerns that the honourable Member has raised."
"Indeed, it was the subject of lengthy discussions this morning with the Council of Europe, which has expressed similar concerns in terms of how we avoid duplication."
"Sometimes, the language that is used in terms of synergies and complementarity should not mask the important question that he has asked in terms of the importance of being rigorous as regards the role of the FRA."
"I believe it is necessary for the Presidency to be clear that steps will be taken to ensure that the FRA avoids duplication, as his question suggested."
"The Presidency has worked closely with the Council of Europe, which supports the establishment of the FRA."
"We believe that the FRA management board could include a representative of the Council of Europe and an observer from the proposed European gender institute in order exactly to avoid the kind of duplication raised by the question."
"This is a matter on which we will need to have continuing watchful eyes."
"In that sense, I am grateful to him for raising this question."
"It is not a matter that will be finally be resolved today, but it merits continued and detailed reflection in the weeks and months ahead."
"Is the Council aware of the exorbitant fees that some banks within the EU are charging for money transfers?"
"For example, a constituent of mine was recently charged almost EUR 1 000 for transferring money from a bank in Spain to the UK."
"Is the Council willing to consider regulating the fees that European bank customers can be charged for transferring money in the single market?"
". The Council refers to its reply to Written Question E-0229/02."
"Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 2001 on cross-border payments in euro has applied since 1 July 2002 so far as electronic payment transactions, cash withdrawals, and card payments are concerned, and since 1 July 2003 to cross-border credit transfers."
"It provides for charges levied by financial institutions for cross-border transactions between Member States and the euro area to be aligned with the charges levied for similar transactions within the Member State in question."
"Other Member States may apply the regulation to cross-border payments and credit transactions in their own currencies."
"It is recalled that the Commission has exclusive right of initiative in the field of Community regulation referred to by the honourable Member."
"However, should the Commission decide to send a proposal to that effect, the Council of course would consider it."
"Thank you very much for that answer."
"Like you, I am very familiar with the ruling of the 2001 Council, to which you referred at great length."
"However, putting that to one side. Would you consider personally that it is a matter of concern that international banks are making huge amounts of profit at what is now the touch of a computer button for people transferring money within the internal market?"
". It is fair to say that, due to the nature of the international capital markets, this is not the only instance in which, by the touch of a button on a computer keyboard, vast amounts of money can be made."
"Indeed, we have some experience of that in the United Kingdom, though – I am glad to say – that was before the term of office of this government."
"However, the honourable Member raises an important point and, should he wish to correspond further with me, I would certainly make sure that those representations are passed on to the relevant people."
"I would like to bring to your attention a constituent who has just emailed me about outrageous FIFA charges for World Cup tickets for 2006."
"It may interest you with regard to the London Olympics."
"Apart from the price of the tickets, he was charged EUR 24 for the use of his MasterCard."
"The tickets only cost EUR 149."
"Is it not time to look, as my colleague said, at the fact that so much money can be made by those who do so little?"
". The honourable Member raises a very important matter on behalf of one of her constituents."
"As a Scotsman, I have to say that I fear the question of World Cup tickets may prove only to be of academic interest to me, but I am sure for many other Members represented in this Chamber it will hold greater significance than for those of us in Scotland."
"As I have already made clear, though, in relation to the original question that was asked, it should be recalled that the Commission has exclusive right of initiative in this field of Community regulation and therefore I think if there are particular concerns in relation to the credit card transaction in question it would be appropriate that these matters also be raised with the Commission."
". Madam President, I am happy to take questions 9, 10 and 11 together."
"As the honourable Members are aware, the Council is committed to the fight against incitement to hatred in broadcasts."
"Article 22(a) of the Television Without Frontiers Directive provides that Member States should ensure that broadcasts do not contain any incitement to hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality."
"However, the directive does not apply to broadcasts intended exclusively for reception in third countries, nor to broadcasters not under the jurisdiction of a Member State."
"Following the measures taken successfully by the French, Dutch and Spanish authorities on the basis of the directive, Al Manar is no longer broadcast by any EU-based satellite company and the Television Without Frontiers Directive no longer applies to it."
"The Council discussed the issue of incitement to hatred in broadcasting from countries outside the European Union at its meeting on 23 May 2005 and took stock of work initiated to respond the problems posed by satellite broadcasting of non-EU channels in the European Union."
"This followed a meeting of the presidents of national broadcasting regulatory authorities on 17 March 2005, which agreed to reinforce cooperation between the regulatory authorities and identified concrete measures to strengthen this cooperation, notably information exchange regarding channels authorised in Member States, establishing a contact point within each national authority."
"In the Council, delegations took note of the measures and proposals outlined to combat incitement to hatred in broadcasts."
"They recognise that consideration should be given to the means of combating more effectively the broadcasting of such material in the context of the revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, notably the adaptation of this instrument to the most recent technological developments."
"– Madam President, I should like to thank the British Presidency for its firm and measured response. I should also like to offer you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my very best wishes for success in tackling the European challenges ahead of you."
"The underlying problem of this issue, however, is that of the relationship between the European institutions and those in third countries who actively promote terrorism."
"Today, in fact, I read an article in the press saying that there is an active campaign in Iran to incite people to commit suicide attacks in Israel and Iraq."
"I should like to know what the Presidency has to say about that."
". I am grateful for the honourable Member’s generous words and good wishes at the outset of our Presidency."
"As I sought to reflect in my initial answer, we wholly condemn actions which are taken towards inciting the kind of terrorism and acts of violence which he describes and I hope my earlier remarks reflect the seriousness with which we regard this problem."
"I would like to thank you for your considered reply and also for the fact that the British Government has belatedly given consideration to banning Hizbollah’s so-called civilian wing, whereas in fact there is no difference between the civilian and the military wing."
"Today was a great day for the city that I represent, London, in our winning the Olympic bid for 2012."
"One of the messages from the Prime Minister in Singapore was that the Olympics will be used as a vehicle for peace and friendship amongst nations, as a way of combating this kind of hatred between peoples."
"What more can be done to stop EU Member State registered companies giving advertising revenue to television companies like al-Manar?"
"In addition, what pressure can you bring to bear through the Council on the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia to stop them broadcasting to the Arabic-speaking communities resident in EU Member States listening to this hate-filled type of broadcasting?"
". First, let me say that I would disagree with his characterisation of the British Government’s position in relation to Hizbollah, but this is not the forum or the occasion to explore these issues, which are more directly of relevance to the national authorities of the United Kingdom than to our role as the Presidency."
"I am, however, grateful to the honourable Member for his warm welcome to his home city’s success in securing the Olympic Games and let me assure him that there are plenty of opportunities in bilateral forums and indeed in contact between the European Union and other nations outwith the European Union to raise exactly the kind of concerns of which he spoke this afternoon."
"– Madam President, I would like to thank and congratulate the Spanish authorities, who have, in turn, just banned the television channel Al-Manar, which we are discussing here, from being broadcast via their satellite Hispasat."
"Having said that, I would like to ask Mr Alexander two specific questions, because our information on latest developments seems to differ, as do our interpretations of certain articles in the Television Without Frontiers Directive."
"France has therefore ordered Eutelsat to stop transmitting the signal."
"Very good."
"What of Globesat, which is a subsidiary of France Télécom and which has not, as far as I am aware, stopped providing the signal to other satellites that, in turn, transmit this signal beyond the borders of the European Union?"
"Your answer appeared to me to be rather vague about the intentions of Nilesat and Arabsat, the Egyptian and Saudi satellites, which, by my reading of Article 2(4), are indeed covered by the provisions of the Television Without Frontiers Directive."
"As you know, we have an association agreement with Egypt, so will this issue be raised?"
"Has it already been?"
"We have a Council on 13 December: do you intend to discuss it then?"
"These are specific questions."
". I would simply make a couple of points."
"First, I am unaware of the disparity of which the honourable Member speaks, but if there are issues of factual disagreement between us then I would be happy to receive representations in that regard."
"The other point I would make is the basic one that Community law does not apply to broadcasts intended exclusively for reception in third countries and that is also a factor in our discussions."
"Madam President, Mr Alexander, Spain did in fact resolve this problem only last week, but France has unfortunately not yet followed suit."
"Mrs Ries is absolutely right in this respect."
"This begs the question of whether a certain amount of pressure should not be brought to bear on the French authorities, and above all on the authorities of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, as Mr Tannock rightly said a short while ago."
"In my opinion, this is also a task for the Council, and one that calls for a certain degree of diplomacy."
"Mr Alexander, I wish you much success in your role as President-in-Office of the Council."
"In view of the fact that Scotland will not be playing in the World Cup, Bertie Vogts should probably be sacked from his job as coach."
". The honourable Member attaches great importance to diplomatic discussion of these issues."
"This is clearly an issue not solely of broadcasting, but also of getting to the root of those organisations or individuals who seek to perpetuate hatred and misunderstanding, when we stand for greater understanding and reconciliation of great faiths and of great peoples."
"So I take on board the importance of diplomatic representations being made."
"In relation to his second point, I think this is factually accurate in the sense that Bertie Vogts has already left the coaching role for the Scottish football team, but then I thought it might be not very of me to point that out, given that we have reappointed a Scotsman to that role, apparently to no great effect so far!"
"As its author is not present in the Chamber, Question No. 12 lapses."
"How will the proposals for an External Action Service be affected by the failure in the ratification process of the proposed EU Constitution?"
"In view of the demise of the Constitution, and thus of the anticipated basis for action, what steps does the Council propose to take to reverse the presumptive steps already taken in preparation for the introduction of the External Action Service?"
". Following the declaration by the Heads of State and Government on 17 June on the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, the Council has not taken a decision on what further steps, if any, might be taken on the preparations for the introduction of the European External Action Service."
"Since the External Action Service would exist to assist the Union Foreign Minister, since the Union Foreign Minster can only exist pursuant to the Constitution, and since the right to act on behalf of the EU only arises on foot of the EU itself having a single legal personality, does it not follow that its legal authority arises from the Constitution?"
"Since there is a pause for reflection with regard to the Constitution, should the same not apply to the External Action Service if that pause is genuine, rather than cosmetic?"
"For if implementation action continues, is the Council not then flying in the face of the public rejection of the Constitution and all its manifestations?"
". Clearly the future of preparatory work on the European External Action Service is tied up with the future of the Constitutional Treaty."
"The honourable Member is right to acknowledge that there is now a pause for reflection following the decisions reached at the Brussels European Council just a couple of weeks ago."
"That time – now for reflection, as identified by the European Council – will continue for a number of months."
"Let us be clear, first of all, that the preparatory work to date has consisted of discussions between the Member States, the Council Secretariat and the Commission, as tasked by the Heads of State and Government in October 2004."
"It is the case that the Luxembourg Presidency took forward preparatory work as tasked by that intergovernmental conference and, indeed, by the December European Council."
"This work, however, has not pre-empted the ratification process: it has consisted of discussion and exchange of ideas in Brussels."
"As I said in my initial answer, no formal decisions have been taken."
"Does the Presidency accept that the Constitution in some places makes mandatory things that are already perfectly possible and legal under the current Treaties?"
"For instance, the Council could decide, by changing its rules of procedure, to meet in public when dealing with legislation."
"National parliaments could be better involved with early information, and some aspects of the External Action Service may, for instance, be explored in due course."
"I note that Mr Allister prefers not to go down that route."
"Presumably, he, as a good federalist, wants the external representations of the Union to remain under the Commission and not under Mr Solana."
". I will not intrude in the private discussion between the honourable Members as to who is a federalist and who is not."
"Let me simply say that I am on record in the United Kingdom as saying that one of the obvious areas where there is scope for progress in relation to greater transparency within the European Union is the European Council in its ability to meet, when in legislative mode, in public."
"That seems to me to be common sense."
"However, we also need to reflect the fact that the decision reached at the Brussels European Council two weeks ago was for a period of reflection."
"It is necessary, therefore, to reflect that in the priorities that we will be developing in the course of the coming year."
"There will be plenty of opportunities, both for Members of this Parliament and, indeed, for European leaders, the European peoples and the public within Europe, to take part in those discussions during the period of reflection."
"Therefore, the first priority must be to hold discussions relating to the period of reflection rather than to move immediately towards changes – whether great or small – in relation to the actions of the European Council or, indeed, some of the issues anticipated in the Constitutional Treaty."
"Luís Posada Carriles, a Venezuelan national of Cuban origin, is wanted by the Venezuelan Government for his involvement in the terrorist attack of 6 October 1976 in Barbadian air space, on a Cubana de Aviaciòn plane which was en route from Caracas to Havana; 73 people were killed."
"Luís Posada Carriles is currently being held in the USA, and Venezuela, where the attack took place, has requested his extradition as the alleged perpetrator of the attack."
"At its extraordinary meeting of 21 September 2001, the European Council declared that terrorism represented a genuine challenge to the world and to Europe, and that the fight against terrorism, on the basis of the rule of law and respect for international Agreements, would be a priority objective of the European Union."
"One of the agreements in question is the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, done at Montreal on 23 September 1971, which is, along with Venezuela's bilateral extradition treaty with the USA, the basis on which the Venezuelan Government is demanding that the North American courts extradite the Venezuelan citizen, Luís Posada Carriles."
"What is the Council's view of the fact that to date, the USA has not extradited the alleged terrorist Luís Posada Carriles?"
". The Council regards the case of Luis Posada Carriles as a bilateral matter between Venezuela and the United States."
"The Council would like to remind the honourable Member, moreover, that the case of Posada’s deportation is still and that the United States authorities have not officially rejected a formal Venezuelan request for extradition."
"Without prejudice to the outcome of the Posada case, it should be noted, however, that the European Union condemns all acts of terrorism regardless of their target or motivation."
"In the European Council declaration on combating terrorism of 25 March 2004, the Union and its Member States pledged to do everything within their power to combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Union, the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the obligations set out under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373."
"In this context, the Council recalls that all EU Member States are party to the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the safety of Civilian Aviation, which makes it an offence to endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight and requires states that have custody of offenders either to extradite the offender or submit the case for prosecution."
"Minister, this case creates great social alarm because, despite the fact that this is a bilateral problem between Venezuela and the United States of America, those countries must not give the impression that they are sheltering or protecting people accused of terrorist crimes, including in the case of people linked to the intelligence services, as in the case of Mr Posadas, who was actually on the payroll of the CIA."
"To a certain extent I welcome your reply, because it suggests that it is essential that no horrendous terrorist crime, such as this one, should go unpunished."
". With the greatest of respect to the questioner, it would be injudicious to be drawn into general discussions of this case given its status as at present."
"I have noted what the questioner said, but in light of the fact that the matter remains , what I have said fully states the Council’s position."
"Replying to me (question H-0377/05)(1) in the last session of Question Time, the Council was totally unable to answer my supplementary question but promised publicly to write to me with the answer."
"How much longer must I wait before the answer will come?"
". Following the reply given by the Council representative to Question H-0377/05 during Council Question Time at the last European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg on 8 June 2005, the honourable Member asked a supplementary question concerning the state of play as regards the transposition of Council Framework Decision No 2002/465/JHA of 13 June 2002 on joint investigation teams."
"In reply to Question H-0377/05, the Council representative stated that 21 Member States had notified the General Secretariat of the Council that they had transposed the framework decision, but in two Member States the draft legislation transposing this decision had been, or would soon be, put before Parliament and that one Member State had announced that it had transposed the decision in part."
"The supplementary question put by the honourable Member was aimed at finding out what the situation was in the 25th Member State."
"On the basis of the information obtained, the Council can inform you that the 25th Member State – namely Italy – has informed the General Secretariat of the Council that the provisions implementing the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on joint investigation teams and the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 29 May 2000, are contained in draft law C2372, tabled by the government on 20 February 2002 and currently undergoing scrutiny in joint committees 2 – justice – and 3 – foreign affairs – of Italy’s Chamber of Deputies."
"No estimate can be given for the moment of how long the Italian Parliament will take to approve this bill."
"Thank you very much, President-in-Office."
"I do not think I have ever had such a full reply to a question."
"I am very grateful for that."
"I must also say that I have never seen the Council benches so full."
"I think this is the first time that the people on the Council benches outnumber the rest of Parliament put together."
"What an impressive start you are making."
"My supplementary question is this: there is nothing wrong with the President-in-Office saying he does not know the answer to the question, as he did in his previous guise a month ago, and promising to write to us."
"However, is he now saying that a promise to write to us after Question Time will not produce a reply and that we must put down a supplementary in order to get the answer?"
"Or, if he does not know the answer, will he in future do what he said in his previous life and write to us as he promised?"
". I am grateful for your words of congratulation to the Presidency for the fullness of our benches, but I fear I have already learned at my initial appearance at this Parliament that what you lack in quantity you more than make up for in quality in relation to the questions that you asked."
"In relation to the specific point that was made by the honourable Member in relation to correspondence from the presidency, it is a matter that I will look into, but I will look into it in light of the fact that we have endeavoured in the course of the reply I have given to offer as comprehensive an answer as possible to the question posed by the honourable Member."
"Considering the G8 meeting this week in Scotland, how does the Council plan to discuss its outcomes and any future actions required by the EU institutions?"
". The Gleneagles G8 summit, taking place in Scotland this week, will focus on two key issues: Africa and climate change."
"Africa, because the continent contains 18 of the world’s poorest countries."
"It is currently not on target to meet any of the UN Millennium Development Goals first set out at the Millennium Summit in 2000."
"The continent needs a step change in development, financing, health, education, governance and the capacity to trade in global markets and programmes for dealing with killer diseases and building African peacekeeping capacity."
"Climate change is our additional priority, because it is clear that our world is warming up."
"Major irreversible change in our climate is a real threat and the most important issue we face in the long term."
"Tackling the problem needs a global approach."
"The summit is an opportunity to move forward the debate at the highest political level and to help forge a common vision."
"The European Union plays a leading role in both issues and has already agreed policies on them."
"The G8 agreement does not bind the European Union, but may serve as a catalyst for future discussions within European Union structures."
"The G8 Summit outcome may give rise to discussion in the relevant Council formations."
"For example, the 12 July Ecofin meeting will discuss development financing."
"All political and legislative initiatives at European Union level will, of course, follow the normal EU procedures for discussion, agreement and adoption as appropriate."
"Before getting to the substance, I too should like to congratulate the President-in-Office, not just for the quality of his responses but for their speed."
"He might be interested to note that I was speaking to a group of Scottish visitors just before coming back here for Question Time."
"They asked me about the G8 and I told them that I had a question – No 16 – but there was no chance of reaching it, so I am very pleased that we have indeed reached it."
"He is absolutely right to say that the G8 does not the European institutions, but it would be foolish of the EU institutions not to respond to the outcome of the G8 discussions."
"He has already given a partial answer to this question, but will he go further and consider asking both the Commission and the Council Secretariat systematically to go through the G8 conclusions to see where follow-up action is required by the EU institutions?"
". It is a benign coincidence that the United Kingdom holds both the Presidency of the European Union in the second half of this year and the chairmanship of the G8."
"I believe it allows an opportunity for effective synergies to develop between the work of the European Union and indeed of the G8."
"The evidence I would cite in support of that contention is already clear."
"If one considers the truly historic decision taken by European Union Development Ministers within the last month to effectively double the level of aid provided by European Union Member States by 2010, from approximately USD 40 billion to USD 80 billion, it is clear that it has already established a very important benchmark for the G8, as it gathers in Scotland this week."
"The European Union deserves fulsome tribute and credit for its long-standing interest in issues of development related to Africa."
"If I might be so bold, with the permission of Parliament, I think the United Kingdom also deserves credit in this instance for having decided to put the issue of Africa at the top of the international agenda of this week’s G8 meeting."
"I would say, however, that the conclusion of this discussion will not be at the conclusion of the G8 Summit this week."
"In the course of our European Union Presidency over the next six months, there will, of course, be this week’s G8 Summit in Gleneagles."
"There will then be the Millennium Review Summit in New York in September, followed by the next critical Ministerial Meeting of the Doha development round in Hong Kong in December."
"Each of those represents a vital staging post on the onward march of progress towards helping many of the world’s poorest countries and the peoples of Africa."
"If you need any further illustration of the critical contribution that European Union institutions can make to that progress, one need look no further than the decisions that will be reached in Hong Kong in December, where I personally hope the European Union’s Trade Commissioner will be able to advance an agenda that is pro-growth in Europe and pro-poor in the world."
"Can I say first say to the Minister that I have been very impressed with the British Government in its general handling of this issue, and I congratulate you."
"I do not want to take from that by saying that Mr Blair really is not making sense when he says he is listening to the people on the subject of the Constitutional Treaty."
"The people are not talking about the Constitutional Treaty."
"We are talking about the Constitutional Treaty."
"They are talking about the developing world."
"Please continue to drive that agenda."
"You have given great leadership on this issue."
"Please do not drop the ball."
"After the G8, after your Presidency here, we need that leadership very badly."
". I am grateful to the honourable Member for his warm words of support for the leadership that Britain has offered both in the G8 and in the European Councils on this important matter."
"We are definitely in agreement that the peoples of Europe care passionately about the issue of development."
"I attended the rally that took place in Edinburgh, in my country of Scotland, at the weekend."
"If, like me, you had been able to see in excess of 200 000 people gathered in that city, you would have been in no doubt whatsoever about the extent to which both the European Union and the Government of the United Kingdom are acting with the full support of people from right across Europe in pursuit of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"However, it must be recognised, notwithstanding the level of public support for the action we have taken and, I hope, the further steps that we can take this week at Gleneagles, that the scale of the challenge we face is profound."
"If you take, for example, the Millennium Development Goals, and in particular their aspirations for sub-Saharan Africa, the timescale set out by world leaders back in 2000 was 15 years for the achievement of those Millennium Development Goals."
"At the present rate of progress in sub-Saharan Africa, some of these Millennium Development Goals will be met not in 15 years but in 150 years."
"We are categorically of the view that this is too long to wait."
"That is why we are so proud of the work that European Union institutions and European ministers of development – and, indeed, as reiterated in a decision by Ecofin when it met last month – have carried out in relation to advancing the cause of development in recent months and weeks and why we are determined to use the opportunities, not just of our Presidency of the European Union, but also the opportunities presented by the G8 this week, the Millennium Review Summit in September and the Doha talks in December, to try to continue to advance this vital and important agenda."
"As its author is not present in the Chamber, Question No. 17 lapses."
"Can the Council please advise on the next steps for the review of the Working Time Directive?"
". As the honourable Member is certainly aware, the Commission submitted an amended proposal regarding the revision of the organisation of the Working Time Directive on 31 May 2005 following adoption of Parliament’s opinion at first reading."
"This proposal was discussed by the Council on 2 June."
"However, owing to the short period of time left for examination, the Council was not in a position to assess all its implications."
"The Council therefore instructed the Committee of Permanent Representatives to examine the amendment proposal with a view to the Council reaching an agreement as soon as possible."
"– Mr Alexander, I would like to know the UK’s position on the opt-out."
"Do you stand by your position in favour of the opt-out or do you have alternative solutions?"
". I am not convinced that this is either the forum or the occasion on which to advance the United Kingdom’s position on this, given my responsibility to answer on behalf of the Presidency."
"As with every incoming Presidency, our responsibility is to seek to lead and also to find consensus, but that consensus will inevitably and appropriately involve the United Kingdom, as well as the other Member States of the European Union."
"The Standing Committee of Nurses of the EU (PCN) has called on EU Member States to create legislation, where it does not exist, on euthanasia and the roles and responsibilities of all healthcare workers, especially nurses."
"The committee has maintained that there is medical practice taking place where life is being ended."
"A report from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the issue of assistance to patients at the end of life called for 'procedures and provisions clearly defining the responsibilities of medical and nursing staff and ensuring the traceability of all decisions and measures taken, thus facilitating effective monitoring’."
"Does the Council agree with the concerns expressed by the PCN and will the Council make a statement on the matter?"
". The Community’s responsibilities in the field of public health are set out in Article 152 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"In particular, Article 152(5) states that Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care."
"The Council, therefore, has no competence as regards euthanasia."
"Thank you, Minister, for that reply."
"In April this year, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe rejected by a large majority a draft measure to legalise euthanasia in Europe."
"At the same time, in the Netherlands, where euthanasia has been legalised, it is reported that assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia are now responsible for one in 40 deaths."
"Given the rise in euthanasia tourism, does the Council agree that the coordination between Member States at EU level on this issue would now be prudent, taking into account the principle set out in the Treaty that the death penalty is not one which should be available in Member States?"
". With the greatest of respect to the questioner, I would reiterate the point I made in my initial answer, that the European Community does not have competence for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care."
"The present Treaty is quite clear on this point in relation to Article 152(5)."
"As such, the Council has no competence as regards euthanasia and so it cannot create legislation on this issue."
"It cannot specify the roles and responsibilities of healthcare workers regarding euthanasia because Member States have the sole competence in this area."
"It is therefore for Member States to ensure that they have procedures and provisions in place to define the roles and responsibilities of medical and nursing staff."
"Member States are also responsible for monitoring these procedures."
"What is the Council Presidency’s assessment of the current situation in Togo, and what measures does it propose to take to contribute to the stabilisation of West Africa?"
". The European Union has closely followed the evolution of the situation in Togo."
"In a statement issued in the aftermath of the elections, the Presidency expressed its grave concern regarding the situation in Togo following the elections on 24 April and paid tribute to the people of Togo who took part in the ballot despite difficult conditions."
"The Presidency also condemned the wave of violence and launched an urgent appeal to all the parties to restore calm."
"In a declaration issued on 3 June, the European Union expressed its support for the initiatives taken by the African Union through its Peace and Security Council, in particular the appointment of a special envoy to facilitate dialogue between the Togolese parties and the decision to send an observer mission to monitor the political, security, social and humanitarian situation, as well as the human rights situation in the country."
"The European Union also urged the Togolese authorities to carry out an impartial, exhaustive and credible investigation into the acts of violence against the civilian population."
"The European Union raised the issue of Togo at the latest ministerial meetings with the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States, held on 11 April and 18 May respectively."
"During those meetings it had the chance to discuss the complexities with regard to African mediation efforts and election monitoring."
"The European Union declares that it is ready to support the national reconciliation process and it will continue to monitor the political situation in Togo closely, particularly in relation to the 22 engagements undertaken by the Togolese Government during the consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement and reproduced in the Council Decision of 15 November 2004."
"The next legislative elections in Togo figure among the election monitoring priorities established by the Commission for 2005."
"The Commission will send an exploratory mission, which should report on the advisability of sending an election monitoring mission if a number of conditions are met: first, if a government is in place; second, if a consensus exists among the main political parties to respect the results of the elections: and, third, there is real progress on the 22 commitments."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am much obliged to you for the detailed answer you have given and would just like to ask whether it is, in your view, conceivable that the European Union will, in the immediate future, intervene directly and actively in the peace process in an attempt to bring about new elections in the immediate future."
". I reiterate the point I made in my earlier statement that the Commission will send an explanatory mission, which should report on the advisability of sending an election monitoring mission if a number of conditions are met, and I set out those conditions."
"In the first instance, we would want to be clear as to the findings of such an exploratory mission in relation to further work that could potentially be done in that area."
"As a Member State of the European Union, Cyprus is entitled to play a full part in all aspects of the CFSP, whereas it does not participate in those aspects of the ESDP concerning EU military cooperation with NATO, in accordance with the relevant agreements between the two organisations."
"However, in all EU-NATO meetings, and in the context of EU institutional procedures, Turkey prevents Cyprus and Malta from participating even in matters not involving direct military cooperation between the two organisations, by taking a very broad interpretation of the North Atlantic Council's decision of 13 December 2002."
"The same situation also arises in EU meetings on the grounds that documents containing NATO classified information are being discussed."
"Is the Council willing to address this persistent situation which is creating major institutional and political problems and which essentially gives a third, candidate country the right to intervene in the operation of the EU and its procedures?"
". As rightly pointed out by the honourable Member, as things stand at present and under the agreed framework for EU-Nato relations, Cyprus and Malta do not take part in EU military operations conducted using NATO assets, the so called ‘Berlin Plus’ arrangements."
"Likewise, they do not receive NATO classified information or EU classified information containing or referring to NATO classified information."
"This state of affairs necessarily has implications for Cyprus and Malta’s participation in EU-NATO meetings, as well as in some internal EU meetings."
"It will not, however, affect the rights and obligations of EU states in their capacity as EU members, in particular the entitlement of Cyprus and Malta under the EU Treaty to participate fully and without discrimination in defining and implementing the CFSP, including defence aspects."
"The Council is fully aware of the problem and, in the absence of complete resolution of the issue, has been raising it constantly over the past year with the parties involved."
"Turkey has been asked to help resolve the problem, but for the time being the complexity and the wider implications of the issue have made it difficult to achieve much real progress."
"Questions on how the North Atlantic Council interprets and applies its own decisions, including that of December 2002, should properly be addressed to NATO."
"I note, however, that requests to extend the scope of EU-NATO dialogue beyond military cooperation in crisis management have come mainly from NATO."
"The Council is happy to consider such an extended dialogue, provided that all 25 Member States are present at the table."
"I should also like to note that, at the most recent meeting between the European Union Political and Security Committee and the North Atlantic Council on 27 June 2005 in Brussels, it proved possible to hold a formal exchange of views on Darfur with all 25 EU Member States participating."
"I would like to consider this a first, even though small, step forward to more significant progress on this difficult issue."
"– I would like to give special thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Alexander, and start by wishing him every strength and every success in his job and that of the British Presidency."
"I understand from your answer, Mr Alexander, that the European Union and the British Presidency do not agree with the approach and the interpretation which Turkey gives to relations between the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ."
"You will surely agree that neither Cyprus nor Malta are Member States of the European Union with reduced institutional parity within the framework of the European Union."
"Does the British Presidency intend to take any specific initiatives to resolve this very serious problem which Turkey is creating?"
". Obviously the basis of the question reflects the fact that two organisations, in particular the European Union and NATO, must both agree on the agenda of any meeting in advance."
"As I made clear in my original reply, it is not for me to comment today on how NATO interprets and applies its own decisions in this respect."
"I would merely reiterate what I said in my initial answer."
"The Castro regime is still holding 61 political prisoners in detention, sentenced to very long terms of imprisonment for activities relating to citizens' freedoms and human rights."
"At the same time, in a clear breach of the principles of international law, the Cuban government is preventing contact between MEPs and human rights activists in Cuba."
"Given this situation, on what grounds did the Council reject proposals for tighter EU sanctions against the Cuban regime?"
". In its conclusions on Cuba, which were adopted on 13 June 2005, the Council drew on the 1996 Common Position, the relevance and validity of which it reaffirms."
"Consequently, the European Union aims to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people."
"This approach has never been called into question by any of the Member States."
"The Council has taken a firm position, especially in relation to the human rights situation which, according to these conclusions, should be raised at every high-level visit."
"This Council has also expressed regret at the lack of any further advance since the release of several political prisoners imprisoned in March 2003."
"It has, in particular, condemned the action taken by the Cuban authorities to curb freedom of expression, assembly, and freedom of the press."
"Furthermore, the Council has categorically condemned Cuba’s unacceptable attitude to foreign parliamentarians and journalists who attended the Assembly to Promote Civil Society, on 20 May 2005, and were either expelled or denied entry into Cuba."
"Moreover, closer relations with the peaceful political opposition and with broader sectors of Cuban civil society through intense and regular dialogue decided at the end of January have produced satisfying results."
"The Council decided to maintain this dialogue and indeed intensify it according to the agreed guidelines."
"These meetings of representatives of the European Union and of the Member States with the peaceful opposition will continue to take place."
"The Council has decided to reconsider its position in the context of evaluation of the common position in June 2006."
". Madam President, I should like to ask the Council representative to inform the House of the specific measures that the Council intends to take."
"The fact of the matter is that members of the opposition are still held in Cuban prisons, having been sentenced to many years of imprisonment."
"The European Council supports the lifting of sanctions against the Castro regime, despite the fact that the EU should insist on respect for human rights when pursuing its foreign policy."
"I would ask whether the time has not come to change our tactics for dealing with the Castro regime, and to stop being guided exclusively by the policies of Zapatero and Madrid on the matter."
". I shall begin with a couple of points of history and then speak of the future."
"On 31 January the European Union agreed to intensify its dialogue with the peaceful opposition in Cuba and then on 13 June, conclusions also noted that the expulsion of EU deputies and journalists, which prevented them from attending a meeting of civil society on 20th May in Havana, was unacceptable."
"The European Union’s cohesive approach to human rights in Cuba was recently shown at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in April when Member States jointly co-sponsored the resolution, drawing attention to Cuba’s human rights record."
"I can assure the honourable Member that the European Union will continue to use every opportunity to call for the release of all political prisoners and will urge the Cuban Government to apply greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, political reform and further economic liberalisation in Cuba."
"As the speaking time set aside for Question Time has expired, Questions Nos. 23 to 42 will be answered in writing(2)."
"That ends Question Time."
"The next item is the report by Mr Timothy Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, 1. on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Agreement between the European Community and Switzerland concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland [13049/2004 COM(2004)0593 C6-0240/2004 2004/0200(CNS)] and"
"2. on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen Acquis [13054/2004 COM(2004)0593 C6-0241/2004 2004/0199(CNS)] (A6-0201/2005)."
". Mr President, I very much welcome your House’s endorsement of the conclusion of the agreements on the association of Switzerland with the Schengen and Dublin ."
"This positive stance is made all the more important by the fact that the political processes required by Switzerland for these agreements to be ratified have now been completed, the most important stage in them having been, without doubt, the referendum held on 5 June."
"We, too – and your House not least – should all make good use of this favourable response on the part of the Swiss in order to foster a positive attitude towards the European cause, and this will of course involve the completion of our own procedures with the minimum possible delay."
"The agreements were signed on 26 October 2004 in Luxembourg and augur well for the continuing development of relations between the EU and Switzerland."
"Swiss association with the Schengen Agreement will bring many practical benefits for EU citizens too, particularly for the many thousands of commuters and travellers, whether for business or other reasons, who are obliged to cross the border on a daily basis, for whom life will be made much easier once the agreement is implemented."
"Moreover, the agreements relating to Schengen and Dublin also enhance security by means of cooperation in combating crime and in the exchange of data across borders."
"It is for this reason that it is so important that Parliament should endorse the conclusion of the agreements."
"It is, however, unfortunate that differing views are held on the procedure applicable to this end, by the Commission and the Council on the one hand and by Parliament on the other."
"Having once again examined its position, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it ought to be possible to agree on one point, namely that neither agreement is an association agreement within the meaning of the European Communities Treaty, even though the word ‘association’ occurs in their titles."
"Apart from that, though, the Commission does take the view that these agreements do not create any kind of specific institutional framework for the cooperation processes."
"The mere existence of a mixed committee is not sufficient to have that effect."
"The point I particularly want to make with reference to this is that the mixed committees’ sole function is to rule on whether or not the agreements should remain in force in the event of Switzerland failing to discharge its treaty obligations, specifically the transposition of the Schengen or Dublin into domestic law."
"It also has to be said that these mixed committees are entitled to exercise influence to a considerably lesser degree than the mixed committees already in existence, as established through other bilateral agreements with Switzerland."
"For these reasons, the Commission regards the legal position as being that neither agreement requires assent."
"The Commission therefore sees no reason to amend its proposal for a decision."
"Thank you for your attention; I look forward to the debate with interest."
". Mr President, like a curate’s egg, as they say, that introduction by the Commissioner was good in parts but not in all parts."
"I am greatly honoured to have conduct of these matters."
"My respect for not only the institutions of Europe but also for the Swiss institutions and people knows no bounds."
"It was only because of the willingness of the Swiss people, through their referendum on 5 June, to see greater cooperation between Switzerland and the EU that I was able to proceed with my proposals."
"As the Commissioner has already pointed out, these are good proposals."
"They are radical, particularly from a Swiss perspective, because although Switzerland retains its independence, if the report is adopted its borders will now effectively allow more movement of people."
"It will retain strong control over movements of goods but there will be greater movement of people, much better cooperation between law enforcement authorities and, through Switzerland's involvement in the Dublin , close involvement in determining who is responsible in the case of difficult asylum applications."
"These are all very good, progressive and acceptable developments."
"They could well be the start of many more agreements based on a similar approach, an approach that was adopted previously with both Norway and Iceland and is now being used with Switzerland."
"As I said, I very much respect the decision of the Swiss people on 5 June and I am therefore happy to proceed."
"However, although I have heard the Commissioner's explanation on the mixed committees and hence the legal base, I still have considerable problems."
"I look at this not so much as a lawyer myself, but on the basis of our legal advice, which appears to be ambivalent."
"From my point of view it indicates that the right procedure would have been the assent procedure rather than consultation."
"That is the basis on which I intend to proceed."
"I still hope that we might be able to reach an accommodation here, because the purpose of my two amendments to this report is to make sure that this is an assent and not a consultation procedure."
"Obviously there might be an ongoing dispute."
"I am disappointed in that part of the Commissioner’s speech, because she seems to indicate that she is happy that her legal advice is better than mine. I suppose you do not always have the same legal advice when you have two lawyers, any more than two economists ever agree on financial matters."
"Nevertheless, I feel very strongly that this is important, not only in this particular case but also for other matters and agreements that we might bring to Parliament for consideration in future."
"My committee is quite clear about this, having taken advice, and I too feel very strongly."
"I do not want to be seen to be blocking progress or obstructing the will of the Swiss people, who are very interested in the outcome of our discussions and what I am doing here."
"However, it is in everybody’s interests that we make it clear that the European Parliament very much guards its right to be involved in assent procedures in the limited fields in which they apply."
"We feel very strongly about that."
"I hope that the Commissioner will be able to reconsider."
"The Council is not present, but it had a similar view."
"I would like to see the matter reconsidered, because these freer relationships can only be to the benefit not only of the Swiss people but also of all of us in the European Union, especially its institutions, and in particular the European Parliament."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I propose to start by raising a number of issues relating to the Schengen Agreement, for I have a very clear recollection of the circumstances surrounding its adoption, which was heralded by a number of things happening at borders, where customs checks were abolished and VAT was no longer to be levied; veterinary controls at borders were abolished, the collection of statistics at borders was consigned to the past, and checks on branded products came to an end."
"At the same time, export subsidies and import levies were done away with too, the effect being that the borders really were open."
"Last to go, and at the hands of the Schengen Agreement, were controls on persons."
"The very opposite is the case in Switzerland, where all the things I have listed remain in place, and only controls on persons are to cease."
"I therefore want to raise the question of whether our Swiss neighbours have not managed to extract the only raisin from what I, in this House, have called this very dry bread, and, in these negotiations, they appear to have done just that."
"At any rate, that is the impression that the people in my electoral district on the Upper Rhine get; they are constantly pointing out the ways in which the things that the Swiss regard as important have actually been dealt with."
"There are, though, very serious problems – the noise made by planes at Zürich airport is one of them – that have been left untouched, even though they are bilateral in nature, affecting both Switzerland and Germany alike."
"The second issue is no less important and has to do with farmers on this border."
"The very great difficulties that the German farmers face have to do with the fact that the Swiss pay much higher subsidies, so that the Swiss farmers are able to pay higher rents, and now they are going to get aid from the European Union too."
"It is enough to defy anyone’s powers of comprehension."
"If adequate account cannot be taken of these interests, then something has gone wrong with the negotiations at some point."
"Our opinions differ as regards the legal basis."
"It is our belief – and our own Legal Affairs Committee confirms it – that these mixed committees really are institutional in character."
"That being so, I do not think this House is in a position to deliver a definitive opinion, and so we will have to go on discussing this."
"I do not therefore think that it will be possible for the European Union to ratify this agreement at present."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member whose electoral district is directly adjacent to Switzerland, I do of course share with Mr von Wogau a fundamental interest in good, and above all close, cooperation between the European Union and that country."
"Although I do not wish to say anything about the legal basis, on which I can do no other than agree with Mr Kirkhope, Members of this House are getting the impression that cooperation between the Member States on the one hand and the European Union – with which Switzerland has been in negotiations – on the other is not all that our constituents have a right to expect."
"I do believe, though, that, despite everything, this agreement adds up – bearing in mind the fact that the Agreement on the free movement of persons has to be added on 25 September – to an advance for those who live in our electoral district, for Schengen and Dublin are about closer and therefore better cooperation in the control of persons and are thus of benefit to internal security."
"It is not only the Swiss who stand to gain from this; so do our fellow-citizens."
"It is, though, because both the European Union and Switzerland must benefit from their mutual cooperation that I share the view that the Schengen Agreement and the Agreement on the free movement of persons must complement one another like two sides of a single coin."
"Particularly in view of the ongoing problems with borders, which we will be discussing with our Swiss opposite numbers at the meeting of the SINEEA delegation in Fribourg next week, it is right and proper that the Commission should tell them that we have to regard Schengen as inseparable from the Agreement on the free movement of persons, and this, as Mr von Wogau so rightly said, should not, if at all possible, be seen as the end, but rather as the beginning, of a process by which the Swiss will come to agree to other closer cooperative relationships."
"It is because I believe this to be in the interests of the people on the Upper Rhine that I regard Mr Kirkhope’s report as worthy of support, and, although it is not for me to give an opinion on the legal issues he has addressed, it has mine."
"– Mr President, one might be forgiven for thinking that this debate is only of interest to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, yet this is not the case – it is of interest to the whole of Europe."
"I should like to begin by commending Mr Kirkhope on his efforts to defend Parliament’s prerogatives."
"I wish to congratulate the Commission on the initiative and to say to the Commissioner that it is very important that Switzerland can become the third country from outside the EU, after Iceland and Norway, to be involved in the execution, implementation and development of the Schengen acquis and the Dublin/Eurodac system."
"The fact is that the Swiss people decided in a referendum, as mentioned by Mr Kirkhope, to have closer ties with the EU by integrating the Schengen area, which allows free movement, and by means of the Dublin Agreement, which covers asylum policy."
"I welcome Switzerland’s participation in these systems, which will eliminate certain obstacles to free movement and will strengthen cooperation; this is vital in view of the country’s geographical location."
"Switzerland stands to gain politically, in terms of greater stability in its geographical neighbourhood, and economically, in terms of the benefits of greater flow of movement."
"Accordingly, Switzerland will have to accept and apply the Schengen acquis in its entirety, which is not true of all EU Member States, given that derogations are only provided for in relation to the future development of the Schengen acquis, a prerequisite seen as necessary for the conclusion of an agreement on taxation of savings."
"As regards the second agreement, Switzerland will have to accept, implement and apply the current and future Dublin/Eurodac acquis with no exception."
"I should like to conclude by pointing out that these agreements mark a welcome shift towards closer relations between Switzerland and the EU. This also demonstrates to other countries that it is possible to strengthen ties, to pool efforts and to work closely together on policy with the EU, without necessarily formally becoming a Member State."
". Mr President, perhaps I might start by replying to the questions in general terms."
"I think we are all, when it comes down to it, glad that we now have these agreements, that one of them has already been approved by a referendum, and that we can embark on the process of ratification."
"As has already been said, that is very important, not only because it can be a model for other countries, but also because it will offer the Swiss people a chance to draw ever closer to the European Union."
"Since the legal issue has been mentioned, it is that in particular that I would like to revisit."
"The legal services of both the Commission and the Council have given their opinions on this."
"Even though Mr Kirkhope has already done so, I would like now, again, to confirm the position."
"Article 300 of the Treaty establishing the European Community specifies four instances in which the conclusion of an international agreement requires assent on the part of the European Parliament. The first is where the agreement is an association agreement within the meaning of Article 310 of the Treaty establishing the European Community; the second, agreements establishing a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures; the third, agreements having important budgetary implications for the Community, and the fourth, agreements entailing amendment of an act adopted under the procedure referred to in Articles 251 or 252 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"In all other instances, Parliament can only give its opinion."
"The Commission’s legal service takes the view that this agreement cannot be seen as included among the instances enumerated above and that the mixed committees established by it have only limited powers, specifically in the field of dispute resolution."
"Although I have of course taken note of what you say, I must uphold this as being the Commission’s opinion."
"I would like to briefly respond to the issues addressed by Mr von Wogau and also referred to by Mr Schwab."
"We are, I think, fully aware of the problems and issues that they have mentioned, which have to do with cooperation between areas, and, in particular, between regions."
"Although such issues as agriculture and aircraft noise are predominantly bilateral in character, I am aware of the connection, and while unable to put forward any solution right now, I can assure you that we are aware of the problems, which we can perhaps again put on the agenda for occasional discussions with the Swiss."
"I have, at the present moment, nothing further to add, and ask your House to continue with the relevant procedures."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Gabriele Zimmer, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the impact of the lending activities of the European Community in developing countries [2004/2213(INI)] (A6-0183/2005)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate affords me the opportunity to present the report that I have written, on behalf of the Committee on Development, to discuss in particular the effects of the European Union’s lending practices, involving specifically in this instance the European Investment Bank."
"The primary object of the report that is before you today, and on which you will be asked to vote tomorrow, is to make the European Investment Bank a major, and above all, an effective instrument of development aid."
"Today, many of you have shown your support for the ‘Make Poverty History’ campaign, and that is, of course, a laudable thing to do, but, if we – as this House has done symbolically – take part in ‘White Band Global Action Day’, we also have to discuss the extent to which the development aid for which we can claim credit to date actually does what we, again and again – not least to the outside world – claim that it does."
"Today’s poverty already has a history, and part of that history has to do with the mistakes that have been made in development finance over recent years and have had the consequence that today, still, 2 736 million people – amounting to almost half the world’s population – have less than two dollars a day on which to live."
"I would like to return to an element in this morning’s debate that I regard as directly relevant to this report."
"Movements in Africa have been persistently critical of the way in which the countries of the North exercise control over them; what they want from us above all else is an all-out war on poverty, hunger and disease, and an agreement on our part to the complete and unconditional cancellation of the poorest countries’ debts, so let us give them that."
"They also call for more, and in particular better, resources to be allocated to development aid than have been to date."
"There is no doubt that one of the errors of the past – and one that has to be addressed with reference to the European Investment Bank – was the lack of coordination among the various bodies involved in development finance."
"Despite the Barcelona agreement, they still, to far too great a degree, operate in parallel – the Commission alongside the Member States, multilateral and national development banks side by side – and ultimately counter-productively."
"It is for that reason that this report attaches great importance to the need for the EIB, in taking up its new tasks, to give priority to coherence, transparency and, above all coordination, from the very outset."
"Among the most fateful errors, though, was the widespread attempt to use what was termed ‘development finance’ as a means of developing our own economic relationships abroad and enabling European businesses to open up markets in the South."
"If you take a look at the limitations placed upon the European Investment Bank’s mandate, particularly as regards loans in Asia and Latin America, you find that virtually word for word."
"The European Investment Bank’s shareholders, namely the Member States of the European Union and the Commission, are currently engaged in negotiating a new mandate for the EIB to grant loans outside the EU, but these negotiations are, I believe, actually being conducted to an increasing extent by financial experts, with less and less involvement of experts on development."
"Nor, so far, have they drawn on Parliament’s expertise."
"Yet this new mandate must contain a clear commitment to the tasks particularly associated with the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and to the combating of poverty in the countries to which money is lent."
"In order, though, that this House may be enabled to monitor how this new mandate is worded, it is, I believe, necessary – and something that this report demands – that Members of this House be informed of the progress of negotiations as early as September this year."
"It is not acceptable that we should be presented with a ."
"No longer can the progress of the war on poverty be measured only by reference to figures for economic growth, which often – and particularly in the case of rural areas – conceal increasing poverty, or, indeed, by reference to the level of direct foreign investment, which the bank cites as an indicator of success but is not suitable as such, for it says nothing about the number of jobs created or about the effects the investments have on society or the environment."
"To take an example: today, in Zambia, the EIB is helping Swiss and Canadian companies to start up large-scale copper mining operations; almost all their profits will go out of the country, while toxins will remain in the rivers to ruin agriculture throughout entire regions."
"The report before you today also contains a range of practical proposals as to how the EIB’s loans can, in future, be put to better use in developing countries."
"These proposals are made in the context of the Millennium Development Goals and in harmony with the UN’s objectives, and a large number of detailed proposals have been made as to how progress can be achieved in this area."
"There is one problem that I particularly want to highlight."
"I believe that the European Investment Bank still pays far from enough heed to the requirement that it should apply the Millennium Development Goals as indicators, enabling it to assess the effects of its own operations after the event."
"It relies on general data, which I do not believe to be sufficient, particularly when one draws comparisons with the effectiveness with which the national development banks of certain Member States already operate."
"It was the tsunami that showed the urgent need for change if the EIB is to be able, in emergencies, to make proper loans independently of external economic criteria and provide really effective help."
"For this, it needs a clearer mandate from its shareholders, the Member States, so I ask you, tomorrow, to vote to adopt this report, for by so doing you will maintain the productive and cooperative relationship between this House and the European Investment Bank, and we will be enabled to make progress in the field of development aid."
"Mr President, Mrs Zimmer, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Zimmer on her report on the impact of the European Investment Bank’s activities in developing countries."
"We think that this report raises many very important issues, and I will not pretend that I do not largely agree with their analysis."
"Before commenting in more detail on the report itself, let me first give my impressions of the situation regarding the implementation of the investment facility."
"Some of you will know that I wrote to Mr Maystadt in February this year, expressing concerns about the Cotonou Investment Facility."
"I am happy to say that the situation has improved significantly since then."
"One of the improvements that I have noticed is a greater willingness to take the risks inherent in investment in developing countries; another is the systematic application of a new framework seeking to measure the impact of operations on development."
"We are talking to the EIB about simplifying the decision-making structure for the facility’s projects."
"In short, we think that the investment facility is on the right track in the ACP region."
"I would now like to make five comments on the report, starting with services of general interest."
"We entirely agree that it is necessary to improve the provision of services of general interest in developing countries, for example in the water and transport sectors."
"As many of these projects are not viable in commercial terms, they obviously require an element of subsidy."
"Consequently, we have proposed to the Member States that, for the next budgetary period, we should double the interest subsidy package that accompanies the investment facility in the ACP countries, and increase it to EUR 400 million."
"With regard to cooperation between the EIB and the Commission, we recognise that even more needs to be done to improve the infrastructure in developing countries."
"The Commission is preparing a communication on Africa, as you know."
"This communication will propose a considerable increase in the availability of regional and transcontinental infrastructure."
"This objective will require substantial efforts to be made to improve coordination between the EIB and the Commission, as well as with other financial bodies and institutions."
"In this context, a group of officials from the EIB and the Commission is currently analysing how our two institutions could improve cooperation in the future."
"Clearly, it will also be important to cooperate with other lenders, as I have just said."
"With regard to micro-lending, we fully support the reference to micro-lending in the report."
"As the United Nations has declared 2005 to be the International Year of Microcredit, this subject is a political priority."
"In this regard, the Commission recently decided to make Commission aid for micro-lending considerably more professional."
"An important pillar of this new approach is to step up cooperation with those banks that specialise in development, particularly the EIB, with regard to the provision of microcredit."
"Consequently, the Commission strongly supports the European Parliament’s call to increase the EIB’s microcredit aid."
"Turning to the development indicators, here too we recognise that the EIB needs to adopt the Commission’s key indicators to assess the results of its operations and to set up an independent evaluation unit."
"Finally, with regard to the review of the external lending mandates, we recently proposed, at a meeting between the Commissioner for External Relations and President Maystadt, to increase the development aspect of the EIB’s external activities, outside the ACP region."
"The review of the external lending mandates, which the EIB and the Commission are now beginning, provides the opportunity to do so."
"I should not like to finish without paying tribute to President Maystadt and his team, who, certainly during all our meetings and whenever we have been in contact, have shown themselves to be very open-minded."
"Within the EIB Presidency, at any rate, there is clearly a considerable openness to development and if President Maystadt cannot go any further in terms of effectiveness, it is partly because, unfortunately, there are rules and his goodwill has its limits."
"That said, he is someone who is very open to reform."
"He is even studying the options for reforming the EIB, to make it more sensitive to development issues and to ensure that, within the decision-making bodies, the development aspect is taken more broadly into account, which is clearly difficult as things currently stand and given the composition of the decision-making bodies."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Zimmer on her excellent report and congratulating the Commissioner for his proactive initiatives."
"I know he has been going up and down to Luxembourg to see Mr Maystadt and I think something very good is going to come out of all this."
"The EU is the largest aid donor in the world."
"The EIB’s lending facility is four times the size of the World Bank."
"But you, Mr President, know everything about the World Bank."
"Who knows anything about the EIB?"
"Unless we do something about it, we could even change the EIB’s name to the European Invisible Bank."
"The EIB should be Europe’s premier financial institution for lending and development."
"It should lend to infrastructure and to SMEs."
"It should lend microcredits."
"It should lend beyond the EDF."
"It should be able to lend to all the developing countries that the European institutions help."
"The EIB’s statute needs to be strengthened by Parliament: to create a legal base, to have a grant funding element so that its lending and its interest charges can be much more competitive and be given with some security."
"For example, if the EIB were to lend at 1% a EUR 1 billion loan, it is only going to cost EUR 10 million."
"If it were to charge 2%, it is only EUR 20 million."
"What is EUR 20 million in our development budget?"
"Very little, but it would enable the EIB to give billions to create infrastructure, create small businesses, create microcredits, and it would cost our Community aid budget EUR 20 million."
"That is all we are talking about."
"I think it is high time we did this."
". First and foremost, I would like to thank Mrs Zimmer for her excellent report and all her hard work, and to thank the European Investment Bank for its cooperation."
"I am convinced that we all have a responsibility to explore and to deal with the problems of the developing world."
"I welcome the policy set out by the European Parliament, the Commission and the British Presidency regarding this issue."
"Developing world countries should not have to subsist merely on aid; possibilities must be opened up for bringing their economies to life."
"Instead of economic paralysis, a way out must be created for them."
"I would like to draw your attention to the following points that are being realised via the European Investment Bank’s lending activities."
"The European Investment Bank supports the objectives set out by the European Union in the Cotonou Agreement and in the eight Millennium Development Goals."
"The fact that the bank takes into account the views of non-governmental organisations and public opinion, even at the project monitoring stage, is important."
"Environmental impact assessment and an environmental impact statement have now been integrated into the project cycle, while attention will continue to be focused on the social and employment policy consequences of the investments."
"A comprehensive anti-corruption policy and an open, transparent process of negotiation and concluding contracts will create a sound basis for this – the parties must namely put in place appropriate internal inspection mechanisms to expose corruption."
"Lastly, I would like to highlight an issue that I consider to be a priority: in developing its lending to the private sector, it will now be possible to monitor respect for human rights and compliance with ILO labour standards and OECD guidelines."
"I believe that the only instruments worth applying are those that bring effective development and not merely transitional solutions to the problems of the developing world."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner Michel, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mrs Zimmer for this fine report."
"The importance of the European Investment Bank is underlined by two facts; one is that the EUR 40 billion it lends make it the world’s biggest public source of credit, while the other is that its active presence in over 100 countries makes it, as a development bank, second only to the World Bank in terms of size."
"The problem, though, is that its statutes stipulate that the European Investment Bank is not actually meant to function as a development bank; they in fact impose upon it the obligation of adjusting its interest rates in line with what the market demands, that is to say of not offering particularly low rates of interest in order to promote objectives in such fields as development policy."
"It has, however, been required to apply its lending policy towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and this, although something that is very much to be welcomed, is a contradiction, and one that ought to be resolved by the bank undergoing a fundamental reform."
"I believe that some fundamental thinking needs to be done about whether it might not be rational and proper for the Bank’s funding of development to be separated, institutionally speaking, from its European activities."
"It is because I believe that a political solution needs to be found to this ongoing contradiction that I regard this as the principal subject for attention in any discussion about the Bank’s policies."
"Until such time, though, as such a fundamental reform is got underway, there is a need for other practical steps to be taken towards improving its policies and in order to enable it to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"One thing that I believe has to be done is for the granting of loans to be guided by the need to address poverty and meet social, environmental and human rights criteria, which must take precedence over financial and technical considerations, and which the Bank’s management must ensure is put into practice."
"Secondly, I think it very important that the Bank should make more use of the instruments for interest rate subsidy provided for in the Cotonou and MEDA agreements, in order to become able to finance the development of small and medium-sized enterprises by means of loans at lower rates of interest."
"The difference between these and the high rates that the Bank’s statutes oblige it to charge can then be made up by means of subsidies."
"The third thing that has to be done is to assess and take into account the social and environmental effects of large-scale infrastructure projects, and to do so to a much greater extent than before."
"It is particularly important that no support be given to projects that do not meet the criteria of the World Commission on Dams, that is to say major dam-building projects."
"These three things I do believe we can put into practice right now, and then, in the long term, there will be a need for a fundamental debate on reform."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the socialists of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"First of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent job she has done."
"The principal operational recommendation of the UN’s Millennium Project stipulates that all developing countries, still in conditions of extreme poverty, should adopt bold national strategies so as to be able to achieve over the course of a decade the objectives agreed on."
"The countries in question should draw up precise financial plans, set out the extent of internal resources that can be invested in the plan and how much will have to be obtained from donors."
"It is clear, in fact, that the fight against poverty is primarily the responsibility of the developing countries themselves, even though it is equally obvious that the achieving of the Millennium Development Goals nonetheless requires a substantial increase in public aid, to eliminate the poverty trap."
"In this context, EU action, even though it has got off to a good beginning, must be rapidly improved and the mechanisms relating to action must be made more flexible and dynamic."
"On the basis of concrete and operational experience, the appropriate and necessary improvements should be made."
"There should, of course, be greater consistency and synergy between the various European aid programmes, bringing together European development policies, such as the Millennium Objectives laid down in 2000 and the Cotonou Agreement, and the EIB’s policies."
"2005 is the year of micro-credit."
"It is particularly important to adopt further instruments to stimulate the investments of small and medium-sized businesses and to encourage entrepreneurship, especially among women and young people."
"I would also like to emphasise one final point."
"In two weeks’ time a delegation from this Parliament, of which I will have the honour of being a member, will visit the areas in Indonesia struck by the terrible tragedy of the tsunami."
"An entire region of our planet now sees its future compromised."
"With regard to this situation it is our responsibility to give the EIB a new, specific emergency mandate, with a view to allowing these people to make a start on their future in a less troubled manner."
"Lending a hand by giving practical support to people who are on their knees, trying to get up, is a duty of solidarity that Europe cannot and must not shirk."
"Allow me to make a few final remarks on the importance of the EIB’s external activities in the developing countries."
"As I said at the beginning of the debate, the EIB is a very important partner for the Commission when it comes to implementing new political initiatives, particularly the provision of infrastructure in Africa."
"We appreciate the progress that the EIB has made."
"Several recommendations from Parliament are encouraging it to continue down that path."
"We will continue to assist the bank in its efforts and we will endeavour to increase the possible synergies between our two organisations with the aim of improving aid to developing countries."
"Many of the answers to the questions and remarks that have been put forward, and rightly so, clearly require, or in any event entail or would entail, an updating or amendment of the statutes."
"It is clear that with the current statutes it would not be possible to meet the wishes that have been expressed."
"We could consider various changes, but I am not going to discuss that subject today."
"Suffice it to say that we are considering it, even if, politically, I have the feeling that it will be difficult to achieve."
"For the time being, we can already work towards renewing the mandates, and we can also consider altering the make-up of the Board of Governors, for example by introducing parity between the representatives of the Finance Ministers and the ministers responsible for development."
"Indeed, at the moment, the statutes and the composition of the Board of Governors pose a major problem."
"You did, I think, say as much in your speech, and others have also mentioned it."
"If I might make a personal observation, for this to be possible, the Finance Ministers will have to come to believe that the Development Ministers have a contribution to make to the Board of Governors, so that we can move away from a purely financial way of thinking, which I fear is not the right approach."
"On the other hand, President Maystadt is currently exploring an option that would involve creating a subsidiary of the EIB, dedicated to development, with a Board of Governors made up solely of development representatives."
"That subsidiary could then have the interest-rate subsidy at its disposal and would therefore have much more flexibility to integrate the considerations and requests that have been raised regarding, for example, the social aspect."
"You are right: certain goods and services cannot be commoditised or, in any event, cannot be commoditised under the same conditions as others."
"The environmental aspect, and all issues of this kind, are components that are strictly development matters and that require different financial treatment, which would tend to involve subsidies."
"I broadly agree with everything that has been said, but we must make do with what we have for the time being."
"We must make the EIB work better, contribute to improvements and, at the same time, reflect on its future."
"However, I must point out - and this is extremely important - that all of the teams with which I have worked so far, in both the presidency and management of the EIB - we have already had several meetings - have struck me as showing a modern and open attitude to these possibilities."
"I must say that usually we are faced with much greater conservatism when we want to carry out reforms of this kind."
"It is therefore interesting that within the EIB we can count on this open-mindedness, this flexibility and this mentality."
"I sincerely believe that they largely share the concerns that have been expressed here."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the implementation of the Community action plan FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am of course delighted at the interest that you are taking in the Community action plan on forest law enforcement, governance and trade, FLEGT."
"However, it is not enough to have an action plan: it must still be implemented."
"That is why the Commission adopted proposals for implementing this plan in July 2004."
"These proposals comprise a regulation establishing a voluntary licensing scheme for imports of timber and a recommendation for a directive on a mandate to negotiate partnership agreements with timber-producing countries."
"The Council is currently examining these proposals, and I hope that an agreement will be reached this year."
"In the meantime, we have released EUR 17 million to finance pilot programmes relating to the fundamental aspects of the action plan, in particular to encourage independent monitoring of logging operations, to strengthen local civil society and to encourage the private sector to follow the broad political guidelines set out in the action plan."
"We have also released EUR 3 million to support the international and regional dialogue on improving forest governance and combating illegal logging."
"A technical assistance programme costing EUR 15 million is also expected to start in Indonesia in 2005."
"We have also endeavoured to develop a common approach with the Member States of the European Union."
"As part of our joint work programme, bilateral agencies of European lenders are currently holding informal consultations on FLEGT partnership agreements in potential partner countries, including Ghana, Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Malaysia and Indonesia."
"That should make it easier to hold formal negotiations on partnership agreements once we have a mandate to negotiate on behalf of the Community."
"In the Commission we are also analysing the feasibility of having additional legislation to support the FLEGT action plan, in other words something rather more coercive and proactive."
"The evaluation is in progress and is taking place in close collaboration with the Member States, since many of the potential measures are clearly matters of national competence."
"The options evaluated include public procurement policy, money laundering, stolen goods and anti-corruption legislation, in addition to the feasibility of practical aspects of the new legislation on monitoring imports of illegally logged timber."
"I hope that this work will reach a conclusion during the course of this year."
"To conclude, I would like to say a few words about the calls for a unilateral ban on imports of timber of illegal origin."
"Personally, I perfectly understand the interests behind these calls."
"However, a unilateral ban on importing illegally logged timber into the European Union would not, it seems, provide our customs authorities with an instrument enabling them to confirm the legality of the timber."
"To achieve this, we need the full and complete cooperation of the exporting country, which is why the Commission has proposed a voluntary system based on partnerships with the producer countries."
"These partnerships will combine a whole raft of governance reforms in the producer countries with measures to stop timber of illegal origin from being imported into the European Union, in particular a licensing system for imports."
"This approach would enable us to deal with both the problem of supply in the producer countries and that of demand on our own markets."
". Mr President, every so often I am in touch with Father Hector Turrini and he with me."
"This is in order to keep him alive."
"He is a priest living in Acre in Brazil."
"He and his mission seek to protect the local communities from the loggers."
"Some of his mission have been murdered and he tells me that he expects one day to be killed himself."
"Those are the lengths that illegal loggers will go to for criminal gain at the expense of the environment, local communities and even human life."
"In Papua, Stone Age communities are exposed, their health contaminated, their cultures destroyed by loggers bulldozing their greedy way through rainforests."
"The European Union is still one of the largest importers of illegally sourced timber."
"In Europe we have lost most of our ancient forests and woodlands, to the detriment of our environment and our native species."
"It is not too late to protect the less developed parts of the world and thus protect the two-thirds of the world’s land animals and plant species that live there."
"But we need to move fast."
"Papua New Guinea has already lost 65% of its rainforests."
"Globally, 10 million hectares are lost every day."
"Since 1970 an area of rainforest the size of France has been lost in the Amazon."
"Twenty million people in the Amazon and 12 million in Africa are at risk, not to mention the great apes and other species of mammals and birds found nowhere else in the world."
"In 1998 the G8 agreed that action was needed."
"In 2003 the FLEGT was designed to help developing countries to stop illegal logging and to reduce the trade in illegal products, particularly those that come into the European Union."
"But it is not yet being implemented."
"The Commissioner has helpfully told us what action is being taken."
"I would say to him that every day we delay, lives, livelihoods, environments and species are being lost."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that you are here this evening, Commissioner, because it gives me the opportunity to thank you for your contribution to this morning’s debate on poverty."
"At the same time, I think that this evening’s topic also relates to development and even, as Mr Bowis said, to life and death."
"Mr President, this morning we had a long debate about poverty."
"We talked about how we can resolve it and about governance issues."
"Illegal trade is a key factor in bad governance."
"As we have just heard, the European Union is one of the biggest importers of illegal logging."
"When the governments of developing countries do not get any revenue, do not get their duties, that is money that could have been spent on the Millennium Development Goals."
"This is a very important issue in terms of both development and the environment."
"I am glad that the Commission is taking action."
"I am glad that the FLEGT is going to be implemented, but I am not sure that it goes far enough."
"I am not sure whether any voluntary measures go far enough."
"You said something, which I did not catch, about some kind of ; I am not sure what that means."
"We need something more than voluntary systems and something more than a trade measure."
"We need something that is an environmental measure, using the proper environmental parts of the Treaty."
"We also need something which can be debated in the public domain."
"We do not want something done through trade, with Parliament only having an opinion; we want codecision on this very important issue."
"You are a relatively new Commissioner."
"You have inherited this dossier from your predecessors."
"I hope that you will bring forward proper legislation under the environmental heading and tackle this very important development issue, which is vital if we are ever to make poverty history."
". Mr President, first of all can I say how glad I am that we are having this discussion tonight."
"Illegal logging has not, until now, been given the priority it deserves in the Commission or the Council, despite the fact that half the logging in vulnerable regions is illegal and that every year an area of rainforest the size of Belgium disappears."
"The motion for a resolution deals comprehensively with actions that can be taken to stop illegal logging, but the most important thing is that some action is taken."
"This is a case of the best being the enemy of the good."
"We do not need further delay while we argue how far action should go."
"Voluntary partnership agreements are a good place to start."
"Developing countries will need support to get the necessary certification systems in place, but such support is already available as an element of development cooperation, as the Commissioner has just indicated."
"It is widely believed that voluntary partnerships will not put a stop to all illegal logging."
"I hope, therefore, that the Council and the Commission will clearly flag up right now that further action is anticipated down the line in order to deal with the refusniks who are not prepared to go down the path of voluntary agreements."
"However, there are several things we can do from the European side to make voluntary agreements a success."
"Twenty per cent of timber in Europe is purchased by governments, so Member State public procurement policy has a huge role to play."
"By insisting that governments purchase only legal timber, Member States can wield an enormous carrot, pulling producer countries towards certification."
"So far, unfortunately, only five EU Member States have moved towards a public procurement policy."
"Secondly, we can make use of consumer power."
"Over 70 European timber firms have already signed up to a declaration committing them to trading only in legal wood."
"They are not being altruistic."
"They know that consumers do not want to buy furniture from illegal sources and that people are quite prepared to pay a little bit extra to make sure that their tables and chairs have not added to the destruction of the rainforest."
"I hope, therefore, that we will have no more delay."
"Let us get on with implementing the FLEGT action plan."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, I have noted your answer, but am compelled to express my disappointment at the slow progress of the process of implementing the Forest Law Enforcement, Government and Trade (FLEGT) Plan."
"Wood logged illegally in various parts of the world, such as tropical wood from the Amazon Region and Africa, is known to be traded here in the EU."
"This sometimes leads to serious civil unrest and even, as previously mentioned, to people being killed."
"I was in Brazil recently and had the opportunity to talk with various Brazilian social organisations. They are extremely concerned at this state of affairs, and indeed the government and other authorities have expressed similar concerns."
"I therefore feel that measures must be taken as soon as possible to put a stop to this phenomenon."
"This whole process has far-reaching consequences, both for the countries illegally exporting this wood and for our own countries."
"Consequently, dozens of EU businesses have drawn up a document calling for measures to prevent the continued import of illegally logged tropical wood."
"This practice must be stopped."
"The effects are not only social but also environmental."
"We are playing a part in jeopardising the survival of key forests and biodiversity; we are having a direct influence on the climatic conditions, the people and the employment situation in both the producing countries and the importing countries; and, in so doing, we are damaging the businesses that act legally and destabilising international wood markets."
"The broad goal for the regional or inter-regional bilateral agreements set out in the EU’s action plan on forest law enforcement, governance and trade, which the Commission tabled in 2003, was to contribute towards sustainable development."
"It is therefore impossible to understand why progress has been so slow in implementing the various undertakings under this plan."
"I cannot understand, for example, why a planned study into legislative options, which was to have been presented by the middle of 2004, has not been carried out; why detailed measures intended to ban imports of illegal wood and wood products, regardless of the country of origin, have been shelved; and why a network has not been set up between customs and administrative and legal authorities to facilitate the exchange of information on the illegal wood trade."
"It is therefore crucial that the Commission table a detailed legislative proposal – and it says that it is drawing up such a proposal – that provides more information and that alters the legal basis of the regulation. Parliament can then discuss this proposal and make a positive contribution to this whole process."
"The political will must be there if we are to put a stop to this illegal trade, which facilitates corruption and money laundering."
"Urgent action must be taken."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we look to you to take a lead."
"We look, first of all, for you to get this legislation which, as you said, was approved by the Commission on to the statute books."
"It is now two years since the Commission gave the approval, but where is it?"
"It is not stuck in this Parliament, that is for sure."
"We have no say over the matter."
"It is stuck in Council."
"That logjam needs to be unblocked."
"I hope the UK Presidency will give you support in making sure that happens but, if there are Member States which are standing in the way, which are making life difficult, then we look to you to name and shame them."
"Let us have these NGOs putting pressure on them."
"As Mr Bowis said, people are dying to save the forests and some Member States are just showing reluctance to get a sensible, positive measure of this kind up and running."
"And where were the Commission’s resources?"
"Minimal resources were being devoted to this behind the scenes."
"I am told by some people that you have about one person devoted to making this legislation happen."
"That is pretty minimal."
"Please wave the flags, say you need more."
"Last month you met a delegation of Members of this House to discuss the possibility of introducing legislative options."
"I know that you are not yet convinced, but you explored some very interesting ground then."
"You said you might be able to put some proposals to the Commission in September."
"Can you still stand by that statement?"
"And have you considered the possibility of introducing legislation as a back-up means, to use your own words, as a ‘carrot and stick’ to encourage countries to sign up to voluntary agreements with the threat of a more difficult regime to follow?"
"Commissioner, there is nothing more to be said, except that we all know that the forests are disappearing at a huge rate."
"The best we can possibly hope for is to slow that pace of destruction, but we simply cannot stand by."
"We need you to help us focus our efforts, produce results, and we want to give you as much support as we can in achieving that objective."
"First of all, I do not want there to be any misunderstanding, Mr Davies: I stand by what I said to you at our very useful and interesting meeting."
"I will return in September with proposals and with a new attempt."
"Like you, I find it regrettable that implementation is being delayed."
"We have already debated this problem at length."
"Nevertheless, I have been doing some investigating: in its FLEGT action plan, the European Union sets out its commitment to analyse the available options for supplementary measures, in particular the feasibility of legislation to monitor imports of illegally logged timber into the European Union."
"The progress of this work has been monitored very closely by Parliament, which has invited the Commission to propose legislation of this kind."
"Now, let us be quite clear: the analysis of these options has been delayed, but it is now in progress."
"It is true that we also lack the human resources to deal with this dossier, particularly given that it is extremely difficult, but we are rather short."
"A further reason for the delay, which is not so easy to remedy, is that this analysis remains a delicate and somewhat controversial subject between the various services of the Commission, which have expressed significantly divergent opinions on the best way to proceed."
"I am trying to bring some order to all of this, so that we have a clearer picture."
"I can tell you that the Commission is committed to reviewing and analysing the feasibility of additional legislation to support the FLEGT action plan."
"I will attempt to relaunch this discussion."
"I have already said that this work was held up by delays connected with confirmation of the active participation of the Member States - you are clearly aware of this, as you have spoken of it yourself - and by our decision to concentrate our scarce resources on implementing the voluntary approach set out in the action plan."
"The evaluation is in progress and is taking place in close collaboration with the Member States, since many of the potential measures are matters of national competence."
"The options evaluated include public procurement policy, money laundering, stolen goods and anti-corruption legislation, in addition to the feasibility and practical aspects of the new legislation on monitoring imports of illegally logged timber."
"I hope that this work will be completed during the course of 2005."
"Mrs Hall, you said that we should quite simply ban illegal timber."
"I agree with you, but we also need to find a system that will enable us to check that legal timber is not illegal timber."
"In other sectors triangular trade does exist."
"I have even requested a report from the Joint Research Centre in Ispra on this subject."
"I assume that you are familiar with the problem."
"You should be aware that, during a very short mandate as Commissioner for Research, I went to that Joint Research Centre, where I saw some very interesting things: for example, that is where they produce the satellite maps that can show, virtually down to the nearest square metre, the crimes that are being committed under the gaze of this satellite; they also show reforestation, the quantity of trees lost, and so on."
"These are the kinds of technical and technological resources that we should perhaps consider implementing in order to address your concerns."
"There should not be any problems within the Commission, but I will need to convince a number of Member States to agree to go down that path and to use the means at our disposal, in order to be more coercive."
"As regards the legal base, the Commission considers that the voluntary import licensing system should be implemented on the basis of Article 133 of the Treaty, on commercial policy."
"Parliament and certain Member States do not share this view and suggest that Article 175 of the Treaty, on the environment, would be a more appropriate legal base."
"Why has the Commission retained Article 133, or commercial policy, as the legal base for the regulation establishing a voluntary licensing scheme for imports of timber?"
"The Commission believes that this legal base is the most appropriate, inasmuch as the regulation seeks only to regulate trade in timber products between the European Union and the partner countries."
"Personally, I think the Commission is right;"
"I also believe that Article 133 is the most appropriate."
"However, do not see this as a religious war."
"The most important thing is to be aware of your legitimate concerns - which I fully share - that you expressed to me during our meeting."
"This matter is therefore not closed;"
"I promise you that I will bring all my leadership to bear on it."
"Obviously, I cannot promise you that I will succeed, but I will do all I can to move this matter on in the direction that you want, as I share your concerns in this regard."
"I will ask the Research Centre to consider what techniques might be used, for example to do what you say, because that would be a big step forward."
"The establishment of some kind of certificate of origin would in itself constitute major progress."
"We will still need to convince the Member States, but I promise you that I will return in September with some ideas on the issue."
"I cannot promise you any more than that at the moment, but things are moving and I will also try - although this is not entirely in my hands - to strengthen the taskforce responsible for this matter."
"I have received one motion for a resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Clearing and Settlement in the European Union [2004/2185(INI)] (A6-0180/2005)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearing and settlement are not only the back office of the financial institutions, they are the backbone of the securities market and hence of the capital markets."
"They constitute all the provisions that investors and financial operators need to hold and transfer securities."
"Clearing and settlement do not affect the capital markets: they the capital markets."
"They contribute to the smooth functioning of the financial world and of the economy of the European Union."
"It is widely acknowledged that cross-border clearing and settlement are hindered by a number of barriers, the nature and impact of which vary, as you know."
"This situation considerably increases the costs of clearing and settlement at European Union level in comparison to national systems, and particularly in comparison to the situation in the United States."
"It also increases the risks, legal and otherwise, of cross-border transactions. It therefore clearly constitutes a major hindrance to cross-border investments, to the diversification of portfolios, and so on."
"It is undeniable that we have not yet achieved a European Union market in this field, with the result that we cannot benefit from the advantages of the growth in the European Union that an efficient clearing and settlement system could bring, and that we will not be able to compete effectively at global level."
"To put it bluntly, the objective of all issuers of securities being able to reach all investors is still a long way from being achieved."
"That is why the Commission welcomes the interest that the European Parliament is taking in this issue in responding to the Commission communication of April 2004."
"The Commission’s declared objective is to promote the creation of secure and efficient clearing and settlement systems in the European Union, guaranteeing conditions of fair competition for the various issuers."
"We want to eliminate the obstacles to cross-border clearing and settlement, and thus to enable clearing and settlement service providers, if they so wish, to access other markets in the European Union and provide their services in those markets, within a commonly accepted regulatory and supervisory framework."
"In other words, we want to create a genuine market in clearing and settlement."
"Our aim is to make cross-border clearing and settlement just as cheap, just as efficient and just as secure as the national clearing and settlement systems in the European Union."
"In 2004, the communication launched very extensive consultations on our initial approach to the policy to be adopted in this field."
"Our policy sought not simply to manage the current market situation but to improve the future environment for clearing and settlement in the European Union."
"This environment would enable the operators to implement their strategy, firstly without being hindered by superfluous barriers, and secondly in full compliance with essential public interest objectives such as the security of the systems, fair competition, efficiency and so on. The aim, in cooperation with the private and public sectors, was to eliminate the Giovannini barriers."
"In addition, we considered it essential to ensure that clearing and settlement service providers were not prevented from entering other EU markets and providing their services there, nor faced with unreasonable conditions when they wished to do so, simply because the competent authorities refused to recognise the equivalence of the regulatory systems or supervisory practices of other Member States."
"If this type of barrier were not lifted, the benefits of lifting the Giovannini barriers, which is the responsibility of the private sector, would be diluted or not fully exploited."
"These are complex issues, which is why we are being rigorous about applying our twofold commitment to have ongoing consultation and an in-depth impact assessment."
"With regard to ongoing consultation, we have set up three groups that are working very intensively."
"The CESAME Group monitors and encourages the progress made by the private sector towards lifting barriers."
"As you are aware, this group’s authority and visibility are already indisputable."
"The Legal Certainty Group examines issues related to cross-border legal certainty with respect to legal compatibility when securities are held via intermediaries."
"The Fiscal Compliance expert group (FISCO) examines cross-border differences with regard to fiscal compliance and aims to reduce the burden of fiscal compliance in this field."
"In order to assess the possible impact of any regulatory intervention, a team representing all the services of the Commission is currently conducting a huge impact assessment with a view to gaining a robust instrument, before deciding whether it is appropriate to propose a directive on settlement and clearing and, if so, of course, to determine its precise content."
"This approach corresponds perfectly to the point of view expressed in Mrs Kauppi’s report."
"We think that we will be able to meet the deadline of the first half of 2006 for completing the impact assessment."
"The scale of our commitment to consultation and impact assessment is also illustrated by the contact that we have had with the various rapporteurs responsible for this report."
"Following an initial draft report on the basis of relatively clear-cut theories, all of the parties concerned – the rapporteur, the experts advising the Commission, the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission secretariat and staff – put a great deal of effort into this matter."
"This openness to debate, dialogue and consultation on the part of the many parties involved in this matter is a model of cooperation for the work that we do together and I would like to thank the European Parliament for taking this approach."
". Mr President, it is a pity that Mr McCreevy cannot be here."
"It would have been nice to talk to him personally."
"When I took over this report from Mrs Villiers, who deserves considerable thanks for her thorough approach and hard work, it was quite clear to me what the outcome should be."
"It is even clearer now."
"As we know, the Commission recently produced a Green Paper on financial services."
"It explicitly stated that any new European proposal for financial services legislation and implementing rules should pass a number of economic tests."
"They involve a careful study of the expected economic benefits as well as ‘the extent to which measures facilitate cross-border business and enhance the competitiveness of Europe’s financial markets, while, at the same time, protecting internal stability’."
"The Commission paper also states that there is clear market evidence suggesting that genuine financial integration is under way in many key sectors, such as in clearing and settlement."
"That sentiment is strongly echoed in our daily dealings with the financial services industry."
"The report before you sends a clear signal to the markets that the achievements will not be hampered by unnecessary regulation."
"That message is a result of a broad cross-party compromise and it has the strong backing of market participants."
"Some of the amendments that have been tabled depart from this functional approach and seek to prejudge the need for regulation."
"I appreciate and respect the cultural differences in regulatory philosophy, which lead some to these conclusions."
"However, it would be a serious mistake to apply this philosophy in the case of clearing and settlement."
"We have agreed to wait for the results of the regulatory impact assessment and of the different working groups set up by the Commission, to which you referred, Commissioner, in order to determine whether there is any market failure and whether a directive is the right solution after all."
"More importantly, our clear signal in support of the developments that are taking place in the clearing and settlement markets should not be diluted with confused concerns regarding potential developments sometime in the future, for which no evidence currently exists."
"I refer here to some Members’ wish to implement competition rules for clearing and settlement service providers."
"There is no need for that at this stage, as evidence suggests that markets are, in fact, generally developing towards more open and transparent competition."
"The call for new competition legislation is a misguided call for a short-term directive, with the risk that it will develop into wide-ranging legislation on clearing and settlement before we have the results of the different Commission impact studies."
"Instead, the plenary tomorrow should fully endorse the committee line, that we should focus our efforts on the removal of the ‘Giovannini Barriers’."
"Here I fully support the initiatives of the Commission."
"The removal of such barriers promotes openness, equal access and transparency in the industry."
"We should not seek to implement some arbitrarily defined single utility or service model across the EU, as that would hamper ongoing market-led cross-border integration and consolidation, along with the tangible benefits accruing to customers of clearing and settlement services."
"As the Commissioner has stated, this is not a technical, minor issue."
"It is a very important field of the single market."
"I fully appreciate Commission efforts in this respect."
"I would like to thank all your staff who have worked hard with Parliament in reaching this compromise."
"I hope we can continue this very fruitful cooperation in the future."
"Mr President, clearing and settlement is a subject that looms large in the European debate, although its actual economic importance and its true structural effect on the markets are sometimes overestimated."
"It is certainly a good thing that our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has reached a sound compromise on this subject and I would like to thank Mrs Villiers and also my colleague, Mrs Kauppi, for that."
"This compromise relies above all on market players finding solutions to the problems that arise."
"This is a good approach because this sector has not broken down: it is operating effectively."
"Let us therefore retain free competition as a basic principle, so that this sector can evolve, innovate and, above all, remain competitive at international level."
"We know that the Commission is in the process of assessing the need for legislation in this field."
"I would strongly encourage it to use the impact assessment to demonstrate the necessity, the costs and the benefits of each measure."
"At this stage of the debate, the Commission has a duty to go beyond general explanations and to show all the stakeholders that its actions are resulting in real progress."
"I do not need to remind you that publishing this impact assessment before proposing a text seems to me to be the only valid way of ensuring an open discussion on this topic."
"For its part, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agrees that priority should be given to removing the barriers defined in the Giovannini reports."
"This aspect is worth emphasising, since the Commission, in its communication, showed very little enthusiasm for attacking the legal barriers that are responsible for the excessive expense of cross-border transactions."
"In contrast, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is not convinced of the benefits of greater regulation and rejects the concept of public utility for this sector."
"The report itself prefers the concepts of non-discriminatory access and transparency of pricing structures."
"This too is a good balance and Parliament has a duty to accept it."
"My final point, Mr President, is that the additional amendments tabled in the plenary seek primarily to distort competition between the various different types of institutions and, in fact, to reduce competition in the sector, which must not be the aim."
"In my view, these amendments should therefore be rejected."
". Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, on her well-balanced report, which is supported by most of the political groups and a large majority of the financial services industry."
"She has been active in finding compromises."
"We are still working on it: Mrs Starkevičiūtė from the Liberal Group, Mrs Berès and myself So you can see that the issue of clearing and settlement in the EU is really a ladies’ world."
"Mrs Kauppi took over from another lady, Mrs Villiers, who left the European Parliament to become a Member of the House of Commons in Britain."
"My Group was not very happy with her approach."
"In the explanatory statement of this report you can still find a reminder of her approach, which was very much anti-legislation and principally and vehemently against a directive on clearing and settlement."
"My Group and the PPE-DE Group do not exclude the need for a directive."
"This was also the starting point in the Andria report from a previous parliamentary term."
"We have chosen not to engage in an ideological battle about whether to have legislation, but to list pragmatically the issues to be taken into account politically, to assess the necessity, feasibility and desirability of legislation or other forms of regulation, and to wait for the factual impact assessments that the Commission is currently carrying out before making up our minds definitely."
"This is a more pragmatic and wise approach and I am happy that we managed to achieve it."
"Nevertheless, I wish to repeat some concerns."
"I should like to see a decent system of integrated European supervision – also in relation to competition rules."
"The Commission should keep a close eye on anti-competitive developments that could take place in this fragile clearing and settlement market, particularly in relation to possible consolidation of stock exchanges in Europe."
"I have noted that the Bundeskartelamt has just given the green light for a possible merger of Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange, although this is no longer a real option."
"The UK Competition Commission will very soon deliver its opinion on this possible merger or on the other combination of Euronext and LSE."
"However, we have already raised the question of whether the European Commission should be more proactive and not leave it to the national competition authorities to judge the developments, because the financial markets – in particular the post-market activities – can have an enormous impact on these markets."
"At least we should monitor the various aspects from the point of view of competition and the impact on the smooth functioning of the European financial markets."
"My Group does not exclude competition rules as a consequence."
"Unbundling of different elements in the clearance and settlement value chain is not something we propose at this stage, but I would like to have more assurance that cross-subsidies do not exist in this industry and that custodian banks are free to transfer securities outside their home conglomerates."
"Let me finish by saying that CESR – the Committee of European Securities Regulators – has already been active on this issue, which has not always been welcomed by our committee, because what it was doing was not very transparent."
"It must be said that at least it has been proactive."
"I hope we can improve on the cooperation and the further elaboration of this regulation on clearing and settlement."
". This important financial question has ended up in women's hands in Parliament, but women usually do everything very methodically."
"I believe that we will be able to begin to solve this problem, as it is one of the European Union's economic policy decisions that has already been the subject of lengthy debate, although the results have yet to be seen."
"It is the cause of the backwardness of the European Union's financial markets compared with other financial markets in the world."
"We need to make considerable progress."
"What needs to be done to achieve this progress?"
"Firstly, I want to address market participants."
"They must make mutual concessions and begin to look for common ground and compromise."
"I understand perfectly that it is difficult to renounce those positions that have already been reached as settled systems on a national level, as this is linked to new expenditures, as well as problems and uncertainty in the future."
"For this reason, we the Members of the European Parliament must reach an agreement and clearly show the market the way to develop a clearing and settlement system, so that it is possible to ensure the forecasts and clarify these predictions."
"We must assure that we solve the questions related to price structure clarity, levels and the true rights of access for all participants, as well as those questions related to equal competition in the market."
"These are the three main segments."
"If we manage to reach an agreement (and I trust that we shall), then national governments will be obliged to act more decisively to remove the obstacles indicated in the accounts."
"I doubt whether any national government can afford not to listen attentively to requests from the financial sector."
"After all, they are the governments' main creditors."
"I would also like to address the Commission on this point: you now have sufficient work groups and the power for all technical decisions, legislation and amendments to be adopted as quickly as possible."
"Why do we need to hurry?"
"Now is a perfect opportunity for the European Union's market to become the world leader."
"Probably most specialists know that uncertainty lingers in the US market due to the methods of regulation chosen."
"The countries of Asia are still forming their markets."
"We have a splendid chance to break into the lead, and must not miss such an opportunity."
"Thus, our compromise today and mutual concessions may yield significant material benefits and recognition as a separate, strong power in the world."
". Mr President, I find myself wondering if the Commissioner feels at home in amongst all these women."
"I do not mind admitting that I rather do."
"Recent years in the European Union and the United States have shown that financial markets are very sensitive and sometimes react strongly to external developments."
"The stability of the markets cannot be taken for granted, but the effective management and smooth settlement of transactions on the basis of clear legislation does help to foster it, and so Mrs Kauppi’s report on promoting the efficient settlement of securities transactions does deserve our undivided attention."
"Securities trading is organised in complex ways, and it is also difficult to monitor."
"Solutions imposed by means of a directive do not always produce the desired outcome."
"I should like to stress that solutions must be transparent and verifiable if confidence in the financial markets is to be maintained."
"In this connection, it is vital to monitor the development of aspects of competition."
"The resolution of 2003 contains the urgent request for more studies into aspects of competition with a view to developing a transparent market for the settlement of securities transactions."
"I should like to back the rapporteur’s comments on the ramifications of introducing a directive."
"The aim is to remove the Giovanini obstacles, but those can also be kept in check without a directive, by means of coordination and consultation."
"I should also like to point out that another cross-border issue, the removal of obstacles to cross-border payments, was tackled very successfully at the time and also involved a complex number of organisations, rules and interests, thus demonstrating that it is possible to remove obstacles that appear virtually insuperable."
"It is therefore time for the numerous settlement costs that hamper the internal market for securities in its cross-border activities to be done away with."
"Finally, I should like to thank Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi once again for the work they have done on this directive."
"I think they have produced an excellent piece of work that will help us move forward."
"– Mr President, I would like, in turn, to salute and emphasise the excellent quality of Mrs Kauppi’s work."
"This is a divisive subject, but we have succeeded in setting aside our national interests in order to reach, in my view, a sound and constructive compromise that will enable us to remove the existing barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement transactions."
"This compromise is based on the idea of not pre-empting the results of the impact assessment currently being conducted by the European Commission."
"Nevertheless, we felt it was important to remind the Commission of the principles that should guide the consolidation of this sector, which is so essential to a robust and smoothly functioning European banking system and thus to the financing of our economy."
"First of all, free competition."
"The system must guarantee undistorted competition between the various operators, whatever their size or activities."
"I am pleased that the text does not rule out the separation of activities, when that same separation is advocated in all other industrial sectors as a means of avoiding cross-subsidisation and the dumping that ensues."
"In addition, I hope that the Commission will be able to conduct a proper examination of dominant positions in the market, including in cases where turnover is below the required threshold, but where the impact of such mergers on our economies would certainly justify such an examination."
"Next, transparency: even though our compromise does not, at this stage, allow me to recommend the separation of the various different post-market activities, it is vital to reaffirm that transparent pricing structures are an essential guarantee for those in this sector who might benefit from fair and undistorted competition."
"Next, security, since the major challenge here is of course to ensure that the European financial system is secure and can guard against both systematic and operational risks, and also against the criminal activities of certain parties."
"We therefore refuse, at this stage, to rule out any instrument, directive or free organisation of the market, or any model, with or without separation of activities, that could be used to consolidate post-market activities."
"Nevertheless, I think it is likely that a legislative text will be necessary in order to remove legal and fiscal barriers, if appropriate to adapt the European rules on competition to these activities and, finally, to provide the transparency and accounting separation necessary to the existence of fair competition."
"I will conclude by saying that it is time to make progress in this field, because European consolidation is underway, without supervision."
"Having successfully harmonised the markets, we urgently need to harmonise the post-market sector if we want to benefit from all our work in the context of the financial services action plan."
"Mr President, thank you for your remarks and comments on this important report."
"Your contributions clearly confirm the importance of the issue, the essential role of cooperation between the public and private sectors, and also the need for an in-depth analysis prior to any subsequent decision on the possibility of legislation."
"I think that this approach is perfectly in line with that of the Commission in the context of the internal market."
"New legislation is only justified if the social and economic benefits are clearly established."
"We are pleased that we will be able to continue the discussions and the exchange of information with Parliament as we receive more specific results from the various expert groups and from our impact assessment exercise."
"To conclude, the Commission is satisfied with the final report that will be put to the vote in tomorrow’s plenary sitting."
"We think it is balanced and open."
"It supports our impact assessment exercise and is open to any well-founded new proposals that the Commission might put forward on the basis of the results of the impact assessment."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on progress made towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania with a view to the next progress report."
". Mr President, it is a great pleasure to be with you here at this hour."
"I am sure we all agree that quality compensates for quantity."
"The urgent item concerns the elections that took place in Bulgaria on 25 June this year."
"It is in the interest of Bulgaria to rapidly form a stable coalition government capable of delivering on the reforms necessary for EU accession."
"Whichever coalition is formed, work must continue in Bulgaria towards meeting all commitments made during the accession negotiations."
"We understand that there is a broad consensus across the party political spectrum on this objective."
"The new government should present an EU integration programme for implementation on all pending issues."
"I also note that President Parvanov yesterday signed a degree recalling the Parliament for Monday, 11 July, even though, under the Constitution, he had until 25 July to do so."
"So, encouragingly, there are serious efforts to keep the preparations moving on and to limit as far as possible the interruption caused by the elections."
"We also understand that there are plans to keep the Parliament working through the summer holiday period to allow progress in the key areas of accession preparations."
"In my speech to the Bulgarian Parliament some weeks ago, I encouraged the members of the Bulgarian Parliament to use part of their summer holidays for urgent legislative work and take off for the Black Sea coast only once the EU-related work has been done."
"I am glad that the response was positive and glad to find this kind of European motivation in Bulgaria."
"It is the sovereign decision of the European Parliament to decide on the granting of observer status."
"However, representatives from Bulgaria and Romania can play a key role in informing their citizens on EU matters, as well as informing us about their countries."
"That is a case in point of the evolving European democracy, which is a very dear objective to this House."
"Since the closing of negotiations in December 2004, both Bulgaria and Romania have continued to make progress in meeting the accession requirements."
"However, the Commission’s ongoing monitoring exercise clearly shows that they can spare no efforts."
"Ensuring compliance with the accession requirements by January 2007 will pose a real challenge over the next 17 months."
"Every day, every week and every month counts for both Bulgaria and Romania."
"For Bulgaria, progress in the fields of justice and home affairs, the environment and agriculture will be of decisive importance."
"Similarly, in the case of Romania, progress in the fields of justice and home affairs, especially the reform of the judiciary system and the fight against corruption, competition and state aid, the environment and agriculture will be crucial."
"In June, the Commission sent early warning letters or ‘yellow cards’ to both Bulgaria and Romania in which we indicated areas of serious shortcomings."
"There were five such areas for Bulgaria and seven for Romania."
"In conclusion, for the moment the jury is still out."
"The Commission will continue to monitor both countries’ progress closely and there is a constant flow of Commissioners and Commission officials to both Bulgaria and Romania."
"They are there not for fun but for serious monitoring and the Commission relies on its characteristic objectivity and professionalism in the monitoring exercise."
"The next significant step will be the comprehensive monitoring report, which will be issued on 25 October."
"That will be an extremely crucial checkpoint for both Bulgaria and Romania."
"I will underline what both President Barroso and I have said, which reflects the position of the Commission."
"If necessary, the Commission would not hesitate to recommend the use of the safeguard clauses of postponement provided for in the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are certain things I would like to reiterate in order to firmly repudiate the insinuations and deliberate disinformation spread in recent days by the Liberals and Social Democrats about the reasons for this debate."
"Why are we having this debate?"
"We are having it because the Conference of Presidents, having already decided to invite representatives from Romania and Bulgaria to come, one year ahead of their countries’ accessions, to observe the work of this House and take part in it, suddenly reviewed the decision and – the Social Democrats having changed their minds – overturned it."
"We are having this debate because, when the Conference’s resolution was revised, a date was set that anticipated the Commission’s progress report and hence also the naming of a final date for the countries’ accession, which means that they, and the countries that joined us in 2004, are not being treated equally."
"We are also having it because the President of this House failed, on Monday, to inform us of the fact that he had already sent them a letter of invitation."
"The issue has never been about when the accession of Bulgaria and Romania is to take place."
"The political decision has been taken."
"Now that we have decided what to do, nobody wants to apply the brakes."
"Like most of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I voted in favour of the accession date for Romania and Bulgaria being 1 January 2007; what happens after that has also been decided."
"The facts of the situation do, though, lead me to regard the decision by the Conference of Presidents as both premature and wrong."
"I find it particularly regrettable that the President, on Monday, withheld from us important information concerning his actions."
"Nobody wants to disinvite anyone we have already invited, and we look forward to having them working with us. Our sole concern was and is with the issue of whether we take ourselves seriously, of whether the matter in hand is more important than the date, of whether equal treatment is more important than the small change of day-to-day politics."
"The question of how we treat one another and the candidates for accession is too important to be handled with so much emotion, and to be the subject of so much disinformation, as we have seen from our competitors and rivals in this House since Monday."
". I am going to begin by refuting what my fellow Member, Mr Karas, said concerning disinformation."
"I come from Hungary, one of the new Member States that was able to participate as an observer in the work of Parliament from the time the Accession Treaty was signed."
"We would like the same to happen now, too."
"Given that both Romania and Bulgaria signed the Treaty of Accession on 25 April, the road has been open for them too – in my view – from that day onwards."
"The other comment I would like to make to my fellow Member, relates to ’how seriously we take ourselves’."
"The Conference of Presidents – a body democratically elected by us in this House – decided on 9 June to send the letter of invitation to the representatives of the two countries in question."
"I therefore think that we will be taking ourselves seriously if we keep our word regarding this letter, and actually welcome our new colleagues warmly to the Parliament from 26 September."
"Aside from this, it is my opinion that on 25 October, when the monitoring report is issued, it would be a pleasure (for you too, I am sure,) if our fellow representatives were able to participate as observers in the work of the sitting."
"After all, it is only by doing this that they will be able to take home first-hand news of areas where there are still shortcomings."
"Only by being here with us will they be able to obtain first-hand information regarding their progress in eliminating the shortcomings mentioned by Commissioner Olli Rehn, on the legislative work under way all summer in Bulgaria, and on the implementation of existing legislation."
"If they know what the problem is and how to solve it; if they know what proposals are being put forward (or reservations expressed) concerning them by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) or European Democrats or by the other side; if they are here and we are able to work together with them."
"This is why I think we should welcome them, and I agree with what Commissioner Olli Rehn said regarding preparedness."
"Eighteen months is indeed a long time."
"We had less time, but the biggest reservation concerning these two countries continues to be that they are less advanced in terms of meeting the accession requirements than the ten countries that most recently acceded."
"For this reason, I think that in their case eighteen months is not a long time."
"By the time of their accession on 1 January 2007, they must learn how to do the work that we do here, taking each other’s words into account and taking each other seriously."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in matters relating to enlargement, I do believe that quality should matter more than quantity."
"The development and stability of the continent of Europe is to a large degree dependent on the simultaneous deepening and enlargement of the European Union."
"Particularly in the Balkans, every extra square metre of European soil that sustains democracy, the rule of law and human rights also adds to the space in which conflicts can be peacefully resolved."
"Enlargement must not, however, be taken too fast."
"Every country must fulfil the requisite accession criteria: not only on paper but also in practice, in a reality that the people can apprehend."
"Even though Bulgaria and Romania have made great strides since the fall of their Communist regimes, I find it regrettable that neither has yet developed much in the way of a political culture."
"There are still too many problems involved in doing away with the cumbersome bureaucracy, despite the positive efforts that have been made to that end."
"What is worthy of criticism is the failure to make much headway in reforming the justice system, the widespread corruption in the police and the judiciary, considerable shortfalls in the integration of minorities, the poor economic development and social and environmental problems."
"The shocking success of the extreme right-wing Ataka party in the Bulgarian elections, which got into parliament with 8% of the vote, has done nothing to improve the overall political climate."
"It is to be feared that this will make the task of forming a government more difficult and further slow the progress of reforms."
"What is important is that we send a signal to those who hold responsibility in both countries."
"Unlike most members of my group, I am persuaded that we should invite observers to this House only after the progress report has appeared and a decision on accession has been taken."
"We should make clear to the governments in Bucharest and Sofia the fact that major reforms are still needed and that the sprint down the home straight to accession will not be accomplished without effort."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we called for this debate was that we wanted an opportunity to discuss at what point it would be right to invite observers."
"Let me start by pointing out that it was not the plenary that took this decision, but the Conference of Presidents."
"This is a highly political decision, and so there cannot fail to be some doubts about this."
"The proper place for decisions such as this one is in this plenary and in broad daylight, and it is not very democratic for them to be taken by the Conference of Presidents and behind closed doors."
"Turning to the matter in hand, Mr Horáček is quite right to draw attention to the continuing deficiencies in the processes of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession."
"We all want Romania and Bulgaria to become Member States of the EU; about that there is not the slightest doubt."
"If, though, we impose conditions on their accession, we must ourselves take those conditions seriously."
"I would add that one reason why the results from the French and Dutch referenda were so devastating was that many members of the public get the impression that, although we attach conditions to a country’s accession, we do not ourselves take those conditions seriously."
"That is why the enlargement process has got completely out of hand; the fact is that we cannot cope with enlarging the EU and deepening it both at the same time, and we must now be very firm in giving priority to deepening it."
"Even so, it sent the wrong message to invite these countries to send observers over a year before an accession the date for which has not yet been fixed."
"It is, after all, quite possible – as the Commissioner himself has just hinted – that accession will be put back a year in consequence of the situation that Mr Horáček has described so accurately."
"Are the observers, then, to be with us in this House for two and a half years?"
"That would surely be inappropriate, to say the least, and so the right thing to do would indeed be to take the decision only once the progress report has been produced. It is for that reason that we want to discuss that now."
"There is no question that the accession process must not be allowed to come to a halt, given that all of us believe Romania’s accession is necessary as the only possible means of providing this people, who have suffered so many trials and tribulations, with reasonable prospects for the future at last."
"It can provide a solution to many as yet unresolved problems; many Romanian children – both Roma and non-Roma – may be freed from the dangers of poverty as a result; environmental protection, including the issue of Rosia Montana (Verespatak) may – I hope – be resolved in a European manner."
"Perhaps Romania’s Hungarian minority may even gain independence."
"Parliament must play a key role in this process."
"We must be rigorous in calling Romania to account, as problems are not solved by sweeping them under the carpet."
"The Commission’s progress report in October provides the last chance to resolve any dilemmas that persist."
"The issue is such a serious one and our task so laden with responsibility that we cannot allow it to become the subject of political jousting between parties."
"The accession process must not be allowed to stall."
"At the same time, accession is only really meaningful if every citizen of Romania gains from it – including the 1.7 million-member Hungarian minority."
"For this to become a reality in everyday life, and not just a pretty catch-phrase, compliance with the accession commitments is crucial."
"It is this that will bring the much-needed modernisation to Romania at every level."
"This is why your responsibility is huge, Commissioner, when preparing the report, and so is ours as a Parliament, when it comes, we hope, to deciding once again on the report."
"These are the really crucial issues."
"As you said, Commissioner, ‘every day, every week, every month counts’."
"Mr President, I very much regret that we are having this debate at this time, as it sends a confusing and essentially negative message to the people of Bulgaria."
"I must say that, as Parliament’s rapporteur on Bulgaria, I was not consulted or even informed about any suggestion that parliamentary observers should be delayed or indeed that some fresh emphasis should be placed on the possibility of delaying Bulgaria’s accession until 2008."
"At the last meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in Brussels on 21 June, attended by Commissioner Rehn, I asked for and received an assurance of the commitment to the timetable for enlargement, in spite of the failure of the European Constitution."
"I recall the Commissioner’s words that Bulgaria and Romania were the last enlargement, not the next enlargement."
"Their accession is guaranteed."
"The question, perhaps, is when exactly?"
"We all recognise that much still needs to be done if Bulgaria is to be ready by 2007, but the task is eminently achievable."
"The one mechanism for delaying accession is the safeguard clause."
"In the case of Bulgaria, unlike Romania, this would require a unanimous decision of the Council."
"I see no merit, therefore, in raising any false spectre of delay."
"I remain optimistic that Bulgaria will accede on 1 January 2007."
"I have always underlined the need to ensure that each country is dealt with on its own merits and that the fates of Bulgaria and Romania should not be inextricably tied together."
"It is widely accepted that Bulgaria has fewer problems than Romania."
"I am only too aware that the elections in Bulgaria on 25 June have produced an unclear result."
"The process of building a government coalition is urgently under way, with a view to convening the Parliament on 11 July."
"The debate tonight merely adds to uncertainty, both in government circles and among the citizens of Bulgaria."
"They are even beginning to think they are not wanted."
"I strongly reassured them."
"What is required in Bulgaria is continuity, stability, commitment and clarity, not uncertainty and negativism."
"On the question of the observers – and I hope you will bear with me as the rapporteur for Bulgaria – I agree with the Commissioner and thank him when he says that the arrangements for the observers are a matter for this Parliament."
"It was confirmed to me in writing just two weeks ago on 16 June by the leader of the PPE-DE Group."
"He said as follows: ‘The Conference of Presidents has decided on its last meeting to invite the observers from both accession countries Romania and Bulgaria to join the European Parliament for the September II session in Strasbourg’, which means from 26 September onwards."
"Observers from last year’s ten accession states had been invited to join us as soon as possible after signature of the Accession Treaty."
"That is the precedent we should follow."
"Any other decision would send an unhelpful signal to our Bulgarian and Romanian friends."
"I very much look forward to welcoming them here in September as observers and as full Members from January 2007."
"Mr President, our Parliament overwhelmingly approved the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria to full membership of the European Union during our plenary session in April."
"The week before, our Parliament’s JPC delegation, chaired by my group colleague Mr Podestà, visited our Romanian parliamentary colleagues and met with the President, the Prime Minister and the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers."
"On 9 June the Conference of Presidents sent the invitation to the Romanian and Bulgarian Parliaments to nominate their European Parliament observers and for them to take up their duties on 26 September."
"Last week I was invited to return to Bucharest to address the appointed observers."
"I regret the European Parliament appears just now not to have maintained a consistent common approach, and that my own Group at present may not be wholly associated with the joint motion for a resolution to be voted tomorrow."
"I have had the privilege of belonging to the PPE Group for over 15 years."
"It is a privilege I firmly intend to preserve."
"I hope, even at this hour, we may come back to a common agreed position."
"We have given our word, expressed in our name by the President of our Parliament to the observers, that they should take up their duties from 26 September."
"If we were to go back on our word, what signal would that send to Romania; to those brave statesmen, politicians and public servants who are struggling to bring democracy, economic, administrative and legal reforms?"
"They regard the prospect of EU membership as the guarantee that they will achieve their goal."
"Let us remember the difficult history of these countries."
"In Bucharest, before the Senate House, opposite the Royal Palace, there is a memorial inscribed with the words ‘Glorie martirilor nostri’ dated December 1989."
"It commemorates the fact that over 1 000 young people, students and soldiers lost their lives demonstrating and defending the demands for freedom."
"How should we honour their memory?"
"This moment of uncertainty in the EU is a time for our Parliament to show courage and perseverance."
"We have given our word."
"We intend to abide by it and welcome the Romanian observers as promised on 26 September this year so that together we may work for a further successful enlargement of our European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we are in favour of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria."
"The speed of the accession process depends solely on the candidate countries and we respect the efforts currently being made in Sofia and Bucharest to this end."
"With regard to the admission of observers to Parliament, however, I would echo precisely what Mr Nassauer said."
"We must step down from our ivory tower and consider the consequences of the decisions that we, and in particular the authorities of this Parliament, are taking."
"It is quite clear that we cannot accept observers prior to the Commission’s report, and that we cannot accept them for Romania and Bulgaria earlier than we did for the other accession countries, that is a year before the proposed date of accession."
"That is why we formally support the motion tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"We consider it to be extremely opportune in both political and legal terms."
"I would add, Mr President, Commissioner, that in general I think that, given the crisis that Europe is currently experiencing and the distrust and suspicion that many people are showing towards the European institutions, now is the time for consolidation and reflection, not a headlong rush forward."
"That is why I said myself that I was astounded at the way in which the Commission prepared the negotiating mandate with Turkey."
"I think that the European institutions are living a thousand leagues away from the reality of the European people."
"We must rejoin the reality of the European people, and to do that, Commissioner, we need to re-examine the negotiating mandate that you prepared with Turkey and, in order to re-examine it and to give us time to do so, we need to delay the opening of negotiations."
"Consolidation will mean more Europe."
"A headlong rush will mean a dispersed Europe."
". Mr President, the matter discussed this evening is a sovereign decision of the Parliament and I have, on behalf of the Commission, nothing to add to the points presented previously."
"I have received five motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0131/2005) by Marie Anne Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE +) (COM(2004)0621 – C6-0127/2004 – 2004/0218(COD))."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, most importantly, the rapporteur, Mrs Isler Béguin, for her detailed and constructive report."
"My thanks also to the honourable members of the Committee on Budgets and Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives for their contribution to the report on LIFE +."
"LIFE + is the financial instrument for applying Community environmental policy proposed by the Commission for the period 2007-2013."
"Alongside application, the programme has resources for improving environmental governance and for financing information and communication actions."
"This proposal is a positive arrangement for financing the environment."
"As the reports which the Commission prepared for the Council made clear, LIFE + makes provision for an average annual increase in financing of 21% compared with current levels."
"In addition, it makes provision for the new programme to shift from a project-based approach to an approach based on national programmes. This safeguards greater flexibility for the Member States, so that they can deal with their most pressing environmental needs."
"This approach implies even greater subsidiarity than at present."
"Thus the regional and local factors which often lead the way in the application of environmental legislation will be able to have their say on the planning and application of the programme."
"I am aware of Parliament's evaluation of the Commission proposal."
"However, the Commission considers that most spending on the environment can be better financed by the financing institutions which are very strong financially, by which I mean programmes for the Structural Funds and rural development programmes."
"So far there have been three noteworthy developments in our efforts to safeguard the integration policy: firstly, the adoption on 21 June of the regulation on rural development; secondly, the strategic guidelines on rural development relating to the regulation, in which clear reference is made to Natura 2000, and thirdly, the strategic guidelines on regional policy which the Commission adopted last Tuesday and which concern the protection of nature and species."
"Consequently, the Commission is implementing the policy of integration in the environmental sector."
"LIFE + will not be able to undertake projects of the scale and breadth for which provision is made in the programmes in question, which is why LIFE + is being called on to supplement these programmes by focusing on the development of environmental policy, as often called for by Parliament, by supporting the exercise of policy, a point on which Parliament has frequently expressed an interest, by improving environmental governance with the participation of civil society and by disseminating information, so that European citizens can understand the objective and repercussions of environmental legislation."
"These objectives coincide with the wishes expressed by Parliament and, through it, by European citizens, which is why I consider that the Commission proposal is the right proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly allow me, as rapporteur, to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety as a whole for the work that it has done."
"I should also like to thank its chairman for the support that he gave us in our work and, above all, the shadow rapporteurs, who really helped me to seek a compromise in order to propose something sensible and substantial."
"I should like very sincerely and officially to thank the whole of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for following my strategy, so as to endow the Union with the necessary means to fulfil its environmental policies."
"Overall, I believe that we have succeeded in gaining recognition, beyond the confines of our committee, for the fact that words are no longer enough for the environment and that financial means are required, as they are for every other policy."
"I believe that, on that issue too, the message has got through."
"I should, moreover, like to point out that, during a debate this week, one of your colleagues, Commissioner, reminded us that we should not lose sight of the main issue."
"He is quite right and we are not losing sight of the main issue, as the main issue, today, really is the protection of our planet, because it is unique, because it is fragile, because it is suffering from the pressure we put on it, and we know this full well."
"Today, with the European Union, we have decided to stop the haemorrhaging: we have to save what can be saved and restore what has been damaged."
"The European Union is aware of the challenge that it has set itself."
"It has already done battle and emerged victorious: Kyoto is the battle that it won, a battle for its signature, initially, and a battle for ratification later on."
"We can hope today that the G8 will also shoulder its responsibilities with the European countries that are going to push for measures to be taken against climate change."
"Neither, Commissioner, must there be any weakening of the Union’s resolve to protect the environment."
"On that issue, we have been rather anxious since Monday, since your president, Mr Barroso, made his statements asserting that the environment and the strategies related to it are too costly."
"We believe that this really is a poor assessment."
"The damage, we know, is global."
"It is happening and the longer we wait to intervene, the higher the price that we will pay, as we all know."
"It is therefore up to us, Parliament, to convince the Council and the Commission that, even in lean times, investing in the environment is, as it were, a prudent subscription to an insurance policy, indeed a life-insurance policy, against the threats weighing on our environment."
"This report on LIFE + is without doubt very important since it concerns the sinews of war: it is a financial instrument."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety supports LIFE +, but we wish to improve it and we have already made that known."
"The former LIFE programme, with its strands on nature, the environment and third countries, had unleashed innovative political impetus and had shown that investing in the environment was the path to follow in the context of sustainable development, and that it created jobs."
"With the new LIFE programme, the Commission is counting on the environment, as you explained, being integrated in the various policies."
"This is a good thing, we cannot deny it, but we are not convinced of the usefulness of delegating environmental policies to the Member States."
"It is well known that, often, the main issue for the Member States is not the environment."
"We will not, therefore, obtain results by renationalising the environment."
"On the other hand, the European Union has to support NGOs, because they are absolutely irreplaceable and because they must be able to continue to carry out their work, which, as you mentioned, is in everyone’s interest."
"Finally, we believe, as you are well aware, that the most overlooked project is Natura 2000."
"On that issue, in fact, we have decided to make everyone aware that Natura 2000 certainly has its costs but that it is not a bottomless pit: it is money that will be channelled into original local development based on respect for the environment and on respect for the people who work the land."
"You explained to us that you were kicking things into touch and that it was the responsibility of the other policies, of the other funds to integrate Natura 2000."
"We waited precisely until the end of the discussions on the Structural Funds, on rural development, to find out whether in fact we had the full guarantees that Natura 2000 would be taken into consideration."
"I can tell you that the glass is half empty or half full, depending on how you look at it."
"With regard to the Fund for Rural Development, we are very hopeful, but we know that it only concerns compensation, which is very positive because financial compensation is needed."
"With regard to the Structural Funds, we know that it concerns investment."
"In fact we are well aware that investment is something that is strictly defined and that we do not need to build any new roads to go and discover biotopes."
"There is therefore a significant shortcoming."
"That is why we propose to take a third of the sum that you agreed, that is of the EUR 21 billion, and to add it to LIFE + so that Natura 2000 can live and can genuinely serve to protect our environment, just as we are committed to doing."
". Mr President, before commenting on the characteristics of this project, I would like to express my thanks not just to Mrs Isler Béguin, but also to Mrs Lienemann, the other shadow rapporteurs and the officials and advisors who are working extremely hard to reach a consensus on this project."
"We have achieved extraordinary consensus in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety: everybody has introduced their points of view and, although there are apparently not many amendments, a new spirit has been introduced and the LIFE programme has been enriched, in cooperation with the Commission."
"How has it been enriched?"
"In my opinion, we have introduced several new aspects."
"Firstly, this project has placed great emphasis on the management of natural resources."
"It is also of great educational importance in terms of teaching how to govern and manage the environment."
"Furthermore, we have insisted on an institutional presence in the form of the municipalities and regions as local authorities that have to re-evaluate their resources."
"In this regard, I would also like to stress another element: the introduction of landscapes deserving of respect that have not been integrated into the Natura 2000 list, such as certain rivers, but which may be important shared spaces."
"There is another innovation: the concept has been introduced, and the idea strengthened, of international projects and cross-border projects."
"Why?"
"Because natural spaces are usually in border zones and in mountainous areas."
"Rivers are a clear case in point: the logical thing would be to create a LIFE for rivers one day, because rivers cross many countries."
"Furthermore, I must say something else: we have created a market spirit for Natura 2000."
"We believe that, in this case, we must imitate United States policy by creating banks for wetlands and banks for natural areas, so that the Member States can compensate proprietors, creating, shall we say, an area of exchange of ownership for the Natura 2000 zone."
"In this way, the companies and many others who also have to take initiatives on the ground may contribute economically to compensating, by means of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, for their passage through those protected territories. They may do so through active and positive policies for the conservation of the natural environment, funded by private bodies and by institutions."
"This is therefore not just another LIFE programme; it is a project based on a consensus which I believe has been guided by great common sense;"
"I therefore congratulate everybody."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, in my turn, to thank Mrs Isler Béguin, our rapporteur, as well as all of my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the shadow rapporteurs, who have endeavoured to present to this House, as my fellow Member, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, has just said, a point of view that is, if I may say so, unanimous or in any case likely to receive majority support."
"LIFE + and the LIFE programme constitute an extremely important part of our environmental policy, because they are the only budgetary tool that the European Union has released for its environmental policies."
"It is true that we are often criticised at European level by our fellow citizens for enacting directives, constraints and rules, which is quite legitimate and must be done."
"Europe has done a great deal for environmental policies, but people often say to us, ‘You impose constraints upon us, but you do not release many funds to support us in implementing the policies concerned’."
"There are therefore shows of resistance and difficulties requiring the Union to provide financial support for implementing policies."
"Support tools do exist, such as the integrated policies, on which progress has been made for a number of years."
"I will come back to that in connection with the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy."
"Yet we also require specific tools."
"The LIFE programme has already shown its effectiveness in many areas."
"I would stress the need to use LIFE to breathe life into the major framework directives, such as the one on water or our programme to combat the greenhouse effect."
"Mrs Isler Béguin is, however, right to say that the core issue of our debate is Natura 2000."
"It is positive that we have succeeded in having Natura 2000 taken into account in the EAFRD."
"The reality is, however, that a whole series of expenditure, which is vital for managing the geographical area targeted and for implementing the directive, cannot be included here."
"This is the case for two types of expenditure: those concerning the operation and those concerning certain geographical areas."
"I am thinking in particular of those areas that are not directly included in agricultural areas– wet zones, areas that are slightly separated from them and so on – and that cannot receive funding under mechanisms linked to the Regional Development Fund and the Fund for Rural Development."
"We therefore need something in addition: we have proposed that 35% of the sum that you, Commissioner, have put at EUR 21 million be devoted to the management of Natura 2000, within the framework of the LIFE programme."
"I believe in any case that a specific budget attached to LIFE is a determining and essential factor for this House."
"Furthermore, given that the Commission, since it was newly formed, has always been at pains to tell us that it would pay great attention to the views of Parliament, the wide agreement within Parliament on this issue ought to lead the Commission to support our points of view."
"Mr President, I should like, in my turn, to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Isler Béguin, for the quality of this collaborative work and her energetic commitment to this issue."
"During the June part-session, our Parliament, in its resolution on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union, sent out a very clear political signal for protecting the planet, nature and biodiversity."
"It is essential to ensure the smooth operation of the Natura 2000 network, the core issue of this debate."
"Mrs Lienemann has just reminded us of this."
"The experts in the Commission have, moreover, calculated that Natura 2000 will need EUR 21 billion over seven years."
"We are aware that the Fund for Rural Development and the Structural Funds are not going to meet all of these needs."
"We therefore have to strengthen LIFE +, the specific financial instrument for the environment with which we have been equipped since 1992."
"I should therefore like to address two main criticisms to the Commission, which I share with our rapporteur."
"The first concerns the initial sum of EUR 300 million, which is, of course, hugely insufficient."
"Behind this battle of figures, it is Europe’s desire to take up major challenges such as air quality, water quality, spatial planning and sustainable waste management that is at stake here."
"The second criticism is as follows: I believe that the European Commission must not offload its responsibilities with regard to the environment."
"The strategy of integrating the environment in all of the Union’s policies has its limits, Commissioner."
"That is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support Amendments 42, 43 and 44."
"The European Parliament will always support you in opposing this kind of environmental Europe, an environmental Europe that in certain respects is in decline, and in all respects is optional, and which is imposed by certain Member States that appear to have chosen to withdraw into themselves."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to add my own thanks to the rapporteur for all the work she – together with the other Members – has done, but I should nevertheless like to make a few observations concerning the proposal on which we will be voting later."
"It would appear that some Members expect a great deal of support for nature policy from the European Union."
"I share this hope, for I too take the view that the European Union, by creating ecological networks, can make a positive contribution to our continent."
"We should not, however, pin all our faith on Europe, certainly where the funding of these Natura 2000 sites is concerned, for these sites are, after all, designated by the national authorities, assisted by European experts, and so it is acceptable that some of the funding for preserving them should come from the European budget."
"Ultimately, though, the primary responsibility for them lies with the Member States."
"In my view, it is very understandable that the funding should follow need, and various amendments underline this."
"We should only do and fund at European level what Member States cannot manage for themselves."
"We should not reverse the position by wanting to pay for everything and checking afterwards to see whether the Member States would like to make a contribution."
"I would therefore call for Member States to be given a greater role in funding and for them to be helped out only as and when EU funding is actually justified."
"Mr President, the G8 leaders in Scotland are exercised about the sustainability of our world."
"If they travelled a little way to the Cairngorm Mountains and the Abernethy Forest Reserve, they would see one of Europe's Natura 2000 sites, covering 13 000 hectares of ancient Caledonian pinewood, moorland, lochs and mountains, which is the habitat for rare species such as the capercaillie and the black grouse."
"The former, which was previously thought to be the bird most likely to become extinct in the United Kingdom within 15 years, is now doubling its numbers."
"The reserve, with its osprey centre, attracts some 100 000 visitors a year and GBP 1.7 million a year and provides 87 jobs in a previously poor rural economy."
"We are seeing such results all over Europe, from Scotland to Spain to Germany."
"The Iberian lynx in Spain has been saved by Natura 2000."
"In Brandenburg, where the great bustard population had fallen from 4 000 in the 1930s to a few hundred, 9 500 hectares of monoculture have transformed its prospects and also brought economic benefit to an economically depressed area."
"We are talking about our European heritage, which we have a duty to protect."
"LIFE + is the new financial instrument that, with the Structural Funds and Fund for Rural Development, will enable Natura 2000 to continue to succeed."
"On 8 June, Parliament voted for ‘a significantly strengthened LIFE + programme’."
"I know that the budget will not be easy this year, but we pick up the proposal for a ring-fenced amount of EUR 21 billion over seven years in that resolution of 8 June."
"We suggest how LIFE + could be significantly strengthened."
"LIFE III, with its three components of nature, environment and third countries, has been a success in all respects, but particularly perhaps in the Natura 2000 sites of LIFE Nature."
"LIFE + will take this forward and this report will help that process."
"I hope that the Commission will respond supportively, constructively and imaginatively."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the intention is that LIFE + should be the sole financial instrument for the environment from 2007 onwards."
"It is no bad idea to combine in one single environmental instrument the various programmes that have supported such environmental measures as actions within the scope of the Forest Focus Regulation and supported non-governmental organisations and local and regional authorities."
"As one who is involved with the budget, I am particularly glad that we can take it as read that this operation will result in greater efficiency and effectiveness."
"We know that, in order to be effective, energy policy must be implemented at ground level, throughout the EU and on a local basis everywhere."
"For that reason, although the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are not open to criticism, it is urgently necessary, if we really do want the funding of environmental policy to add indisputable value to Europe, that the use to which the funds are put be effectively monitored."
"Such monitoring will involve not only codecision by Parliament on the multiannual programmes, but also, and of necessity, evaluation at short intervals, in order to make it possible to make adjustments without delay."
"The ‘LIFE-Nature’ part has been as good as dropped from the Commission proposal for LIFE, and with it has gone the funding for Natura 2000 measures."
"That is something we cannot accept."
"The Commission’s proposal for the management of the Natura 2000 areas to be paid for out of the Fund is no bad idea either in view of what the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has seen of the problems inherent in such a – essentially competition with other objectives laid down in various funds."
"We eventually came to an agreement that LIFE + should be used to support those Natura 2000 areas that are not covered by one of the funds."
"It remains to be seen how far this approach, which is at once perceptive, realistic and motivated by solidarity, will get us."
"Despite this House, yesterday, prompted by the Committee on Regional Development, having struck every single reference to Natura 2000 out of the Structural Funds Regulations, I do expect not only our Committee, but also the NGOs and the Commission, to take the initiative – or go on the offensive – in order to persuade people."
"– Mr President, the LIFE + environmental programme is crucial for supporting the implementation and development of environmental policy."
"It therefore has to act as a stimulus for implementation and as a catalyst for innovation and change, and thus enable action to be taken across the board at European level on the priority areas."
"Based on our successful experience with the current LIFE programme, LIFE + has to be the vehicle for assessing and monitoring conservation status, for drafting action plans on the recovery of species and for actions linked to the operation of the Natura 2000 European network."
"Demonstration projects concerning the establishment and protection of Natura 2000 should continue to be funded since they provide European added value."
"Environmental policy, however, amounts to more than just Natura 2000."
"That is why I am against Amendment 35, which proposes allocating 90% of the LIFE + programme to the funding of Natura 2000."
"LIFE + should actually adopt an approach that provides proportionate support for the four crucial subject areas in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme: climate change, the preservation of biodiversity, the environment and health, and the protection of natural resources."
"Finally, I should like to say that I share the rapporteur’s opinion that projects must continue to be selected at Community level to ensure that they provide European added value."
"– Mr President, I believe that words truly need to be turned into deeds, because delivering speeches about saving the planet and sustainable development is something that we do constantly in this House and elsewhere."
"Unfortunately, when the time comes for us to equip ourselves with the means to act, there is no one to be seen."
"Parliament is not in agreement with the European Commission, which has made choices with which we cannot concur."
"Commissioner, we understand that the funding for LIFE + must be integrated into the EAFRD and the ERDF."
"That is a question of transversality; we can accept it even if we might also regret it."
"However, we know how local elected representatives behave."
"When choices have to be made between different priorities, economic priorities and environmental priorities, it is well known that, unfortunately, it is the environment that suffers and is the victim of those choices."
"That is why Europe absolutely has to display authority in what it wants and why it is crucial to provide for specific funding, inter alia, in Natura 2000."
"Natura 2000 is an important policy that Europe wanted, that it has been difficult to persuade local elected representatives on the ground to accept, that has been difficult to understand and difficult to implement."
"Yet it is precisely now, when we need to manage the Natura 2000 sites, that the European Commission is taking a step backwards."
"That cannot be true."
"Today, the Commission no longer wishes to assist in funding the management of these sites."
"Some of them will not be covered by the EAFRD and the ERDF because they are neither farming areas nor woodland areas."
"What will we do in those cases?"
"I will remind you that LIFE + is a financial instrument and that we would appear not to be giving ourselves the ability to negotiate most effectively with the Council."
"Commissioner, you ought to assist this Parliament in its financial negotiations with the Council."
"We need you."
"We are at the stage of first reading and we have to show our determination, our determination to protect the funding that is absolutely crucial to us."
"We have a very good compromise, and yet we have the feeling of being abandoned by the Commission."
"That really would be regrettable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group feels proud and happy today with the report that has been handled so well by the rapporteur, Mrs Isler Béguin, and also by everybody whose work has enriched it."
"Codesision is our strength, and this is inspired by the need to fulfil the environmental objectives that the European Union has always claimed are a priority."
"With regard to resources for the Natura 2000 network, this report is not asking for the impossible."
"The Commission is as aware as this Parliament of the difficulties caused by the financial perspective but, if you want me to tell the truth, I believe there are solutions that can be found through good will and decisiveness, as in this case."
"Perhaps an increase in funding for the network must also be accompanied by a better redistribution of the necessary resources."
"Of course, Commissioner, people should not be made to pay for the sins of others."
"By way of example: we cannot carry on calling on the Andalusian rural agents to tighten their belts further, both for the maintenance of the network on the basis of their legitimate responsibility as farmers, and for very specific and necessary actions, such as the preservation of the Iberian lynx."
"The Commission will remember better than I the excitement with which the Natura 2000 network was launched."
"Since then we have seen a hopeful process with legislation and programmes that make our environmental priorities a reality."
"All of this investment of resources and excitement cannot now come to nothing."
"LIFE + must be a powerful guarantee of the maintenance and strengthening of what we have created so far, also with regard to habitats and the variety of species we have."
"In this regard, and without calling into question the legitimacy of co-funding, nobody can deny that maintaining the network means — and this must be the case — high costs for certain Members and in particular for Spain."
"My country, together with Denmark, has the greatest amount of protected area and, furthermore, 29% of this area is in my community, Andalusia."
"Commissioner, sometimes we have to make efforts, take a position and be courageous."
"I would urge you to continue investing in the protection of the environment."
"It is worth it."
"Mr President, since 1992 LIFE – the Financial Instrument for the Environment – has been the major vehicle of European Community Environment policy."
"It comprises three funds, for Nature, Environment and Third Countries."
"The current LIFE III programme is due to finish at the end of 2006 when a new package, LIFE +, will be introduced as part of our new Financial Perspective on which we await a Council decision."
"However, it is time for this Parliament to make a decision now."
"Do we want to preserve our natural heritage?"
"Where our shared environmental heritage is concerned, the financing must fit the policy, not vice versa."
"It is extremely difficult to quantify in monetary terms the value of our natural boglands, our native species of flora and fauna and natural habitats and public amenities, such as parks and woodlands."
"Importantly, these are common treasures, enjoyed and owned by the general public."
"The buck stops nowhere if not with us here in the European Parliament, where, through the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we are co-legislators with the Council."
"We bear equal responsibility for maintaining and strengthening our efforts to prevent biodiversity loss and environmental degradation."
"Without adequate funding for LIFE +, the positive steps to address these problems since the introduction of the current programme in 1992 will be reversed."
"Important socioeconomic benefits of the programme will also be lost."
"Up to 125 000 jobs are supported in the EU 15 in nature protection related activities."
"This is a growing sector."
"Mr Bowis has told us about the Scottish example."
"The Scottish Parliament estimates that landscape tourism contributes EUR 560 million to Scotland’s economy each year, much of this in economically depressed regions."
"He mentioned the black grouse and the Iberian lynx."
"Commissioner, can I ask that in seven years’ time the red squirrel be added to that list of biodiversity successes?"
"It is not just a question of the amount of money."
"The money must be secure."
"Without designated, ring-fenced funding specifically earmarked for the environment, we will not achieve our environmental policy objectives."
"The current ‘integrated approach’ to financing environmental policy being proposed by the Commission, whereby funding will come from rural development funding and structural funds, worries me deeply and I think it simply will not work."
"Let us be realistic, there will always be something more immediately important than protecting the environment."
"If properly financed, LIFE + will give us the means to promote our special areas of conservation and thereby promote biodiversity in Europe, which is being lost at an alarming rate."
"Mr President, let me, too, join in congratulating the rapporteur, whose report demonstrates the commitment that is called for and who, as we have seen from the debate so far, has the overwhelming majority of this House behind her."
"This report makes good the immense deficiencies in the Commission proposal, and so it is vital that it be adopted by a large majority."
"As I see it, the proposal’s most glaring defect is the failure to provide financially for the management of the Natura 2000 network during the period from 2007 to 2013, even though the Sixth Environment Action Programme gave high priority to, among other things, species diversity and the protection of species."
"Within the Commission’s plan for Natura 2000 networks to be funded by the Structural Funds lurks the immense danger that, in practice, not enough money will be made available for them."
"Mrs Haug has already referred to the result of yesterday’s vote."
"It is also clear from the Commission’s approach that it is unwilling to take responsibility for the way in which the Community’s common environmental policies are implemented."
"The Commission has also failed outright to put in place the clause ensuring proper management of the Natura 2000 networks, which is an essential condition for funding by the Structural Funds, and so we in this House need, by a convincing majority, to endorse the rapporteur’s approach, which entails integrating into the LIFE + programme the costs of implementing Natura 2000."
"Mr President, the proposal to integrate existing environmental support programmes into a single financial instrument, LIFE +, is justified since it provides a guarantee that actions will not be duplicated."
"It is also a sensible idea to harmonise and simplify principles and procedures."
"The aim of the LIFE + programme is to safeguard funding for actions that will be ineligible for support under the EU’s other financial instruments."
"Given the current challenges we need to address in the field of environmental protection, this approach is entirely justified."
"The key problem we face with regard to the LIFE + programme, however, is fulfilling the tasks of co-financing, creating and implementing the Natura 2000 network."
"The priorities set for the LIFE + programme give due consideration to issues relating to the protection of nature and biodiversity, including the Natura 2000 network."
"At the same time, however, it is emphasised that co-financing for the Natura 2000 network is only to be provided on a complementary basis, which means that support is to be provided under the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund."
"I am concerned at the fact that whilst the concept of the Natura 2000 network in Europe has evolved, this has not been backed up by an appropriate guarantee of funding for the creation and maintenance of this network."
"No clear details have been provided regarding the principles according to which funding can be obtained for protection measures for Natura 2000 sites between 2007 and 2013, and this will undoubtedly mean shortfalls in funding for the Natura 2000 network."
"It will then be impossible to implement many much-needed protection measures."
"For example, the majority of areas designated as Natura 2000 sites in Poland and other countries will not be covered by the funds indicated."
"Such areas include land that is part of national forests, or peat bogs, swamps, natural grasslands, dunes, moorlands and scrublands that are not used for agricultural purposes."
"In the context of the European Commission’s letter of 6 January 2005, which suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of extending the list of Natura 2000 sites in Poland, which could mean that up to 20% of the country would be covered by such sites, a guarantee of separate funding for the establishment of the Natura 2000 network has taken on even greater significance for Poland and other countries."
"Mr President, the LIFE + Regulation is an outstanding piece of legislation."
"The fact that it is a regulation means that it will be binding upon all Member States, and have greater force than any directives addressed to them."
"The document has one flaw, however, which is that it only provides an indicative list of priorities, and leaves us in the dark as to how much funding these priorities will receive, if any."
"This is particularly true for Natura 2000, which is an issue that previous speakers have already touched upon."
"My message to the Commissioner is that it would be a mistake to force this programme to compete for support under the Structural Funds and the Fund for Rural Development."
"This would be an unworkable approach, because it would unleash a dirty war over whose needs were greatest; the needs of local communities, of the needs of protecting the environment and rare plant and animal species or those of the people living in the areas in question."
"Such a state of affairs would be intolerable."
"The second point I should like to make relates to the funding of Natura 2000."
"According to the Commission communication, the cost of such funding is expected to reach EUR 6.1 million."
"I am well aware that this is not a lot of money; in fact, it represents an absolute minimum."
"Yet EUR 5 million of this amount is to be earmarked for the 15 old EU Member States, and only EUR 1 million for the 10 new Member States."
"Is this an appropriate ratio?"
"Does the Commissioner not believe that distributing funds in this way runs counter to the principle of European solidarity?"
"Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, I do not envy you, Commissioner, your present position, for, on Monday, you had to account to the House for the deferment of the thematic strategies that the Commission had announced and on which it is now evidently unwilling to deliver, while today we are discussing LIFE +, the new financial instrument, and we are not exactly of one mind on that either."
"This LIFE instrument, which first saw the light of day in 1992, is, however, something on which I very much want to congratulate the Commission, for in creating it, it fashioned a trailblazing programme for European environmental policy."
"The important thing about it is that it was intended to implement the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Flora and Fauna Directive, and to provide the financial means whereby this could be done."
"It was significant that the Commission opted for the integrated management approach, one that I too wholeheartedly endorse, for it is the remarkable thing about this programme and not to be found in any of the others."
"We are now discussing the new proposal, which is to cover the period from 2007 to 2013, and is also intended to help achieve the objectives of the EU’s Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"As a great deal is being said about Lisbon in this House, I would remind you that one of the objectives to be achieved by the ‘Lisbon Year’ of 2010 is to check the loss of biodiversity in Europe, and that, free-standing though this objective is, it also has socio-economic implications."
"Speaking as one who comes from a region in which tourism plays a very major role, I can say that our capital consists principally in the biodiversity and natural wealth that our region possesses."
"It is important that this new programme should continue to guarantee financial support for the Natura network."
"Although there is no doubt that the Commission’s choice of the integrated approach in collaboration with the Regional Development Fund has been the right one, I would like to raise the objection that this involves us pursuing different objectives, resulting in a conflict the resolution of which is absolutely necessary if we are to strike the necessary balance between both aspects – rational regional development on the one hand and the protection of nature on the other."
"Mr President, the amendments made to LIFE + by Parliament have significantly improved the draft regulation."
"Increasing the budget tenfold over and above the recommendation made by the Commission is a tangible step towards realising the objectives of sustainable development and also serves the European Union’s strategic objective of halting the reduction of biological diversity by the year 2010."
"The budget increase makes LIFE + a substantial independent instrument in European Union environmental policy."
"In its present form, LIFE + has only been used to shore up ‘current financial gaps’ arising between structural funds and agricultural funds."
"The promotion of nature protection objectives would, in this case, depend on critical domestic priorities and may be overshadowed by socio-economic objectives."
"Both the structural funds and the Fund for Rural Development operate on the basis of allocation of funds to a specific applicant."
"This leads to a significant risk that activities in areas of great natural value might not be financed due to the absence of a suitable applicant, or due to distance."
"In the case of LIFE +, it would therefore be more beneficial to operate on the basis of the model that has been used in Estonia for many years, that is, subsidies for activities of importance for nature protection are distributed by place of residence: the recipient of a subsidy does not have to be a landowner, but may be a person implementing an activity of importance for nature conservation."
"Member States need the European Union to provide a dependable and long-term financing strategy in order to ensure the protection of the network of Natura areas."
"If decision-making is left solely to the Member States, the protection of objects of great natural value may be overshadowed by other domestic priorities."
"In order to avoid this, it is important to leave programming decisions to Member States, while establishing minimum levels of financing of LIFE + activities at a European Union level."
"It is essential that we all give our support to the amendments tabled by Parliament, in order to channel the Union’s resources towards the conservation of natural objects of European importance."
"Many thanks."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too welcome the Commission’s proposal for simplifying the funding and administration of the existing environmental programmes and, in LIFE +, combining them into one single financial instrument."
"I, too, am all in favour of protecting the environment and of making whatever financial provision is necessary for it, and I would be happy if we were able today to make generous financial arrangements for the protection of nature."
"I do believe, though that the failure of our financial planning for 2007-2013 means that it would be unrealistic to make specific financial demands today, and an illusion to believe that we can."
"Right now, we do not know how much the overall European budget will add up to."
"We all know that the whole house, the financial framework, must be standing before we can furnish the rooms."
"We have given a very full description of the way in which the Structural Funds and rural development, on the one hand, compete against LIFE + on the other."
"As things stand at present, we have to ask ourselves which measures it makes sense to promote through LIFE +, and which tasks should continue to be entrusted to the Member States."
"Should not, for example, the protection of forests remain a responsibility and task for the Member States?"
"Why, for that matter, should the acquisition of land be funded by LIFE + money?"
"The assumption is being made here that the mere acquisition of a plot of land by an environmental organisation itself protects the environment, but what is at issue is not to whom the land belongs, but how it is managed; to put it another way, its management as a FFH area, a habitat for flora and fauna, has to be ensured and promoted, with the resultant tasks and costs being covered by LIFE +."
"Proper management of areas of land is what protection of the environment is all about, and it ends up being much better value for money too."
"I am strongly opposed to the institutional support of non-governmental organisations;"
"LIFE + must not be used to underwrite such bodies’ administrative costs, but to fund projects that are of practical benefit to the environment."
"– Mr President, I would like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Béguin, and the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent work which they have presented."
"The need to finance LIFE + has a clear European dimension and value."
"The deterioration in the environment and ever increasing environmental issues, often of a cross-border nature, make it necessary to change the pan-European and global approach."
"In order to achieve this, it is necessary, together with investments in the environmental sector, for environmental actions under all programmes to be monitored both inside and outside the European Union, in order to ensure they function better and are more fully coordinated."
"The concept of protection of nature and biodiversity needs to be introduced as a basic feature in thematic priorities for the financing of the LIFE + programme, as a basic line of approach and actions in the new financing tool."
"This programme will need to be in a position to finance other actions, such as Natura 2000, which no other programme can cover."
"Thus there will also be a commitment from other financing instruments to meet such requirements."
"Commissioner, I believe that the increase which the European Parliament is calling for is the minimum required for the serious operation of LIFE +, which aims at basic aspects of environmental policy, which are information, awareness-raising among citizens and, most importantly, control of the application of this policy."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the speakers for their constructive remarks and their concerns regarding Natura 2000 in particular."
"The Commission believes that the current environment programmes have served their purpose."
"LIFE-Nature and LIFE-Environment have been excellent catalysts but, as set out in the mid-term evaluation of the LIFE programme, have done little for the development of environmental policy."
"LIFE + sets out to make a difference."
"Its purpose is to provide funding for policy development, but it would also permit, for example, local and regional actors to spread best practice for dealing with environmental implementation issues."
"Spending on tangible environmental investment is best integrated into the funds that have financial muscle, those in rural and regional development areas."
"I have already referred to the present success of the Commission’s integration policy."
"On 21 June the Agricultural Council adopted the Rural Development Fund Regulation."
"This sets out that farmers and private forest owners can receive compensation for costs incurred and income foregone because of Natura 2000 actions."
"Under that regulation, as regards farm investments, enhancement of the public amenity of a Natura 2000 area is eligible for support and the drawing-up of management plans relating to Natura 2000 can be financed."
"The Council foresees a budget of EUR 82.75 billion to accompany the regulation."
"At least 25% of that amount – or EUR 22.2 billion – would be allocated to compensate farmers and private forest owners in connection with Natura 2000."
"Moreover, it is entirely possible for Member States to focus an even bigger share of their national envelope on Natura 2000 financing if they so wish."
"Two days ago the Commission also adopted the strategic guidelines for both rural and regional spending."
"The rural guidelines refer to Natura and the regional guidelines, clearly, to nature and species protection."
"The Commission is, therefore, delivering on the integration of the environment into other policy areas."
"Turning to LIFE + and the proposed amendments, the Commission finds it difficult to take into account most of the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to this proposal."
"I am aware of the 44 amendments tabled by that committee and of a further four by the Committee on Budgets."
"I should like to divide these amendments into three distinct blocks."
"First, on scope: unfortunately, the majority of the amendments seek to enlarge the scope of the proposal."
"This runs counter to the Commission’s agreed integrated approach."
"Many amendments concern Natura 2000, others set out more precisely what is already indicated in the text, for example, forest monitoring, networking, awareness-raising and NGO financing."
"In addition, certain aspects, such as eco-innovation are clearly covered by other programmes, in this case by the competitiveness and innovation programme."
"To contain this in LIFE + would introduce the risk of the double financing of projects, something the Court of Auditors feels very strongly about."
"Secondly, on procedure: the Commission could accept some of the amendments in principle, for example those relating to assessing the impact quality of the programme."
"However, others regarding the adoption of multiannual plans by codecision, would lead to a sclerosis in programme implementation."
"Clearly, therefore, this could not be accepted."
"In a similar way, the Commission cannot accept the additional demands arising in respect of the comitology procedure."
"Lastly, on the budget, which is the most complex and difficult proposal for the Commission to deal with: the report on LIFE + increases its proposed budget by EUR 21 billion, but an amendment has been tabled to reduce this proposal to EUR 7.35 billion."
"However, I am also aware that the Committee on Budgets proposed a zero budget for LIFE +."
"Similarly, the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives did not put a budget figure on the table for LIFE +."
"If Parliament were to provide an additional budget of EUR 7.35 billion for the environment, the Commission would do its utmost to ensure that these funds were properly included in the relevant structural programmes, thereby supporting Natura 2000."
"In its turn, DG Environment would do all it could to ensure that such funds were effectively and efficiently spent on Natura 2000 matters."
"Turning to the amendments in detail, the Commission can accept in principle Amendments 9, 32 and 33."
"The Commission can accept Amendment 25 in part, as amended by Amendment 43."
"The Commission cannot accept any other amendments."
"In conclusion, the LIFE + proposal offers a flexible financial instrument for the environment."
"I hope that we can find common ground in the short term to take this proposal forward."
"Mr President, if you will allow me to briefly react, could I ask you, Commissioner, which side you are on?"
"Did we not all agree to reduce the sum of EUR 21 billion to EUR 9 billion, which really is the minimum?"
"You say, however, that nothing has been agreed in the financial perspectives, while Mr Böge stated that Natura 2000 cost EUR 21 billion."
"We need to have the guarantee that this EUR 21 billion will indeed be shared out across the budget."
"We believe that agriculture can take a third and that the Structural Funds can take another third."
"It is therefore for the environment to take its third."
". You are right that this EUR 21 billion comes from a study that we carried out at the Commission and it proved that we need at least EUR 6.1 billion yearly for these programmes."
"Of course, Mr Böge’s report had a reference to this."
"The amount was brought down by the amendment to EUR 7.35 billion for the seven-year period, so actually the money you spoke of before was not made available by this report."
"Again I have to repeat that, if we had this additional EUR 7.35 billion, we would ensure that it would be spent through the relevant funds for Natura 2000 and the other environment programmes."
"I must underline that, with the integrated approach, we are going to use the structural funds, the Cohesion Fund, and the Agricultural Fund in order to get the money we need."
"The guidelines that were voted on last week and two days ago will really help us in this respect."
"The Fund for Rural Development, and especially Axis 2, which deals with land management, will get at least 25 % of the rural funding of EUR 22.2 billion."
"This will also help greatly with programmes which the Member States have an interest in financing as they have a legal obligation to finance projects relating to Natura 2000."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place presently, at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0193/2005) by Tokia Saïfi, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on textiles and clothing after 2005 (2004/2265 (INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, Commissioner, without implicating you, I can only regret the fact today that neither Mr Mandelson nor Mr Verheugen are present at this debate on an issue that has been at the forefront of the news for several months."
"Commissioner, the European textile and clothing industry has a future and trade interests to defend."
"Following the signing of the memorandum of understanding in Shanghai on 10 June between the European Commission and the Chinese Government, which has been ratified by the 25 Member States, the European Parliament today expresses its opinion on the future of the European textile and clothing industry, a future that we all hope is promising, and that despite the numerous upheavals that the sector has undergone in recent months."
"I believe that this framework agreement, this free trade agreement, gives the European textile industries some breathing space."
"I nevertheless believe that the European Parliament is duty bound to monitor carefully the management and the follow-up of that agreement."
"Indeed, I believe that we should be able to keep certain safeguards in place and use the defensive trade instruments at our disposal within the context of the WTO when that proves necessary."
"Furthermore, in the long term, the European Union and the national authorities must contribute to developing measures that will make it possible to capitalise on the production and sales potential of European manufacturers, in addition to ensuring that fair trade rules are respected on the international textile and clothing market."
"I will therefore remind you of the maxim that states that a trade policy with the rest of the world should be based on two principles: fairness and reciprocity."
"From that perspective, and with the aim of remaining competitive in this new trading environment, free access to third-country markets is a vital factor in the drive for growth."
"That is why the Commission must encourage all of the WTO countries, apart from the most vulnerable developing countries, to use the Doha negotiations to secure reciprocal market access conditions, which are both fair and comparable, for large-scale textile and clothing producersA firm line must, moreover, be taken against those countries that are still closing their borders to European producers by raising non-tariff barriers to trade."
"These practices need to be combated using the legal instruments available to the European Union."
"With six months to go until the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting, Commissioner, I would stress the fact that removing barriers to market access for industrial products has to be a key objective of the Doha mandate."
"It is also crucial, and this motion says so, to protect our European know-how, our European added value."
"To do so, we must defend intellectual property rights and combat counterfeiting and piracy."
"The Commission must in fact go on the offensive to ensure that third countries comply with the TRIPS Agreement, particularly with regard to textile designs. Similarly, it is necessary to establish ethical trade based on production processes that respect the environment, health, and labour standards."
"Finally, in order to respond to the slowdown in the European textile industry and to guarantee its future and its competitiveness against the US and Asian regional blocs, we have to support the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean production zone in the textile and clothing sector."
"To achieve this, goods must be allowed to move more freely by applying cumulation of origin across the Euro-Mediterranean zone as quickly as possible."
"In parallel with these trade measures, the European Union should implement a transitional practical plan to assist restructuring and retraining for the entire sector, with a view to helping textile-producing regions and safeguarding the future and competitiveness of the sector on international markets."
"Commissioner, the European Commission needs to study in detail the points made in this motion and develop the recommendations made therein by introducing practical measures."
"Furthermore, on behalf of the European Parliament, I call for the Commission to give a quarterly report, before the Members of this institution, on all of the recommendations issued in this resolution and on the actions that it has undertaken."
"Finally, for the future of this sector to be genuinely promising, constant attention must be paid to developing it."
"That is what I call for today for textiles and clothing, a key sector of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should, however, like to say that if Peter Mandelson is not here, it is precisely for very good reasons that are, I might add, related to the matter in hand."
"He was keen to take part in bilateral meetings in Great Britain, where he had the opportunity to meet a number of extremely important ministers, particularly in the context of the WTO negotiations that will be taking place in Hong Kong."
"His absence from these meetings would have deprived us of certain opportunities to defend the priorities that you outline here."
"As you know, these negotiations have a direct bearing on the textile sector."
"I would therefore earnestly request that you excuse his absence; it really is for urgent reasons."
"It was genuinely worthwhile for him to attend these meetings."
"That said, I would like to thank Mrs Saïfi for her excellent report and I welcome the draft resolution."
"It supports the efforts already made by the Commission to assist the European textile and clothing sector in also taking up the challenges set by the abolition of quotas since January 2005."
"Our objective is clearly to lessen the impact of a historic agreement on trade liberalisation, which was finalised exactly 10 years ago."
"We all recognise that the European Union’s trade policy should guarantee the best environment and the best possible conditions for the sector so as to enable it to face the competition on equal terms."
"The shake-up of the regulatory and trading environment ought to encourage us to turn to the future and go on the offensive, to find new commercial outlets and to create markets, rather than to seek only to protect ourselves from competition on the internal market."
"I am now going to address the principal trade issues raised in the draft resolution."
"Firstly, with regard to Chinese imports, I will speak about the EU-China agreement of 10 June 2005."
"Following months of negotiations, we are pleased to have reached an agreement with China, which guarantees a more moderate growth in imports in the main categories of products."
"This gives European industry an additional two and a half years in which to continue the process of reorganisation and adaptation."
"The broad support given to the Commission’s approach by the Member States indicates that a negotiated agreement was certainly the best means of confronting the influx of Chinese imports, and this for various reasons."
"Firstly, most EU products are covered, that is to say around half of the imported products that were liberalised in January 2005."
"Secondly, there is only a slight difference between the quantities agreed and what would have resulted from the mechanical application of the safeguard clause if it had been implemented."
"It must be well understood that there was really no alternative solution."
"Implementing the safeguard measures on a case-by-case basis would have been economically destabilising and politically very difficult."
"The agreement will provide more clarity, certainty and credibility for businesses on both sides (producers, exporters, importers and retailers) and will promote textiles exports from developing countries and Mediterranean countries to Europe."
"This agreement is therefore in everyone’s interests."
"The question of whether we will refrain from taking safeguard actions in the future and on other products remains."
"The European Union has not relinquished its legal rights, but it is clear that we have entered into a transaction."
"We do not rule out possible future actions if they are really justified."
"Careful monitoring will therefore continue."
"From now on, we have to focus our attention on the interests of the European Union, interests that we are going to defend forcefully, in the textile sector: market access; intellectual property, the Euro-Mediterranean zone, rules of origin and origin marking."
"The action plan on market access, debated by the High-Level Group on 14 June 2005, should be officially adopted and implemented with the emphasis on intellectual property issues."
"Increased convergence of market access conditions in the textile and clothing sector is also required."
"It would be advisable to reduce customs duties within the context of the WTO."
"They should be set at the lowest possible level for LDCs and vulnerable developing countries."
"Non-tariff barriers need to be tackled effectively: that is a key objective of the WTO negotiations on market access for non-agricultural products the tariff reductions envisaged by the European Union would be acceptable if a significant number of countries, in order ideally to attain a critical mass, made comparable offers in return in terms of market access."
"The Commission is considering putting forward proposals on origin marking and labelling."
"These proposals will enable both appropriate information and guarantees on the origin of clothing items to be provided, whilst avoiding placing an unnecessary burden on businesses."
"The new system of generalised preferences, which offers preferential access to developing countries, was adopted on 27 June and will enter into force on 1 January 2006."
"A specific safeguard clause for clothing products has been introduced."
"It excludes any country recording an annual growth in exports greater than 20%."
"That clause is the only concession in a global stability agreement that will remain in force until the end of 2008."
"China has been excluded from it and the status quo is maintained for India."
"As regards the reform of preferential rules of origin, the Commission is going to carry out an impact study in the most sensitive sectors, including the textile and clothing sector."
"We have to measure the effects of change on EU industry and on developing partner countries."
"I now come to the Euro-Mediterranean zone."
"We share your desire to establish a genuine Euro-Mediterranean zone in which goods can move freely and are exempt from customs duties."
"Since the 1970s, textile products have entered the EU market exempt from customs duties and, in parallel, the Mediterranean countries have progressively abolished customs duties on EU exports."
"The competitiveness of the Euromed textile industry depends less on customs duties than on competition from Asia, on the preferences granted by the European Union to Asian countries, through the GSP, on the relaxing of the preferential rules of origin and on unfair competition caused by China’s lax compliance with employment law."
"Although the cumulation of origin has been delayed at the Council, every effort is being made to speed up the procedure and to ensure its entry into force in autumn 2005."
"Conclusions: the Member States overwhelmingly supported the agreement reached with China; the industry obtained an additional transitional period to improve its competitiveness both at international level and within the Union, and the Commission is going to monitor the programme of positive actions regularly and thoroughly with a view to securing the future of the European textile and clothing sector."
"With regard to your request for regular updates, the Commission will keep Parliament regularly informed of the implementation of its initiatives."
"That said, I am not going to go so far as to promise you a report every three months, but I believe that it would indeed be quite reasonable for reports to be made to Parliament on a regular basis."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the import of textile sector goods from China is the first stage of a new phenomenon, which marks the start of an inexorable invasion of Chinese products into European markets."
"Textiles are the first stage, and other sectors of production will follow."
"We cannot deny that Europe does not have any effective response to this new phenomenon, which is a consequence of globalisation."
"Let us be clear: Europe must compete with parts of the world where products are manufactured by workers earning the lowest salaries."
"The EU needs to reconsider its approach to talks on international trade agreements, so as to increase pressure to strengthen corporate social responsibility and to encourage strict compliance with International Labour Organisation rules and conventions, and international conventions on the environment and human rights."
"These principles must form part of EU bilateral and multilateral trade agreements."
"I also fear that textile imports are not being adequately monitored."
"Information passed on to me by organisations working in the sector indicates that in June 2005 the quantities recently agreed between the EU and China for this year have been far exceeded."
"I sincerely hope that the EU, in the guise of the Commission, demonstrates very quickly that it is capable of enforcing what has been agreed."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Saïfi for the work she has done on this report."
"What we are proposing today to the House is an expression of concern about the difficult situation being experienced by the European textile sector and, furthermore, it proposes concrete measures for dealing with the enormous challenge facing it."
"Firstly, we believe that it is essential to demand reciprocity."
"In other words, we want equal ground rules for everybody, transparency in access to the markets and respect on everybody’s part for social and environmental laws."
"But, secondly, we are calling for practical support for speeding up the restructuring of companies in order to increase competitiveness and in order to guarantee their future within the new global framework."
"We need a restructuring of the sector, which must be promoted at all levels, European, State and regional, and which must be based on social and institutional dialogue."
"We need to resolve the fundamental problems by means of a modern industrial policy."
"This resolution therefore requests from the Commission and the Member States a European strategy on textiles and clothing aimed at improving processes that add quality, at producing innovative and technologically advanced products, at attaching particular importance to trademarks, at increasing efforts in the commercial field, at including the techniques of the new economy and at ongoing professional training."
"In order to fulfil these objectives, we will need a European textile plan that includes aid for restructuring and specific resources within the framework of the Union’s funds."
"Two instruments must make a decisive contribution to dealing with the future of the sector: the launch of the European technological platform, which will allow for the creation of a coordinated strategy in the field of research, and access by the sector to the Seventh Framework Programme, in accordance with the sector’s own specific characteristics, such as the high number of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"European textiles are recognised throughout the world for their quality and their design, they have demonstrated their ability to adapt and now, if they receive the urgent support they need in view of the profound changes facing them, we can proclaim that they have a future."
". – I should like to highlight a number of points and proposals contained in the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development."
"Firstly, the abolition of quotas in the textiles sector may have harmful consequences in the EU’s least favoured regions."
"This is a key sector for the EU with huge potential, a sector that is capable of helping to turn economic and social cohesion into reality."
"The EU must support this sector as an industry, both at national level and across the Community as a whole."
"A Community programme must be set up for the sector, and especially for the less favoured regions depending on it."
"Support for modernisation and promotion of the sector must be regarded as an objective cutting across EU policies."
"The safeguard clauses provided for in trade agreements need to be invoked as soon as possible, in order to protect the sector in the EU both at the present time and with an eye to the future."
"The 'emergency procedure' provided for in the guidelines for invoking the safeguard clause should now be launched, with all the categories affected being included."
"I should like to add a few additional points."
"The prime concern of the so-called memorandum of understanding concluded between the Commission and China on 10 June 2005 is to legitimise the current situation, with its devastating impact on the sector, especially in countries depending on it, and this is something that we find unacceptable."
"As organisations involved in the sector have said, on the basis of data provided by the Commission, what was agreed in the memorandum has led to exports increasing from 49% in 2004 to the 318% projected for 2005, a far cry from the 8, 10 12.5% figures announced."
"Furthermore, by 20 June, reported exports from China had already exceeded the 10 June agreement for almost all products. Inexplicably, the Commission forfeited the right to the safeguard clauses, thus restricting its implementation."
"The Commission and the Council have acted in a way that has clearly demonstrated their lack of commitment to defending this European industry."
"They are therefore the main culprits for the terrible situation of thousands of businesses and for the destruction of thousands of jobs, with devastating social consequences."
"Hence the proposals for amendments that we tabled."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it appears that an analysis of the completed proposals and a European policy and strategy on the textiles industry are finally taking shape."
"That is essential because millions of citizens have been turning to us in recent weeks and calling on us to act on these issues."
"We cannot ignore their impatience, and at times anger, which is linked to the feeling of living in an era in which the phenomena of globalisation are in the end governed by the United States, used by large countries such as India and China, and paid for, in various ways, by developing countries and by Europe."
"It is with this is mind that the report clarifies the fact that the policies and strategies for the textile industry do not amount to state aid or protectionism, but rather to full acceptance of the rules of trade."
"It demands, however, that everyone should respect the rules and it points out the path to be followed: the opening-up of markets and competition should be seen as an opportunity, but at the same time the European Union needs to enhance its actions for the textile industry, for its modernisation and restructuring, for innovation, for research and for employee training."
"The report also calls upon the Commission to adopt a clear initiative on three points."
"Firstly, it calls for a policy guaranteeing that the rules of free trade are respected within all manufacturing countries, particularly China, and therefore that the state aid or hidden subsidies granted to businesses, which distort competition, are reduced."
"Secondly, it strongly calls for the recognition and implementation of ethical, social and environmental clauses, aimed at widening the scope of worker’s rights and improving working conditions."
"Finally, a more effective fight against counterfeiting, fraud and forgery is called for, which must be pursued by tightening up the penalties imposed on retailers and purchasers of counterfeit items and by adopting a traceability system."
"I will conclude by stating that we would have liked more clarity on other points, for instance the inclusion of an active strategy for consumer awareness and more precise words with regard to the immediate introduction – and I am pleased that the Commissioner said it – of a mark of origin for all textile and clothing goods, precisely in order to protect and revive one of the strengths of our production."
"Everything, however, now rests on the policy and on Europe’s ability to make itself heard and respected."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, the Commission, with our support, succeeded in coming to an agreement with China, the object of which is to protect the European textile industry from a veritable tsunami of Chinese textiles."
"There is good and bad in this."
"It is good that it gives the textile industry in southern Europe some breathing space, but let us also consider the agreement’s negative aspects: by reintroducing quotas, we are establishing barriers to trade, and that is what we always criticise the Chinese for doing."
"Who is to determine which importer is allocated which quota?"
"Is it to be done on the basis of ‘first come, first served’, or is there to be preferential treatment for those who already have longer-standing contracts to supply?"
"Are there perhaps other variations?"
"If so, with what justification, and how does the Commission propose to determine that?"
"What about the supermarkets and traders who, in anticipation of the quotas expiring, have placed big orders in China?"
"Will they get their goods?"
"Will the shelves now remain unreplenished, or will someone pay them compensation if they have to buy their products less cheaply elsewhere in the world?"
"What about the European textile firms, who, in anticipation of the quotas expiring, have, on the one hand, relocated their production to China and, on the other, have further expanded their marketing and distribution in Europe?"
"Can they get supplies from their own factories in China, or will the reintroduction of quotas be just tough luck on them for having lost their livelihood and been obliged to lay off their workers in Europe?"
"What about the textile manufacturers who have spent the last few years and their own money restructuring themselves?"
"Will they now be penalised, while the companies that did not face up to the challenge get money from the Structural Funds?"
"To those businesses that have not so far come to terms with the new on the global markets we are giving a final chance to make good their omission, but it is no part of any European protection and subsidy policy’s remit to be the textile industry’s permanent insurance against the future."
"We are talking here about what businesses, their managers and workers, are fundamentally for, and so I call on them to face up to this challenge."
". – Mr President, I shall start by commending Mrs Saïfi on her outstanding work."
"The issue before us is the need to draw up and implement a trade and industry strategy to ensure the viability of the European textiles and clothing industry in the context of the major opening up of the international markets."
"For such a strategy to succeed, it will require both defensive and more proactive measures to be adopted."
"The defensive measures relate to the need to help to regulate international trade in the sector, and in this regard, we welcome all initiatives aimed at ensuring reciprocal conditions of access to markets and at invoking all ethical, social and environmental clauses guaranteeing such proper regulation of the international markets."
"This is not about protectionism. It is about ensuring that international trade in this sector can take place on the basis of justice and fair play."
"Proactive measures must be adopted, because this is also about the worldwide competitiveness of this industrial sector."
"Such proactive measures entail the EU adopting a more aggressive industrial policy for this sector, which is a hugely important sector."
"In this context, we also welcome all initiatives aimed at fostering greater investment in research and development, at promoting innovation and at improving access to funding, which is one of the key problems that these businesses have to face."
"Over 95% of this business landscape is made up of small- and medium-sized enterprises, and one of the most serious problems that they face is precisely that of access to funding."
"Against this backdrop, we feel that it is vitally important that steps are taken to invest in technological progress in manufacturing, to create mechanisms for fashion and new services, to invest in technical textiles and in non-technological innovation and to set up a technology platform with a view to strengthening this industrial area."
"In this respect, there are, from our point of view, two components that should be brought to the fore: the trade component and the industry component."
"If the two go hand in hand, it may be possible to make the EU textiles and clothing sector viable."
"To conclude, I wish to repeat our call for the international markets in this sector to be regulated and the EU must table clear proposals in the context of the Doha Round, and when we say this we are not calling for protectionist measures to be adopted."
"This is a sector that must be opened up, and that must strengthen its capacity to compete in international markets."
"Yet we are only talking about regulation of international trade in this sector that has very specific characteristics. It is essential that this take place."
". Mr President, the issue of textiles and clothing after 2005 in many ways marks the demonstration of a new era in world trade practices and the growing strength of emerging economies."
"This new era is one that belongs to the innovative, those with relevant knowledge and those who are able to recognise changing world climates and adapt accordingly."
"There are many well-rehearsed arguments setting out the current difficulties that we are facing in the textiles sector here in the European Union."
"Whether they are that, as a continent, we simply were not prepared for 1 January 2005, or that the Chinese state involvement in the production processes of its manufacturers distorts true market competition, it is certain that the experience we are having today with textiles will, in time, prove not to be unique."
"Indeed, I just read a report in newspaper this morning that sets out details of the first round of imports of 4x4 vehicles from China, at a price that I cannot see any current suppliers ever being able to match in the EU."
"That is the extent of the competition that we are now facing."
"We must recognise that the economic world order is now changing at a pace as never seen before."
"That creates for us many managerial challenges at EU level and it is here that we, as an institution, must do all that we can to empower our entrepreneurs with knowledge so that they may continue to compete and lead the field in our areas of expertise."
"It is not desirable that management of the sort that we have recently had to endure through negotiations with the Chinese should happen again with any of our competing partners."
"The Commission was right to take the steps that it did, but that is no long-term solution."
"Our experience should widen our vision, strengthen our position, so that we may seize the opportunities that lie within the management challenges that we face."
"I represent a constituency with a long history of leading in the textiles trade."
"The cotton mills of Lancashire helped form the backbone of the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom."
"Much of that has changed over the years."
"Mills that once employed thousands now employ in the very low hundreds."
"That change started in the 1980s, when changing conditions demanded computer-generated production processes and the longer-term efficiencies that they produce."
"It was unfortunate in Lancashire that the management of the process was not provided at a governmental level, and many valued and skilled people found themselves with redundant skills overnight."
"The vision, lack of provision of knowledge to empower and innovation was not catered for at a national level."
"The new changing circumstances that we face must not be allowed to be a repetition of that experience, but rather a window in which we evolve our industry."
"The report, as finalised by the Committee on International Trade, is one that I am able to recommend to this House."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
". Mr President, I thank Mrs Saïfi for her timely report and believe that the end of the Multifibre Agreement poses a very great challenge to a great many countries around the world."
"The World Bank and the World Trade Organization predict that as a result of the abolition of all quotas China’s share of world trade in textiles and clothing will rise from 17% in 2003 to over 50% by 2010."
"Some argue that to date China’s imports have mostly grown at the expense of imports from other third countries which have seen their share of the EU market decrease, but it is already very clear that the EU textile and clothing industry is experiencing significant pressure."
"According to the European apparel and textile organisation, Eurotex, the sector could risk losing 1 000 jobs a day and up to a million jobs before the end of 2006."
"I welcome the steps that the Commission has finally taken to address the problem but I wonder what makes them so confident that a few years’ breathing space will really make any long-term difference."
"Since the sector in the EU has already had ten years in which to make adaptations to this new reality, what more will they do in the next few years that they have not already done?"
"My concern in saying that is that the Commission is underestimating the size of the challenge we face."
"Its response has been to urge European manufacturers to produce higher-value products rather than competing with China on basics, yet China’s ability to climb rapidly the value-added ladder across so many sectors shows how unhelpful this advice is."
"The Commission has also failed to acknowledge that this challenge is a systemic one, not a one-off sectoral one."
"The textile sector is likely to be only the first sector among many."
"As Mr Karim has just said, we already know that there are many other sectors that are about to cause us concern in terms of Chinese competition."
"I am thinking of footwear, bicycles, machine components, and also high-tech goods."
"But if the impact in the EU will be severe, in many parts of the developing world it will be devastating, especially for women who are disproportionately represented in these sectors."
"In 2000 textiles and clothing accounted for 95% of all Bangladesh’s industrial goods exports."
"In Laos they accounted for 93%, Cambodia 83%, Pakistan 73%, the list goes on. The sector employed nearly 2 million workers in Bangladesh, 1.4 million workers in Pakistan."
"Little wonder, then, that several dozen countries led by Bangladesh and Mauritius made an eleventh hour appeal to the World Trade Organization to save their textile industries."
"It is very unfortunate that their appeal fell on deaf ears, because China’s deflationary pressures are already driving down wages, pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers’ rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive."
"In the Philippines, for example, the government has ruled that its law on the minimum wage will no longer apply to the clothing industry."
"The Bangladeshi government has recently announced that it will increase the number of authorised overtime hours and reduce the restriction on women’s night work."
"Now, part of the solution undoubtedly lies in pressure on China to meet social and environmental standards, so that its competitive advantage is not based on the appalling exploitation of workers or the environment."
"But that alone is not enough."
"The challenge posed by China raises some fundamental questions about the logic and direction of free trade itself and it demonstrates the destruction that happens when a country has not just a comparative advantage but a more or less absolute advantage in so many areas."
"The old theories about free trade always being a win-win arrangement are shown to be fundamentally flawed and therefore the Commission urgently needs to undertake more research in order to understand these new trends better and formulate appropriate policy approaches."
"Finally, I just want to say that I regret that two of the amendments submitted today link textiles and REACH."
"I think those amendments are very misleading and unhelpful and unfortunately, largely because of those amendments, my Group will abstain on the final vote on this report."
". Mr President, I cannot fathom the general uproar about the rapid increase in textile imports from China since 1 January this year, for it was clear to all of us that this was precisely what was going to happen."
"If you open up and liberalise the markets without imposing conditions, you simply have to expect other producers to seize their opportunity and benefit from it by rushing headlong into the newly-open markets."
"Just take a look at China’s main imports at present: aluminium smelters, casting machines, presses, moulding dies, and roller mills."
"What that tells you is that we will have enormous problems in five years’ time – in the footwear industry, in the bicycle industry, in the car industry and in iron- and steelmaking."
"Not even the stay of execution until 2008 provided for by special safeguard clauses will solve the problem; it will do no more than alleviate it."
"It is naive to demand the same conditions of competition for trade with China and with other countries."
"Does that mean that, from 2008 onwards, a worker in the European textile industry will have to take home the same pay as his Chinese counterpart in order to be able to compete?"
"The idea is absurd."
"It is both an absurdity and a scandal that the European Union, by going as far as to subsidise those companies that transfer production to third countries, is sawing through the branch on which it sits."
"The only chance of a solution lies in the complete recasting of the EU’s trade policies."
"The EU must commit itself to a system of fair trade, and that involves abandoning the unfettered opening-up of markets and liberalisation."
"A fair balance of interests implies the promotion of trade where it is rational and not an end in itself, alongside the maintenance and promotion of local production and regional economic cycles, not only in our own regions but also in developing countries."
"This also involves something for which my own group has called, namely a commitment on the part of the European Union to improved working conditions and workers’ social security entitlements, as also to high environmental standards both in our own industry and in the production systems of our trading partners."
"This means taking into account, as appropriate, developmental differences between our various trading partners."
"It has to be said, though, that it is urgently necessary that the Commission’s mandate for trade negotiations be redrafted once and for all."
"The old mandate, dating back to 1999, has failed twice, in Seattle and Cancún, and it will fail again in Hong Kong."
"I do not grasp how the Commission is meant – as this report itself puts it – to draw up its future mandate itself."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s demand for targeted support for research and development in the textile sector, where priority should be given to the development of safe, chemical-free textiles by way of the consistent application of the principle of mutual recognition, wholly in the spirit of REACH."
"I believe that there is also a need to ensure that consumers do not become specimens for the testing of textile products derived from every variety of nanotechnology before the effects of this have been adequately researched."
". Mr President, since the abolition of the import quotas in January 2005, the global textiles sector has undergone drastic change."
"Alongside spectacular growth in the Chinese textiles exports, there is a deep crisis in the textiles sector within the European Union and in the developing countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia and Laos."
"I share the rapporteur’s concerns about the considerable growth in the quantity of Chinese textiles on the European market, and call on the Commission to closely monitor the implementation of the bilateral agreement between the European Union and China between 2005 and 2008."
"Let me underline the fact that this agreement is just the first step in making the global textiles market fair and enabling it to function properly."
"The Commission must continue the dialogue with Beijing to make it clear that a liberalised world market is dependent on a level playing field if it is to function."
"Under no circumstances is it compatible with the principles of the free market that illegal state support systematic export subsidies should be paid, that intellectual property rights should be violated and that a country’s own market should be insufficiently open."
"These things cannot be explained by ignorance, given the precision with which Beijing reminds the European Union of its WTO obligations."
"The rapporteur is right to ask that attention be paid to China’s compliance with labour guidelines."
"In many factories, the workers, including many children, are required to work under appalling conditions."
"The Commission must actively pursue a policy aimed at improving working conditions in China."
"That is not only vital for the Chinese workers, but also for textile workers in neighbouring countries."
"As a result of the Chinese expansion, textile companies in those countries are forced to reduce production costs still further in order to remain competitive internationally."
"I do think, though, that it is disappointing that the rapporteur should take so narrow a view of the future of the European textile sector as lying in a Euro-Mediterranean zone."
"Within the complex global textiles market, the European Union should not primarily focus on cooperation with one region."
"Moreover, concluding a trade agreement with a country such as Syria is, given the current human rights situation, unthinkable."
"The Commission must clearly map the opportunities and threats within the global textiles sector without import quotas and formulate clear policy for the European textiles sector after 2008."
"Only a commercial and innovative European textiles sector can retain a competitive position on the global market."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the action launched some months ago by the European Union, which has been hit hard by the intolerable increases in textile and clothing imports from China, has started to produce results by means of the memorandum of understanding."
"Total liberalisation, however, will only come about in 2008."
"The report by Mrs Saïfi, whom I truly thank for her excellent work, rightly insists that the utmost attention continue to be paid to verifying the good will of the Chinese authorities and to keeping a worsening situation under control."
"By means of the amendments to the final text, I wished to emphasise a number of extremely important aspects for the European textile sector and for manufactured goods in general."
"Suitable penalties today need to be laid down, such as putting a ban on trade with the European Union for a certain period of time for all of those found guilty of illegally importing goods or of importing counterfeit goods, and who are thus implicated in a crime, the severity of which must be judged in terms of its repercussions on European society as a whole, not only on producers, but above all on consumers."
"I call for constant monitoring of the Chinese authorities’ commitment to combating piracy the counterfeiting of trademarks and products, and child exploitation, and to ensuring respect for workers’ rights."
"Another important problem arises from the fact that the boom in textile exports from China has caused devastating effects in those developing countries whose principal and essential market for placing and selling their goods used to be the European Union, which is now overloaded with Chinese goods."
"The needs of those countries must also be taken into account as the sector finds a new equilibrium in the next few years, which will be marked by trade liberalisation."
"It is the Commission’s responsibility to implement strategies providing vital support for modernisation and enabling businesses to confront, in an informed way and with a clear outlook, a path that is still an uphill climb, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Liberalisation of the global market cannot occur if the parties involved do not all respect the same rules and the provisions resulting from the agreements."
"The absence of rules or the failure to respect them prevents fair competition, and, in actual fact, invalidates the very concept of the free market."
"We are not only protecting an important EU sector of production, but we are also protecting the right of consumers to have access to safe and quality products, and the right of workers to know the true prospects for their future and to have the social clauses implemented with respect for human rights."
"The European Union has to forcefully say to the rest of the world that there can be no free market without fair competition, and that in order for competition to be fair, the common rules must be respected."
"– Several Members are addressing the Presidency with regard to the serious events currently taking place, of which you may be aware, involving a series of explosions on the London transport network."
"Several underground stations and several buses have been targeted, and it is reported that there are some people injured, perhaps some fatalities; we do not know any more for the moment."
"I understand that Members wish to speak on this matter."
"I should simply like to say to them that the Presidency and the whole of Parliament are, of course, extremely concerned by what is happening."
"I simply propose that we do not open a debate now. These events are ongoing."
"I have been informed about them."
"I have requested information."
"There has been yet another explosion only a few minutes ago."
"A third incident, as the British call it – but it is more than that, it was in all likelihood an attack – has occurred in a London underground station."
"I believe that we should wait a little while longer before debating the issue, to find out what is happening and to have more information."
"For the time being, the London underground is completely blocked off, paralysed, closed."
"In the meantime, I was very keen to make this announcement to you, and to say that our Parliament is obviously very concerned about what is taking place."
"I therefore propose that we continue our debate whilst awaiting further information."
"Mr President, important as this debate is, it pales into insignificance when compared with the atrocious terrorist attacks in my capital city today."
"I would like to join, I am sure in the name of all in this House, in utterly condemning that terrorism and in expressing condolence and sympathy to those who have been injured and killed."
"We live in an age where terror seems to know no bounds."
"Coming from Northern Ireland, where we alas have known much of that in our history, one’s heart goes out to the people affected by this morning’s terrible events."
"Turning to this subject, Northern Ireland, like many parts of Europe, once boasted a vibrant and large textile industry."
"Today it is reduced to all but nothing, with thousands upon thousands of job losses."
"Since trade policy was foolishly handed over to the exclusive competence of the EU, the plain truth is that Member States are powerless to act in the face of cheap imports ravaging their textile industry."
"The plain truth is also that the EU has failed the textile industry."
"The abolition of import quotas on 1 January 2005 has, in the UK and elsewhere, caused soaring imports, especially from China."
"Whereas we are denied import quotas, China’s state owned factories benefit from export subsidies, state aid and even free electricity, as well as the benefits of its artificially undervalued currency."
"Little wonder that we cannot compete."
"Commissioner Mandelson’s decision to impose anti-dumping duties on certain synthetic fabrics is welcome so far as it goes, but often such fabrics are then further processed in China to give them added value, thereby avoiding the anti-dumping duties."
"For example, a synthetic fibre that might be subject to that duty is given added value by making it into a roller blind, whereby it escapes the anti-dumping duty and is dumped in the EU at ridiculous prices."
"That loophole must be closed."
"Generally, the Commission needs to be much more robust with China than it has been hitherto."
"–Mr Allister, Parliament, which, I believe, in its entirety supports the condemnation of terrorism that you have just made, also expresses every sympathy for the injured, since at present we still do not know whether there have been any fatalities."
"Terrorism, since that is apparently what we are concerned with here, will always be met by Europeans who are prepared for terrorists and who refuse to yield."
"We know that there were several major events in London yesterday, a happy event with London being chosen as the 2012 Olympic city, and the G8 taking place."
"What has happened, therefore, is certainly no coincidence."
"Let us then condemn these acts in the strongest possible terms."
"Mr President, I too should like to express my sympathy to all the victims."
"Since 1 January 2005, WTO members can no longer impose quotas on textile and clothing imports."
"The impact of this measure on the European market has proven to be enormous, both for importers and producers."
"It is a good thing that the Commission has engaged in dialogue as a means of finding a solution to this dilemma, for by doing so, it has given the European producers some breathing space – no more than that, and nor can it be more than that, for the WTO does not allow any more and is not expected to change its position."
"European producers will now have to come up with a real response to the new situation."
"We need a strategic response to the problems in the long term, because the European textiles and clothing sector, and not that sector alone, has a structural problem."
"There are many products that are, or can be, produced more cheaply in China, or maybe in other countries too."
"It is also a fact that China fails to adhere to the WTO rules, and this is a major problem, particularly in the areas of intellectual property, working conditions, the environment and market access."
"It is because of this that it can produce more cheaply, and the resulting unfair competition is something that really should be addressed."
"Compliance with the existing rules must be ensured."
"Many poorer countries have, in recent years, become hugely dependent on the textiles and clothing sector, and they, too, are seeing jobs disappear as they struggle to compete with China."
"We must prevent the least developed countries from becoming the biggest losers."
"Too little consideration, moreover, is being given to the interests of importers and producers who, in response to the post-2005 situation, have entered into financial commitments, sometimes major ones."
"They should not become the victim of a rescue operation in a section of the production industry."
"They are entitled to predictability and legal certainty."
"Finally, we can, of course, protect our trade position, but always in line with the WTO, and showing due responsibility towards poor countries, and in respect of fair trade, human rights, and the environment."
"I might add that all WTO members should, in fact, do likewise."
"My compliments to Mrs Saïfi."
"Mr President, over the last three years alone, over USD 20 billion was invested in China’s textile and clothing industry, much of it even coming from our own industries, and its capacity increased by 50%."
"What that means is that in China, every year, 20 billion articles of clothing are produced, equivalent to four items for every human being on this earth."
"That sums up its capacity."
"Let me now pass on to the social aspect."
"Women working in China’s textiles industry have a place right at the bottom of the social scale, many earning less than a dollar a day and, moreover, without any rights."
"Even so, China’s share in global textile markets is soaring."
"The poorest states in the world are now losing even their textile industries."
"Africa, stricken with Aids, is losing thousands of jobs a day."
"The European Union is currently losing a thousand a day."
"Around the world, over 30 million jobs are under threat of relocation, not to mention the 30 million jobs accounted for by sub-contractors."
"This is more than just a fundamental change in the world of work; it is a catastrophe."
"Things have come to such a pass in China that the country is competing with itself; social security rules are being cut back and businesses are being discharged from their social obligations."
"While we talk about fair trade and core labour standards, capital can do as it pleases."
"The one thing I ask of you, Commissioner, is that you raise the issue of social security at the forthcoming WTO negotiations in Hong Kong."
"Saying ‘yes’ to liberalisation means that the ‘how’ has to be considered as well."
"This I say in my capacity as Vice-President of the International Textile, Clothing and Leather Workers' Association, whose members – over 10 million in 110 countries around the world – are devastated by this catastrophe."
"– The textile sector was the first sector of EU industry to feel the pain of changes in the global market."
"New market participants have appeared on the textile market, above all China and India."
"It is sad to hear statements by European Union officials that when China's membership of the WTO was negotiated ten years ago, no one imagined such growth in China."
"Textiles and other sectors with problems show that this is not about a single European state's inability to manage its economy."
"It is a problem for the majority of industrial sectors in the whole of Europe."
"While having an industrial policy, the European Union only really predicts the general direction for growth and employment."
"The sectors recommended for expansion are not identified; this is a matter for the Member States."
"As a counterbalance to China, the rapporteur proposes to concentrate textile production in the Mediterranean region."
"However, this will definitely not stop China, and Europe will have new competitors."
"There is a need for an analysis and long-term development forecast of EU industrial sectors, taking into account the appearance of new market participants and the division of markets."
"I therefore invite the European Parliament to urge the European Commission to prepare proposals to amend industrial policy, to forecast long-term industrial development up to 2030-2050 and to submit recommendations to industry about sectors of the future that should begin to be invested in now."
"If we do not undertake such measures, a Chinese ‘tsunami’ will devastate industry in Europe."
"– We will now interrupt this debate, which will resume at 3 p.m."
"Honourable Members, in the last hour, reports have reached me of what now appears to be a coordinated series of attacks on London’s transport system."
"Explosions have been detonated on three buses and at four tube stations."
"Deaths have already been confirmed, and many people have suffered terrible injuries."
"I do not yet have any specific figures, but we may have to deal with many deaths."
"Reports of attacks are continuing, and they arrive every few minutes."
"On behalf of Parliament I want to express our condolences to all those who are suffering the consequences of these barbaric acts."
"As President of Parliament and a citizen of a country that experienced only last year the horror of this kind of multiple attack, I want to send, on behalf of us all, a message of solidarity to the British people."
"We all stand with you today."
"We will never let the atrocities of terrorism defeat the values of peace and democracy in Europe."
"I ask you now to observe a Minute’s silence."
"– The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to replace part of the amendment, that is to say that we wish to replace the words ‘priority will be given’ with the words ‘the Commission will encourage’."
". Mr President, on behalf of the rapporteur and under Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure, I would like to ask the Commission if it is now prepared to accept the amendments of this House."
". Honourable Members, the Commission maintains its position as stated yesterday by my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, meaning that the consultation of the European Parliament is required."
". Mr President, in that case, again on behalf of the rapporteur, I should like to ask the House to refer this back to committee for further consultation."
"Mr President, I believe that the European Parliament has a duty to respect the deceased."
"At this very moment, a serious of new explosions is taking place in London."
"That is an attack against the entire Union, which cannot refrain from making contact with the current Presidency of the European Council."
". Mr President, I rise under the same rule, for the same rapporteur, and I put the same question to the Commission, please."
".I, of course, take account of Parliament’s position and will not fail to communicate it to the College."
". Mr President, that may be half a step forward, but I should still like to refer the matter back to committee for further consultation."
". Mr President, I should like to clarify that, by way of this report, we recommend that the European Parliament reject the agreement on the transfer of passenger data between the EU and Canada."
"That does not mean that the agreement cannot go ahead, even if we vote against it, because we are only being here."
"You may recall that the European Parliament last year rejected a similar agreement with the United States on grounds of both substance and procedure."
"The agreement was signed nevertheless and this House subsequently took the Commission and the Council to court."
"The case is pending and a court ruling is expected by the end of this year."
"I need to underline that the agreement with Canada is much better in substance."
"We recognise that a good deal has been negotiated by the Commission."
"However, the Commission chose the identical procedure as it did in the case of the agreement with the United States."
"Both the European Parliament and the national parliaments are effectively being sidelined."
"The Commission should have chosen the assent procedure instead."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously endorsed the view that the Commission has chosen the wrong legal base."
"If Parliament were to accept this procedure now, it would basically undermine the pending court case."
"I reiterate, by voting for this report, the Council can still go ahead with the agreement."
"In other words, rejection by the European Parliament does not in any way jeopardise the agreement but, at the same time, Parliament remains coherent with its earlier positions and will not undermine the court case."
"Therefore, I kindly ask you to vote for this report."
". Mr President, there is a split vote on Amendment 2 to paragraph 26."
"The first part is up to the word ‘market’ and then the rest of the amendment would be deleted, so it would be similar to the original form in committee."
"I propose that the first part be adopted."
"The second part would not be adopted; it would be rejected."
". Mr President, there is a linguistic problem in this amendment."
"I should like the word ‘and’ changed to ‘or’, so that this is the least of all possible reasons why a clearing and settlement service can refuse access."
"So ‘and’ should be changed to ‘or’ in the English version – the original version – and then in all the other language versions."
"– That concludes voting time."
"– Mr President, I should like to make a practical proposal: we were unable to vote on Mrs Saïfi’s report on the textile industry this morning and I know that it is scheduled to be put to the vote this afternoon."
"I believe that, given the considerable implications of the textiles issues, not least for employment, we ought not to vote on such a matter rather hastily this afternoon."
"I suggest postponing the vote to the next part-session."
"Mr President, I think Mr Wurtz has got it absolutely right; what matters is not that we have not yet brought the debate to a conclusion, for that is in order."
"What matters is that, instead of holding the vote today, we should wait until the next part-session, which will be in September, and vote then."
"I strongly support the motion."
"– Mr President, I very well understand the arguments put forward by my fellow Members: they are right that the textiles issue is a fundamental one."
"I should simply like to remind you that the part-session in Strasbourg concludes on Thursday afternoons at around 5 p.m. and that Members should be in attendance."
"Requesting such postponements means finally accepting that we do not work up to the end of our part-sessions as they are scheduled."
"I genuinely regret that."
"Mr President, I had asked to speak even before the declarations of vote on the order of business."
"I would like to put to you the straight question as to whether it really is legitimate to move the adjournment of a vote before the end of a debate."
"I do not believe that it is."
"I believe that this should have been moved only once the debate was over, or, alternatively, that we could have voted this evening, and I would ask you to check this before then."
"In that case, we would have to include in the closing vote another vote on the motion for adjournment, for it was, or so I believe, irregular to vote on that in the middle of a debate."
". I'm voting today for my Report on the initiative by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg with a view to adopting a Council decision adjusting the basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff because we have received some assurances that there will be a greater level of accountability and transparency in the way that Europol's activities are conducted."
"Europol is extremely important to European citizens and to the European Parliament."
"Its activities on issues such as drug trafficking, illegal trafficking of human beings and other organised crime is vital work which has increasing importance with the enlargement of the EU and potential further enlargements."
"In voting for my Report, I have noted the EP Hearing with the new Director in June 2005 of Europol and the EP visit to Europol's Headquarters in April 2005."
"It is important we support the work of Europol, but that, in turn, the Council understand the urgent need for accountability and transparency in Europol's core work."
"At present we have not yet achieved this level of accountability."
"Mr President, I just wanted to make it clear that I twice voted against Amendment 43 when we voted on the Isler Béguin report, not out of any ignorance of the content or of the proposal by the Committee of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but because we should ask ourselves the fundamental question of whether individual committees should now, while we are in the middle of a debate on the financial perspectives, be able to adopt resolutions that go against what we resolved in relation to the Böge Report."
"We will only have any clout in our negotiations with the Council if we, no matter how legitimate the individual committees’ opinions may be, do not, in anticipation of the decision on the financial perspectives, sabotage the basis on which our decisions are arrived at."
"It is for that reason, bearing in mind our negotiations on the financial perspectives, that we have voted against."
"Mr President, having voted against the Isler Béguin report, I wish to make clear that I am in favour of protecting the environment and also of the financial settlement, which is absolutely necessary."
"I also favour keeping to the position we arrived at on the financial perspectives, as laid down in the Böge Report."
"I am, however, opposed to the institutions giving support to environmental associations or non-governmental organisations, and against the European Union taking upon itself any more functions."
"Even in protecting the environment, subsidiarity must be the order of the day."
"Primary responsibility for it lies with the Member States."
"That applies to forestry policy, and also to the buying-up of land for nature conservation."
"When money is tight, we have to concentrate on what is essential, that being support for the environmentally-responsible management of land."
". The Commission’s proposal concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE +) falls short of what is required, in terms of financial resources, and it is unacceptable that it fails to cover the Natura 2000 component."
"The report adopted today improves considerably on the Commission’s proposal, by introducing, with improved funding, the nature and biodiversity component, which covers the creation, preservation and management of Natura sites, (the network of the most important nature sites in the EU), thereby helping to achieve the objectives aimed at halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 and beyond."
"The amendments that have been tabled clarify the objective of the LIFE + project. It provides for drastically reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, protecting Europe’s forests, providing more information on the environment and increasing the involvement of European citizens in achieving environmental aims."
"The question now is whether this ambitious project can be implemented with the existing resources and political will."
". I voted for this report."
"Life + is the key instrument for the development, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and communication of community environmental policy and legislation."
"It will notably support the implementation of the 6th Environment Action Programme."
"We must ensure that a proper budget is established for Life + commensurate with its ambitious goals."
". The commitment shown by the EU to addressing environmental issues is, broadly speaking, worthy of our support."
"It is our responsibility to try to leave a habitable world for future generations; for this reason, the abuse of resources as though there were no tomorrow is disgraceful."
"Nevertheless, one must distinguish between policies to protect the environment and policies that bring the environment to the centre of the stage as though it were the only issue that existed."
"There are other key areas that we must not overlook, such as people, economic needs and development needs."
"In this context, I broadly share the concerns that Parliament has expressed both in committee and in plenary debate, especially given that the common agreement is a reasonable one."
"We protect the environment because we put people first."
"That should be the principle guiding what we do."
"."
"There is much scepticism about the European Union among the Swiss public, who fear the loss of their political rights and do not want to allow anything to be imposed on them."
"To date, the Alpine state has taken the wise course of entering only into bilateral treaties, as a result of which it enjoys a privileged partnership with the EU, something that is also to be recommended to many other states who want to retain their sovereignty and characteristics."
"The EU, racked by crises, slides on one banana skin after another, thrown into disarray by the German visa scandal, with the double ‘no’ to the Constitution and unresolved budget issues following close behind."
"It has to be said that this very rejection of the constitution may have made it easier from some of the Swiss to vote in favour of Schengen and Dublin, as it is more probable that they will come to like a loose federation of states than a centrally directed single state."
"Against the background of prevailing suspicion, the veiled threat of Schengen/Dublin is not exactly likely to foster trust, the result being that everyone knows that they will have to vote in September on the extension of the agreement to the new Member States of the EU."
"It is precisely this ignorance, and the all too obvious steamrollering of sovereign decision-making that causes the European public such concern."
"It is not acceptable that support grants worth millions and deceptive promises should be employed to entice new Members or bind countries closer to the EU, thereby robbing them of the option of going their own way outside it."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish to welcome the agreement between Europe and Canada on the processing and forwarding of Advance Passenger Information and Passenger Name Records data, which we regard as thoroughly well-balanced."
"It represents a decisive step in addressing the sensitive issues of global security and the fight against international terrorism, of which we have seen another lamentable example today."
"The PPE-DE Group has abstained from voting today, this being our chosen way of protesting to the Council at the short deadlines, which are scarcely credible and leave no time for the debate that needs to be held."
"Our protest is directed solely at the procedure."
"We want this agreement, for on it depends the security of the citizens whom we in this House represent, and the way we have voted is intended to reflect that."
"I would like to express our congratulations to the Commission on the agreement and on the proposal, as also to the rapporteur."
". I welcome the substance of the agreement with Canada on the use of Advance Passenger Information (API) / Passenger Name Records (PNR) data of passengers on flights to Canada."
"I particularly welcome the principles of non-discrimination and reciprocity, the possibility of jointly reviewing the execution of undertakings made, and the fact that data transferred are limited by the ‘push’ system, which sets a positive example to other similar agreements such as the one with the USA."
"I am delighted that, unlike the USA, Canada has a legislative data protection system, including supervision by an independent data protection Commissioner."
"I also welcome the fact that Canadian law allows citizens rights of access, rectification and even opposition as regards any personal information relating to them, and that the Canadian commitments extend this right to EU citizens who are not present in Canada."
"I support Mrs in ’t Veld’s outstanding report and its proposals, and I agree that we need to wait for the Court of Justice’s ruling on the USA PNR case."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on the political situation and independence of the media in Belarus."
"I am grateful to colleagues from different political parties and different political groups who supported this resolution."
"I look forward to the Commission’s concrete actions to provide, as soon as possible, the necessary assistance to begin the broadcasting of independent radio programmes to Belarus from abroad – from Lithuania, Poland and, possibly, Ukraine."
". One of the direct effects of the most recent EU enlargement has been that politicians, the media and the people have increasingly turned their attentions to the countries that are now the EU’s closest neighbours."
"One of these is rightly Belarus, where events over a number of years are cause for serious concern."
"As was abundantly clear recently with Ukraine, the EU is capable of using its influence to promote successful transitions to democracy."
"This idea lies at the root of the concerns expressed in the resolution that was adopted in this House and to which I gave my full support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that within our Europe we will never again have to witness a war against the sovereignty of a State."
"I hope that a situation never again occurs in which a national economy is crushed with the connivance of the World Bank, in which extortionate conditions are imposed one after the other, and in which public and state-owned enterprises are despicably expropriated or put out of business."
"I hope that everyone still feels shame for one of the most ignoble pages in the history of Europe, which caused death, misery and instability in the Balkans."
"With this in mind, I abstained from the vote on the hypocritical resolution on Srebrenica."
"Ten years after one of the lowest points in recent European history, we should try to remember and learn from the terrible events of that time, and to understand two enormously important points: firstly, we should appreciate that peace, which most people nowadays take for granted, is a fragile gift, and secondly, great strides forward have been made in these ten years."
"Right now, our duty is to remember the horror and the part played by those who encouraged and carried out the massacre, to remember the fact that there were organisations that failed to protect the victims and to learn from the mistakes that were made."
". The massacre in Srebrenica, Bosnia, ten years ago should never be forgotten."
"In July 1995, the Bosnian Serb army took control of the small spa town which had been declared as a UN ‘safe area’."
"Within five days 7 000 men and boys were brutally murdered."
"This was the worst case of genocide in Europe since the Second World War."
"A decade later and still the men who ordered the massacre are at large."
"The EU must do all it can to put pressure on the relevant authorities to capture and put to trial those responsible for this atrocity."
".– Τhe Communist Party of Greece voted against the unacceptable motion for a resolution on Srebrenica because it endeavours to exonerate the murderous war by NATO against Yugoslavia and justify the crimes against its people, who were dismembered by the intervention by the American and European imperialists, initially causing war within the country and then the NATO attack."
"It is using Srebrenica to launder this dirty war and to legalise forthcoming movements to redivide the Balkans and imperialist interventions planned in the area as a whole."
"An effort is being made to sanctify the US-inspired special tribunal set up in The Hague, the 'bill of indictment' of which has collapsed and been ridiculed."
"As far as Srebrenica is concerned, we would point out that:"
"? the reasons for the foreign imperialist intervention cannot be concealed;"
"? the people remember that the bomb in the market square of Sarajevo which exacerbated the war was the result of action by foreign secret services."
"The reference in the resolution to Srebrenica as the greatest post-war crime is a blind forgery of history, because the greatest post-war crime of imperialism in Europe to date is the slaughter of Yugoslavia."
"Politically, those with moral responsibility for the war, for the bombing of the maternity clinic in Belgrade, the intensive care unit and the school in Alexinatz, for the slaughter of civilians, for the use of cluster bombs and for the destruction of infrastructures are the American and European imperialists."
". One of the key areas of our relations with the Far East is the embargo on arms sales to China, which I support, although I am aware that this is, more than anything, a symbolic gesture, given that, even without European arms, China remains a threat to Taiwan, and that China still commits an alarming number of human rights violations."
"China’s power – both now and in the future – is not exclusively military in nature. It is now a growing economic power that uses a huge amount of energy."
"It is a demographic power. It is a diplomatic power, in view of its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and its diplomacy and cooperation policy of helping developing countries without imposing any kind of democratisation process; far from it in fact."
"Consequently, rather than simply discussing whether or not to remove the embargo, the EU needs to think strategically."
"Our prime objective is to ensure that China becomes a democracy."
"No democracy poses a threat to us, whereas a military, diplomatic and demographic power with huge economic strength and without democratic checks and balances might pose a medium- or long-term threat."
"Mr President, I was unable to support the conclusions of the resolution on landmines, although, as someone who has been involved in development cooperation, I share this concern and I regard the use of landmines in developing countries as a great tragedy."
"I represent an EU country that is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Ottawa Treaty by the year 2016."
"By that time we will have scrapped the world’s safest and least destructive mines, which protect our 1 324 kilometre long border with Russia."
"The mines have not just been left in the ground unsupervised: they are in storage and guarded."
"When they were placed in the ground during the war, precise maps were produced so that they could be deactivated later on."
"No civilian can tread on a Finnish mine or accidentally step on the tripwire of a deactivated mine."
"Images of children with mutilated limbs do not apply to conditions in Finland."
"Countries where that happens cannot be part of the Ottawa Treaty."
"We already know that our defences are weakening substantially."
"We will have to find a substitute system with the same function but a different name."
"Our problem is therefore one of semantics."
"One might ask what logistic strategy adheres to a set of morals that insists on the destruction of the present antipersonnel mines but agrees that some replacement system should be acquired."
"The purpose of warding off and destroying the enemy does not alter the fact that this weapon system is to be exchanged for something more modern, more expensive and more effective."
"The new systems are not in any way less lethal instruments of death than the current land mines."
"Their purpose is to prevent the enemy’s advance."
"In resolving the problem we should focus more on the use of mines as instruments of terror than the equipment itself."
". Anti-personnel mines are among the most heinous devices used in warfare, as they, often invisibly, extend the horrors of the conflict into the future."
"We therefore naturally wish to express that we are committed to ensuring the success of the Mine Ban Treaty, and that we share the concerns that Parliament has raised in this regard."
"Our displays of concern and commitment to the success of this Treaty are not enough, however."
"Countries such as EU Member States must commit themselves to providing direct support for the victims, who are usually in countries with terrible development problems such as Angola."
". The PPE-DE Group abstained on the resolution tabled by the other political groups on anti-personnel landmines largely because we do not support those parts of the resolution which call for a widening of the anti-personnel landmine campaign to include anti-tank mines and other categories of munition, which are currently required in the inventories of our responsible armed forces."
"These weapons are, in any case, under consideration by the parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) – a highly responsible group which is examining matters such as detectability, fuse design and self-destruction in order to minimise collateral effects."
"We attach importance to maintaining a broad consensus on the anti-personnel landmine issue, and therefore remaining focused on what really needs to be done – making safe those areas in many parts of the world where mines are a threat to the civil population and an obstacle to economic development and assistance to mine victims."
". The illegal and unsustainable exploitation of forests has a devastating effect on both mankind and nature."
"In vulnerable regions such as the Amazon, Central Africa, South-East Asia and Russia more than half of the logging activities are illegal."
"The government of Brazil announced last year that the destruction of the world's largest tropical forest, the Amazon, proceeds apace."
"In the 12-month period ending last August, farming and logging, much of it illegal, destroyed 10,000 square miles of forest."
"This was the biggest one-year loss since 1995, when the Amazon shrank by about 11,000 square miles."
"Internationally the EU has committed itself to protect the last ancient forests and to fight the illegal exploitation and trade of timber through CITES, WSSD and CBD."
"In May 2003 the European Commission published the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade Action Plan."
"I urge them to speed up implementation of this important initiative."
". My intention was to abstain on the vote on the resolution as a whole on the Kauppi report."
". I welcome this report as a contribution to finding a way forward in completing the Internal Market for financial services, specifically in the area of clearing and settlement for Securities Transactions."
"A common regulatory and supervisory framework for clearing and settlements is necessary for the further integration of the single market in financial services."
"This report sets out a reasonable approach to devising such a system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to say on the subject of the vote on Bulgaria and Romania I say on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and it is that it was our group that was the motivating force behind yesterday’s debate."
"We wish to stress that the previous enlargement of the European Union was a great success, and that is what we want the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to be."
"In no group in this House were there as many votes in favour of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania as from our group, the PPE-DE."
"We want it to succeed; we also want the accession treaties to apply as a whole and to their fullest extent."
"We have taken a different view as regards the observers."
"The Conference of Presidents, meeting on 9 June, decided that the observers should come on 26 September."
"Let me make it quite clear that the idea of inviting observers – that is, from the ten countries that are now Member States – originally came from our group."
"We are firm advocates of the idea that countries due to join us should send observers."
"We would, however, have preferred it if the observers were to join us in this House one year prior to accession, as once did the observers from the ten new Member States."
"There would have been an opportunity, when we moved the debate on Monday, to inform the House that its President had already, and without our knowledge, extended the invitations."
"This was something of which we needed to be informed."
"This state of affairs has prompted us to withdraw our motion and both the changes to the vote for which we had asked."
"We would have been glad if the House had been able to arrive at a common position."
"As most members of our group were in favour of abstaining from the vote, we did not vote in favour of the joint motion."
"As democrats, we will of course respect the majority that has resulted from it; we will welcome the observers and look forward to working with them."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on the admission of observers from Bulgaria and Romania to the European Parliament."
"I believe that that is an extremely important step forward towards the day marking the full membership of these, the last two ex-Communist states, which, in my opinion, ought to have been accepted with the other eight countries on 1 May 2004."
"Within the Italian national anthem is the line ‘’, which – I will say it for the benefit of the interpreters – means ‘let us all join together for the coming battles’."
"The terrible news that we received a short while ago from London prompts me to say that, if all of the European Member States remain united, we will be able to defend ourselves far better from the insane attacks against democracy, as is happening at this very moment in London."
"Mr President, further to what has been said by our group chairman, I would like to say that I abstained from voting on the resolutions on Romania and Bulgaria, as the fact that the President of this House had already, on Friday, sent a written invitation to the observers meant that neither resolution actually has a procedural basis any more."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have responded to this change in the procedural basis by withdrawing the resolution, and that was the right thing to do."
"As the other side had not done likewise, and the resolutions – to the substance of which we were not opposed – had already been taken, and the deeds had been done, it was not necessary to draft a new resolution."
"I always work on the principle that, if you have sent someone an invitation, you cannot withdraw it if circumstances have not changed."
"While we extend a warm welcome to those to whom the invitations have been sent, and look forward to their working with us, we do believe that what is more important than any date is that equal treatment should be given to all acceding countries, that rules should be obeyed and that their substance should be taken seriously, for, if that were not the case, the public would get the idea that we did not treat everyone equally."
"I have to reiterate that it was incumbent on the President of this House to inform us during Monday’s debate of precisely what he had done."
"Had he done so, we would have saved ourselves a great deal of recrimination, upset and misunderstanding both before and during this debate."
". I warmly welcome this resolution on observers from Bulgaria and Romania."
"The presence of observers from the Bulgarian and Romanian Parliaments can make a useful contribution to the preparations for a successful accession and I look forward to their arrival."
". Mindful of the state of negotiations on Bulgaria’s prospective EU accession, of the difficulties that remain to be overcome and of the most recent accession processes, I feel that, although this process might take longer, the same conditions should be set for Bulgaria and its politicians as those set for other countries at the same stage."
"I therefore welcome the decision adopted by the Conference of Presidents on 9 June to invite the parliaments of Bulgaria and Romania to appoint parliamentary observers and to welcome those representatives from 26 September 2005 until the countries formally join the EU."
". The European Democrats and many others within the PPE-DE Group fully supported the joint motion and acted to oppose negative proposals, which were then withdrawn."
"We regret the fact that this issue was unnecessarily brought before the House at this stage."
"We confirm our commitment to the early enlargement of the EU to include Bulgaria and Romania and to welcoming parliamentary observers from these countries in September."
"This is as soon as possible after signature of the Treaty of Accession, in accordance with precedent."
"We all recognise that much still needs to be done if Bulgaria and Romania are to be ready for accession on time."
"But at this stage it is most unhelpful to talk of delay and prematurely to raise the spectre of safeguard clauses."
"In this regard we reiterate the need to ensure that each country is dealt with on its own merits."
"The elections in Bulgaria on 25 June produced an unclear result."
"It is most important therefore that a stable and broad-based coalition Government, with strong elements of continuity, is put in place as soon as possible to implement the necessary programme of modernisation and reform with urgency and effectiveness."
"We shall continue with the debate on the report by Mrs Saïfi, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on textiles and clothing after 2005 [2004/2265(INI)] (A6-0193/2005)."
"– Mr President, allow me first of all, because we are resuming this debate in very distressing conditions, to offer my sincere condolences to the families of the victims of the attacks that have taken place in London, the terrible consequences of which we are learning minute by minute."
"To return to our debate, the major importance of which was stated this morning, my group, through Caroline Lucas’s speech, has stressed the extent to which it supports the series of temporary measures that are being proposed."
"That said, I should like today to highlight certain points that appear to me to be essential."
"The first concerns two paragraphs in the report that seek to minimise the scope of the REACH Directive, and which we consider to be totally unacceptable."
"Those two paragraphs actually make a very clear recommendation to limit the scope of application of the directive in order to prevent its having – supposedly – harmful consequences for the textile industry and its competitiveness."
"I would remind you that the draft REACH Directive, currently being debated in Parliament, proposes to record, assess and monitor the use of chemical substances that could be harmful to our health and our environment."
"These references are therefore completely unacceptable, because we do not believe that the competitiveness of our industry can be increased at the expense of health, the environment and employees’ working conditions."
"It is all the more unacceptable given that in my region, for instance, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, which is hard hit by the restructuring, we are unfortunately well versed in this type of debate, which advocates curbing environmental demands in order, so they say, to protect jobs."
"That systematically results in a social and environmental disaster."
"I am referring, of course, to the very high number of asbestos victims."
"I am also thinking of the Metaleurop affair, which was the subject of a major debate in this House, and which caused the inhabitants of the region to lose their jobs, their health and their soil, unusable for years."
"This attack against the REACH Directive is therefore entirely misplaced, all the more so since it is expected that its effect on the textile and chemical industry in general will be to foster and drive the capacity for innovation."
"Our discussion ought to be much more focused on the competitive advantage resulting from the low cost of producing textiles products in China."
"In fact we should be aware that these low production costs are due to the exploitation of Chinese workers and to the violent suppression of their demands."
"Allow me to refer to an extract from an Amnesty International report, a relatively recent one since it dates from 2002, which states very clearly that in private companies in China overtime is not only compulsory, but is also unpaid, and that certain factories impose fines on those refusing to work overtime or arriving late for work."
"Chinese workers work between 10 and 12 hours per day and their accommodation and food costs are often deducted directly from their wages."
"It is not unusual for businesses to withhold wages for sometimes two months, or to keep the identity cards of certain workers for several months."
"In short, trade unions are hugely repressed."
"Since we have a structured dialogue with China on human rights – talks moreover took place last week – it seems to me that we ought to highlight the freedom of trade unions."
"The numerous trade unionists today incarcerated in Chinese prisons ought to be the subject of protection measures, protection measures provided for in the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders."
"This is an entirely crucial factor in the debate, which, I believe, has been unjustly concealed."
"– Mr President, since 1 January, hundreds of textile workers have found themselves thrown onto the streets, and tens of SMEs/SMIs have disappeared together with their know-how."
"It is hard to say, but it is not the trousers and T-shirts imported from China that should be counted, but the jobs destroyed and the lives shattered."
"When we hear the Commission and the Council of Ministers say, ‘we are not aware, we were not aware, we could not be aware, it is China’s fault’, I can only cry out: but who are they trying to kid?"
"The decision to abolish the quotas was taken 10 years’ ago with the agreement of all of the governments."
"China has been part of the WTO for nearly four years."
"Over the past two years, nine out of ten textile machines have been bought by China."
"Ultra-modern factories have been built there thanks to direct or indirect capital investments, including from Europe."
"The European governments and institutions knew all of that and have done little or nothing at all."
"They are therefore entirely and jointly responsible."
"The pitiful agreement that Commissioner Mandelson reached with the Beijing authorities will not change anything."
"The ineffable Commissioner Mandelson is like Molière’s doctor: he waits for his patient to die in order to ascertain his illness."
"However, can the general interests of Europe be reconciled with the specific interests of the City: invest in China, Turkey or elsewhere?"
"Today it is the textile industry, but tomorrow it will be the car industry or perhaps the aeronautics industry, as China already manufactures Airbus doors and builds regional aircraft that compete with European, Canadian or Brazilian products."
"You were surprised by the instinctive rejection of your ultraliberal constitution by the majority of those rare people in Europe who had a vote!"
"This overwhelming rejection is, however, the people’s punishment for your policy, including that relating to the textile industry."
"The public do not want that policy to become the basic law of the Union."
"In order to save and develop our textile industry, it is time for a change of policy."
"After introducing a moratorium on the lifting of quotas, the Commission is duty bound to boost and assist research and development and training efforts in this sector."
"The European Central Bank ought to encourage the introduction of low-interest loans for SMEs/SMIs in the sector, promoting employment, research and training."
"The Union should take measures to prevent imports of goods produced by children or slave labour or by workers denied their freedom to participate in trade union activity, and to impose a tax on social dumping."
"Finally, emerging countries should be given assistance to develop their internal markets."
"– Mr President, having congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs Saïfi, I would like to note for the Commission's benefit specific points of dialogue, agreement and/or disagreement with regard to the strategically important European textile and clothing sector."
"I am in favour of opening up markets;"
"I am against neo-protectionism, but in favour of the principle of reciprocity."
"I am in favour of abolishing quotas, but with a parallel obligation to undertake symmetrical obligations with regard to duty-related and technical barriers."
"I am in favour of international competition, but against all forms of its distortion, in favour of free but balanced trade, but against infringements of intellectual and industrial property rights, against imitations and piracy and against aggressive practices of economic, social and ecological dumping."
"I am in favour of agreed solutions with China and memoranda of understanding but, at the same time, against the fragmentary approach being taken to aggressive Chinese exports to Europe."
"I am against what is still, to a large extent, a closed and non-transparent market in China, the maintenance of high import barriers, the application of unfair practices and the lack of adequate cooperation on fundamental investigations into dumping practices."
"I am in favour of the immediate implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean trade zone on the basis of the principle of reciprocity."
"I am in favour of adequate Community financing to strengthen research and innovation, especially in the less advantaged areas of the European Union."
"The pros and cons – and these are not all – are the topical parameters of a real challenge in relations between the European Union and China and a challenge in general for the world trade system."
"To close, I should like to express my sympathy to the families of the victims in London and to add my feelings of repulsion about the incident to those of the British Presidency."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the calamitous effects of the latest round of liberalisation in the textile sector on 1 January 2005 made action urgently necessary, and I am very glad that the Commission has done something."
"Although it deserves a great deal of praise for the speed with which it initiated negotiations and took steps to deal with the situation, these steps could have been more far-reaching and could have been taken sooner."
"I would like to highlight the important role this House has played in this respect."
"It was what we did that compelled the Commission, even more than it would have been, to have recourse to these measures."
"Left to themselves, they might well have done rather less."
"It is, though, to challenges such as these that European policy must respond."
"Here in Europe, we enjoy the great advantage – and it is one of which I am glad – that our consumers are surely among the most mature in the world, and so they should be given the chance to decide what and how to buy, on the basis of far more information and with greater ease."
"We should give thought to the possibility of introducing a ‘made in Europe’ label, which would be able to be carried only subject to certain very stringent criteria being complied with, first among them, of course, compliance with international labour standards, along with social and environmental standards and a ban on the use of child labour."
"If we succeed in this, we will also be able to find another way to respond to this development and make the world rather more socially responsible and cleaner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this debate, which is unfortunately being conducted in a rather deserted Chamber, is important because it relates to one of the most significant sectors for European industry and therefore for the economy and citizens of Europe."
"It is a sector that has been going through a serious crisis for some years now; the crisis has now been accelerated by the introduction of new trade agreements and the fall of many customs barriers, but the sector had already been experiencing great difficulties for a long time."
"It is an important sector in terms of volume of business, the number of workers, its distribution in various European countries and its particular concentration in certain regions."
"As a consequence, a crisis within that sector leads, in a number of local situations, to nothing short of a crisis for the economic and production system."
"As we have already stated on other occasions, we too felt that the Commission’s intervention came slightly late in the day. People had already been calling for it for some time, with the data in hand, in view of what was taking place with regard to imports and their volume."
"Despite this criticism, however, we welcome the action taken by Commissioner Mandelson, whom we invite to oversee not only the agreement reached and its implementation, but also what is happening with regard to other categories of products."
"In actual fact, the issue has not been resolved once and for all, and what has been done for a few categories of products, somehow containing the situation, could be required in the coming months for other categories of products."
"For now we must not waste the time we have gained and we must make use of the recommendations originating from the high level group, from cooperation with entrepreneurs and social partners and from the ongoing talks."
"Action must be undertaken to promote the restructuring and reorganisation of that sector, so as to overcome a profoundly structural crisis."
"I refer in particular to employment, to professional training, to credit assistance, and to all of those innovations that can help such an important sector for Europe to remain that way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dark clouds have hung over the future of the textile and clothing sector ever since Europe and the nation States have been subjected to the dictatorship of the World Trade Organisation, have been enslaved by the free market and the rule of finance over the economy and politics, and have therefore assented to globalisation, which has also often been glorified in this House."
"As a consequence, they have given up protecting industry, production and national labour."
"At the moment, the prospect of exporting many European goods and services has almost been wiped out, because it is impossible to withstand the competition from the so-called ‘Asian Tigers’ with regard to markets in developing countries."
"Added to that is the fact that we are subjected to unparalleled competition within our internal markets, both as a result of goods imported from the countries mentioned, and because of the diabolical mechanism allowing European producers, who have perhaps also benefited from government funding for their activities, to relocate production and to import and market their products in the countries in which the brands originate."
"In view of the terrible predictions made by industry associations, and taking into account that in the absence of national sovereignty, imposed by this bureaucratic Europe, initiative measures cannot be taken by individual Member States, the Commission must expedite policies and directives supporting European businesses and employees in the sector, and prevent the marketing in EU countries of goods produced by the Asian Tigers, which are invading our markets. , they are goods produced without any guarantees for the consumer in terms of the production processes and the materials used, which often have a very high environmental impact, and which, furthermore, do not respect social guarantees and workers’ dignity, in complete contrast to what is stipulated by the World Trade Organisation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening now in the textile sector in the trade between China and Europe presages, in our view, what will happen in many areas over the next few years."
"We are only seeing the first stage."
"That is why our present responses to this issue will serve other areas of our industry in the future."
"We cannot accept the deregulation of international trade without concerning ourselves with the related human, economic and environmental consequences."
"A case in point is the textile sector where the end of quotas was dreaded and where there have been countless company restructurings, indeed outright shutdowns, in the regions in which this industry is still very prominent."
"Faced with these human dramas, we are, in a sense, powerless."
"The introduction of safeguard clauses, the fight against counterfeiting and the supplying of aid for research and information provision are all helpful roads to go down, but we cannot stop there."
"In paragraphs 18 and 24 of her report, Mrs Saïfi rightly emphasises the need to combat all forms of modern slavery and forced labour, as well as the exploitation of children."
"Indeed, it will never be possible for our modern economy, based on, among other things, respect for human dignity, to compete faced with such abuses."
"Mrs Saïfi’s responses, designed to combat these scourges, are insufficient, however. One has to be able to hit where it hurts."
"That is why, together with 50 of our fellow Members representing four political groups, we have lodged an amendment asking the Commission to consider putting in place an ethical tax on products proven to have been manufactured in violation of all the rules of human dignity and, above all, involving the exploitation of children."
"It is crucial that an institution like ours serve more than one generation and that it serve to generate hope."
"Mr President, I sincerely welcome the outcome of the European Commission’s negotiations with the Chinese authorities. This will provide companies affected by the huge rise in imports with some respite in this extremely serious crisis for the textile and clothing sector."
"It is now necessary to monitor the implementation of the safeguard clauses and to evaluate the effects of these measures."
"I should like to put three questions to the Commissioner."
"How do you intend to respond to this resolution by the European Parliament on the future of the textile and clothing industries?"
"How do you intend implementing the High Level Group’s recommendations, which have been received very favourably by Parliament?"
"And what actions do you intend to take to enable companies to have access to the market?"
"For example, might the European Union support trade strategies common to those small- and medium-sized European enterprises that might wish to form consortia with a view to conquering new markets such as China’s?"
"Fellow Members have already said this, but the current crisis in the textile sector was foreseeable, and crises in other sectors of industry are foreseeable in the context of a globalised economy."
"We must all work with ingenuity and tenacity to safeguard the textile, clothing and leather industries, for the lessons we shall learn from this crisis will, in the long run, help us to maintain and develop other sectors of the European economy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the future of textiles and clothing after 2005 without doubt presents a complete picture of the new economic and trade realities at global level."
"Textiles and clothing are a key sector for the European Union and I therefore support Mrs Saïfi’s protest at the absence of the competent Commissioners in this House."
"The sector, which is mainly composed of small- and medium-sized enterprises, today finds itself in great difficulty as a result of Chinese goods, produced and sold extremely cheaply, invading our market."
"Imports from China have increased on a worrying scale, particularly following the definitive abolition of import quotas in January 2005."
"As a consequence, the EU textile and clothing sector finds itself under unprecedented pressure."
"Our factories are closing down with increasing frequency and thousands of workers are left without jobs."
"In Italy, 24 000 jobs were lost in 2004 and over 66 000 in the last three years."
"It must be stressed that this problem also afflicts all of the developing countries that used to export their goods to Europe and that are now no longer able to withstand the Chinese competition."
"As a consequence, factories are not only closing in Europe, but also in Sri Lanka, in Pakistan, in Morocco and in the entire Mediterranean area."
"What can we do?"
"The appearance on the world trade scene of new, aggressive global players, in particular China and India, makes it necessary to review the traditional objectives of Community trade policy, characterised by the maximum opening up of the markets to assist in promoting European industry worldwide."
"The current scene and the way it is likely to develop, however, dictate a more prudent approach, aimed at protecting European industry in the face of unbalanced and destructive competition."
"The following actions need to be implemented urgently: approving without delay – as Commissioner Michel stated in this House this morning – the proposal for a regulation for the compulsory marking of origin of goods imported into the European Union; laying down industrial policies aimed at providing support to the sectors most exposed to international competition, including through the use of the Structural Funds; strengthening the trade protection instruments available to European businesses, including anti-dumping measures – as has been done for leather shoes – and anti-subsidy measures as well as the safeguard clauses; making the fight against counterfeiting a European priority, by supporting Commissioner Frattini’s initiatives; and steering the Commission’s choices towards bilateral agreements."
"If Hong Kong were to collapse like Cancún, there would be no time to relaunch the multilateral negotiations."
"To conclude, I call for a review of the position on the new policy on chemical substances – the REACH Directive – particularly in order to guarantee the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, many thanks to our fellow member, Mrs Saïfi, for her excellent initiative and her report."
"I very much want to emphasise how important this subject is."
"A common European market requires common rules."
"The same rules of competition must be applied to all the participants in the European textile market."
"That is part of what respect for competition means."
"China represents the ideology of state enterprises."
"No one will be able to accept advantages being accorded to Chinese enterprises."
"Our national governments are not entitled to accord advantages to national enterprises."
"The Commission would immediately pronounce a ban."
"It would, however, be a mistake for our national industries not to react, faced with China."
"That is why I am in favour of applying the principle of reciprocity of trade, as everyone could benefit from it."
"It is therefore extremely important to ensure that the High Level Group’s recommendations are properly applied and to be vigilant when it comes to properly implementing the Shanghai agreements."
"– Mr President, the recent EU-China agreement is a positive development and we must acknowledge the important contribution made by Commissioner Mandelson to the final outcome."
"This agreement gives the European textile industry some breathing space but, more importantly, it allows for crucial strategic decisions to be taken even now as regards the regrouping and modernisation of the textile sector in Europe."
"Today, international developments in competition are forcing companies into making progress in leaps and bounds, into technological modernisation, innovation, research, technology and lifelong learning."
"That is why the European Union must develop the structural policies and Structural Funds for the textile industry, develop the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development, create a specific Community programme for the development of the textile and clothing sectors, dynamically develop the institutional possibilities offered by the WTO to overturn China's social and environmental dumping and combat the problem of child labour by taking, where necessary, specific defensive trade measures, by safeguarding and defending free and equal access to third country markets and pure competition for European products, by defending consumer rights, by combating piracy and imitations and protecting intellectual property rights and by taking initiatives for a new integrated cooperation agreement with China to replace the 1985 cooperation agreement, which has basically been overtaken by international developments."
"I should like to take advantage of Commissioner Michel's presence here to finish by saying that the Commission will also need to step up its investigation into uncontrolled imports of Chinese shoes, which have created serious problems in European countries such as Greece."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to express, on my own behalf and that of the Commission, our sincere condolences to the victims, and to the families of the victims, of the atrocious and barbarous acts that have taken place in London."
"I should also like to express my complete solidarity with the British authorities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I note that, behind a few inevitable and no doubt necessary criticisms, the general tone of the speeches is fairly favourable to the Commission’s approach."
"That is already the case with the draft resolution, even if a number of people consider that still further steps could be taken, for example when it comes to social norms, protection against China or industrial restructuring."
"Even so, I should like to revisit a few of the concerns expressed."
"The agreement with China is of concern to, among others, Mr Silva Peneda, Mr Guerrero, Mr Caspary, Mr Allister and Mrs Martens."
"I would say that Mrs Martens found the right words to express this concern."
"Like the majority of those who follow these issues, she thinks that the agreement with the Chinese will allow European industry some breathing space between now and 2008 and that this agreement is therefore good in itself."
"I wish to point out that this agreement is to be applied strictly and that the quantities imported are strictly accounted for within the framework of genuine self-limitation quotas."
"With regard to the safeguard clauses provided for by China’s act of accession to the WTO, it will be specified that the European Union has not formally relinquished these, but the agreement with the Chinese is obviously global and designed specifically to avert such conflict in administering the sector as might arise from the harsh measures constituted by these clauses."
"These clauses would therefore only be applied if this were really justified, something that does not seem to me to be the case, precisely because the agreement with China covers the most sensitive products, that is to say almost half of the Chinese textile sector liberalised in January 2005."
"Mr Allister who, I see, is generally well disposed towards this agreement, will appreciate that the management of Chinese trade thus put in place obviates the necessity for the anti-dumping measures that he was recommending."
"Finally, I should like to reassure Mr Caspary that the agreement with China will enable volumes to be stabilised, with a reasonable annual rate of increase of 8% to 12%."
"It therefore protects European manufacturers but, until 2008, also stabilises importers’ stocks."
"Flexibility clauses are envisaged within the framework of the negotiations under way with the Chinese in order to mitigate the limitation measures, to the advantage of importers."
"Allow me to say a few words about respect for social standards on the part of developing countries."
"I would say in reply to Mr Silva Peneda that, although the European Union and the Commission actively promote such standards, developing countries criticise us on this subject, interpreting our demands as a form of protectionism in disguise."
"Matters are therefore not always as simple as they appear."
"Developing countries constitute the vast majority of ILO members and reject the link between trade and social standards."
"However, the Commission is not giving up and is proposing systematically to introduce into any preferential free trade agreement negotiations a withdrawal of preferences clause in the event of non-compliance with these standards."
"It is also acting positively."
"For example, the Council followed its lead on 27 June 2005 after we had proposed making new trade concessions to Sri Lanka, because the latter had just ratified the ILO’s eight basic conventions."
"The policy is fairly clear: ban child labour in exchange for abolishing customs duties on exports to the European Union."
"It is a question of making a link between multilateral trade negotiations and social standards."
"We cannot say what will be decided in Hong Kong in December, but the Commission’s very strong attachment to this link can be pointed out right now."
"If he had been able to be present in the House this morning, my colleague in charge of trade, Peter Mandelson, would have certainly explained how, in Turin on 26 May 2005, he intervened along these lines within the framework of a meeting organised jointly with the ILO."
"In this area, as in others, many practical measures are possible."
"For example, serious thought is being given to a partnership and social dialogue structure with China where textiles are concerned."
"I would return now to the European Union’s trade policy priorities by way of replying to Mr Belder, among others."
"Implicit in the draft resolution is the need to give priority to the Euro-Mediterranean zone, particularly in relation to Asia."
"The Commission largely shares this point of view."
"Developing trade between the two banks of the Mediterranean should help the development of this region and partly resolve the serious problems, such as immigration, that are common to the north and south of the area and that extend beyond the problems relating to textiles."
"There are other priorities: Africa, in connection with which I would refer you to the G8, meeting today in Scotland; the Least Developed Countries; and the poor countries of Asia."
"The Commission therefore agrees with Mrs Saïfi on this point: a number of comparative advantages need to be maintained in favour of those to whom the European Union intends to give preference."
"That is why, for example, it very strongly supports putting in place the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin, which should be adopted by the Council this autumn."
"I would, moreover, take this opportunity to invite Parliament to help the Commission put pressure on the Council in order to speed up the adoption of the protocols in question."
"Finally, it should be noted, on the question of trade preferences, that, since this year, the European Union has withdrawn most of its trade preferences from China."
"This negative priority is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the draft resolution."
"Mr Zingaretti, in particular, referred to the trade protection measures."
"If third countries subsidise their exports, there are responses available."
"In fact, the European Union has a whole arsenal of responses available to it."
"These include antidumping duties or anti-subsidy measures."
"For example, a week ago, the Commission opened an antidumping investigation in connection with certain types of Chinese and Indian shoes."
"The matter was discussed. We are not in the business of pious hopes in this House."
"I can assure you that these measures are taken very seriously by these two countries."
"When it comes to counterfeiting, which is Mrs Muscardini’s concern and one that is shared by the Commission, the European Union has made progress."
"Since July 2004, a new arrangement is in force enabling companies to ask for the customs authorities to confiscate goods likely to be counterfeit."
"What we have here is a unified, free and simple Community procedure, intended as it is, in part, for small textile companies representing, as one MEP rightly said, 90% of the sector."
"However, does not greater efficiency demand, above all, that more be done to integrate the European customs authorities?"
"A Community Customs Code has existed since 1992, but it is applied by 25 national customs authorities, which are sometimes difficult to coordinate."
"Fraudsters are often clever at exploiting such situations."
"A lot therefore remains to be done in this area."
"On the subject of intellectual property, which is a very sensitive subject in the textile sector, recent years have been characterised by a veritable explosion in statistics."
"I should like to point out that China’s accession to the WTO now imposes obligations upon it and also gives the European Union the option of taking more vigorous action if China does not comply with the obligations arising from its accession."
"I would therefore say to the representatives of the European left, who do not want the European Union to fund relocations, that we are in complete agreement."
"It must simply be pointed out that there is not a single clause along these lines in any preferential trade agreement."
"I do not think it right to suggest things that are untrue or to allow them to be said."
"Mr Rull and Mr Karim too spoke about the industrial restructuring of the textile sector."
"I think that Mr Karim is right: European industry has been urgently awaiting a miracle from the Commission since the beginning of 2005 and the liberalisation of the Chinese textile sector."
"It has already been said, but I should like to state emphatically that liberalisation was decided upon ten years ago, in 1994."
"A number of Member States have also been able to prepare for it."
"The crisis in the textile sector is not, therefore, European in nature. It affects only those Member States that are unprepared."
"It must also be pointed out that industrial restructuring measures are largely the responsibility of the Member States."
"In its sphere of competence, the Commission proposed to reserve a portion of the Structural Funds for those sectors undergoing industrial restructuring following crises just like that in the textile sector, a matter now being discussed by the Council."
"In December 2004, the Commission – and, more specifically, Commissioner Potocnik – together with Euratex (that is to say, the European Apparel and Textile Organisation) announced an initiative known as the ‘European Textile Technology Platform’, one of whose purposes is to encourage technological innovation and so promote more upmarket products in the face of Chinese competition."
"It is true, as Mrs Lucas very rightly said, that the real victims of the liberalisation of the textile sector are the poorest countries, otherwise known as the Least Developed Countries, and that is precisely because they manufacture products with little technological content, such as cotton tee-shirts."
"Europe has the resources to go upmarket and to specialise in textile sectors."
"I am thinking of fabrics with very high technological content, in respect of which Chinese competition is more limited."
"Protection is, admittedly, necessary as a temporary measure, but innovation is surely the real solution."
"I am sorry that this resolution has not been adopted from today for, on behalf of the Commission, I broadly share the approach proposed by it."
"I should like to make a few more comments."
"Mr Leichtfried and Mrs Toia say that these are good measures but that the Commission could have reacted more quickly."
"The Commission responded in five months, after having verified that harm was indeed being caused."
"Where the Chinese are concerned, there can be no question of imposing quotas lightly."
"Mr Romagnoli, I should like to repeat what I have just said."
"I challenge you to say by what precise mechanism the Commission might encourage relocations."
"It is not true that it would do so."
"Mrs Laperrouze welcomes the agreement, rightly I believe."
"Regarding the High Level Group, a plan for identifying trade restrictions was presented by the Commission to the High Level Group on 14 June."
"It was presented by more than one Commissioner, namely Mr Mandelson and Mr Verheugen, and Mrs Saïfi was also present."
"Regarding Mr Tajani’s speech, in which he talked of marks of origin, the Commission is preparing a draft regulation to make such marks compulsory upon import."
"You must know, however, that the Member States are divided on this issue, a factor that is obviously slowing down progress on the matter."
"Regarding the reciprocity mentioned in Mrs Lienemann’s speech, I agree, but this needs to be discussed within the WTO."
"Allow me to conclude by drawing attention to two small considerations that are by no means irrelevant."
"An Airbus represents 20 million Chinese shirts."
"It is worth reflecting upon this and bearing in mind that trade is not a one-way affair."
"Trade operates in all directions and, by focusing upon one product in particular, one can sometimes significantly lose out on another product."
"That is something worth repeating."
"I should also like to comment upon the highly ideological charge I heard made against liberal Europe, about which so many bad things are said."
"I just want to point out that it is liberal Europe that has made peace possible and that has led to the wealth that has been created no doubt being better distributed and shared out here in Europe than anywhere else."
"Collectivist or Marxist Europe, about which some people are clearly nostalgic, certainly cannot, in my view, offer the same track record as what is known as liberal Europe."
"As for trade union freedom, which was talked about in the same breath, it is guaranteed everywhere in the liberal states."
"I have not yet seen it genuinely guaranteed in totalitarian states, even left-wing ones."
"I say this simply because of my own liberal affiliations and because, from time to time, it is worth repeating."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in September."
"In view of the inroads China is making into the EU market, this report is too little, too late."
"The future of 170 000 companies and 2.5 million workers in Europe is at stake, as well as a market worth EUR 185 billion."
"One need look no further than the US for a good example of how not to take decisions on this matter."
"Within two years of quotas being lifted in 2002, China had gained a 65% market share in the country."
"The Chinese problem consists not only in cheap clothing imports, but also in unfair practices such as state subsidies, tax breaks, land distribution and subsidised energy and transport."
"If we wish to stop China in its tracks and to keep jobs in Europe, we should convene an extraordinary WTO session to discuss how we can prevent global trade being dominated by a single supplier."
"At the same time, we should launch the emergency procedure provided for in the guidelines for invoking the safeguard clauses, and set up a new programme to secure funding for regions where the sector provides jobs for workers who would otherwise be unemployed, and ensures that women are not forced into inferior jobs."
"We should make funding available for restructuring under the new Financial Perspective, and for new solutions and the implementation of research results in the SME sector under the Seventh Framework Programme."
"EU policies should be targeted at modernising industry, as otherwise the Electronic Proposal Tool will never be anything but a dead duck."
"The governments of heavily industrialised Member States should be granted derogations from the ban on subsidies, and an impact assessment must be carried out for REACH in order to ensure that it does not act as a brake on the competitiveness of European industry."
"A consolidated market should be set up under the EU-Mediterranean agreements, and a similar platform should be established in the Baltic region."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Duarte Freitas, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union [COM(2004)0687 – C6-0201/2004 – 2004/0247(CNS)] (A6-0195/2005)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, particularly its draftsman, Mr Freitas, together with the members and draftsmen of the Committees on Budgets, International Trade and Regional Development, for all the work they have done on this report."
"On 28 June 2001, the Council adopted a reform of the agricultural support scheme in the outermost regions of the Union."
"These measures go back to 1991 and 1992, and they have proved their effectiveness in promoting agriculture and the supply of these regions with agricultural products."
"Managing them has, however, posed a number of problems."
"The two strands of the Posei scheme, which constitutes the specific arrangements for supplying and supporting local producers, are characterised by administrative inflexibility."
"With regard to the specific supply arrangements, the Commission is required to legislate for what are often only modest variations in the quantities of products to be supplied in the outermost regions."
"This is not an efficient administrative framework."
"The support schemes for local production comprise a range of as many as 56 micro-measures laid down by Council regulations."
"It is not possible to adapt these measures without interinstitutional legislative procedures, a state of affairs that prevents any rapid response by the Community when it comes to adapting the support measures to specific situations."
"That is why the Commission proposes a change in philosophy regarding both the aid given to these regions and the adoption of a participatory method of decision-making."
"The new system would also allow the measures to be adapted quickly, taking account of the specific features of these regions."
"The draft regulation envisages the presentation of one programme for each outermost region in the Member States concerned."
"These programmes will comprise two sections: one on the specific supply arrangements for agricultural products – agricultural inputs or products designed for transformation – which are essential in terms of human consumption in the outermost region concerned, and another section on support for local production."
"With regard to financing, the regulation affects neither the sources of financing nor the level of Community support."
"The Community will finance the programme under the EAGGF Guarantee Section up to 100% within the limits of an annual ceiling laid down by the Council regulation."
"A part of this support will be compulsorily reserved for support for local agricultural production."
"The amounts are calculated on the basis of the average of the amounts spent on financing the specific supply arrangements during the reference period 2001 – 2003 and on the basis of the ceilings for expenditure applicable to support for local production."
"A portion of the subsidised amounts will be integrated into the direct payments under Regulation 1782/2003."
"They are among the ceilings to be found in Annex 8 of this regulation."
"I turn now to the reform of the sugar arrangements and to the outermost regions."
"Although they do not form part of the Commission proposal, I should like to make a number of comments concerning the reform of the sugar arrangements and the outermost regions."
"The Commission is well aware that the characteristics of sugar production in the outermost regions of the Community are appreciably different to what they are in the other regions."
"That is why financial support should be given to this sector through the granting of subsidies to farmers in the outermost regions."
"The restructuring arrangements will be financed through the deduction of a specific amount from all the quotas applicable to sweeteners."
"The sugar companies in the outermost regions will not fall under these arrangements."
"These regions will thus be placed on an equal footing with the ACP countries in terms of price."
"This is an approach considered reasonable by the Commission."
"What is more, the French outermost regions, which were the only ones to benefit from support to outlets, will receive an additional amount of EUR 15 million corresponding to current outlet measures in respect of the reference period."
"The direct payment in favour of the outermost regions will be included within the single framework of the Posei programme which we are debating and, as a consequence, excluded from the single payment arrangements."
"The French and Portuguese outermost regions have benefited in the same way as the other Member States from the same increase in the amount of their direct payments, corresponding to the reduction in additional prices."
"In the case of the French outermost regions, the amount increases from EUR 39 million to EUR 44 million and, in the case of the Portuguese outermost regions, to just over EUR 1 million."
"I now come to the Commission’s position concerning the amendments."
"In view of what I have just said, the Commission is able to accept Amendments 1, 8, 9, 18, 23, 24, 27, 28 and 32 and is able in part to accept Amendment 35."
"Unfortunately, the Commission does not wish, and is not in a position, to accept the other amendments proposed."
". –The archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, and the French overseas departments, are referred to as the EU’s outermost regions and are characterised by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate and economic dependence on a few products."
"This concept of outermost regions was introduced into the EU’s primary law in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, and constitutes the legal basis for the Council to adopt specific measures applicable to the outermost regions, acting on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting Parliament."
"As the Commissioner mentioned, agricultural programmes specifically designed to offset the problems faced by the outermost regions have been in place since 1991 and 1992."
"These programmes have encompassed two types of measure: firstly, specific supply arrangements, to support the supply to these regions of agricultural products destined for human and animal consumption, processing in local industries and agricultural inputs; and secondly, support for local agricultural production."
"These measures have had a considerable impact and have had a positive influence on reviving the economies of the outermost regions."
"As has also been mentioned, however, experience over the years has shown that greater flexibility is needed in the management of these two schemes."
"The proposal currently before us maintains the previous programmes, but proposes a radical change of philosophy, whereby the management of programmes is made easier and the decision-making process is brought closer to those principally affected, namely the regions themselves, whilst at the same time maintaining the level of support granted in the past."
"The Commission’s intention to decentralise decision making and simplify the management arrangements is to be welcomed, as is the approach based on encouraging participation in decision making and speeding up the implementation of measures responding to their specific needs."
"I therefore broadly agree with the Commission’s proposal. There are some issues, however, that should be improved upon, and to this end some amendments have been adopted that form part of my report."
"Firstly, I feel that, given that there are no export refunds, no restrictions should be placed on the possibility of exporting or re-dispatching processed products that have received support under the specific supply arrangements."
"This is because production and the market in the outermost regions are often too small to guarantee the sustainability of local processing industries, which are essential for the survival of some agricultural crops and for a degree of diversification. Consequently, in some cases these industries need to complement their supplies with raw materials from outside and to export or dispatch their products to ensure their viability."
"I must also express my satisfaction with the measures announced by the Commission for the outermost regions in the proposed reform of the sugar common market organisation."
"Yet there is one specific question that this does not resolve. I refer to beet production in the Azores, involving the Sinaga company, which will have no chance of survival, either under the regulation currently in force or with the Commission’s proposal."
"Secondly, given the time limits laid down in the draft regulation for the submission of programmes and for their approval, I feel that the date scheduled for their application needs to be made more flexible, in order to remove the risk that the current regulation will be revoked before the programmes arising from the new legislation can enter into force."
"Thirdly, I also wish to stress the importance of introducing the possibility of granting derogations for the outermost regions in the area of rural development, taking account of the specific features and vulnerable parts of this area, thereby providing continuity for the current regime."
"Fourthly, as regards the basis for defining the financial ceilings, I feel that the reference period of 2001 to 2003 is inappropriate for defining the amount of funding, as this takes no account of the impact of changes made under the 2001 reform."
"My report therefore suggests that, in the calculation of financial ceilings, account should also be taken of exemptions granted under the specific supply arrangements."
"As well as representing a fairer deal for the outermost regions, this approach does not inflate the amounts involved in support currently granted to those regions."
"Lastly, I should like to congratulate my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the support that they have given me and, in particular, the Members from the outermost regions, who have worked very hard on this process."
"I should also like to thank the politicians and the representatives of the socio-economic sectors of these regions for their dedication and support while I was drawing up this report."
"Commissioner, I wish to point out that this report was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I trust that Parliament will take this into account when it gives its final opinion on this issue as expressed via the vote."
"I trust that the Commission will appreciate the enormous importance of this issue to the outermost regions, and I naturally ask the Members of this House to vote in favour of this report."
". – I should like to congratulate Mr Freitas and all of the (many) Members from the outermost regions and elsewhere involved in drawing up this report."
"I wish to tell the Commission that over the course of recent years we have already managed to achieve some positive results, by improving the provisions of this regulation on issues such as the aromatic wine known as and dairy quotas specific to the Azores; indeed, we have also been successful in blocking the Portuguese Government from transferring those quotas to the mainland."
"We already have the beginnings of an agreement on the extremely tricky issue of sugar beet and sugar cane refining in the Azores, to which the rapporteur referred."
"That being said, I wish to draw the Commission’s attention to the problem that Article 4 bans ‘processed products’ in some language versions, and ‘products incorporating products imported under this scheme’ in other language versions."
"This issue is dealt with extremely badly in the Commission’s proposal; it may be highly technical, but it is also of major importance."
"I call on the Commission to do what it has done in other areas: to channel all its efforts into addressing this problem, to listen to what we have to say and to see what this may mean on the ground in these outermost regions."
"With this kind of attitude, we can achieve a positive outcome on this issue, too."
"Lastly, I wish to offer a special word of thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, who supported the vitally important strengthening of this programme. The Committee on Budgets does not always act in this manner, but this does illustrate the committee’s great concern with the interests of the outermost regions."
"Thank you to everyone, and let us hope that the final hurdles can be overcome."
". – I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Freitas on his outstanding report, and in particular on his dedication and his preparedness to accept amendments and suggestions from other committees – from all committees, in fact – not least those of the Committee on Regional Development, for which I was the draftsman."
"I also commend him on the way in which he accepted suggestions from all Members from the outermost regions, who strove hard to resolve this problem that affects everyone."
"Although the Commission’s draft regulation is to be welcomed, some amendments were needed in order to ensure the continued effectiveness of a scheme that has made a considerable contribution towards regional development, from the point of view of the citizens, businesses and, especially, agri-food undertakings."
"Of the suggestions and amendments that we tabled, I shall mention only the most relevant ones."
"The first of these concerns the annual amounts of funding to support measures for agriculture in the outermost regions. We share the rapporteur’s view that the 2001-2003 calculation submitted in the Commission’s proposal was inappropriate, given that 2001 was a transitional year in which the POSEI agriculture programmes were reformed, and that those reforms only came into effect in 2002."
"We therefore suggest that a three-year reference period of 2001 to 2004 would be more suitable."
"The second aspect concerns exemption from customs duties."
"It makes no sense for the Commission’s proposal to ignore this substantial gain for the outermost regions, hence the suggestion that the amounts granted in the three-year reference period be taken into account in setting the future ceiling."
"The third aspect is that of exports."
"We share the belief that, in order to satisfy what the Commission said in its statement, we should look into the possibility of creating a regional integration area, we should support the rural world in these regions and, to this end, we should pave the way for independent exports of processed products and imported products under the special supply arrangements to third countries, neighbouring countries of course, or to the rest of the Community."
"I have no doubt that this will solve the problems of various agri-food companies in all regions, but especially the sugar beet production industry in the Azores, as has been mentioned previously."
"In the light of these aspects, I hope that the Commission will take on board the opinion not only of these Members, but of Parliament as a whole."
". –I should first like to congratulate Mr Freitas on his outstanding report on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions."
"I share and support the rapporteur’s positions, in particular those concerned with making the management of support schemes for agriculture in the outermost regions more flexible and with the prime objective of adopting a decentralised approach that encourages participation and that ensures that the measures in force are, where necessary, implemented swiftly."
"In the context of this philosophy, the Member States are now planning to submit to the Commission one programme per outermost region, which will cover the two strands of the Posei agriculture schemes – the specific supply arrangements and the support scheme for local production."
"Each programme will contain a description of the current agricultural situation, its weaknesses and potential, the proposed strategy, the expected impact and a timetable of implementation. This will enable each outermost region to define its own agriculture development strategy to cater to its specific needs."
"Accordingly, due account can finally be taken of the double insularity faced by producers and operators on some islands that form part of certain outermost regions."
"I also wish to highlight the rapporteur’s suggestions as regards developing an effective policy to help small- and medium-sized enterprises in the agri-food sector of the outermost regions. This measure has had a positive effect on the agriculture sector, on jobs and on trade."
"I cannot finish without mentioning a good example of the implementation of the concept of outermost region enshrined in Article 299(2) of the Treaty."
"The agricultural and supply policies provide for special treatment tailored to the specific reality of each outermost region, and this special treatment has been improved upon and strengthened in the light of experience gained with the implementation of the Posei schemes."
"This certainly sets an example that ought to be followed when adapting the remaining common EU policies to the specific characteristics of the outermost regions."
". – I offer warm greetings to you, Mr President, and to all of the Members of this House, on my behalf and on behalf of my fellow Socialist Member of Parliament and friend, Mr Capoulas Santos."
"In light of the specific features of the outermost regions, such as remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult climate and economic dependence on a few products, all of which combined have a detrimental effect on their development, these regions rightly enjoy special protection, which is enshrined in Article 299 of the Treaty."
"This protection is, moreover, the result of successive decisions by Parliament, the proceedings of the Seville European Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, and the conclusions of the third report on economic and social cohesion. Accordingly, it must, as a matter of urgent priority, be translated fully into practical reality."
"The Commission issued a timely communication aimed at establishing a stronger partnership for the outermost regions entitled ‘a stronger partnership’, which deserves a favourable response."
"The report before us – on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions – forms part of the process of implementing that strategy."
"The agriculture sector is hugely important to these regions, and this report represents substantial and noteworthy progress in this regard."
"Nevertheless, the initiative can and must be improved considerably, and this report by Mr Freitas can play a substantial role in achieving such an improvement."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Freitas on his dedication and positive attitude during the process of drawing up the report, and those congratulations are extended to all of those Members who were actively involved and who made relevant contributions towards finding appropriate solutions to the specific characteristics of each region."
"Special mention, in this connection, goes to the draftsmen Mr Casaca of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Jardim Fernandes of the Committee on Regional Development and Mr Assis of the Committee on International Trade."
"Although the proposal for a regulation before us does not provide for changing the sources of funding or the pace of support, it will, however, introduce greater flexibility in implementing different measures and better adaptation to the specific features of each outermost region. This will be achieved by means of stepping up participation in the decision-making process, which is a positive step and one that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports."
"The Commission’s proposal suffers, however, from shortcomings and gaps on a number of aspects."
"We now have the opportunity to plug those gaps, on the platform of the broad consensus that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development managed to attract through the proposals it adopted, not to mention the opinions adopted by other committees."
"We therefore have ample reason to call on Members from all sides of this House to use their vote on the relevant amendments that have been tabled to express their solidarity with some of the more problematic regions of the EU. After all, we want to see the Union become more economically and socially cohesive."
"We also call on the Commission to welcome the most relevant proposals adopted in this House and we feel sure that both it and Parliament will be equal to the task of meeting the legitimate expectations of the people and authorities of the outermost regions."
"Today we have seen a degree of openness on the part of Mr Michel; time will tell if there is more to come in the future."
"This is the only way in which the objectives which were clearly and objectively set out in the preamble to the Council’s proposal for a regulation under discussion and which we fully endorse can be achieved more satisfactorily and more quickly."
"What we really need is to work towards strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion in Europe."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating Mr Freitas on his balanced report."
"The outermost regions of the European Union suffer from geographical, climatic and economic conditions that are adverse in comparison with those prevailing in the others, a situation the particularities of which the EU has acknowledged and, indeed, mentioned in Article 299(2) of the European Communities Treaty."
"It is therefore the EU’s business to ensure that its more distant regions can share in the development of the whole."
"As agriculture is an important means of support for the economies of the outermost regions, I welcome the Commission’s proposal for a Council regulation on special measures for it."
"Measures of this kind, formerly provided by programmes going as far back as 1991, are now indispensable to the outermost regions’ development, ensuring on the one hand that these can be supplied with the agricultural products they need for life, while also, on the other, promoting the local production, marketing and processing of such products."
"By providing for decentralisation and simplified management tools, the Commission proposal ensures a more flexible approach to the EU’s outermost regions, and this is something that I very much welcome, believing as I do that the best solutions to problems are, as a rule, to be found locally, where there is most knowledge of a given region’s particular circumstances."
"This is the only way in which we will, in the long term, be able to make the outermost regions more competitive, enabling them to make up for lost time and catch up with the rest of the EU, for suspending, on a permanent basis, the rules of the internal market or using money from the Structural Funds cannot be sustainable solutions in the long term."
"Mr President, I speak as a representative of a new Member State where the agricultural sector is crucial to the existence of many citizens, and where the lack of adequate subsidies for farmers has had a severe impact."
"I am therefore delighted that this particular Community initiative has been launched, with the aim of supporting agriculture in regions that are geographically remote and that have only limited access to the common market."
"The most interesting aspects of this report would appear to be the concern that crops which have traditionally been grown in a certain area, and which are characteristic of that area, should continue to be cultivated, and be exported throughout the EU with a special EU."
"The EU should provide particular support to local and non-industrial manufacturing processes, since the products of such processes have a better taste and flavour."
"As I see it, enabling cheaper exports to neighbouring third countries would also be one way in which we could provide appropriate assistance to outermost regions."
"This idea would merit consideration by the Community as a whole, including the new Member States, which have long-standing ties with their non-EU neighbours."
"This would solve the problems we face with regard to the poor eastern regions of the EU, which are located in Poland and elsewhere and which share borders with Belarus, Russia and Ukraine."
"The economies of these Member States have suffered as a result of the restrictions imposed on trade with those countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the effectiveness of the Posei programmes has been proven and recognised by the European Commission, the latter considered, only two years after the last reform was implemented, that a change was needed to the ways in which the specific supply arrangements and the support for local lines of production in the outermost regions were managed."
"The European Commission has, however, committed itself to ensuring that the proposed reform will not bring into question either the timeliness of the measures or the way in which they operate and will not affect either the sources of financing or the level of Community support."
"The fact is that certain conditions laid down by the draft regulation imply more complex evaluation procedures, programming, monitoring and control for the beneficiaries than does the present framework."
"Moreover, the budget proposed for the specific supply arrangements, calculated on the basis of unduly strict historical references, would, contrary to the Commission’s promises, amount in reality to restricting the level of Community support and be in danger of curbing the development of the industrial sectors concerned, whereas if the Poseidom were not subject to any change until the end of 2006, the specific supply arrangements would continue to progress at their present rate and would therefore increase substantially."
"Everyone is now agreed in recognising that, without the Poseidom, it would be impossible for the diversification sectors in the overseas departments to develop."
"Implementing different arrangements now would be tantamount to saying that all the efforts made to date, by both the European Union and local farmers, have been to no avail."
"The excellent report prepared by Mr Freitas achieves a balanced compromise between the need for reform and the preservation of a system of support for sustainable agriculture on the farms of small economic size of the outermost regions."
"I sincerely hope that the Commission and, above all, the Council will be very much inspired by Parliament’s opinion and avoid even partially bringing the current support measures into question."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Freitas for the work he has done as rapporteur, which I believe to be very satisfactory."
"I would also like to thank our Union’s Commission for the work it is doing in favour of the outermost regions."
"I believe that Mr Michel has said it very clearly."
"This is a success story: over the last 14 or 15 years, the outermost regions have benefited from special treatment via these programmes — Poseidon, Poseima and Poseican — which have allowed four million citizens, living on islands spread throughout the world — in the Central Atlantic, in the Caribbean and in the Indian Ocean — to have a decent way of life that is consistent with their needs."
"In short, there has been a clear improvement in the living conditions in these regions."
"This has been achieved by means of a very reasonable procedure, which consists, on the one hand, of allowing agricultural surpluses from the rest of the Union’s territories to enter our territory and also enabling other parts of the world to import products. On the other hand, it prevents those imports that are necessary for maintaining living conditions from destroying agriculture and other elements of the local economy."
"The proposal now being presented to us by the Commission is intended to make the system we had more flexible."
"As the Commissioner has said, it was necessary to adopt 56 micromeasures that were not in reality in line with the importance of this type of organisation."
"The amendments being presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are aimed at making the mechanism more flexible and must also be accepted."
"I would like to point out — perhaps for those people who are not aware of the situation — that what justifies this special treatment and this flexibility for the outermost regions is their complete inability to compete within the Union’s markets. In other words, the aid to the farmers of the Canary Islands, La Réunion, Madeira or the Azores is in no way going to prejudice the rest of the European Union, since the competition conditions are the same."
"On the contrary, I would say that these regions are going to facilitate the development of the economy in the rest of the Union, since they will have markets with a degree of purchasing power that benefit the whole of the European Union."
"I therefore hope that this House will approve the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development by a large majority and that these measures will continue to function to our benefit and to the benefit of the rest of the European Union’s territory."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for his work."
"There is a need for special measures to be taken in all the European Union’s policy areas, particularly, of course in agriculture, and especially in its outermost regions."
"I myself am from a region, Lower Austria’s , which was for decades on the fringes of Western Europe and of the free world, and it too had to contend with some similar problems, such as problematic topography and climate, inadequate resources, a small and regional market and a scarcity of jobs."
"The Member State in question has been helped by support programmes from the European Union to build up innovative and self-supporting agriculture and to create jobs."
"Solidarity in real life is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union."
"It is unfortunate that several Heads of State do not see that so clearly, particularly as regards the common agricultural policy."
"Following on from what the Council resolved at its summits in Brussels and Luxembourg, productive agriculture must be possible throughout the EU, in every region and location."
"At the end of the day, it is the disadvantaged regions that need agriculture to help bring people employment and prosperity."
"More than that, the support measures we are discussing today enable our model of multifunctional and sustainable agriculture to function as an example to those in all the parts of the EU that are far from the continent."
"In many states adjoining the regions in question – and here I am particularly thinking of South America – an agricultural industry comparable to that in the USA is in the process of being developed."
"We are now being presented with an opportunity to create a sustainable economy by other means – the right ones in economic, environmental and social terms."
"Mr President, we are discussing a regulation today which may go unnoticed amongst the serious problems facing the Union at the moment but which, for the agricultural sectors of the outermost regions, is of fundamental importance and which in many cases is a matter of survival."
"I would essentially like to stress two aspects of the draft we are discussing today: firstly, the maintenance of the funding, which was approved in the last reform in 2001 and which, given the current situation, is no small issue; and, secondly, the decentralisation of management that gives local authorities the power to introduce the necessary flexibility in accordance with the needs of the agricultural sectors at any given moment."
"In other words, there is no intention to make changes in terms of the level of the aid, but it is intended to create a more flexible instrument in the field of management, as indicated by Mr Duarte Freitas in his Amendments 4 and 21."
"The rapporteur’s Amendment 27 intends to give legal coverage for imports of C sugar in certain outermost regions, particularly in the Azores, the Canary Islands and Madeira; there are certainly obstacles here, but I hope that the Commission can analyse the matter and take it into account in order to find the most appropriate solution."
"In his speech, Commissioner Michel made an ambiguously politically-correct reference to the management of the specific supply arrangements for the islands — I am referring in particular to the Canary Islands."
"Believe me, Mr Michel, the people of the Canary Islands would like both the local authorities and the services of the Commission to guarantee the greatest possible transparency in the management of the SSA, of the specific supply arrangements for the islands."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to the debate."
"Allow me to reply to a number of important points raised."
"Firstly, I wish to reaffirm that the main purpose of this fundamental change is to give the Member States greater flexibility, which should enable them better to take into account the needs of the outermost regions."
"Regarding the reference period – and I would refer in this connection to Mr Freitas’ and Mr Fernandes’ speeches – a number of you are demanding a flexible period for calculating the financial ceilings applicable to the specific supply arrangements."
"I think I am able to state that the Commission has made substantial efforts to ensure that the new support arrangements are favourable to the outermost regions."
"It has to be said that adopting the proposed reference periods would lead to a considerable increase in expenditure."
"The proposal constitutes a package."
"One cannot single out the more agreeable provisions and ask for those deemed less favourable to be reexamined."
"I would take the liberty of drawing your attention to this feature of my reply."
"The funding has been calculated on a basis favourable to these regions, particular account having been taken not of the historical figures but of the ceilings laid down for support for local production."
"The Commission is not inclined to modify its proposal concerning these financial ceilings."
"With regard to limiting the specific supply arrangements to agricultural products – a matter addressed by both Mr Freitas and Mr Casaca – the Commission also wishes to provide a clearer framework for the Posei measures."
"That is why the new arrangements concern only agricultural products, listed in Annex I of the treaty. The unsatisfactory situations that applied in the past when it came to administering the Posei measures need to be brought to an end."
"The Commission proposes transitional periods that should enable the various sectors to adapt to the new situation."
"The case of the Azores and Sinaga has also been mentioned."
"Raised by Mr Freitas and Mr Fernandes, the matter concerns the problems specific to the Azores and, in particular, to the Sinaga sugar refinery."
"The Council’s draft regulation does not include new provisions concerning exports and shipments of products that have benefited from the specific supply arrangements."
"Since 1992, the Commission has been applying the same criteria to all the outermost regions, that is to say the average for the trade flows during the period 1989–1991."
"This approach was confirmed by the European Court of Justice in the Sinaga case. This needs to be pointed out."
"The opportunities for financial support for sugar production in the Azores have been considerably increased in the Council’s draft regulation."
"The proposal provides for funding calculated, where support for local production is concerned, on the proportion of the development potential for sugar production within the framework of the production quotas: almost EUR 4 million per year, instead of the current effective production of EUR 400 million per year."
"On the basis of this generous funding and within the framework of the broad margin of flexibility left to the Member States in choosing sectors to subsidise, it is for the national authorities to decide, if they so wish, to increase support for sugar production and the specific sugar refinery, following consultation with all the interested parties."
"The Commission is convinced that these new rules will improve the supervision of these arrangements, first and foremost in the interests specifically of the outermost regions."
"– This is just to inform Mr Michel that he is very much mistaken as regards the ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which referred the decision on this case to the Portuguese judicial system."
"I will be delighted to avail him of the relevant judgment of the Portuguese Supreme Court, which says exactly the opposite of what the Commission continues to allege."
"It thus appears that the Commission is unaware of the reason of justice, which is absolutely clear and unequivocal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"– The Commission is seeking to amend Regulation 1453/2001, putting into practice the principles underpinning the reform of these specific support schemes for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union."
"I welcome the proposed decentralisation, which grants greater responsibilities to regional representatives, given that the specific interests of each region must be catered for, taking account of different dates of accession and significantly increasing the amounts provided for."
"2001 to 2003 cannot be an acceptable reference period, because 2001 was a transitional year."
"The system of limiting exports of products under the specific supply arrangements to third countries and dispatch to the rest of the Community has served to choke the local agri-food industry."
"This happened with Azores sugar, the production of which must be made viable, and the same is true of other livestock and food produced using local traditional methods."
"Accordingly, the system must be changed."
"As regards the specific supply arrangements, particular attention should be paid to Madeira vineyards and bananas, to Azores milk and to the special measures designed to help farmers buy agricultural fertilisers and pesticides."
"I therefore support the report."
"Today’s debate on support for agriculture in the outermost regions of the EU is a prime example of the two different common agricultural policies that are implemented."
"One is applied to the old EU Member States, and another to the new Member States."
"There can be no question that farmers living in the outermost regions of the EU suffer financial difficulties."
"At the same time, however, the 3.6 million farmers living in the new Member States face even greater problems."
"Farmers in the outermost regions have already enjoyed the full benefits of the common agricultural policy for many years, whereas the EU has graciously ‘allowed’ farmers in the new Member States to receive shockingly low direct payments, thus depriving them of the chance to achieve the levels of farmers in the old Member States."
"The decisions taken in this connection were not based on any economic or social grounds, and most certainly not on any ethical grounds."
"They do, however, pose serious threats to Europe’s food security and to the stability of the agri-food market in the European Union, as well as acting as a breeding-ground for dangerous social tensions."
"Farmers from the new Member States are still being discriminated against."
"The arguments and expert opinions that have been put forward have proved meaningless for the EU authorities, as has the anticipated level of funding."
"One need only be a farmer in a new Member State to be deprived of any chance of obtaining support, no matter how justified such support would be."
"The pretext used is non-compliance with the countless conditions imposed by Brussels."
"We should put a stop to this discrimination, and we should begin this task today, by refusing to consent to the minor issue of support for the outermost regions of the EU."
"By doing so, we would send out a warning to the enemies of a common Europe based on solidarity, and let them know that only those who have previously acted in solidarity can later rely on solidarity themselves."
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions concerning Zimbabwe(1)."
"Mr President, the situation in Zimbabwe is going from bad to worse now."
"The latest piece of brutality, known as Operation Drive Out Rubbish, involves knocking down whole areas of cities."
"The UN estimates that more than 200 000 people are without roofs over their heads, and many of them are in danger of dying of cold now."
"The violent and systematic persecution of Mugabe’s critics is developing into a humanitarian disaster."
"According to the BBC, Methodist bishops have warned of genocide in the last day or two."
"The responses from the surrounding world are still too feeble, and the sanctions adopted are scarcely being implemented properly."
"The worst thing, however, is that the SADC countries, and South Africa in particular, are still protecting Mugabe and accepting the huge sufferings he is inflicting upon his people."
"All this was aired recently in the hearing in the Committee on Development, but there were also proposals about what might be done."
"First and foremost, the EU must put far greater pressure on both the UN and the SADC, especially South Africa, and so at long last comply with the responsibility it has by virtue of its own strength."
"Over and above that, it can, in entirely practical terms, increase its support for civil society both within and outside Zimbabwe with a view to developing a human rights culture and producing more documentation about human rights violations."
"It can increase support for the victims of torture and of organised violence both in Zimbabwe and in exile and it can provide proper legal aid in connection with obviously unjustified legal proceedings brought against human rights campaigners and those who support, or are believed to support, the opposition."
"There can be support for a free press, with news sent from Britain and neighbouring countries, partly in the form of newspapers published there."
"All this will cost a lot of money, however."
"In short, we are pleased about the resolution, but we should like to take the opportunity to emphasise these practical opportunities for offering help, and we hope that the Commission will look sympathetically at them."
"Mr President, as masses of people demonstrate about the situation in Africa, the G8 leaders are meeting in Scotland."
"It is most apt that we should have a resolution on Zimbabwe."
"‘Operation Drive Out Rubbish’: that is what Robert Mugabe calls his latest atrocity."
"His government has been responsible for destroying the homes and livelihoods of as many as 1.5 million Zimbabweans."
"That number will rise if we do not take the necessary action."
"Just last week a pregnant woman and a four-year-old child were killed during the mass eviction of 10 000 people from the outskirts of Harare."
"Imagine the pain and suffering, watching helplessly as your home is bulldozed, then to have no knowledge of where you are being taken."
"In spite of Amnesty International’s urgent appeal to exert pressure on the Mugabe regime, the African Union last week still refused to condemn President Mugabe."
"The people of Zimbabwe are victims of a human rights catastrophe."
"Human rights abuses can never be just an internal matter for a country."
"It is up to us all to raise our voices in protest and it is even more important that Zimbabwe’s neighbours condemn the atrocities."
"However, we should not just raise our voices and then carry on as usual."
"That is why the return of asylum seekers to Zimbabwe should be halted now."
"Otherwise EU governments like the UK Government can quite rightly be accused of gross hypocrisy."
". Mr President, in expressing its concerns about Zimbabwe, my group is not primarily thinking of the white farmers who became rich during colonial times, but of the large, black, majority who still have much lower incomes."
"President Mugabe played a major role in the fight for independence, both against colonialism and Ian Smith’s white minority regime."
"During and after that struggle, he always presented himself as the hero of the black majority."
"In practice, for many years, he did far too little to improve their lot."
"He seemed to have become a moderate ruler, radical only in his aversion to homosexuality."
"He was hardly recognisable as the former leader of the fight for an independence that gave the poor hope for a much-changed society, one that would make equality for all people its key priority."
"Only long after he came into power did he become very radical, particularly towards anyone who threatens, or could threaten, his absolute rule."
"The political opposition, the rich farmers, the poor slums and the market traders became in turn the victims of his activities aimed at intimidating and destroying them."
"In a previous debate on Zimbabwe, on 16 December 2004, I expressed the assumption that Mugabe had started campaigns of this kind in order to make up for his loss of popularity, trying, through his unexpectedly decisive action, to acquire and mobilise new followers."
"We now see that his approach can no longer be attributed to clever tactics but rather to the behaviour of someone who is losing his mind."
"Instead of providing better housing for the poor, he is driving them away from the cities by demolishing their dwellings."
"In this, he is starting to show much likeness to the demented regime that Pol Pot sought to introduce in Cambodia 30 years ago."
"My group finds it regrettable that this resolution levels exhaustive criticism at Zimbabwe’s neighbour, South Africa, and the African Union, while no attempt is being made to help them solve the problems."
"As long as Europe gives Africans cause to see it as the coloniser that it once was, we will lack the moral authority to be able to contribute to improvement."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing, as a British MEP, my deep sorrow at the news of the explosions in London."
"While a clear picture has yet to emerge, it certainly has all the trappings of a coordinated terrorist attack."
"Yet again we are reminded of the fragility of our world order and the need to work together to eradicate such barbaric, mindless acts."
"Freedom and democracy are the fundamental tenets of the Union."
"Just as we continue to espouse these principles within the Union, we need to translate this commitment into tangible actions against regimes that are diametrically opposed to such freedoms."
"That is why I am lending my wholehearted support to the resolution on Zimbabwe."
"It is not sufficient for the international community to indulge in the occasional ritual condemnation of President Mugabe; rather, we need to see a strong and viable opposition to him."
"If we are truly proponents of a free society, then how can we continue to stand by and allow this dictatorial oppression to continue unabated?"
"Why, as a Union, have we not levied increased pressure against the regime?"
"Why have we not tightened and enforced sanctions?"
"Why has the Council refused to respond to Parliament’s consistent calls in this respect?"
"Furthermore, it is a great disappointment that South Africa and a number of Zimbabwe’s other neighbours have chosen not to intervene in the plight of the Zimbabwean people."
"We have witnessed the entire resources of a once wealthy state enslaved."
"We have seen their people denied their intrinsic human rights, and yet this oppression and destruction has elicited little response from their neighbours."
"I would suggest to President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa that his choice not to criticise President Mugabe is a very disturbing indictment on his views of what constitutes a fair, free and open society."
"At a time when the international community is galvanised to address the endemic problems that Africa faces, it is only appropriate that we look beyond poverty relief to the maintenance of good governance, transparency, the rule of law and respect for human rights for all African countries."
"I therefore call upon this Parliament to support this resolution wholeheartedly."
". Mr President, may I first of all express my utter condemnation and disgust concerning the terrorist attacks on London today in which, according to the latest reports, over 40 people have been murdered and many hundreds injured."
"I extend my deepest sympathy to the victims and their families."
"The people of Zimbabwe live under a different sort of terrorism."
"It is unremitting and comes from the hands of the very authorities that should protect them – the government, the police, the army."
"The situation there is desperate and deteriorating."
"Since fixing the election in March, Mugabe has now deliberately destroyed the homes and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of the poorest Zimbabweans, while millions more continue to rely on international food aid for their survival."
"What does it take before the world responds to this catastrophe?"
"Africa is at the top of the agendas of today’s meeting of G8 leaders at Gleneagles and of the UK Presidency of the EU."
"The focus on Africa is bolstered by the massive wave of popular support for Bob Geldof’s Live 8."
"All recognise the need for improved aid, debt relief and fair trade."
"They also all acknowledge that, without good governance, much of the value of such assistance will be destroyed."
"The attitude of African governments to Zimbabwe is a true test of their commitment to such good governance, yet South Africa, the key to bringing about change in Zimbabwe, continues its quiet complicity with Mugabe’s oppression."
"I have asked the British Foreign Secretary and President-in-Office of the Council, Jack Straw, to urge President Mbeki, who is at Gleneagles today, to condemn Mugabe and to use every means at his disposal to bring about change for the better in Zimbabwe."
"Opposition leaders from southern African countries know what needs to be done."
"I have spoken to some of them here today in this Parliament, but their governments must be empowered to act and the EU itself must get serious."
"The Council and Commission must have a fresh determination to get a result."
"It should no longer tolerate excuses for evasion of its sanctions and those sanctions must be toughened and extended."
"And they must ask themselves: what specific additional action should we be taking?"
"This Parliament will give them some advice in its resolution today, and I hope they will take notice."
". Mr President, allow me first of all to express, specifically to the British Members of this House, my deepest sympathy with the victims of the horrific events in London."
"I will now turn to Zimbabwe."
"More than ever, Mugabe seems to be turning into Africa’s Pol Pot."
"These may be big words, but I read them several times when I leafed through Zimbabwean documents yesterday and the tragedy unfolded there before my very eyes."
"With his indefensible ‘Operation Drive Out Rubbish’, Mugabe is destroying thousands of shelters in the poor suburbs."
"All and sundry are being driven into the wintry cold, desperate and not knowing where to go."
"Many of those driven away voted for the opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, during the elections in March."
"What are the reactions on the international stage?"
"Neighbouring South Africa claims to be applying tacit diplomacy, but it is so tacit that it is not even being heard in Zimbabwe."
"The members of the African Union, who met in the Libyan city of Sirte, did not feel it incumbent upon themselves to condemn Mugabe’s regime either."
"Their excuse is that they do not want to interfere in domestic affairs."
"The Commission, represented by its President, Mr Barroso, takes the view that we do not need to teach Africa any lessons."
"The Council seems to appreciate the seriousness of the situation but does little to bring about any real improvement."
"Together with the United Kingdom and backed by Greece and Denmark, the United States broached the subject of the crisis in the UN Security Council."
"If the United Nations really wants to do the great things to which it aspires, this is a situation in which it should do them, but sending Anna Tibaijuka, Kofi Annan’s special envoy, to that country will not be enough."
"The world has been watching from the sidelines for far too long, while the dictator Mugabe has gone about his business unpunished, becoming more insolent in the process."
"At the G8 Summit at Gleneagles in Scotland, poverty was at the top of the agenda."
"We clearly expect more than the token appeal on the part of the G8 ministers on 23 June to Harare to adhere to the rule of law and respect human rights; an excellent starting point for these world leaders would be this House’s resolution, which is explicit and uncompromising."
"Mr President, some may well have thought, following the rigged elections on 31 March, that the dictator would have had enough of repression for a bit, but, unfortunately, he had not."
"In order to intimidate still more, he mounted ‘Operation Drive Out Rubbish’, the ‘rubbish’ in question being in fact, cynically enough, people, some of whom – having already had to abandon their farms, which had been confiscated, were now losing their homes for the second time, and lacked any means of subsistence."
"What is more than cynical, though, is the behaviour of the African Union, which declines to intervene, and South Africa is playing a key role in this."
"To President Mbeki, who is in Gleneagles today, I say this: ‘You are personally and politically responsible for what is happening in Zimbabwe, for you have for years been omitting to do what you could to put an end to this human tragedy!"
"If, as is evidently the case, your ‘Old Boy Network’ regards the misery of millions of people as an acceptable price to pay in order to hold on to power, you forfeit the right to govern what has been bequeathed to you by a liberation movement!’"
"Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has at last delivered his trenchant criticism of this behaviour in an interview in today’s issue of the ."
"I call on the Council and on all the Member States to make the regime’s pariah status effective at last."
"You, the Council, are not even prepared to deny this clique entry visas."
"Those who terrorise their people in this fashion cannot gain the right to attend international conferences by availing themselves of international agreements, yet neither the Council nor our Member States are prepared to administer such a diplomatic slap on the wrist as to refuse them visas."
"That is another scandal, this time a scandal for European politics."
"There are certain Member States that are currently capitalising on other Member States’ progressive withdrawal from Zimbabwe by expanding their own presence there, and by so doing, they – all of them – make us this regime’s stooges."
"The people of Zimbabwe need us, so let us put a stop to this and do something effective at last."
"Mr President, Zimbabwe was once one of the most affluent countries in Africa."
"It exported food and provided aid to the other countries in Africa that were less wealthy."
"Today it is a weak and poor country, and the dictator that rules over it is a great man of narrow interests."
"Unfortunately, these interests are often also dishonest and bloody."
"Credit is due to the authors of the motion for a resolution for having included the following key idea."
"Even if we stepped up aid to Africa, and hence to Zimbabwe, we would not be providing much in the way of real assistance unless we also ensured that this aid is backed up by good management, respect for human rights and solidarity in Africa."
"By this I do not mean solidarity between dictators, but solidarity among societies in support of democracy."
"Our debate today is concerned with Zimbabwe, but we should also talk about Brussels."
"For many years now, Parliament has repeatedly asked the Council to take action on this issue, but the Council has acted blind and deaf."
"This situation is reminiscent of the Polish saying; ‘a beggar talked to a picture, and the picture answered nothing’, with the only difference being that the silent Council is an ugly picture."
"It is time to give serious thought to real and across-the-board sanctions, and to a boycott to be imposed by the other African countries on Zimbabwe."
"The European Union, together with the USA and the Commonwealth countries, should exert a certain amount of diplomatic pressure on the African countries to this end."
"The Council must not bury its head in the sand and pretend that the problem does not exist."
"Mr President, we in this Chamber have spoken about Zimbabwe many times now, and everything that could have been said has been said."
"I do not now intend to repeat what out resolution says; I only wish to say that democracy is a challenging process which requires effort."
"We cannot even take for granted that it exists where people have sworn to uphold it."
"Perhaps we need a completely new profession, that of ‘democracy engineer’, to examine the weak points in a society’s structures and conduct an impartial quality control assessment of democracy."
"President Mugabe, a former freedom fighter and national hero, has degenerated into a dictator, who guards his own power jealously, and a criminal, and this needs to be analysed."
"When, a few years ago, we were in Zimbabwe as election observers, we could only wonder at Mugabe, who had the nerve to proclaim during the election that the government would remain, whatever the result."
"How does such arrogance come about?"
"This former fertile African model country is now in a state of chaos."
"Now its economic structures have disappeared and the country’s plight is worsening the whole time."
"What is that slow slide from democracy to dictatorship?"
"One keyword is law and order, a condition of the social contract."
"When he incited people to occupy land illegally, instead of carrying out a controlled land reform himself Mugabe did away with law and order in the country and thus destroyed the viability of its social core."
"There is also a sequel to this: now Mugabe is using hunger and misery as a weapon against his own people, and is feeding nationalism and blaming colonialism to conceal his own crimes."
"What is more, by crushing the opposition he is destroying the basis of democratic society."
"For democracy to function, rulers need to be aware of just how dangerous they can be."
"The possibility of becoming corrupted by power comes from within."
"The philosopher and theologian, Niebuhr, hit upon a reason for man’s dual nature: our capacity for good makes democracy possible, and our inclination to do bad makes it necessary."
"Only true democracy guarantees that new faces will replace people who have been corrupted by power."
"President Mugabe, for the sake of your people, it is time for you to go."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree more or less with what was said and with what is included in the resolution."
"Obviously, Mugabe’s regime is an inadmissible one that is doing absolutely unacceptable and abominable things."
"We agree about that."
"That being said, I should like, all the same, to introduce a few qualifications regarding the tactical or strategic responses that are to be made, given the regime that is in place and the means available to us to move things in the right direction."
"When you speak of sanctions, for example, I obviously share your point of view concerning sanctions directly affecting the Zimbabwean authorities."
"They definitely must be applied."
"I would even add: what are we waiting for before applying them?"
"Obviously, I agree."
"That being said, it needs carefully to be borne in mind that certain types of sanction have harmful repercussions on populations."
"In general, I am not, moreover, in favour of sanctions. I tend, rather, to be in favour of political dialogue."
"It has in fact been seen how, when they affect populations, sanctions generally rebound upon those who apply them, rather than target the authorities at whom they were directed."
"That is the first thing I wanted to say."
"What I should now like to say, I say in the knowledge that my comments make me vulnerable to criticism."
"It would not, however, be right for me not to let you know my feelings regarding this debate."
"It is very easy for us, as Europeans, to issue press releases almost every day, denouncing and attacking Mugabe."
"You should be aware, however, that, every time Mugabe is attacked, his symbolic importance as a black hero in relation to the evil white colonisers is reinforced."
"As someone – Mr Meijer, I think – said a few minutes ago, Mugabe is clearly making use of this vicious circle to rehabilitate himself politically and in the popular imagination."
"That needs to be acknowledged."
"There is something else you ought to know, too. Otherwise, you will not be fully informed."
"Together with yourselves, I certainly recognise that maximum pressure has to be exerted, but it has to be exerted in a subtle way."
"What also needs to be understood is that the leaders of the other African countries, whom you denounce for not daring to adopt positions, or make value judgments, on Mugabe’s behaviour are put in difficult positions in their own countries every time Mugabe reinforces his symbolic, not to say heroic image."
"You need to know this and you also need to know that it is extremely difficult for Mr Mbeki, and I would say straight away that the old boy network …"
"no, but of course not, there is no old boy network;"
"I am sorry; it is an insult to the South African President to speak of an old boy network."
"What Mr Mbeki and other African leaders in the region fear is, in reality, that the phenomenon of violence and of an anti-colonialist uprising somewhere might spread into neighbouring countries."
"I have on many occasions broached this issue with the representatives of the African Union and with the various Heads of Government of these neighbouring countries."
"I am able to tell you that they certainly want to put pressure on President Mugabe, but that they want the conditions to exist for doing so."
"In order to bring those conditions about, it is not enough, moreover, for the community outside Africa to relaunch the debate and wave the threat of sanctions, insisting on more of these and on the need to take a harder line."
"Firstly, what is meant by the need to take a harder line?"
"Someone tell me what has to be done."
"Do troops need to be sent in?"
"What should be done? President Barroso was extremely vigorous in his condemnation of Mugabe’s attitude following the expulsions that took place recently."
"I should like someone to explain to me what, apart from that and apart from the vengeful, sometimes cavalier, press releases and the routine chest-baring, is meant by taking a harder line."
"Alternatively, we could engage in a debate on the duty, or right, to interfere."
"I personally am ready to engage in that debate."
"I am not indifferent to such a debate. I suspect, however, that, on the day that the demand is made in this House for troops to be sent to Zimbabwe to bring about order there – in which case, the agreement of the African Union will still be required – great harm will be caused to Africa and to its regional institutions."
"I also very much doubt that any candidates would be found in this House for assembling the bulk of the troops needed."
"All I want to say is that an attempt at coherence is needed when points of view are defended."
"We are not just a sounding board."
"The European bodies, and I too, need at some point to be told precisely what these additional things are that need to be done."
"There is no end of condemnation going on."
"I met President Konare in Syrte four days ago, together with President Barroso."
"Our conversation basically consisted of our saying: but, President, why do you yourselves, as the African Union, not condemn Mugabe’s conduct?"
"To which he would reply: but, my dear friend, every time you attack Mugabe, you make matters much more difficult for us because our peoples do not consider Mugabe to be a tyrant or dictator; they consider Mugabe basically to be standing up to the evil colonisers, embodying genuine resistance and being faithful to history."
"That is what I hear, and I believe it."
"Even though I know that this is impossible, there is almost a need, for a few weeks, to adopt a low profile and not to talk too much about all this."
"I am almost convinced that doing so would put the African Union, the regional organisations, President Mbeki and others in a position to exercise their peer review duty."
"I am almost convinced that you would be putting them in a position to do this."
"As long as we continue ostentatiously to lambast Mugabe’s attitude with press releases and calls for vengeance, we shall not – and I am sorry to have to tell you this – be able to obtain the judgment we await from the African Union and the African organisations."
"It is only by obtaining such a judgment that we can in the end exercise influence."
"That is what I believe. I do not think that there is any other way in which we shall succeed in doing this."
"That is something you should know."
"I spend a lot of time in those African countries, and I am utterly dismayed to see this vicious circle whereby the more tyrannical Mugabe is and the more the European Union and other international bodies intervene to condemn him, the more popular he is."
"If, however, this vicious circle did not exist, Mugabe would undoubtedly not last for long, for it is only through this mechanism that he holds on to power."
"What Mr Meijer said is true: it is this mechanism that is the key."
"To summarise, there is a need to be very careful when attacking the African Union and the African leaders in the region."
"I absolutely deny that we are the poodles of Mugabe’s regime."
"I can tell you that I myself am by no means any such thing, and I can say this after having tried on many occasions to get things moving in South Africa."
"At one point, South Africa tried to convince Mugabe to transform his government into a government of national unity, opening it up to Mr Tsvangirai and his party."
"At one point, things had moved in the right direction."
"Then, along came the sanctions, which again created an extremely difficult climate."
"I vigorously condemn Mugabe’s attitude."
"I believe that the planned measures and sanctions should be applied against the Zimbabwean authorities."
"There is no reason for not applying them."
"That goes without saying."
"I agree with most of what is contained in the resolution."
"I am simply trying to explain to you the limits of what we can usefully do, because the problem is, in fact, one of doing things that are of use."
"Mr President, on a point of order, the Commissioner has had almost ten minutes to stand up and make an apologia for Mugabe’s regime and the inaction of Mbeki, the Commission and the Council."
"This is disgraceful."
"There is a procedural problem in this House."
"How can we have a proper debate when we are limited to one or two minutes and then the microphone is turned off, while the Commissioner can stand up and make this disgraceful response?"
"He has denied everything that every Member of this House, right across the political spectrum, has said."
"We do not have the power, you have the power, Commissioner."
"I have been talking, along with other colleagues today, to members of the political opposition in many countries in Africa."
"They do not share your view, Commissioner."
"It is the most disgraceful outburst I have heard from a Commissioner in a long time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning trafficking in children in Guatemala(1)."
". Mr President, when we visited Guatemala a few months ago, we witnessed what a delicate time it was for Guatemala and, in particular, for the peace agreements."
"Many of the people we met expressed their concern about what they consider to be a replacement of the peace agenda, which has yet to be concluded, with an emerging economic and trade liberalisation agenda."
"Within this context, the vulnerability of many population groups is clear and therefore worrying."
"Of the groups most affected by the present situation, I would like to highlight the indigenous groups, social movements and human rights activists and, as expressed in the resolution we are debating on and voting today, women and children, in particular the poorest of them."
"First example: according to the Human Rights Activist Protection Unit of the National Human Rights Movement, between January and May, 76 attacks against human rights activists have been recorded, a figure that includes attacks and murders and the unlawful entry of headquarters."
"During our visit, several abused and threatened groups told us of their experiences."
"Furthermore, they complained of the impunity that they believe is being enjoyed by the perpetrators of these events, due to the lack of investigation by the authorities."
"Second example: the data on structural and direct violence suffered by Guatemalan women is alarming, but the judicial and legislative responses appear to be insufficient."
"Illegal adoptions and complaints of forced pregnancies and abductions of children are simply a symptom of, amongst other things, the weakness of the rule of law in Guatemala, particularly with regard to poor women and indigenous communities."
"For all of these reasons, within the European Union’s future strategy on Guatemala 2007-2013, the Commission must be urged to establish the following as priority issues: social cohesion, the right to food, rural development and the reform of the land use and tenancy system."
"Furthermore, the population groups affected must participate as much as possible in devising the strategy."
"Only by involving the different players in the process will it be possible to guarantee that the implementation of the strategy has the local support necessary for its objectives to be achieved."
". Mr President, Guatemala has been caught up in a culture of violence which the government seems unable to curb."
"There is a feeling of terror, mainly among families living in the slums, which suffer the highest murder rates."
"Trafficking of women and children is commonplace."
"‘No protection, no justice’."
"That is the title of an Amnesty report published last month which estimated that nearly 1 200 women and girls were brutally killed between 2001 and 2004."
"Many had been raped."
"Fewer than one in ten murders have been investigated."
"A nine-month study beginning in 2003 discovered that 688 girls were trafficked into different Guatemalan cities."
"These girls were not only from Guatemala, but from other Latin American countries as well."
"As the girls were recruited by criminal organisations, all the victims were between 14 and 18 years old."
"They were led to believe when recruited that they would work as waitresses in Guatemala, only to be told the true nature of the job afterwards."
"They are often beaten up or locked in a room for several days without food for being disobedient."
"They do not run away as they are living in a state of fear."
"The government must prosecute the criminals who are involved in this trafficking."
"Other illegal practices have developed, including kidnapping babies, payments to mothers to rent out their wombs and buying of babies from very poor mothers."
"Guatemala must bring in specific legislation on adoptions and apply the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption."
"Measures must be taken by the government on all these issues."
"If it does not do that, we as an international community are quite right to condemn it."
". Mr President, the ongoing human rights violations and illegal child trafficking in Guatemala are intolerable to the international community."
"Even though the civil war ended seven years ago, there is still a climate of violence and intimidation in the country, and it is ever more frequently the case that its victims are children and young people."
"The main problem, and one that requires a response from the international community, is the impunity of organised gangs of criminals."
"The latter escape punishment either because the Guatemalan authorities lack the necessary commitment, or because they are quite simply incapable of winning the fight."
"Over the past decade, illegal child trafficking has become more lucrative than the drug trade."
"As a result, Guatemala has become a transit country for the large-scale and illegal trafficking of minors to Mexico, the United States and Canada."
"This problem is one of enormous complexity."
"In the majority of cases, the children involved are put up for illegal adoption, and it should be stressed that more children are adopted abroad from Guatemala than from any other country in the world, apart from Russia and China."
"This exacerbates social ills, such as child prostitution, forced child labour and violence against women."
"Illegal trafficking in children and children’s organs is becoming increasingly prevalent in Guatemala, mainly due to a lack of human rights regulations at national level, and to the massive poverty that affects two thirds of the population."
"Statistics tell us that half of those living in Guatemala survive on less than two dollars a day."
"The poverty in the country, together with the lack of any family planning policy and the disintegration of the education system, mean that one third of children under the age of 15 have no access to education."
"In its mission to promote respect for fundamental human rights and to condemn all forms of violence against and exploitation of minors, the European Union has a moral obligation to intervene in the domestic affairs of countries that violate the rights of their youngest and most defenceless citizens."
"I therefore propose that a worldwide campaign be launched to tie in with UNICEF programmes promoting the rights of children and young people throughout Latin America."
"Today’s terrorist attacks in London have highlighted the fragility of our sense of security, even in Europe, where we live in peace."
"We must therefore make even more concerted efforts to oppose all forms of violence, wherever in the world they occur."
". Mr President, in the previous debate, we concluded that Zimbabwe has now turned into a hell, but the same can said of Guatemala, which has, however, been in the grip of misery for much longer."
"Since the in 1954, which removed from office a government that had intended to free the country from poverty and backwardness, hardly anything has gone right for Guatemala, and it has been under the constant rule of governments lacking even the least concern for the weakest groups in society or for human rights, and with a long tradition of using violence and other forms of intimidation against anyone who seeks to improve the situation."
"The backwardness of the past 50 years is exemplified by the absence of any legislation criminalising child trafficking, by the falsification of government documents, the many homicides that go unpunished, the obstruction of human rights activists in their activities, the poverty in which 56% of the population live, and lack of almost any opportunity for the indigenous peoples to take part in political decision making."
"Not only in Zimbabwe, but at least to the same extent in Guatemala, there is every reason for the European Union to help bring about sweeping changes."
"It therefore follows that my group is firmly behind the proposed resolution."
". Mr President, during the recent visit by a delegation from this Parliament to Guatemala, our attention was drawn to a particular issue, and the five Members, from different political groups, making up that delegation agreed that the adoption of children in Guatemala by foreign families causes an immense problem, represents a flagrant violation of children's rights and, ultimately, is the subject of an extremely lucrative business."
"According to official figures that we obtained there, in 2004, 3 824 Guatemalan children were subject to international adoptions and that figure, for a country with just over 12 million inhabitants, demonstrates that something is not working properly there."
"The adoption of a child costs between USD 25 000 and USD 30 000, and just 2 or 3% of that goes to the birth mother, that is to say, less than EUR 400."
"This means that the total sum obtained through this phenomenon of massive donations is the second largest of the country’s exports."
"The children concerned are generally children of single mothers, many of them girls of between 13 and 14 years old, largely indigenous and, in many cases, victims of drugs and/or prostitution."
"Over recent years, many Guatemalan governments have tried to approve a law to implement the Hague Convention on adoptions, but they have failed."
"The Guatemalan Congress, undoubtedly subject to external pressure, has not been able to approve that law."
"Now, the Guatemalan Government hopes that, over the coming weeks, a law will be approved to put a stop to this situation. My group therefore intends to send a very clear message to the Guatemalan authorities, communicating to them that they will have our every support so that their Congress can finally approve a law that imposes order on this truly intolerable situation."
". Mr President, the title of today’s debate points to a modern-day tragedy on a massive scale."
"Every year, over 1.2 million children are trafficked, and international adoption generates annual profits of USD 20 million."
"Children in poor countries live in destitution and are turned out onto the streets, sexually exploited or murdered for transplantable organs."
"The developing world has become a den of debauchery for many developed countries."
"Apart from drug and weapons trafficking, child trafficking is the best way to make money in Guatemala. The gangs involved in such trafficking advertise on the Internet, safe in the knowledge that they will remain unpunished since there is nothing in Guatemalan law to say that such underhand practices are crimes."
"The particular barbarity of these criminals is apparent from the fact that mothers who have just given birth are drugged and forced to sign documents confirming that they relinquish their parental rights."
"Despite the growing magnitude of the problem, however, neither the Guatemalan Government nor the local authorities have taken any kind of action."
"From the moment of their conception, today children experience unprecedented aggression instead of love and care, and are exposed to the threats of murder, forced labour and sexual exploitation."
"Such practices are facilitated by the depravity of politicians, of lawyers, of officials and even of international humanitarian organisations."
"John Paul II once said that care for children was the first and basic test of human relations."
"Our actions should not be limited to intervention and the adoption of resolutions, as commendable as we find them."
"Particular emphasis needs to be placed on the role played by the morally healthy family, as the latter provides children with love and a sense of security, which are indispensable prerequisites for growth and development."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is very aware of the situation in Guatemala, as reported on by a variety of United Nations special envoys, as well as by the European Parliament delegation despatched to Guatemala in April."
"Within the framework of implementing the 1996 peace agreements, defending human rights is a key priority in our relations with Guatemala."
"Regarding the adoption of children, the Commission has, since 2004, supported the actions regularly taken by the European Union in respect of the Guatemalan authorities."
"These actions enable us to express our concern about the failure properly to implement The Hague Convention."
"The contacts between the European Union and UNICEF have also been satisfactory in this regard, particularly on the occasion of the recent visit to Guatemala by the Secretary General of the Hague Conference, Mr van Loon."
"This visit enabled a climate more favourable to the necessary implementation of the aforesaid convention to be created."
"At the same time, the Commission supports a series of cooperation projects concerning the problems surrounding the trafficking in children in Guatemala and the fight against child pornography, and it does this within the framework of the ‘country’ strategy for the period 2007 – 2013, which is in the process of being defined."
"We intend to supplement and increase these efforts by means of a cooperation policy entirely focused on the protection and overall affirmation of children and young people, particularly young people and families at risk."
"The Commission has also associated itself with a variety of actions by the European Union in support of, in particular, the Interior Minister and the Public Prosecutor."
"These have enabled us to express our concern about the human rights situation, including the growing violence against women and the attacks on those organisations set up to protect human rights."
"In terms of cooperation, the overall indicative budget of the European Union allocated to Guatemala in the area of human rights and democratisation for the period 2002 – 2006 amounts to EUR 18 million."
"This aid includes support for the judicial authority and for the office of the human rights public prosecutor in the rural areas."
"The Commission has also launched a specific ‘gender’ programme, aimed more specifically at indigenous women and equipped with a budget of EUR 6 million."
"Finally, the Commission has approved a budget of EUR 1.2 million in support of establishing the office – due to be ready by July 2005 – of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala."
"Where our future cooperation is concerned, the absolute priorities in our relations with Guatemala are still social cohesion, rural and local development, including the definition of a comprehensive food aid strategy, and, finally, the advancement of the indigenous peoples."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning human rights in Ethiopia(1)."
". I am pleased to be able to begin this speech by celebrating the release of the six human rights activists whose release we were calling for in the resolution we were to debate today."
"These people were amongst thousands who were detained in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, during and after the demonstrations that began on 6 June and that lasted several days."
"Thirty-six people were killed in these disturbances."
"Although some 4 000 people have now been released, several thousand remain in prison or in unofficial police detention centres."
"In view of this situation, the European Union must remain resolute and demand that the investigation of these events continue without obstruction by any of the parties."
"Furthermore, it seems clear that the opposition has neither the intention nor the means to carry out a violent uprising which could ultimately compromise the election victory which it claims to have won."
"Nevertheless, we cannot claim victory on behalf of the government which, according to the various recounts, appears to have lost the elections."
"The European Union must therefore send a clear message to the government, warning it that it must cease all repressive and provocative attitudes, particularly towards members of the opposition, human rights activists and independent journalists, since that hostile attitude may lead the country into a situation of chaos that will benefit nobody."
"Finally, the European Union must demand that the government fulfil its responsibility to guarantee the security of the citizens and of the new Parliament."
". Mr President, some may wonder how, on a day when the plague of terrorism has again hit innocent civilians in a European capital, we can continue to debate the matters on our parliamentary agenda as planned."
"The answer is of course that, while our hearts go out to the victims and their families, we must allow cowardly acts of terror to disrupt our democratic institutions and processes."
"To do otherwise would in fact give the cowardly terrorists the sick satisfaction and perverse pleasure they seek to achieve by perpetrating such monstrous crimes against humanity."
"Ethiopia is, unfortunately, a country with a long history of poverty and famine."
"It is also a country with a long history of autocracy and state terror."
"During their fourteen years in power, the governments led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi have continued to amass a shameful human rights record."
"Many critics of his government have been routinely subjected to harassment, imprisonment and torture."
"Last month, after the recent parliamentary elections in the country, opposition demonstrations in the capital Addis Ababa were met with brutal attacks by the Ethiopian police."
"The demonstrators, mainly university students, claimed, with good reason, that there had been widespread electoral fraud."
"The security forces fired indiscriminately on the unarmed demonstrators, killing at least 36 and injuring over 100."
"An estimated 5 000 people were arrested and thrown into military detention centres."
"Following international reaction, many have now been released, but a large number are still in detention."
"Over the last few years, Ethiopia has received – and continues to receive – a considerable amount of development aid from the West, much of which is from the EU."
"Many argue – quite rightly – that we ought to reconsider how this aid to African countries is given, because it would appear that in some cases at least – and Ethiopia is an example – the granting of financial help may bring about the collateral danger of helping to establish a non-democratic regime the policies of which further lead to national poverty."
"I ask you to support this motion for a resolution."
"– No, Mr President, I speak to the House not, unfortunately, as an author, but as a Member of the House and as head of the EU election observation mission to Ethiopia."
"The elections afforded the opposition and all of Ethiopian society an unprecedented voice, which is to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi’s credit."
"The presence of international observers, of which our mission was the most significant in terms of numbers and professional commitment, was a key factor in instilling confidence among the electorate, who turned out in their droves and 90% voted."
"The delegation sent by Parliament felt the sustained applause of voters queuing up on 15 May and for this reason the EU’s electoral mission feels an enormous responsibility."
"It is crucial that the Ethiopian people have their expectations of true election results fulfilled and the mission will do all it can to ensure that this happens."
"Nobody can know for sure what the election results will be because the process got into serious difficulty at the stage of counting the ballot papers."
"In addition to the delays in publishing the results, there were a large number of complaints from all parties, including the party in government."
"Concern among the population with regard to those delays and complaints was at the root of the tragic events of 6, 7 and 8 June, on which the mission immediately spoke out publicly."
"We called at the time for an independent inquiry and we continue to do so."
"Specifically, we call on the government to release those held in breach of constitutional guarantees and of human rights; we call for elected candidates and other opposition representatives, along with human rights campaigners, to be allowed the freedom to perform their duties; we call for media freedom and for opposition representatives to be allowed access to the media; we called then and call now on the opposition to hold back and discourage others from carrying out or calling for an insurgency, from calling for people to break constitutional law and from fomenting inter-ethnic conflict, which will ultimately only help those with a vested interest in ensuring that the results of the popular vote are never disclosed, those who, in turn, would stop at nothing to force the electoral process to be disrupted, leading to a spiral of violence and economic and political chaos; we call on both sides – government and opposition – to comply fully with the 10 June Agreement aimed at addressing complaints, which is backed by the main contributors, including the Member States."
"At this point I wish to pay tribute to the representative of the Commission, who played – and continues to play – an outstanding role in Addis Ababa."
"Our mission has been restructured to meet requests from both sides that we should observe this process of looking into complaints and I shall therefore be back in Addis Ababa next week."
"I shall finish, Mr President, by saying that the situation is very delicately and dangerously poised."
"The risk of civil war is not mere rhetoric."
"I have just heard the news that the main opposition announced this morning that it is pulling out of the complaint investigation process due to its representatives allegedly being obstructed."
"Accordingly, any demonstrations of interest in the Ethiopian process, however constructive or well-intentioned they may be, and this is clearly the case of this Parliament initiative, could be taken the wrong way, or could be used for nefarious purposes by those who have a vested interest in breaking up the democratisation process in Ethiopia."
"My duties as head of the electoral observation mission have not finished."
"It is an independent mission, and the work is not yet done."
"I therefore ask Parliament to appreciate that I feel it is my duty not to take part in the vote on this resolution."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to lend my full backing to the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Ethiopia."
"No attempts are made to hark back to the time of King John; instead, the resolution makes it quite evident that we are aware of the gravity of the situation in one of Africa’s poorest countries."
"Ethiopia was a founding member of the Organisation of African Unity, but the country is still troubled by the unstable situation in Somalia, as well as by conflicts with the medieval regime in Eritrea."
"One of its neighbours is Sudan, which has been trying for several decades now to resolve the internal conflicts in its north and south and the disastrous situation in Darfur."
"In the past, Ethiopia has suffered coups and been ravaged by drought and war in Uganda."
"In a situation such as this, it is absolutely crucial to strengthen the faith of the Ethiopian people in democratic systems."
"I agree with Mrs Gomes, the leader of the election observation mission, in this respect, and it is only right that the resolution should also emphasise this point."
"That by itself is not enough, however; we must not tolerate the violation or circumvention of the laws of any country, especially when the country in question boasts a high electoral turnout, which is an indication of the public’s enormous interest."
"Support must be provided to enable a thorough investigation of all complaints."
"We must step up our efforts, however."
"A country such as Ethiopia, which is striving to improve its agricultural and industrial situation, needs our assistance."
"A number of countries have already provided such assistance in the past, and programmes of this kind should be given a major boost."
"Aid for Ethiopia must be clearly targeted at solving fundamental problems, instead of benefiting the government."
"It is just as important to send experts to the country to help train farmers, and if necessary to provide assistance in identifying and securing water sources, as to offer places to study at secondary schools and universities in the European Union."
"There is an old proverb that says; ‘give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for life’."
"We should take this as our guiding principle."
". Mr President, in a special way, the theme for this week is Africa, a continent neglected all too long by all of us, including, to some extent, those of us who sit in this House."
"Starting with the pop concerts at the weekend, moving on through the summit in Scotland on Wednesday and our great debate here in this House, it is Africa that dominates today’s topical and urgent debate this Thursday afternoon."
"The subject of Zimbabwe alone has made clear just now much potential for conflict there is in this topic."
"It has become evident that there is a need, over and above purely humanitarian approaches, for a rigorous and well thought-out Africa policy to be developed."
"I have to say that I was shocked by what the Commissioner had to say on this point."
"Speaking as a Bavarian Member of this House, I have to say that, when I recollect that the Commissioner was, in his former incarnation as Belgium’s foreign minister, one of the prime movers behind the attempt to impose sanctions on Austria, that model European democracy, to hear him now give it as his opinion that it would be counter-productive and wrong to apply sanctions against Zimbabwe’s Mugabe, one of the most infamous dictators in the world, then I have to say that this application of double standards is something we simply cannot accept."
"We have to make it abundantly clear that we, in Europe, can be credible only if we do not just potter around showering Africa with money, but instead, put together a political strategy and a perfectly clear concept of what human rights are."
"I agree unreservedly that we cannot, of course, go around making ourselves out to be the ones who can teach the world."
"We have enough to do to put our own house in order, but, Commissioner, I do believe that it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, to impose sanctions on the dictators in Africa and exert pressure on them."
"South Africa’s President Mbeki, who parades himself around the whole continent as a model democrat and peacemaker, is himself basically no more than a Mugabe in disguise, or else he would long ago have come out in opposition to the wrongdoing in Zimbabwe."
"That much is clear enough when you listen to what the representatives of the churches in South Africa have to say on the subject, and this is a cause we should take up."
"It is in this context that we have to consider the portents for Ethiopia, and beware."
"Ethiopia has already experienced enough catastrophes in the shape of dire famines, wars and civil wars, a dictatorship bearing the unmistakeable mark of Soviet-style communism, followed by another civil war and a war of secession, war among its neighbours and more of the same besides; it is now heading for a new one."
"We now see yet another dictatorship coming into being, and that in a country that has massive potential, a country that is one of the oldest independent states on earth, with an ancient people, predominantly Christian in culture, that until recently had never had to endure colonial hegemony, a country that had fought Fascism and European militarism, a country that was once the pride of Africa and the symbol of independent self-supporting development."
"We must not allow this country to disintegrate into clans in the same way as its neighbour Somalia, into multiple divisions along tribe and party lines, with most of the parties based on tribal allegiance."
"That is why we need to throw a massive amount of weight behind democracy and human rights in Ethiopia."
"It is not often that I find myself agreeing with Mr Kohlíček, but today I have to add my voice to his."
"We have to support decentralised projects in agriculture and in irrigation, thereby preventing it from being only those at the centre and the bureaucrats who benefit, but, on the contrary, enabling a new community to come into being, from the bottom up, on the strategically vital Horn of Africa."
". Mr President, in this debate on human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Ethiopia, I cannot allow the dreadful events in London today to pass without comment."
"I do not represent London – or England – but I will say that we Scots stand foursquare beside our nearest neighbour, our friends, our colleagues and indeed our families in London and elsewhere."
"Tomorrow will be for questions and for reasons."
"Today is for decency and humanity."
"In our interconnected world, an attack on the rights of the innocent in London, in Ethiopia, anywhere is an attack on the rights of us all."
"And in the light of today’s events, it makes it all the more imperative that those of us on the side of human rights and the rule of law speak with a clear, loud and forcible voice in the world."
"If we agree on nothing else, it must be that illegal violence against the innocent is never and can never be the answer."
"On the widespread abuse of human rights in Ethiopia, I wholeheartedly endorse the earlier comments of my group colleague Mr Romeva i Rueda and would add that press freedoms must not be forgotten in this debate."
"The freedom of the press is pivotal to a free society and a free world."
"These freedoms are also being widely infringed in Ethiopia and I would add my condemnation to that of the House."
"There is little debate within the House on the substance of the motion for a resolution before us, but events outwith this House make it all the more important that we protect these rights."
"Mr President, I envy Ethiopia."
"Yes, you heard me correctly – I envy Ethiopia, but not for its government, as there is little cause to do so."
"I envy the Ethiopian people for their belief that so much depends on them."
"I do not believe there is a single European country that can boast an electoral turnout of almost 90%, as recorded in the elections held in Ethiopia on 15 May of this year."
"Such a high turnout merits our respect and our support, and a country that can achieve this deserves democracy."
"The only problem is that democracy comes at a very high price in Ethiopia."
"Thirty-six people were killed and several thousand imprisoned, although fortunately 4 000 of the latter have recently been released."
"The word solidarity is one of enormous importance for the people of my country, Poland, and indeed it also holds great meaning for the European Union."
"This solidarity should be extended to Ethiopia too, and the country should not be condemned to oblivion, even if it is a long way from Strasbourg."
"We should not allow ourselves to forget Africa, and our thoughts should not only turn to it once a year, or whenever Bob Geldof organises concerts."
"The non-attached Members fully back the motion for a resolution, because it amounts to nothing less than a political translation of Ernest Hemingway’s wise saying, ‘ask not for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee’."
"Ethiopia is a typical case in which the European Union can make a difference and in which it also applies itself to making a difference."
"Like all of you, I followed very closely the development of the electoral process in Ethiopia."
"I followed it before the elections, and I have to say that the electoral campaign was a model of democracy, with access to the media for everyone."
"It was from the time that the elections started that there was a genuine problem."
"I was obviously a witness to the serious incidents that occurred on 7 and 8 June 2005."
"I intervened personally."
"Mr Solana intervened."
"You should know that I was in contact almost every two days with Prime Minister Meles to inform him of the EU’s concerns about the progress of the elections and, more specifically, about the human rights violations that were committed during those incidents."
"Clearly, the messages that the European Union and others have sent, and continue to send, to the authorities have some effect, as shown by the government decision to release approximately 3 800 people arrested without charge following the demonstrations."
"We have had many telephone contacts and, on each occasion, Mr Meles has responded to our request."
"I spoke with him and President Barroso three days ago in Libya."
"There are apparently still 600 to 700 detainees, many of them held in secret."
"Prime Minister Meles told me that he was trying to speed up settlement of these issues and that the majority of these detainees would probably be freed if they were being held for no reason."
"The Ethiopian authorities have to respect not only their laws but also international human rights standards."
"We have asked for the International Committee of the Red Cross to be allowed to visit those who are still prisoners."
"With regard to the events of 7 and 8 June, it would be desirable if the Government were to authorise an independent inquiry in order fully to establish the facts and the charges."
"Prime Minister Meles told me that he was in a position to respond to this request and that he was going to do so."
"Regarding the electoral process, I am very pleased about the progress made after the serious risk of matters going off course, just as I am very pleased that it has been possible to make a start on dealing with the electoral dispute."
"I have asked all the political parties – I have met them all, including the opposition parties – and their leaders to observe the maximum restraint so as to enable the national election administration to complete its work independently."
"The European Union has also arranged – in response to a request from the opposition parties – for representatives of each party, including the opposition parties, to sit on the committee set up to receive complaints."
"There too, we have obtained satisfaction."
"We were also the only key player in negotiating a code of conduct for the media."
"This code is well on the way to being adopted by all the parties, and it is more than likely that it will be adopted fairly quickly."
"The Commission and the EU as a whole very much want Ethiopia to conclude the electoral process not only in the interests of the country’s stability but also because of the terrific signal that real democratisation of the country would send out."
"Both through the European Union’s election observation mission and through the political dialogue conducted within the country itself by the Commission’s representative, the Commission is at the forefront of the initiatives and is playing a constructive role appreciated by all the Ethiopian parties."
"We shall continue to support the process."
"I should also like sincerely and publicly to thank and congratulate the honourable Member, Mrs Gomes in view of her remarkable work as head of the European election observation mission and the excellent collaboration she has made possible between herself and ourselves."
"We have had contacts, and I appreciate the degree to which she has helped bring our positions closer together."
"I wanted very much to say that she has gone beyond her simple role as head of the observation mission and that she really has been a quite remarkable facilitator."
"I am convinced that the European Union will continue to engage in constructive, but firm and demanding, dialogue in order to continue to have a positive effect on the process under way in Ethiopia."
"This process is obviously a delicate one."
"In each camp, extremists are only waiting for a mistake to be made or for an opportunity to spark things off."
"I think that this collective responsibility – involving Parliament, the Commission and the Council – should forestall this worst case scenario and keep each camp committed to the legal framework and current electoral and political process."
"I should like, even so, to add something."
"Without taking sides, I should like in any case to say that the influence of the European Union is, to some extent, helped by Prime Minister Meles’s open approach and, above all, by his considerable confidence in the European Union."
"He sees the European Union as an institution and a reality to believe in and to respect. Hence, his relative promptness in responding to our requests and entreaties and, indeed, our demands."
"I am convinced that, if we can continue to support the process, we shall play a conciliatory role, and democracy could quite easily come into its own again in Ethiopia."
"Prime Minister Meles told us that he would accept the verdict of the electorate when it is announced by the institution that is to make known the precise results."
"If, for example, it were necessary to hold fresh elections in a number of constituencies etc., he would fall in with this."
"We shall see what comes of the matter."
"In any case, each time that he has committed himself to do something, he has done it."
"It was important that I informed you of this."
"The picture I am painting is not as black as that painted by certain speakers."
"Of course, the situation is a delicate one."
"Naturally, it is risky."
"Of course, it is dangerous."
"Who would imagine otherwise?"
"Since I have been a Commissioner, however, this is the first time I have been aware that, when the various institutions – Parliament, High Representatives, the Commission and delegations on the spot – work together, including with the Member States and using all the instruments available to the European Union, they are effective."
"That is certainly the case where Ethiopia is concerned."
"I have the feeling that we have been really very useful, but I should like again to thank Mrs Gomes from the bottom of my heart because she has been of great help to us."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, the Saïfi Report was on the voting list for this evening rather than for midday."
"It was, however, dropped at midday, and that after the voting was already over and many of us had already left the Chamber."
"On re-reading the Rules of Procedure, it is quite clear to me that Article 170(4) states that the deferment of a vote may be moved before the vote takes place."
"It follows that Mr Schulz could now move that the Saïfi Report be deferred, but the reason why he cannot do that is clear to see, for he is obviously not even here."
"It is my view that we can no longer accept the Rules of Procedure being used in this way."
"The report could have been voted on now, but the reason why it was not scheduled to be voted on this evening was that there would have been a clear majority in favour of voting on it, for those who are present now are the ones who work right up to the last minute."
"What happened at noon today was the action of those who are too lazy to stick it out right through to the end of the sitting."
"Mr President, I would like to make a correction."
"Mr Posselt is evidently unaware that the motion originated, not from Mr Schulz but from somebody else."
"I might add that the vote went the way it did thanks to a majority far in excess of the number of Members present at the moment, and that makes it democratic."
"Mr President, I have to say, in support of the speech by my excellent fellow MEP, Mr Posselt that, from a certain point of view, we are very surprised at what has happened regarding the Saïfi report."
"I should like us to evaluate the consequences for it is, at root, a sign addressed to all those who care about the Strasbourg seat."
"Everyone knows that this seat is threatened."
"Let us think again about this morning’s vote."
"Independently of the issue raised by Mrs Saïfi’s report on an important subject, namely textiles, the debate on which ought not, in my opinion, to have been postponed for two months, given that it was an urgent matter, there is, in addition, the signal we have sent out by admitting that, as from 12.30 p.m. on Thursdays, it is impossible to do anything important in the Chamber of Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg, which I consider to be the main seat of the European Parliament."
"Given that our activities begin on Tuesday mornings, the fact that they cease on Thursday mornings would suggest, not to put too fine a point upon it, that the Strasbourg Parliament, in Strasbourg, only sits, roughly speaking, two days per month."
"That is a consequence of which I would ask all of my fellow Members to assess the significance, and that is why I am raising a formal protest on this subject."
"Mr President, I believe this has been agreed by all political groups."
"In paragraph 17 of the resolution, we should like to delete the words ‘government of national unity’ and insert the words ‘transitional government’."
"Could I also suggest that in paragraph 18 we also include the G8 governments."
". – This is simply toclarify that I had difficulty with my card in the voting machine and unfortunately I did not vote on my report."
"I wish it to be noted, however, that I was, of course, in favour."
"The vote is closed."
". The specific characteristics of farming and market supply in the outermost regions are evident and are rightly acknowledged by the EU."
"In this context, and in light of recent experience, I feel that the thrust of the proposal, which is essentially to make the process more flexible, meets Portugal’s considerable interests in this issue."
"Our outermost regions – the Azores and Madeira – deserve special focus due to their specific situation, not least in the field of agriculture."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 7 July 2005."
"Please allow me next to make a statement relating to the events we have witnessed this summer."
"As you will remember, on 7 July, at our last sitting before the holidays, we were taken by surprise by the terrorist attacks on London, which, as we feared at the time, caused many victims."
"Europe continues to be threatened by terrorism and this is a problem to which we must attach special importance in view of the events of July and those which followed."
"This summer, however, has also been marked by other tragic events: the persistence of terrorism in Iraq, horrendous natural disasters and accidents that have brought pain to many families throughout the world — particularly here in Europe and now, especially, in the United States."
"You must be aware that, during this summer, whenever one of these events has taken place, I have immediately expressed our solidarity and made contact with the countries affected by these dramas on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Every time they have happened we have made our voice heard."
"I also believe that we should all join together today to share the pain of the families of the victims of these events, of those who have lost their loved ones in the deadly conflicts affecting the planet."
"The United States deserve special mention, since they are currently experiencing a drama of extraordinary dimensions which is shocking the whole world."
"It appears that there will be many many victims, thousands of people have been displaced and enormous damage has been done, both in economic terms, and to the social structure."
"In Iraq, terrorism kills many people everyday, in a constant drip."
"A rumour alone is enough, as was the case a few weeks ago, when panic on a bridge in Baghdad led to the deaths of more than a thousand people."
"Dramatic civilian aeroplane and helicopter accidents have led to the deaths of more than 400 people in Indonesia, Greece, Venezuela, Peru and in the Baltic, and also in Afghanistan, where European soldiers have died — Spanish, on this occasion, but they could have been from any European country — following a helicopter accident."
"I feel we should remember at this point the words addressed to us by the President of Afghanistan, Mr Kharzai, when here in this Assembly he highlighted the significant role played by the troops of European countries in defence of human rights and peace-keeping in his country."
"There has been more: disastrous floods in Austria, Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Switzerland have killed dozens of people and displaced hundreds of thousands of inhabitants."
"Serious economic damage as a result of excessive rainfall in one half of Europe and serious economic damage resulting from the terrible drought suffered by the other half of Europe, a drought that feeds the forest fires, particularly in Portugal, France and Spain, which have cost the lives of dozens of people, including firefighters and pilots involved in fighting those fires."
"The results of this environmental damage caused by too much water, in some cases, and a lack of it, in others, will be very difficult to reverse and should remind us that the violent nature of these phenomena is the result of imbalances to which the European Union has paid particular attention and will have to continue to do so."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the majority of these dramas, the European Union has demonstrated its capacity to mobilise and to go to the assistance of the victims quickly."
"We must make use of our capacity for prevention and action in order to show solidarity."
"Our Parliament will have the opportunity to debate this issue today, within the context of the Commission statements appearing on our agenda and we will soon have to legislate on strengthening air safety."
"Having commented briefly on these dramatic events of this summer which is coming to an end, I would like to call on you, now that we are back here again, to observe a minute’s silence to demonstrate our solidarity with all of the victims and express our deepest sympathies to them."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 1 September, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"No amendments have been proposed for Monday or Tuesday."
"The agenda you have seen for Monday and Tuesday will therefore remain the same."
"As a result of a debate that took place in the Conference of Presidents, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the report by Mr Brok, on the Council Decision on the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the Agreement creating an association between the European Economic Community and Turkey as a result of the enlargement of the European Union, be added."
"Given the complexity of the issue, I believe that somebody should explain this request."
"Mrs Frassoni would like to do so."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group believes it is necessary to keep this item on the agenda."
"We had supported the same request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who decided, however, to change their minds, in our view for reasons linked not to Europe but to another very important event in a Member State."
"In our view, there is no need to be afraid of a debate on Turkey; on the contrary, such a debate is needed, and it is important to keep the protocol issue separate from the more general issue that we will be debating in the second September part-session."
"In that way we will be able to focus specifically on the topic of Cyprus, in which Turkey certainly holds some responsibility, although we must not forget that the Republic of Cyprus does as well."
"We believe the issue is important, and it is equally important for Parliament to be entirely free to discuss, debate and come to a decision on it quite separately from the other Institutions, such as the Council or the Commission."
"Indeed, Mr President, we have to consider the fact that we already know what the Council’s decision will be, since the informal Council has already been held."
"Mr President, last Thursday, in the Conference of Presidents, we had the opportunity to discuss this issue."
"I know that we in the Socialist Group, like most of the other groups in this House as well, do not think it appropriate to hold this vote this week."
"One reason for this is the ongoing discussion in the General Affairs Council, with particular reference to the outstanding issues in relation to Cyprus, which – along with a number of others – indicates that we should debate the whole package – that is to say, the adoption of the association agreement and all the other associated issues to do with our policy on Turkey – at the second part-session in September, along with the Commission’s negotiating mandate for 3 October."
"We therefore take the view that Mrs Frassoni’s motion should be rejected."
". Mr President, I would like, as rapporteur, to ask for your agreement to our inviting the Council to inform us how this protocol is to be implemented in view of the additional statement Turkey has made in relation to it, and to do so prior to any decision being taken by us and by 26 September at the latest."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that the debate on the situation of the political prisoners in Syria be replaced by the issue of human rights in Belarus."
"– The issue is a relatively simple one: the Committee on Foreign Affairs is set to adopt a report on relations between the EU and Syria, indeed next week in all likelihood."
"A separate resolution on this report does not therefore appear to be the most appropriate course of action at this time."
"With regard to Belarus, however, a number of MEPs were prevented from entering the country in August, this at a time when attacks on the independent media, journalists, members of the opposition and NGOs have been increasing at an alarming rate."
"Furthermore, various opponents of the Belarus Government, foreign journalists and leaders of the Union of Poles in Belarus have also been detained."
"We therefore feel that the urgent debate on relations with Syria should be replaced by one on the situation in Belarus."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out to the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that there is a great difference between a vote on an association agreement and one on a resolution regarding two specific cases of human rights violations in Syria: these concern two members of parliament, one of whom has been on hunger strike for a long time."
"We are thus facing a real emergency situation."
"As regards the situation in Belarus, we are all of the same mind, and we all express our concern."
"I would recall, however, that on 5 July this Parliament debated the Commission’s statement and on 10 July we adopted a resolution on more or less the same topics."
"I believe, therefore, that Parliament’s authority lies not in repeating resolutions but rather in ensuring that its resolutions are properly followed up."
"To conclude, in relation to the situation of the two members of parliament and the NGOs, we call for a letter from our President; as regards the situation in Belarus, we call for a new debate, perhaps in a forthcoming plenary session, so as to put greater pressure on both the Council and the Commission."
"On this matter, therefore, we agree with the proposal to keep the situation in Syria among the urgent subjects for debate."
"Mr President, the vote has been held, the result is clear, and we do of course respect it, but I would like to pick up on what Mrs Napoletano had to say."
"Belarus is still an important issue, and we should discuss it at one of the forthcoming part-sessions – I would suggest the second September one."
"We have just had a meeting of our group’s bureau that was attended by guests from Belarus."
"The situation there is very threatening, and so I ask Members now to agree to this debate being held during the second September part-session."
"This request is one that I make from the bottom of my heart and I make it to you all."
"Thank you, Mr Poettering."
"I am sure that the Presidents of the political groups will take good note of your request and that they will take it into account when establishing the agenda of the next part-session."
"The next item on the agenda is the requests for one-minute speeches, which we will continue to conduct in accordance with the instructions that I communicated to you by letter and which are gradually enabling us to carry out this item in a more organised fashion."
"Following the news of the attempted bomb attack on the president of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians, József Kasza, I went to visit the scene last week."
"I was able to ascertain in person that the hand-grenade had indeed been intended for József Kasza."
"I could only conclude, there in Subotica, that in Serbia-Montenegro’s northern province of Vojvodina, right on the border with the European Union, the series of attacks on national minorities has not come to an end."
"In fact, the situation has worsened."
"In documented cases of minority and human rights violations such as this, the European Parliament has a duty to consider the facts and not the self-justifying statements made by the relevant Serb politicians, who are implicated in these incidents."
"And this approach is particularly warranted in the case of a country with which the EU is preparing to open Association negotiations in the autumn."
"Making use of its budgetary power, the European Parliament also has a duty to use the Community support it provides to Serbia-Montenegro as an instrument to protect that minority."
"It is also the duty of the European Parliament, by conducting monitoring activities of its own on a more regular basis, to speak up concerning the kind of country the Union is entering into closer relations with. Last, the European Parliament also has a duty not to forget that, alongside József Kasza, there are some 300 000 people belonging to the Hungarian and other minorities in Vojvodina that need to be protected."
"On behalf of the nine languages of the ten new Member States, I would like to voice an objection, because once again discrimination is taking place against the new Member States."
"In July of this year, the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) published a competition in which, for the first time, candidates from all 25 Member States would be able to take the tests at the same time."
"Seven hundred new ‘public administrators’, as they are called in EU terminology, are to be recruited, but the language requirements include only the 11 languages of the 15 ‘old’ Member States."
"This means that a Dutch person is able to take the test in Dutch, while Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Slovenian, Estonia, Latvian, Lithuanian and Maltese applicants cannot take the test in their mother tongue, but must take it in one of the 11 languages of the 15 ‘old’ Member States."
"This is blatant discrimination and runs contrary to the spirit of the European Union."
"Mr President, I ask you – and I have submitted my request to you in writing too – to take action against this discrimination without delay."
"Mr President, the plane crash on 14 August involving a low-cost Cypriot airline claimed the lives of 121 people."
"In a small country like Cyprus, the human loss has been devastating and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and all my colleagues for the condolences offered to the families of the victims."
"While an investigation into the exact cause of the crash is under way, it would appear from leaked official reports that long-standing organisational errors and administrative shortcomings may have rendered the Cyprus Civil Aviation Department incapable of fulfilling adequately its role as an aviation safety service."
"Although the Government of Cyprus has committed itself to corrective measures immediately, it is now clear that the Commission has been aware of this situation for some time and has kept largely quiet and chosen to follow a slow and rather ineffective course of remedial action."
"Civil aviation authorities in other Member States may have similar safety-related problems, and corrective measures may be needed urgently."
"I hope that when the Commission makes a statement in this House later on tonight, it will be persuasively clear of its intention to tighten up urgently its watchdog role over the civil aviation authorities and to make sure that transparency is strictly applied."
"Mr President, thank you for commemorating the recent natural and other disasters."
"I would like now to address the floods affecting central Europe."
"Several tens of thousands of people have been affected by the rivers bursting their banks and the huge volume of rainfall in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary."
"The situation is without doubt worst in Romania: following the spring floods, it has suffered catastrophic damage in July and August."
"The floods, covering 34 counties and claiming many lives, have left 575 settlements, homes, several hundred kilometres of motorway, 83 schools, 29 nursery schools, hospitals and churches under water."
"The financial cost of the damage caused as a result of the natural disasters affecting Romania amounts to EUR 1.5 billion."
"On behalf of the Hungarian delegation, it is our moral duty to use every means at our disposal to support the region’s inhabitants."
"Romania – the poorest of the countries affected – cannot cover the enormous costs of reconstruction out of its own resources."
"It therefore needs to receive assistance as soon as possible from the European Union Solidarity Fund to be able to carry out salvage operations."
"I request your kind support in this matter."
"Mr President, I implore you, on behalf of Edinburgh in Scotland, to reconsider, with the Bureau, its flawed decision to hold the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg, rather than in my home city, Edinburgh."
"It is bad enough that we have to come to Strasbourg, without inflicting it on innocent third parties."
"Edinburgh and Scotland hosted the G8 Summit this year."
"The UK currently holds the Presidency of the European Union and Scotland wants this meeting to be in Edinburgh."
"The Edinburgh bid was better and cheaper."
"The Scottish Government will commit 100 000 Scottish pounds to help this event take place."
"We are used to welcoming hundreds of thousands of people to Scotland with warm Scottish hospitality every day."
"We want this meeting to be held in Edinburgh and we are willing to play our part to make it happen."
"I hope you and the Bureau will be able to play your part and reconsider."
"– Commissioner Mandelson’s recent statements have been alarming and unacceptable. Pandering to the interests of the major distributors and retailers in the EU, he has announced the intention to authorise the entry of tens of thousands of textile products currently held at customs, having exceeded the quotas set in the agreement concluded with the People’s Republic of China."
"What a pity the Commissioner did not show the same commitment in defence of Europe’s textile production, for example by activating safeguard clauses, a number of months ago when our textile sector was facing – as it still faces – a veritable flood of imports."
"The current situation has demonstrated who in the EU is really benefiting from the liberalisation of the textile sector; the major importers and distributors have increased their profit margins to ever more outlandish levels."
"There is much at stake: defending Europe’s clothing and textiles industry and ensuring that many thousands of companies and jobs are not wiped out, with the appalling social and economic consequences that that entails."
"– Mr President, mention was made earlier of the Minutes."
"However, I am not sure if everyone knows exactly what is going on with Turkey and Cyprus: Turkey does not recognise Cyprus."
"This is a direct insult on all of us here; on all of us who recognise Cyprus and consider the Members of the European Parliament from Cyprus to be our peers."
"And then Turkey comes along and says, ‘We do not recognise the Cypriots’. Consequently, it is insulting all of us who recognise the Cypriots."
"This matter needs to be examined in depth and we need to make this country understand that it cannot be the troublemaker of Europe before it has even joined Europe."
"It is incomprehensible."
"Imagine if it did not recognise Spain, your country; imagine if it did not recognise Germany or France: would we even be discussing this?"
"There can be no discrimination between small and large countries."
"All countries are equal here and Turkey cannot therefore cock a snook at democracy in this insulting manner."
"If Europe is based on anything, it is based on democracy and respect for the other nations and Turkey cannot barge in and invade this place and insult institutions and values which Europe sorely needs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 3 October, Europe will be given the opportunity of putting right a considerable mistake that it made last year by deciding not, after all, to open accession negotiations with Turkey."
"The mood in many Member States today is quite different from last year."
"Particularly the French Government springs to mind, now that the deadline of 3 October is drawing nearer."
"The arrogance with which Ankara haughtily refused to make the slightest effort in the area of human rights – examples I would cite include the recognition of the Armenian genocide, and the recent scandalous charges brought against Mr Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish author, with regard to linguistic rights for the Kurdish minority –shows how Turkey and its culture remain incompatible with our European values."
"Then there was also the ridiculous situation involving the so-called Ankara protocol and the Turkish Government’s persistent refusal to recognise another EU Member State, that being Cyprus."
"Mr de Villepin and Mrs Merkel, like many others, are quite right when they say that in that case, Turkey does not belong, and so I hope that that is the message that this House will be sending out."
"Mr President, reflecting on my speech concerning the situation of the ethnic Hungarians living in Latvia, Mr Zīle of Latvia accused me of ‘telling lies to this Parliament’."
"I come from a different political culture and do not use phrases of this kind about a fellow parliamentarian."
"I am sure he is just an innocent victim of a misunderstanding."
"After his intervention, I had the opportunity to talk to the leaders of the Hungarian minority of his country."
"I understand that for Hungarians living in Latvia, it is nearly impossible to pass the so-called citizenship exams, despite the fact that they have been educated there."
"On the other hand, those from other ethnic origins – Latvians and some other Baltic nations – have free, or almost free, access to citizenship."
"That is what I referred to and is what I called an unfair policy."
"Generally speaking, any kind of ethnic discrimination is against the basic democratic ideals of this Union, but in the case of Hungarians, even the historical arguments are missing for such discrimination."
"Mr President, I would like to give my unreserved support to those who argue that we have to help Romania to overcome a grave natural calamity at a difficult time, one in which it also has to prepare itself for membership of the European Union."
"This latter consideration, though, makes it seem to me all the more objectionable that the government is attempting, by way of a change in the law, to remove from office the presidents of the two houses of the parliament and those of the various regional parliaments, even though the current legislative period is not yet over."
"I think Romania has more important things to do, such as ensuring internal consensus."
"Perhaps you, Mr President, might make inquiries of your opposite numbers in Romania?"
"Above all, I would ask the representatives of the other political parties to bring influence to bear in an attempt to get these matters resolved consensually and without internal disruption, rather than by taking this sort of action against opposition parties."
"Romania needs political consensus if it is to make a good job of preparing itself for the European Union and for life as one of its Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the case of Francisco Larrañaga, a Spanish and European Union citizen sentenced to death in the Philippines."
"Regrettably, a few weeks ago the Philippine courts once again confirmed the death sentence on this citizen, and the clock is now ticking; we know that the trial was plagued with irregularities and that it is clear that Paco Larrañaga was not allowed a proper defence, since several witnesses have supported him, having seen him somewhere else on the same day and at the same time that the crime he is accused of was committed."
"But the essential thing at the moment is to save the life of Mr Larrañaga and all the institutions must do their bit in relation to this just demand."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a European Union citizen is going to be killed, and we cannot turn a blind eye to this violation of every citizen’s foremost right, the right to life."
"I would therefore call upon the President of this Parliament to appeal urgently to the government of the Philippines and to the President of that country and call on them to ensure that she exercise her right to pardon Francisco Larrañaga so that this European and Spanish citizen is not executed."
"Thank you very much, Mr Iturgaiz, for drawing the Presidency’s attention to this citizen’s situation."
"We shall look into the case and, if appropriate, we shall act in accordance with your suggestion."
"Mr President, last week marked the first anniversary of the Beslan massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 331 people, of which 186 were children."
"Astonishingly, the self-confessed perpetrator of this crime, Shamil Basayev, was appointed deputy prime minister of the so-called Chechen government-in-exile on 25 August."
"This man is a wanted war criminal and has close ties to Islamist terrorist groups like Al Qa’ida."
"The so-called foreign minister, a Mr Osman Ferzaouli, who resides in Denmark as a political refugee, says this will result in Basayev being more responsible in future."
"The culture minister, Akhmed Zakayev, resides in my city, London, also as a refugee, and in the past has denied any links with Mr Basayev."
"Surely Russia will accuse the European Union of double standards when we rightly demand that they punish those guilty of atrocities in Chechnya whilst we in the EU are giving harbour to these individuals who support terrorist action."
"The governments of Denmark and the United Kingdom should revoke the asylum status of Mr Ferzaouli and Mr Zakayev."
"Mr President, the lower Clyde on the west coast of Scotland has a fine record for building world-class ships."
"That industry has been in serious decline for the last 30 years."
"Now Ferguson’s – one of the few remaining yards – sees its future threatened."
"Mr President, as you know, all new orders for ships in the European Union have to go out to public tender."
"Ferguson’s recently lost a competitive tender to a company called Remontowa in Gdansk in Poland."
"They believe they lost it on unfair terms."
"The Commission is now investigating suspected state aids to that particular yard."
"I am raising this matter today because two new ships are out for tender and it is important that the next competition be based on a level playing field."
"Mr President, I ask you to join me in urging the Commission to complete its investigation as a matter of urgency so that we can know that this tender process will be on the basis of equals tendering for the contract and not with one company facing competition with one hand tied behind its back."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a major industrial dispute in my constituency of London which affected many thousands of air passengers around Europe – that of the Gate Gourmet workers, 670 of whom were arbitrarily dismissed from their jobs on 13 August without any redundancy payment."
"This led to a major strike by British Airways staff and caused major disruption for many passengers."
"Having visited the workers during the summer recess, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the poor industrial relations records of some of these companies and the need for an amicable settlement."
"All that the workers want is reinstatement, and if that is not possible, then redundancy payment."
"The company is moving in the right direction, but we should send the signal that throughout the European Union we want fair and balanced industrial relations, and observance of the law, so that consumer disruption of this kind can be avoided and workers can get on with their lives, and so that people with over 30 years’ service in such companies receive the justice they deserve."
"Mr President,"
"On 28 July, the IRA made an historic decision to end its armed struggle."
"Sinn Féin believes that there now exists the opportunity to achieve Irish Republican objectives through purely peaceful and democratic methods."
"This courageous initiative removes all remaining obstacles to real political movement and a shared future."
"Those who held up the IRA as the only impediment to peace have no more excuses."
"There is an onus upon the Democratic Unionist Party to engage with my party."
"Thus far, they have refused."
"There is also a responsibility on the British Government to implement the aspects of the Good Friday Agreement on which it has so far reneged."
"Meanwhile, the summer months have been characterised by attacks against vulnerable Catholic and nationalist homes."
"Bricks, petrol bombs, pipe bombs and gunfire have been an ever-present reality."
"Residents feel vulnerable and powerless and they feel angry at the inaction of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the relative silence of Unionist political representatives."
"The job for all those connected with the Irish peace process is immense."
"– Mr President, the recent tragic aeroplane crashes in Europe and the rest of the world, for the victims of which you too have just expressed your condolences, make it more than imperative that we redefine the dividing line between the need to liberalise and prevent distortion of competition in the civil aviation sector in Europe and the even more pressing and legitimate demand for maximum possible safety standards to be maintained."
"The European Union is obliged at the very least to initiate legislation to strengthen the legal framework for harmonising technical and administrative procedures in the civil aviation sector."
"Our demand should be accepted by the European Aviation Safety Agency, as should the measures which it has recommended or proposes to take."
"When legitimate interests in 'liberalisation', 'the market' and 'flight safety' are compared, we call for 'flight safety' to come first."
"This must be the message following the tragic aeroplane crashes."
"Mr President, since we last met, a Member State of this Union, the Republic of Ireland, has been shamefully harbouring three convicted international terrorists."
"IRA terrorists Monaghan, Connolly and McCauley were duly convicted of training FARC guerrillas in Colombia."
"They skipped bail – partly put up, it is said, by the Dublin Government – and now, on the back of a sordid deal with the IRA, and despite Interpol warrants for the three men, they are brazenly flaunting themselves in Dublin."
"To date, Ireland has done nothing to meet its international obligations, but continues to provide complicit sanctuary for these international terrorists, making a mockery of their affirmations in this House, when President of the Council, that they were committed to the fight against international terrorism."
"I condemn that duplicity, I condemn that hypocrisy but most of all I call on the Dublin Government to end the shame and to return these fugitives forthwith."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of the opportunity presented today to bring to the House’s attention a remarkable initiative by some of Europe’s young people."
"Over 50 of them, from six European countries, took part in a workshop at a college of higher education in my electoral district in which they acted out their own ‘European Parliament’, the object being to make the EU more attractive to the public."
"What emerged from this was a resolution on the creation of a citizens’ Europe, a number of points from which I would like to quote."
"The young people’s ‘European Parliament’ calls on the Commission to provide the citizens of Europe with comprehensive information about the Member States, European policymaking, and cultural events in all their diversity."
"They call for a deceleration of the enlargement process and, in order that there should be more in-depth information about the EU, propose closer cooperation between it and the national broadcasters."
"They articulate the view that EU information material must come across to the public in their day-to-day lives and the environments in which they live, and they believe it necessary that the EU should cooperate across the board with institutions involved in school education at national level in fostering cultural, historical and political awareness."
"Mr President, along the same lines as Mr Allister, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, during the summer, we witnessed the return to Dublin – to the Republic of Ireland – of the so-called Colombia Three."
"As you may be aware, Mr President, the three men involved were convicted in Colombia of assisting FARC terrorists there."
"In the interests of fighting international terrorism, these men should be returned to Colombia to finish the sentences they were given originally, and not be allowed to go free, as they are at present, to flout international will."
"You cannot, on the one hand, pay lip-service to the fight against terrorism if, on the other hand, you overlook what is actually happening within a Member State of the European Union."
"This has got to be acted upon, and acted upon positively, and the response should be made in a very responsible and effective manner."
"Mr President, I would like to remind both Mr Allister and Mr Nicholson, and indeed Mrs de Brún, that the rule of law applies in the Republic of Ireland and the law will take its course in the Republic of Ireland in relation to the case they mentioned."
"Could I also remind Mrs de Brún that she has no right to use the term 'Óglaigh na hÉireann' when referring to the IRA. 'Óglaigh na hÉireann' is the name of the Irish Army, not an illegal Irish organisation called the IRA."
"My reason for rising here today is to welcome those participating in the freedom drive to the European Parliament."
"People with disabilities are looking to Europe to help them achieve their full freedom and dignity as European citizens."
"We must listen to them and act, and indeed the Commission and the Council must especially listen and respond effectively to their legitimate concerns."
"As I will not have the opportunity to do so later on in the debate, I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to all those in New Orleans and elsewhere in the United States who have lost relatives, friends, and indeed belongings, as a result of the catastrophe following Hurricane Katrina."
"Political lessons should be learnt from this, but they must take second place to Europe offering whatever aid is needed and whatever aid is requested by the United States to assist the people concerned."
"Mr President, I wish to draw the attention of this House to a very practical matter that is specifically of concern to Irish beef farmers, but that touches at the very heart of the recent Common Agricultural Policy reforms."
"Throughout the summer months we in Ireland have witnessed the direct impact of the importation of cheap Brazilian beef into the market."
"If you recall, Commissioner Fischler promised farmers less bureaucracy and better market prices."
"However, what we and farmers throughout Europe are seeing is that the price for their product will be set by the lowest-cost producer outside the European Union."
"We have seen what has happened with the textile industry throughout Europe."
"Are we going to see something similar happen to the European Union's agriculture and food industry?"
"As we approach the world trade talks again in November, I urge the Commission to ensure that beef is treated as a sensitive product and that we do not eradicate our own beef producers because of cheap third country imports."
"I would add that the regulations that Europe imposes on its farmers are very strict and much more difficult than those imposed on food produced outside the Union and that should be taken into account as well."
"Mr President, while watching Belgian television during the summer recess, I heard members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament voice criticisms concerning the EUR 1 million donated by Parliament to the World Youth Day in Cologne."
"I should like to make it known that I am outraged at this waging of war on Europe’s Christian past, present and future."
"It is not imperative that Europe be Christian, and there is nothing to stop it being secular."
"Yet if we fail to respect the religion that has been ours throughout history, and thanks to which Europe came into being, there is a risk that our continent will one day become Muslim."
"Provided that it is not already too late, we should endeavour to prevent this from happening."
"Mr President, for the second time in the past six months, I should like to protest to the House at the insulting of Catholics."
"I have been prompted to do so this time by the desecration of an image of the Holy Mother of Częstochowa at an exhibition held in the Brussels Parliament to mark the 25th anniversary of Solidarity."
"The Black Madonna of Jasna Góra is the most sacred being apart from God for Polish people, and, in the words of a poet, ‘even those who believe in nothing believe in her’."
"I would remind the House that according to the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, everyone has the right to freedom of religion."
"As well as making religious tolerance compulsory, this guarantees respect for devotional objects."
"Failure to comply with this principle is nothing other than an insult to Catholics and to non-Catholics who respect Our Lady the Queen of Poland, as well as a violation of the Convention."
"I would note that values based on Christianity are a fundamental aspect of European culture, and a cultural heritage shared by the nations of our continent."
"Mr President, on behalf of all those who are opposed to the European Constitution, I should like to take this opportunity to greet the House at its first session after the summer recess."
"I should like to inform Members that there has been a good crop of mushrooms and other forest products in Poland, despite the crisis in the European Union."
"We are doing very nicely indeed, and the number of opponents to the Constitution is rising dramatically."
"At the same time, I should also like to call on the European Union to apply those principles it proclaimed before the new Member States joined, namely equality, honesty and a fair settling of accounts."
"Mr President, three more countries ratified the European Constitution over the summer, namely Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg, with ratification in Luxembourg taking place by means of a referendum."
"I should like to say how much I welcome this development, which demonstrates that the European Constitution is far from dead, regardless of what its opponents, the Eurosceptics, might think."
"I would call on those countries which have not yet ratified the European Constitution – my own country, the Czech Republic, being one of them – to endeavour to do so over the next few months."
"Two thirds of people in the Czech Republic would like to have their say on the European Constitution, and 49% are still in favour of it."
"At the same time, ratification presents Parliament with the challenge of strengthening its dialogue with citizens and stepping up the debate on both the ratification of the European Constitution and, of course, on the future of the European Union."
"Mr President, I am grateful to you for drawing the attention of the House to the catastrophe in Louisiana and New Orleans."
"Some of these people are of French and Spanish descent and are, of course, American citizens."
"The European Commission has an ability to provide extremely good advice and support through ECHO."
"All around the world in crises of a similar type, ECHO has played a prominent advisory role – in the tsunami in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, and in other instances such as the Mozambique floods."
"I have discussed this matter with Commissioner Michel and am requesting this Parliament to ask the Commission to send an ECHO team to advise the United States authorities, both state and federal, on our experience of dealing with these matters."
"It is our chance to give something back to the American people."
"Mr President, on 29 July, criminal indictments against subsidiaries of UBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were announced by prosecutors in Milan who are investigating the collapse of the giant Italian dairy company Parmalat."
"Within 48 hours, a former member of the Citibank board fell to his death from his New York apartment and a former President of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, was found dead in his own swimming pool."
"Mr Duisenberg, of course, enjoyed the support of Deutsche Bank in his fight for the presidency of the ECB."
"Given the curious coincidence and timing of these unusual and unexpected deaths, this House might hope that Europol and the intelligence services will look closely at the surrounding circumstances."
"Mr President, in mid-August Polish MEPs were prevented from entering Belarus by border guards."
"I hereby call on the President to lodge an official protest about this, since the initial response of the President’s spokesman was a refusal to comment on what he said was a private matter concerning only the Polish MEPs."
"I was among the four MEPs prevented from entering Belarus in August, after being denied entry into Cuba in May."
"Neither Fidel Castro nor the Belarussian dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, pay any regard to international standards."
"The two capitals of Havana and Minsk are symbols of human rights violations and the gagging of public opinion."
"The reason behind my attempted trip to Belarus was Mr Lukashenko’s instigation of a new wave of persecution against those of his citizens whose opinions differ from his own."
"The last remaining independent newspapers have been shut down, access to the Internet has been blocked and opposition activists have been detained, arrested and sentenced."
"The same fate has befallen the democratically elected leaders of the Union of Poles in Belarus, which was the last NGO that had not fallen into step with the Minsk dictatorship."
"I call on the President to ensure that the EU institutions set in motion measures to support activists who have been persecuted by Mr Lukashenko."
"Steps should be taken to put pressure on Mr Lukashenko’s officials, and backing should also be given to independent radio stations and programmes broadcasting to Belarus from neighbouring countries."
"Such broadcasts will be the only source of independent information for Belarussians."
"In the world of today we are unfortunately becoming witnesses to various natural disasters, such as floods or fires following disastrous droughts."
"I may not be saying anything new here, but I have the feeling that we are constantly underestimating the very real threat of the bird flu pandemic."
"The head of the WHO flu programme, Klaus Stöhr, said on a German radio station that if the virus mutates, it will spread rapidly."
"Stöhr says that there are scenarios in which the virus could spread across the entire word in three to six months."
"Together with many colleagues present here, I believe that the preventive measures that individual Member States and the European Union as a whole have taken are inadequate, which may be partly due to lack of funding, or an unwillingness to release such funds."
"In my opinion we need to refine a system for releasing monies for preventive measures against bird flu and for the purchase of antiviral drugs from the European Solidarity Fund much more quickly."
"That concludes this item."
"The next item is the Commission statement on natural disasters (fires and floods)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the extreme weather this summer has left a trail of destruction in numerous countries in Europe as well as in the United States of America and we have also seen many lives lost in the accidents of which the President spoke earlier."
"I too would therefore like, on behalf of the College of Commissioners, to express my condolences and our support for the victims of these disasters and accidents."
"The Iberian peninsular suffered the worst drought in 60 years and this, in conjunction with high temperatures, encouraged the fires to spread in southern Europe."
"At the same time as the fires, floods inundated Central and Eastern Europe and hurricane Katrina hit the southern states of the United States of America."
"Floods and forest fires occur repeatedly in Europe."
"The repercussions were more serious this year, but the fact that they occurred comes as no surprise to us."
"Consequently, political leaders need to anticipate this sort of disaster by planning measures which help to prevent, where possible, and using all available resources to deal with such crises in the most efficient way possible."
"The Community civil protection mechanism was adopted in 2001 so that the European Union could respond in an efficient and coordinated manner to major emergencies."
"This mechanism is used to coordinate the resources available in the Member States for providing assistance."
"It also helps by conducting drills and planning hypothetical scenarios and simulations in order to identify possible gaps and problems in the Member States' civil protection systems and promotes cooperation and interoperability between the Member States' emergency services."
"When the mechanism was activated in Portugal at the government's request, the European Union managed to organise the despatch and intervention of a number of fire-fighting vessels and helicopters from France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands within 24 hours to support the Portuguese fire-fighters and, with this assistance and more favourable weather conditions, it proved possible to check the fires within a few days."
"In this way, the situation was brought under control and at midday today there were only five fires, compared with more than 50 on 22 August."
"The mechanism was also used to provide help to Bulgaria and Romania, the two countries worst hit by the floods."
"Several Member States provided help by despatching teams, pumps, decontaminants and other resources through the European Union's civil protection mechanism."
"At the moment, the European Union is making an important contribution to and is participating in efforts by the United States to deal with the tragic trail of destruction left behind by hurricane Katrina."
"Yesterday, Sunday, we received an official request for assistance from the United States and immediately activated the civil protection mechanism in order to coordinate the help provided by the Member States to the areas affected."
"The European assistance package is made up of contributions from the Member States, which vary from material assistance to equipment and missions of experts and other specialists."
"Teams of experts and other materials have already arrived in the United States."
"The Community civil protection mechanism has now become a necessary tool for coordinating European assistance."
"The response to the events of this summer, like the response to the tsunami at the end of last year, has proven that the mechanism operates satisfactorily."
"Nonetheless, there is room for improvement, which is why the Commission proposed a package of measures in April 2005 to strengthen the European Union's response capability in the field of civil protection."
"These measures include proposals to improve the transportation of aid and the facility for the European Union to lease specialist equipment, such as additional water bomber aircraft, from third countries."
"These are precisely the sort of measures which will give European citizens – and not just European citizens – better protection against future disasters."
"The Council is now examining the package of measures to strengthen civil protection."
"I am certain that the European Parliament supports our proposals and will stand by us in our endeavour."
"Civil protection can only cover the first, immediate stage of an emergency."
"Other resources need to be used in order to deal with the consequences of disasters and to prevent them; this is what Mr Pan Ouzký was talking about earlier."
"The Commission has certain such resources at its disposal. Let me give you some examples."
"The rural development programmes provide support to a broad range of forestry activities with funds to prevent fires and restore forests which have suffered damage."
"The 'forest focus' regulation is the most recent resource which we have at our disposal for monitoring the application of measures to prevent forest fires."
"The financial package for 'forest focus' for the period from 2003 to 2006 totals EUR 65 million, which includes EUR 9 million for preventing fires."
"As far as floods are concerned, the Commission has proposed that a European Union coordinated action plan be prepared and applied in order to manage the risk of floods."
"The Commission has taken the relevant political initiative in application of the conclusions of the European Council held in December 2004."
"The European Union Solidarity Fund can provide support to countries hit by major disasters in order to help them with their restoration efforts."
"Romania and Bulgaria have already asked the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund."
"My colleagues responsible for regional policy, enlargement and agriculture are presently examining these requests."
"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, allow me to close by saying that I am certain that the European Parliament will support our proposals and will take advantage of this opportunity to put the commitment to solidarity which it has undertaken into further action."
"It is our duty towards everyone hit by the recent disasters."
". Mr President, as the Commissioner responsible for the environment has pointed out, this summer we in the European Union have been the victims of disasters caused by fire and by water, and while some regions are seriously threatened by gradual desertification, others are living in fear of floods."
"This is a demonstration of European diversity and of the need to be sensitive to the realities faced by others."
"In several countries of the south of Europe, the fires have led to the loss of dozens of human lives, the evacuation of entire populations and extraordinary environmental damage."
"It is true that we are suffering a year of drought, but I believe that it is unacceptable to resign ourselves to fate."
"On the contrary, it is our responsibility to analyse the underlying causes of the disasters that are repeated year after year, and to find out what we are doing wrong or, quite simply, what we are failing to do."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore proposes the creation of a temporary committee in our Parliament."
"That committee should assess which concrete measures we could adopt in Europe to complement those that are being implemented in the Member States."
"Fire does not stop at national borders, and we should therefore create a European protocol for fighting fires; we should at least consider creating a specific European agency and – why not? – specialised cross-border bodies."
"Commissioner, twenty-four hours is sometimes too long."
"Without prejudice to the role of the European Solidarity Fund, I believe it would be a mistake to restrict ourselves to seeking funds every time we suffer a fire."
"We must go further: for example, the European Commission, with the support of the Council, has removed the aid to farmers for the creation, clearing and monitoring of firebreaks, and that is something that should perhaps be reconsidered."
"Mr President, these are some of the proposals we could evaluate in this temporary committee that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposes be created in our Parliament."
"– Mr President, I should like to begin by echoing the words of the President of Parliament at the beginning of this sitting. On behalf of the Socialist Group, I wish to express my solidarity with the victims of all of these disasters."
"Secondly, I should like to thank all of the Members of this Chamber, from north, south, east and west, and from all political groups, who have expressed specifically to us – the Portuguese socialists – their solidarity with the victims of the drought and the fires currently ravaging the western Iberian Peninsula, with Portugal very much the worst affected region."
"I should like to say that what is happening to Portuguese forests is, in terms of scale, without parallel around the world, without parallel in the Amazon region, without parallel anywhere."
"The deforestation that has taken place in recent decades is on an absolutely disastrous scale; we cannot ignore the scale of this disaster."
"We must take account of the seriousness of the problem and consider the entire range of measures that need to be taken to deal with the situation."
"We must analyse the viability of the Solidarity Fund and ascertain why it has thus far been unable, for example, to combat the fires; why, for example, has it been unable to provide financial support for the aeroplanes needed to tackle the fires?"
"We must look into the question of farming, as Mr Galeote Quecedo rightly pointed out, because this disaster is part of a drought on an enormous scale. We must also look into forest policy in order to ensure that it takes greater account of the climatic characteristics of the west of the Peninsula."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to express my solidarity with the victims, although solidarity alone is not enough: we have to make a solemn commitment to the victims that we will make a serious and determined effort to prevent such disasters."
"Let us begin, however, by asking ourselves why such events happen."
"In my view, global warming is certainly involved, as it has aggravated extreme events, or longer periods of drought, as was pointed out by Commissioner Dimas, whom I thank for being here today."
"I must also mention heavier rainfall – another phenomenon that has no counterpart in the past."
"I would point out that a two-degree increase in air temperature, from 20 to 22°C, means a 12% increase in the water vapour content of the atmosphere and hence in the amount of energy in the atmosphere, as we have unfortunately seen confirmed in hurricane Katrina."
"We have to pool our efforts to organise our civil defence response: that is truly a job to be tackled at Union level and no longer just by the Member States."
"We must strengthen our commitment to intervene following disasters, but above all, particularly as extreme events are getting worse, we must reinforce a global prevention plan that includes the maintenance of watercourses. It is clear that, when one addresses the situation on the ground, all the necessary measures need to be carried out on the ground."
"Such maintenance must allow for the hydroelectric use of watercourses, as well as reforestation and the recycling of biomass for energy purposes: in short, a measure designed to implement a systems-oriented plan of work."
"That is the subject that I should like to put to you, and I have yet to hear any discussion of its importance."
"We must ensure that it can all be sustained with own resources so as to constitute a great resource for the European Union as a whole."
"It is a scheme that should enhance our security in terms of water resources, geology and fire protection and also enable us to make use of energy generated on the ground."
"It is a systems-oriented measure that I call on the European Union to promote in support of the actions taken by Member States."
". Mr President, I too wish to pay my respects and those of the Verts/ALE Group to those killed, injured, or otherwise suffering from the effects of these calamities, for which – although we describe them as ‘natural disasters’ – human action must bear at least some share of the blame."
"In particular, as I see it, the images we have seen from the USA over recent days show that we politicians have the great responsibility of doing everything humanly possible to prevent such calamities or to alleviate their effects."
"I have two or three practical questions I would like to put to Commissioner Dimas."
"The first has to do with protection against flooding."
"We heard, particularly from Austria, complaints to the effect that there was room for improvement in cross-border cooperation, for example on the Danube."
"Could you, Commissioner Dimas, say something more, and more specific, about what instruments the EU possesses to deal with this?"
"Turning to the forest fires in Portugal, this is the second year that we have been faced with such an extreme situation."
"Last year, measures were introduced in the individual locations; do you have as yet any initial findings relating to them?"
"Were these measures effective this year?"
"If we are now to talk in terms of new funding, it follows that we have to know which measures are effective and which are not."
"Another thing I particularly want to do is to take up Mr Prodi’s idea."
"I am astonished, Commissioner Dimas, by the lack of any more proactive approach in your speech."
"Climatologists are predicting extreme drought in Southern Europe, as well as flooding and extreme weather phenomena in Central Europe, not to mention that climate change will make hurricanes and typhoons even more powerful and even more devastating."
"They have produced a whole range of publications on the subject."
"Let me ask you, Commissioner Dimas, whether we ought not, at last, to do more about climate change, on top of all the many things that are said about it?"
"Where have we got to with the second European Climate Change Programme, and how do you intend to inject more life into the climate talks in Montreal this autumn and winter?"
"If we decide on measures to protect us against climate change and organise them in an intelligent way, these self-same measures will reduce our dependence on crude oil and help to improve the quality of the air in our towns and cities."
"Perhaps the Commission should shed some light on the details of what would be a win-win-win situation."
"– We welcome the scheduling of this debate, as we proposed at the beginning of August."
"Some 200 000 hectares of forest in Portugal and over 120 000 hectares in Spain have thus far been scorched as a result of the severe drought."
"Dozens of human lives, including those of firefighters, have been lost; homes, farms and factories have been destroyed; protected ecosystems have been lost. That is without mentioning the heavy emotional cost, for which nothing, nobody, will compensate."
"We therefore wish to express our deepest condolences and our solidarity with the bereaved families and with the populations in the affected regions. We should also like to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by the firefighters and the people that have made efforts to combat the fires."
"In light of the seriousness of the situation, the Commission must quickly step up its collaboration with the national authorities to support the populations, to help minimise the effects of the fires and the flooding, to support all national support initiatives aimed at restoring the production capacities of the affected regions, thereby creating jobs and providing compensation for the social costs involved in job losses and destruction of livelihoods."
"This can be done by activating the Solidarity Fund for the regions and countries affected, if necessary by changing it."
"Community administrative procedures must be facilitated, especially those relating to the need to re-programme the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Measures must be taken to make these procedures more flexible."
"Support must be given for the reforestation of the affected areas – taking account of their bio-climatic and ecological characteristics – and for forest fire prevention measures, such as firebreaks, forest tracks, access points, water points and forestry programmes."
"Payment of certain direct aid to farmers under the common agricultural policy must be brought forward so as to take account of the problem of the fires and the drought on the farming sector."
"Article 87(2) of the Treaty must also be implemented as a matter of urgency, with the aim of granting appropriate financial aid to all affected sectors."
"A further urgently required measure is the implementation of an effective, Community-wide protection system, in order to protect farmers, especially small and medium-sized holdings, against dangers and crises such as those arising from the current drought and fires, or floods. Possible measures include a public farmers’ insurance scheme financed by Community funds, enabling farmers to receive a minimum wage in the event of public disasters of this nature."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am myself from the Vorarlberg, one of the places affected, but am every bit as deeply affected by what is going on in Portugal and in the Southern States of the USA."
"A committed European ought, after all, to look much further afield and go beyond what Members have already – and rightly – said."
"We ought, actually, to be looking as far ahead as 2050."
"Climate change is happening now. That is not just what Klaus Töpfer, the head of the UN Environment Programme, says; it is also a matter of scientific observation."
"Is it not high time for a master plan to be drawn up with all speed – one rather like the one that NASA drew up to address the anticipated climate change as long ago as the 1980s – which would list what we can expect to have to cope with in great detail and without taboos, not even the taboo against the evacuation of certain currently inhabited areas?"
"Here in Europe, we will not be able to afford to rebuild – every year or every three years – the places we are still protecting."
"It is high time that we really did look further ahead."
"– Mr President, I should like to say that I share the words of the President of Parliament, along with those of Mr Galeote, Mr Casaca and Mr Guerreiro, who gave an overview of the situation and with which I am in broad agreement."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity, Commissioner, to address a few remarks directly to you."
"Quite apart from humanitarian and technical considerations, there is also a political dimension."
"The political question is whether or not the European institutions, and the Commission in particular, have the ability to give an unequivocal example of what European cooperation can be, of European solidarity for the many populations affected."
"I wish to tell you that the best thing that Europe can do at the present time for Portugal – the country that I know best – is to offer a swift and effective response to the populations affected, of which there are many throughout my country."
"A response a year from now, however technically good, technically perfect even, is worse than an immediate response that has political meaning."
"This is my message."
"I wish to express my hope that the Commission is able to translate these intentions into reality and that Parliament, in the guise of its temporary committee, applies the necessary pressure and offers the help needed for this to happen."
"Mr President, as other speakers have already said, during this summer 2005, two natural phenomena, the devastating fires and the horrendous floods, have caused destruction and the tragic loss of human lives throughout the European continent: in the Member States, in certain candidate countries and also amongst our closest neighbours, such as Switzerland."
"In its Resolution, the Socialist Group wishes to pay a sincere tribute to these victims and to express its solidarity with their families and friends."
"In our Resolution, we Socialists note that these disasters are not isolated events, but that they happen year after year, their repetition demonstrating structural problems, which include climate change, but also others linked, for example, to agriculture and the agricultural use of land."
"In its Resolution, the Socialist Group calls for European solidarity, not just through an immediate economic commitment, asking the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, but also through other medium- and long-term measures, such as the creation of a European civil protection body or a European drought monitoring centre, or also, ladies and gentlemen, through the production of an initiative report."
"We believe that this would be more effective than a temporary committee, and would seal the commitment that the European Parliament must also make, not just urging other institutions, such as the European Commission for example, to work, but also working itself as a legislator, in this case via its different committees, which could work together, as I have said, to produce an initiative report on forest fires and on the natural disasters that regularly desolate our continent in the summer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European drought monitoring centre would naturally be a tool for promoting knowledge and reducing and monitoring the effects of drought in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Europe under water, Europe under fire, this ought not to be inevitable, yet, unfortunately, it is a recurring theme, and every year we are forced to speak about it."
"These disasters are mistakenly described as natural disasters."
"In actual fact, we know that fires are nearly always, in the first place, caused by human beings, whether because they are criminal acts, because they are linked to acts of carelessness or because they are due to political choices that have led us to neglect entire areas."
"Faced with these disasters, we have to join together and let solidarity prevail."
"We require a genuine European public security organisation that combines human and material resources so that real European mutual aid can exist."
"Commissioner, you have made proposals along these lines."
"Faced with the scale of the disaster in Portugal, I was struck by the lack of resources on the ground."
"This would suggest that a precise list of everybody’s forces should be drawn up, and it is the responsibility of the Commission to take the initiative for this."
"We will support it in this area."
"We also need to carry out repairs, and in order to do so, we must make use of the Structural Funds or the Cohesion Fund."
"We must, however, use these for prevention purposes."
"In this area, awareness campaigns encouraging vigilance and reminding arsonists of the penalties they incur must be implemented, or, as the case may be, strengthened."
"With regard to forestry policy and agricultural policy, let us acknowledge our mistakes, let us question the decisions that have led to lands being neglected and the spread of scrubland, where it is impossible for our public security forces to intervene effectively."
"We also need to make better use of plant species to combat fires."
"The floods that have descended on Central Europe and Alpine Europe are not inevitable either."
"They are often due to the outcome of climate change and human activity."
"We are equipped with instruments and a raft of measures."
"We simply must call on the Member States to take on their share of the contract and to apply the national implementing measures without delay."
"The Commission must also present proposals to us for 2012."
"Without doubt, it is primarily human lives, those of our fire fighters and of our rescue teams, which for us are at stake, not to mention the ecological disaster and the need to regenerate the natural environment."
"It is with all of the direct or indirect victims in mind that we must intervene."
"In my constituency, in the Alps, we have had flooding, and in Provence and Corsica there have been fires."
"It is for this reason that European solidarity must operate as a survival reflex."
"Mr President, although we have already, today, expressed our solidarity with the victims of this environmental disaster, it is at least as important that we should continue to make solidarity with the persons affected within the European Union our concern even after the television cameras have been switched off."
"When people are starting again from scratch for the third time in six years, as some are having to do in my part of the world, it is not surprising that there is a lot of despair in evidence."
"I believe that our definition of the Solidarity Fund is too narrow if it is not possible for Europe to intervene financially to deal with this, despite losses of the kind seen in the region from which I come, where one third of the provincial budget has – in the truest sense of the word – been washed away."
"Apart from reformulating the criteria for the Solidarity Fund, what can the EU do?"
"Above all, I think, it can remind the Member States of their own responsibilities. As has already been said, climate change is already happening here."
"It has to be reiterated that Austria – and this I say as an Austrian – still has much to do when it comes to achieving the Kyoto target."
"You, Commissioner, cannot simply stand by and say that you will see to it that there are as many aircraft as possible in place in the event of a fire; we have to take action before things get that far."
"In working across borders too – as we have seen from the floods, when different Member States were affected by the same adverse weather conditions – in the INTERREG programmes, and in research projects, priority needs to be given to cross-border measures and prevention."
"We have discussions on this subject to look forward to, and I see it as an area in which a rethink is called for."
"It is now open to us, in the next research framework programme and in the trans-European networks, to take appropriate medium-term action in this area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking all those who, in highly sacrificial ways, gave help in the various disasters that are the regrettable topic of today’s debate, getting stuck in and helping, as quickly as possible, to limit the damage by giving speedy aid wherever it was needed."
"With many speakers, I can do no other than agree."
"We must of course prepare ourselves for the disasters that seem to come our way with ever-increasing frequency."
"I want to make it very clear, Commissioner Dimas, that the programmes that the Commission put forward resulted in preventive measures being taken."
"I can tell you that that was the case in my own home region, upon which the flooding has now had an appalling impact, and where the various measures we took to deal with flooding resulted in markedly less damage being done than in the past, even though the quantity of water was greater than when the area was last flooded."
"What that means is that aid is having an effect and is also being used to prepare preventive infrastructures."
"It is of course very regrettable that, in my electoral district and elsewhere, the flood occurred while these were being built, with the consequence that a number of things that were under construction were also destroyed and the floodwater took another course than it would have done had the infrastructure been completed."
"I would like to appeal to the Commission to make extensive use of the Solidarity Fund."
"Funds for this purpose are still available for 2005."
"I hope that the Member States affected will soon be in a position to give Brussels a report on what the damage amounts to and enable the Commission to make funds promptly available for the speedy rebuilding of public facilities – for that is the major problem where I come from – and to help build up protective infrastructure."
"That will be the right response and will put us on the right track."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a verse, the greatest Portuguese poet once described love as ‘fire that burns without being seen’."
"I should like to talk to you about other fires – ones that burn and can be seen; fires that cause something very different from love, because they spread sadness, they confirm how impotent we are, they cause terror, they induce anguish, they kill, they destroy wealth and they undermine confidence in the present and hope for the future."
"This has manifested itself in a great sea of grey, and a giant cloak of smoke continues to lay waste to Portugal, especially the Central and Northern regions."
"The forest fire disaster has thus far given us some terrible statistics; the fires have burnt more than 240 000 hectares!"
"Yesterday, indeed, Motorway number 1, which links Lisbon and Oporto, was closed to traffic for hours, due to a fire burning near the town of Fátima."
"At the same time, flames continued to devastate the districts of Aveiro, Bragança, Guarda, Leiria, Santarém and Viseu."
"In my district, Coimbra, which is the worst affected, the flames have consumed 32 km2 in the municipality of Pampilhosa da Serra alone, and only 8 km2 of forest remained."
"This municipality has been totally decimated and has virtually been wiped off the map."
"In the city of Coimbra itself, the fire leapt over the River Mondego, penetrated well into the urban area and levelled everything in its path."
"The flames travelled 20 km in three hours."
"Some 80% of the Vale de Canas National Forest has been destroyed."
"Other municipalities in the region, such as Miranda do Corvo, where I am the chairman of the municipal assembly, Penela, Poiares, Penacova and Soure, have been hit in devastating fashion."
"In some regions of the country, the picture is disastrous; the majority of the population has been affected and economic stability has been undermined (the forest is of key importance to the local and regional economy)."
"There is no doubt that the situation meets the exceptional conditions that Commissioner Hübner has deemed acceptable for mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund."
"This summer, Spain, France and Greece have endured the same story, suffering similarly devastating effects."
"The fight against disasters must be made an EU priority."
"Coming back to Portugal, in addition to the problem of the forest fires, we have the problem of the drought, which now affects 100% of mainland Portuguese territory: more than 80% of the country has suffered extreme drought and around 20% severe drought."
"It is horrendous."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe that we are building is first and foremost an area of solidarity; and that solidarity must be translated into action, even if the strict letter of the law does not quite match up to the hard reality that we are enduring."
"There is always more to life than can be covered in regulations."
"Let us wipe out misery, sadness, impotence, terror, anguish, death and the destruction of wealth."
"Let us raise the flags of confidence in the present and hope for the future."
"It is a matter of urgent priority that we minimise losses of all kinds arising from the fires and the drought in Portugal."
"Portuguese citizens confidently expect a significant gesture of support from the citizens of other parts of Europe, a gesture that should be given material form by Europe’s institutions."
"This is the only way in which we will achieve more and better Europe."
"This is the only way in which Europe will fulfil its destiny."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the end of July I have been keeping a close eye on the terrible tragedy of the forest fires throughout the country."
"Quite apart from the widespread destruction, it has caused panic and taken lives."
"There have been 18 fatalities in Portugal, including one Pedro Figueiredo, a dedicated firefighter from Oliveira de Azeméis, who was due to run in the October local elections on the basis of his extraordinary civic and community dedication."
"The threat of large-scale fires has not gone away; it is still present."
"As recently as last night, coming from the interior of the country to make the journey here, I passed the great fire of Sardoal, which was still burning."
"We knew that this was going to happen this year, not only because of the experience of previous years and the weather forecasts, but also because our forests had become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the drought, the other plague ravaging my country and its countryside for a number of months now."
"In April, during the debate and in Parliament’s resolution, which I was involved in tabling, the risk was already clearly forecast and clearly apparent."
"This is why I was taken aback by the apparent initial surprise that characterised the response and by the hesitation in some countries."
"I was similarly surprised by the decision taken by the Council of Ministers in June to scrap the firebreak subsidy."
"This decision was entirely incorrect in and of itself and especially absurd in a year such as this."
"The dire problem of the forest fires has created a deep sense that the Portuguese countryside has no hope, that it is unsustainable, and that it has been abandoned and neglected."
"Our forest is one of our greatest national treasures. There are many reasons why it is so vulnerable, and we must address all of them."
"Consequently, as chairman of the party, I have tabled a proposal to set up a national agenda for the defence of the forest. Our desire is to work with others to ensure that this agenda is implemented rigorously and consistently until such time as we achieve security."
"It is also necessary, however, to look into the European-level implications of the issue and the reasons why Europe must step up its involvement in these activities."
"One of the reasons why the Portuguese forest is so vulnerable is the desertification of the country, the sudden, radical change in the demography of the countryside and the sudden abandonment of farming and traditional practices across large areas."
"In other words, let us not forget that there is another side of the common agricultural policy, which was never designed to address the realities of the Mediterranean."
"Consequently, we must look increasingly towards mobilising European solidarity in the tasks of rebuilding and managing the forests."
"The resolution that we have tabled represents a step in this direction and that is the way forward."
"We must also set up a temporary committee of inquiry in order to raise our awareness of these realities."
"I wish to thank the President of the Commission for the way in which he responded in writing to the letter that I sent to him, in which he offered guarantees that the Commission would not fail to help my country and those worst affected."
"On the other side of the coin, I regret the Council’s absence, which sends out a pitiful message in response to such a large-scale tragedy in Europe."
"– Mr President, natural disasters cause both pain and unhappiness, but they give the European Union the opportunity to show its solidarity and human face."
"They give us the opportunity to demonstrate that we are prepared in difficult times to support each other."
"I congratulate everyone who spoke earlier, especially on the unanimity which they expressed."
"We too are with them."
"We all support both the Portuguese with the fires which have affected them and the central Europeans with their floods."
"However, I would like to make one point."
"Fires and floods have happened in the past and will always continue to happen."
"However, the majority of the scientific community states with certainty that, nowadays, these extreme weather conditions have increased in intensity as a result of ecological disaster, as a result of the climate change which we have brought about."
"Let us take advantage of this opportunity to sound the alarm and increase everyone's awareness of environmental protection issues."
"We know that the European Union sets great store by this issue and quite rightly so."
"Other major industrial powers, such as the United States of America, India and China, also need to understand that, unless we protect this environment, sooner or later it will fall on our heads."
"One other point I would like to make is that blanket tree-planting both before and after fires must take greater account in future of the advice of forestry experts so that we plant more trees which do not burn easily."
"One last point I wish to make – and the previous speaker made the same point – is that, over recent years, over recent decades, our mountain villages have been deserted."
"When people leave our forests, it is like guards leaving the army, it is like guards leaving the borders."
"We need to re-examine our rural policy so that mountain areas are not deserted, so that people stay in mountain villages."
"I have been following this debate closely and with pleasure."
"It is not the subject that is pleasurable, but the attitude demonstrated by the Commissioner and my fellow Members with regard to this grave matter."
"The reason I have been following this debate is not only because the region I represent – for example the village of Mád, an important area for Tokaj wine production – is one of those that suffered severe damage, and because in Romania, a neighbouring country to my homeland, the damage has reached devastating proportions."
"It is because I feel that here, in the European Union, we have to do a bit more than we have done so far."
"As regards the extent of the damage in Romania, let me tell you about the case of a village that was inundated by a two-metre-high wave of water in a twenty-minute cloudburst."
"I do not think this needs any further explanation."
"In such cases immediate rescue operations are required."
"If there were a civil protection force that could be deployed for rescue purposes at a European level, then even eurosceptic citizens of the Union would realise that the work we undertake together is worthwhile."
"Rescue operations are followed by reconstruction, and this requires money."
"We have funds for this purpose, but I agree with the previous speakers who have said that we should probably review the regulations relating to the way these are used."
"It is unacceptable that support should take more than a year to reach the beneficiary, or even that it should take nearly a year, as is now happening in the case of Slovakia."
"Lastly, many speakers have referred to the question of prevention."
"I think that EU resources should be used primarily for this purpose, as this is where they can be most effective."
"I agree with the previous speaker, for example, who gave particular importance to reviewing the situation as regards forestry from this perspective."
"However, this must be decided on the basis of thorough analysis rather than a bright idea from the Members of this House."
"For this reason, I support the proposal of my group to set up an ad hoc committee to deal with this issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I want to express my solidarity with all the victims and to thank particularly the many who gave voluntary help."
"We have had terrible fires in southern Europe, dreadful floods in the USA, in China and, in particular, in the European Alps."
"The Vorarlberg, the Tyrol, Switzerland and many areas in Bavaria were seriously affected."
"The damage in my own homeland, the Tyrol, was massive."
"Let me quote you a few figures: the damage done to the public road network, to the system supplying drinking water, to the building of commercial roads and to communications amounted to hundreds of millions of euros."
"In total, over a thousand houses were damaged, and the destruction of factories and business premises meant that many people lost their livelihoods."
"It is obvious to all of us that we now need to act quickly, and, in particular, to be thorough in examining what caused this."
"Commissioner Dimas has already highlighted a number of measures that have been taken."
"Although they amount to a good start, they must be followed by others, especially in view of the deficiencies in cross-border cooperation."
"The EU’s Solidarity Fund will also play its part, and we should adapt its rules to enable a proper response to major events of this kind, which affect whole regions."
"Priority must, however, be given to thorough analysis."
"Let us not lose sight of the unfortunate fact that these natural disasters have become more devastating over recent years and that they are also occurring with far greater frequency."
"There is no doubt that the greater impact has to do with the more intensive exploitation on our part of confined spaces, particularly in mountainous areas, and also with the settlement of vulnerable areas."
"It follows that we have to give close consideration to what areas are amenable to settlement."
"Likewise, there is no doubt that the greater frequency is closely connected with global warming, but the way to address this is through continual research promoted by European programmes, particularly in exploring the possibilities of prevention."
"What is important, though, is that the results we obtain be given practical expression, and this will mean the Member States and regions taking their obligations seriously if we are to be able to prevent such terrible occurrences in the future."
"Mr President, the disasters that have hit certain EU Member States have been a source of distress to all of us."
"I saw at close quarters the fires in Portugal and Spain while they were still raging, and also the widespread devastation they wreaked."
"Assistance cannot be denied to countries that have been struck by misfortune on such a large scale, and it is for this reason that I am naturally in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"A more general consideration comes to mind in this context, however."
"Europe is being hit by a great many disasters, and their number is increasing."
"Such disasters include fires in southern Europe and floods in central Europe."
"My country, Poland, is also frequently affected by floods, the worst of which occurred eight years ago."
"Other disasters to have hit Europe include hurricanes, as was the case not long ago in Slovakia, and even earthquakes."
"We must be better prepared, firstly to prevent such disasters, and secondly to provide each other with assistance in dealing with their aftermath."
"I believe that a general debate on the functioning of the system for preventing disasters and providing aid in the event of such disasters is needed."
"This debate would also deal with the joint measures we could take to improve this system, and should take place in a calm atmosphere and be unrelated to any specific event."
"I propose that such a debate be held in the not too distant future, or in other words over the next few months."
"The European Commission should also put forward comprehensive proposals to ensure that this debate is not merely held whenever there is a fire, flood or disaster."
"Disasters know no borders."
"We must therefore act together to develop cross-border disaster prevention systems, and provide each other with cross-border assistance to deal with their aftermath."
"We must work in a methodical and organised manner, however."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have witnessed a great many natural disasters in Europe over the past few years."
"As mayor of Hradec Králové, I had first-hand experience of the floods which hit the Czech Republic, and which led to a number of our towns being inundated and many people being left homeless."
"Floods result all too often in the loss of life and property throughout Central Europe, for example in Austria, Germany, Hungary and Romania."
"Southern Europe, on the other hand, suffers from oppressive heat waves and ferocious fires."
"As we heard a short time ago, forest fires are still raging in Spain and Portugal, and I saw for myself the devastation they wreak during a trip to observe this summer’s regional elections in the Algarve region of Portugal."
"We should also not forget the windstorms that left a trail of destruction in the Baltic States and Sweden in January of this year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Union is engaged in discussions on its future, there is no better way for its institutions to win over the hearts and minds of the citizens of its Member States than by placing an emphasis on prevention and on the mobilisation of genuine aid, while also reducing the impact of natural disasters of this kind."
"I vividly remember the positive response of Czech citizens to the practical financial assistance provided by the EU following the floods that hit our country."
"The motion for a resolution due to be debated tomorrow, concerning the release of just under EUR 6 million from the Solidarity Fund to deal with the aftermath of the devastating hurricane that hit Slovakia last November, will also be a practical contribution."
"Back in January, I held in-depth discussions in Brussels with representatives of Slovak local authorities on the possibility of EU aid for the highest-lying regions of Slovakia, having organised the meeting in my capacity as an MEP and as President of the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic, in order to provide the representatives with information on the opportunities available and the way in which the European institutions work."
"At this time, Slovakia also asked the European Union for help in covering the costs of hurricane-related damage."
"Over seven months have now passed since this request was made, and yet the areas affected are still waiting for money."
"We are far from happy at these delays, and Members of this House should not be either."
"We therefore hope that an appropriate decision will be adopted and implemented as soon as possible, hopefully before the first anniversary of the hurricane that raged through the Tatra Mountains."
"We should not shirk our responsibilities, and we should lend our support to practical measures."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to express my support for the victims of the forest fires, which, this summer, set ablaze certain regions in Southern Europe."
"Unfortunately, the problem of forest fires is not a new phenomenon."
"For over 13 years, the issue of preventing these fires and repairing the damage has been the subject of an action framework at Community level, and for years now the tragic consequences of these fires have met with sorrow in this House at the first part-session after the recess; it is high time that action was taken."
"The European Union needs firstly to strengthen cross-border cooperation."
"Very often, the Member States use incompatible equipment."
"There is also an urgent need to propose Community action programmes for civil protection that are worthy of the name."
"More generally, and without substituting for the Member States, the European Union must accord forests the status they deserve both at political and institutional level."
"The Commission’s proposal on forestry strategy, which we are currently examining, seems to me to be slightly half-hearted."
"Forests make up 40% of the surface of the European Union."
"They generate significant economic activity and have environmental and recreational capacities that I will not point out here."
"They deserve better than a minor role between the environment and agriculture."
"For these reasons and in order to be even more effective, we must give serious thought to creating an Agency for Forests, not to mention – it is not a crime to dream – a Directorate General specifically focused on forests."
"Mr President, I too should like to express my solidarity, as a European, with all those areas that have been struck by natural disasters."
"With particular reference to two areas of European policy, namely rural policy and forestry policy, I should like to invite the Commissioner to consider whether we can deploy these policy measures more effectively in those regions that are being hit by drought or other climate-related disasters in the long term."
"I refer primarily to southern Europe, southern Spain, but in particular southern Portugal and its cork oaks."
"The situation there shows that drought – not a man-made disaster therefore but long-term drought – constitutes a real threat, with all the consequences that this entails: drought stress in trees, including cork oak."
"We must see what we can do to offer those governments the opportunity of using either rural policy or forestry policy in order to combat stress diseases in those trees effectively."
"This is done far too little at the moment and I am convinced that if measures are not taken promptly, this will lead to climate change in those regions."
"The same applies to forestry policy, for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and it would be good if in future, this policy could be used more to maintain traditional crops and indigenous tree species."
"They may not always be of great economic value, but they are vital if the nature and climate of the areas involved are to be maintained."
"In those areas, we could do a great deal by deploying rural and forestry policy to tackle those problems."
"Finally, the South is being hit by a drought."
"In my own country, many fruit growers were badly affected by frost damage in February."
"It would be good if you were to make contact with your agricultural counterpart to assess to what extent the funds for rural policy can be used to pay compensation for extreme damage suffered in a specific year."
"In other words, it sometimes pays to be more resourceful with the money you have than to ask for more."
"Mr President, over the last 100 years the temperature of the planet has increased by 0.6ºC and in Europe, in particular, we have had an increase of 0.9ºC."
"That is why several Members – Mr Maat, Mr Prodi, Mr Turmes and others – have mentioned the connection between climate change and the recent phenomena and catastrophes."
"Over the last few months, the tragic catalogue of natural disasters has tested the European Union's civil protection response to the limit."
"Using the Commission's civil protection mechanism, the European Union has dispatched field hospitals, search and rescue teams and forensic experts to help to deal with the aftermath of the Asian tsunami."
"Pumps and medical supplies were sent to the flood-affected areas of Romania and Bulgaria."
"Water bomber aircraft and specialist helicopters were sent to deal with Portugal's forest fires."
"Today, the first consignments of European Union assistance arrived in the United States, following the destruction caused by hurricane Katrina."
"Over this period, it has been demonstrated that the European Union system works, and works well."
"By pooling the civil protection resources of Member States, we were able to provide a common response that is more effective than any Member State can provide on its own."
"A well-coordinated response is always more effective."
"In the natural desire to show solidarity with the victims of natural disasters, many nations spontaneously offer support, but without clear coordination there is a risk that assistance will be duplicated or that what is sent will not meet the real needs of the affected region."
"The Commission's monitoring and information centre provides a real-time service matching resources with requirements."
"In Romania and Bulgaria the crisis had passed by 24 August, when we received the message that no further international assistance was needed."
"Nevertheless, the situation could deteriorate quickly, and the Commission is continuing to monitor the overall flood situation in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Romania was immediately offered assistance by Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Malta, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom – almost all the Member States."
"The assistance took the form of intervention teams, highly specialised material and financial support."
"Assistance in the form of highly-specialised material was immediately offered to Bulgaria by Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Malta, Sweden and Slovakia."
"Portugal was offered assistance by France, two water bomber aircraft by Italy, one water bomber aircraft by Germany, as well as three Puma helicopters and four other helicopters, and Spain offered one water bomber aircraft in addition to bilateral assistance."
"The Netherlands offered two helicopters, Slovakia one."
"Norway also offered assistance, but those offers were not needed, so were not taken up."
"Today, in Portugal, there are only five fires."
"The Dutch helicopters will return tomorrow to the Netherlands and the German helicopters are still operating today but will be going home tomorrow."
"I should like to refer to what Mrs Grossetête said about arson."
"In Portugal, 98% of the fires were caused by humans."
"Twenty percent were caused by arson and the rest by negligence."
"Many people have been arrested."
"In the United States, the European Union's mobilisation is only just beginning."
"Following yesterday's request from the United States Government, the first European Union assistance arrived within 24 hours from Italy and Germany."
"It is important to note that, even though the rules of our civil protection mechanism prevent it from being activated until a formal request is received, Commission experts had contacted their US counterparts last week to explore areas where the European Union could provide the most help."
"We received the request yesterday morning."
"It is too early to have a final picture, but it is clear that thousands of lives may have been lost."
"According to the United Nations, the cost of the damage is likely to be several times that of last December's tsunami."
"Even though the request for help was only received yesterday, a large number of states have already offered assistance, including medical teams, water purification equipment and heavy-duty pumps."
"I am aware that other Member States are in the process of preparing additional offers."
"Some of the assistance is already on site, whereas the rest is still being considered by the United States or is in the process of being dispatched."
"The civil protection mechanism response to this year's natural disasters has provided a clear example of European Union added value."
"It is important that all Member States channel their assistance to the United States through that mechanism in order to avoid overlapping."
"We will use the United Kingdom Presidency as the contact point."
"That has worked very well up until now."
"Mr Pinheiro and others raised the question of whether the mechanism could work more efficiently."
"The mechanism has worked excellently up until now and help from the Member States has been coordinated immediately."
"Of course, there is still room for improvement."
"That is why, in April this year, the Commission made proposals which would effectively create a European civil protection force, more or less along the lines suggested by Mr Prodi and others."
"Having heard the comments today, I am confident that Parliament will support these proposals."
"Finally, on behalf of the whole College of Commissioners, I would like to express solidarity with the continued suffering of the victims of hurricane Katrina."
"We are standing by to provide any assistance that might be needed."
"– The debate on this item is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by Jonas Sjöstedt on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the management of waste from extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC [16075/1/2004 C6-0128/2005 2003/0107(COD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the serious background to the proposed directive on waste from extractive industries."
"It is still only a couple of years since we saw huge accidents involving collapsing tailings dams in Spain and Romania."
"In the case of Romania, the accident meant that important river systems were poisoned with cyanide."
"These accidents show the huge environmental risks that arise from mining waste not being handled correctly, as well as the subsequent international consequences."
"In addition to these major accidents, there has also been a series of minor ones and a kind of continuous poisoning of the environment from improperly handled waste from many years ago, dotted about the countryside and causing, for example, heavy metals to leak out into the water systems."
"At present, the European Union has no effective rules for dealing with these environmental problems."
"The regulations governing waste have not been adapted to cover this type of waste."
"With the proposed directive, something can be done about this."
"The cyanide method that was used in Romania would be banned under the proposed directive."
"We would make tough demands on the safety and supporting capacity of tailings dams."
"We would require mining companies to be serious in their approach, to return the countryside to the way it was and to be able, in economic terms too, to guarantee that the countryside is restored to its former state following mining."
"Many of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading have been included by the Council of Ministers in the common position, and that is of course excellent."
"Other important proposals have, however, been rejected."
"It is therefore important for us to adopt those amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety whereby we are now trying to put back what was adopted at first reading."
"I want to give a few examples of such changes."
"We do not just want an inventory to be drawn up of old mining waste. We also want something to be done about the situation, and this, in Parliament’s proposal, involves obligations."
"We also believe that the environmental problems that arise in excavation voids following extraction of minerals should be covered by the directive."
"In the Council’s common position, large groups of waste are exempted from essential parts of the directive, for example the financial guarantee."
"If this is to be prevented, we must adopt Amendment 13."
"It is important to remember that waste that is not dangerous in the chemical sense can also cause very serious environmental problems."
"That also applies to inert waste."
"We also propose that there should be greater stringency where exemptions are concerned."
"It should not be possible to grant long-term exemptions whereby waste can be put to one side."
"Instead, proper waste-processing facilities should be built."
"Such long-term exemptions now form part of the Council’s position."
"These are some examples of amendments through which we in Parliament want to see a significantly more far-reaching, effective and progressive directive than is the case with the Council’s common position."
"Voting against these amendments would be tantamount to lowering our environmental ambitions."
"A stringent and constructive directive in this area will not only be of benefit to the environment but will also favour the best, most modern and most environmentally aware mining companies that are also most serious in their approach."
"It will bring about speedier improvement in the industry."
"Commendably, it will also penalise those which do not accept their environmental responsibility."
"It will favour environmental technology and research."
"It may also make the EU a world leader in the area of environmental technology where mining is concerned, which would be another positive factor and might mean our being able to help other regions of the world."
"With the proposals put forward in my report by Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have an opportunity to prevent serious accidents, similar to those in Spain and Romania, from happening in the future."
"We can ensure that we do not have to see more such accidents."
"We have the opportunity to reduce the amount of poisons released into our water systems."
"We also have the opportunity consistently to do something about damage wrought upon the environment in the past and to obtain better water status."
"Let us take advantage of these opportunities."
"Last but not least, I wish to thank my fellow MEPs for their constructive cooperation."
"A number of fellow MEPs from a variety of political groups have put forward amendments that have improved this report."
"I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, and I want to thank the Commission for its very constructive cooperation so far."
". Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, more importantly, its rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, for their painstaking preparation of this recommendation for second reading."
"With the consequences of the serious accidents caused by mining waste in Aznalcollar in Spain in 1998 and in Baia Mare in Romania in 2000 still fresh, the aim of the proposal for a Commission directive was to introduce rules at European Union level in a bid to minimise the repercussions which storing waste in tailings dams or heaps has on the environment and on human health, both under normal operating conditions and in the event of an accident."
"In conjunction with the revised Sevezo II Directive on the control of major industrial accidents and a document on best available practices, the proposed directive will safeguard the proper management of waste from extractive industries throughout the European Union."
"At first reading, the Commission accepted in full, in part or in principle 46 of the 74 amendments tabled by the European Parliament, in that they clarified and improved the text, while remaining consistent with the format and approach of the original Commission proposal."
"Forty-one amendments have now been incorporated into the common position either verbatim or materially."
"The Council discussed the proposal during the Irish and Dutch Presidencies; it soon became apparent that a significant majority of the Member States considered that the scope of the Commission proposal was excessively ambitious and implied spending which they felt was out of proportion with the probable risks."
"The Commission considers that many of the changes adopted in the common position improve its initial proposal."
"Most importantly, the provisions relating to inert waste have been extended, licensing procedures have been detailed, references to Community standards have been increased, especially to the standards adopted in the framework directive on water, demands for the long-term stability of waste facilities have been reinforced, stricter limit values have been set for cyanide compounds and an inventory of closed, abandoned sites has now been demanded."
"At the same time, the Council, which is interested in the principle of proportionality, has granted the Member States the facility to exempt non-hazardous, non-inert waste from certain provisions of the directive, especially from the need for a financial guarantee."
"The Commission would prefer the wording of its initial proposal, which did not allow such exemptions. However, the Commission has decided to support the common position, taking account of the fact:"
"first, that no general exemption from the basic provisions of the directive is allowed and the competent authorities in the Member States will decide on a case-by-case basis and,"
"secondly, that no exemption is allowed from the main environmental safeguarding clauses in the directive relating to the safe design, operation, closure and after-closure of waste facilities."
"However, I would like to point out that the Commission is willing to examine in a positive spirit any other possibility for compromise which may arise."
"I trust that we shall complete the procedure for this proposal as quickly as possible."
"We need the new directive, which will safeguard the environmentally correct management of mining waste both during the day-to-day operation of waste facilities and in the event of a major accident."
". Mr President, Commissioner, in this Common Position, many of the amendments adopted by this House at first reading have been taken on board."
"Improvements include the definition of waste, which has been made clearer, and a more precise description of the financial securities and the inventory of closed sites, along with the rules applicable to them."
"I can also go along wholeheartedly with what Mr Sjöstedt has just said; good work has been done, with a good cooperative approach, but there is one point, and a crucial one, on which we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats take a different view, and that is where the differential weighting of waste is concerned."
"We have to take account of the fact that mining waste has a different potential risk, and, as the Common Position does just that, it is right that the Member States should be able to distinguish between hazardous and non-hazardous waste and reduce – or annul – the conditions placed upon non-hazardous, non-inert waste other than that very precisely defined as hazardous and included in Category A. There is a wide spectrum of mining waste, extending from such harmless materials as playsand, salt and topsoil at one end to the toxic cyanide derived from ore mining at the other."
"We cannot apply one single measure to everything."
"Particularly where non-hazardous, non-inert waste is involved, the imposition of excessive burdens on small and medium-sized businesses in the quarrying and earth-moving sector is indefensible."
"As you, Commissioner, pointed out, a quarry, or a sand or gravel pit cannot be regarded in the same light as a landfill for hazardous waste; all they are doing is meeting the demand for building materials."
"I ask that the amendment to Article 3 be adopted."
"It is intended to extend the scope of this directive to the burning of chalk."
"People are willing to buy and use the waste products resulting from this, of which chalk dust is one; they are not hazardous and the Landfill Directive is not meant to apply to them. This would avoid unnecessary costs associated with landfill."
"In all that we do, we must not lose sight of our objective, which is to keep people and the environment safe with the minimum of red tape and expense."
"This is intended to achieve that end."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall now, for once, use my three minutes to say something basic."
"I do not propose to go into the vast number of points of detail that many in the House find incomprehensible but which those of us who are involved in this debate understand as a matter of course;"
"I am sure that there will be other Members who will want to discuss them."
"This directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries is a piece of legislation that does not exactly evoke much interest on the part of most of the European public – at any rate, not from those who live in my own country – but that has done nothing to save us from energetic lobbying on the part of interested parties – on the one hand, the unions, the industry and its associations and, on the other, the various environmental and consumer groups."
"Our drafting of a resolution has been made no easier by the fact that none of them want the same thing all the time – sometimes, indeed, the precise opposite."
"All the same, I do believe that the Environmental Committee has presented the plenary with a balanced piece of legislation on which to vote, particularly as this Directive is supplementary in character."
"The Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill Directive largely exclude the extractive industries, the types of waste produced by which do not in fact fit the regulations exactly, in that many of them present no problems in terms of the environment."
"Legal certainty, though, is a necessity – not only for people and their environment, but also for trading enterprises and for businesses engaged in the extraction of such raw materials as oil, coal, metals, clay, gravel or sand."
"There are two things that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament always bear in mind: first, the protection of people and the environment, with a sustainable way of doing business, and secondly our enterprises’ need for a proper framework and conditions if they are to be able to do business and create jobs for the people whom we – as I said in my first point – want to protect from harm."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, has been perceptive and rigorous in taking both these principles into account in this proposal for a resolution, and for that, many thanks to him."
". – Mr President, I welcome the Commission's initiative requiring the best practice of some Member States to be applied to all."
"It is certainly the case that an impressive number of Parliament's amendments have already been adopted and I think congratulations are due to the rapporteur."
"I am sorry that the Council has introduced a number of loopholes."
"I rather prefer the Commission's more ambitious proposals."
"Well, let us see how the votes go."
"But even if some of the more controversial amendments before us are accepted, I think that the Council and industry should understand that Parliament's representation on the Conciliation Committee will be positive and pragmatic."
"It is not in any of our interests to require steps to be taken that would hinder the efficient and economic operation of this industry."
"We must accommodate some of the concerns expressed, for example the need for a proper transitional period to ensure that problems with mines closing prematurely in order to avoid the obligations of this directive are circumvented."
"But the Council should understand that Parliament must insist that reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the natural environment is properly protected from commercial interests otherwise tempted to think only of short-term gain."
"As the rapporteur and the Commissioner have pointed out, the sins that have been committed in the past need to be avoided in the future."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also fully supports the report by Mr Sjöstedt and congratulates him on his work."
"It is true that at a time when political Europe is searching for its identity, Europeans are, for their part, demanding that health protection and the preservation of the environment remain a priority for the European Union."
"This draft directive is directed to this end and it will also provide legal clarification."
"This directive is justified by the amount of waste created by mineral extractions, which we know produce each year nearly a third of the waste generated in the Union, some of which is toxic, indeed very toxic."
"As it is inadequately treated and stored, it can seriously threaten the environment and people’s safety."
"We all recall the consequences of the Baia Mare and Baia Borsa disasters."
"This directive must also ensure that the new accession countries have the means to eradicate pollution from waste produced by extractions in the past."
"Furthermore, the industrialists concerned own operations throughout the world, and in order to prevent further disasters, the European Union must set an example by implementing operating rules guaranteeing the safety of workers and better protection of the environment."
"If you will allow me, I would like to offer three examples: the first concerns the operation of the uranium mines in Niger by European businesses."
"I have some knowledge of this – they are French businesses."
"The issue of contaminated waste has been raised time and again, during the Irish Presidency, for example, but even now questions remain unanswered."
"The second example concerns the very controversial project of the opening of a gold mine at Rosia Montana, in Romania, a project that provides for the construction of a tailings pond for waste of highly toxic extraction, with a dam – brace yourselves – measuring 30 metres high."
"Finally, the last example calls to mind the destruction of the coral reef in New Caledonia, for which we were responsible, by extractive waste from the nickel mines."
"This last example, Commissioner, illustrates the need to prohibit direct discharges into continental, coastal or marine waters, unless, of course, they are compatible with the Water and Waste directives."
"For all of these reasons, we support the work carried out by our rapporteur and we hope that you will support these amendments."
"Mr President, although mining is less widespread in Ireland now than it once was, some mining companies have left a legacy that continues to pollute our land and water due to a lack of proper checks."
"A case in point is the situation in Tynagh Mines in Co. Galway in the West of Ireland, which, since its closure in 1981, has continued to be an environmental hazard."
"Throughout the European Union, hundreds of millions of tons of waste are generated by mining and many sites left in a condition which poses grave dangers."
"It is important, therefore, to deal not only with waste generated following such a directive but also to deal with historical waste arising from facilities that have been abandoned or which were not shut down properly."
"We should also reverse the Council's lifelong exemption from some of the key provisions for certain existing facilities."
"The rapporteur's proposals, as one of my colleagues has already said, are balanced; they should be welcomed by responsible companies within the mining industry, as well as by people whose lives and livelihoods have been damaged by irresponsible mining operations."
"I commend this excellent report by Mr Sjöstedt and thank him for his work."
". Mr President, I welcome this report and encourage the rapporteur to keep fighting for as strong a directive as possible."
"In Ireland, as in many other places, we cannot begin to deal with the problem of deteriorating human health or clean up our environment without tackling the problem of old mines and the waste that was left behind when the mines were closed and the mining companies dissolved."
"In Silvermines, County Tipperary, a 147-acre, 40-foot high plateau of fine red toxic tailing pond blights the area and in dry weather the dust blows across several counties."
"Mud lagoons dissolve the mercury, arsenic, cadmium, antimony and many other toxic minerals, and channel them via neighbouring streams straight into the Shannon River, only metres away from where the water supply for Limerick City is taken."
"Animals and, most importantly, people in the area suffer from an incredible range – a tragic range – of diseases, the kind that demonstrate an environmental attack on the immune system."
"That is a sin from the past; the company concerned has gone and the mess needs to be cleaned up."
"A further problem is that one of the biggest industries in the west of Ireland is a company that ships mining waste into Ireland."
"It is on an island and has its own docks."
"It brings in bauxite to make alumina."
"It claims that it is safe and it creates big red mud tailings ponds."
"That industry wants to expand this year, next year and the year after."
"The rate of animal death in the area was so alarming that it sparked an investigation a number of years ago, which documented unprecedented animal deaths."
"It was not uncommon for farmers – and these are not large farms – to have lost 150 animals per farm in the area around the industry."
"Also very startling was the amount of human death from cancer and the amount of learning disability among children."
"We need very strong …"
"Mr President, ‘one size fits all’ is one of the curses of EU legislation and, if the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety gets its way, we will have under this directive another classic illustration of it in action."
"Although not all extractive industries have the same environmental and safety impact, if the Committee on the Environment succeeds, then this legislation will make them all needlessly subject to the same restraint."
"Legislation to fit the need is one thing, legislation not tailored to need is invariably oppressive and destructive of competitiveness."
"So it is here, with the rapporteur trying to require all sites – regardless of size, product and complexity – to comply with all articles."
"There is no sound reason why the shallow sand quarry should be subjected to the same legislative demands as the large, deep mine producing hazardous waste."
"The requirements for non-hazardous or inert waste should remain proportional and not, as proposed by the committee, be largely subjected to the same stringency as Category A hazardous-waste sites. The framework directive on waste and the landfill directive make adequate provision for non-hazardous waste quarries."
"There is no convincing or compelling reason for these further burdens to be placed on this important sector of our economic production."
"I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for continuing in the second reading to fight for strict regulation that takes human and environmental assets and interests into account."
"We desperately need this directive, which covers mining waste containing cyanide and heavy metals, and other waste that presents a risk to the environment, for example due to its physical volume."
"Let us recall the disaster, dubbed simply by some the ‘cyanide-tsunami’, that took place in the Romanian town of Baia Mare (Nagybánya) in 2000, or the contamination incident in Spain in 1998."
"In both of these cases, large volumes of dangerous substances spilled into rivers, causing enormous damage to the natural environment, even in neighbouring countries."
"The legislation now before us has some very good qualities."
"It tightens licensing procedures and places greater emphasis on prevention; it makes it compulsory for operators to draw up a detailed waste management plan and makes information on mining waste more accessible; its extends the areas to which financial guarantees relating to such operations will apply, and obliges mining companies to ensure complete rehabilitation and monitoring of areas where they have ceased operations."
"As far as I am concerned, however, the most important and most forward-looking aspect – in view of the impending accession of Romania and Bulgaria, and the large-scale mining projects currently in preparation or under way that present a risk to the environment and to neighbouring countries – is that the new directive must also be taken into account by newly acceding Member States from the date it enters into force."
"For this very reason, I call upon my fellow Members to vote in favour of these rigorous amendments aimed at achieving environmental protecting objectives, and in doing so to take a major step towards safeguarding our environment and preventing disasters."
"Mr President, five years ago there was an appalling incident of cyanide pollution on the River Tisza caused by a gold mine in Baia Mare, Romania."
"Before this incident, the term ‘environmental policy’ had been nothing more than a strange phrase for many ordinary people living on the two banks of the river – for peasants, shepherds and fishermen."
"After 30 January 2000, they understood the meaning of ‘environmental policy’: to prevent pollution of this kind, in which 100 000 m3 of hazardous sludge leaked into the River Tisza, destroying its flora and fauna."
"I do not like to speak in terms of money when we are talking about the value of nature, but the Centre for Environmental Studies estimated that the loss of revenue suffered by commercial fishing and tourism was around EUR 18 million in Hungary alone, not including the loss of natural heritage or environmental damage."
"That is why I welcome this report."
"Mr Sjöstedt did an excellent job: as well as writing a good report, he went to Baia Mare, Romania, where he visited the site of the pollution."
"He met the people living, working and suffering there, and his local experiences are integrated into the report."
"This legislation should be strict and well integrated into other Community policies."
"I have tabled three amendments which were supported by the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I hope they will also be supported by this plenary session."
"My aims were to clarify the requirements of the directive by giving references to the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive, to prevent the discharge of environmentally harmful mining waste into any body of water and, last but not least, to promote waste prevention as the primary means of waste management."
"I hope this legislation will give us a 100% guarantee against any kinds of mines producing cyanide or other pollutants, either in Member States or in applicant countries."
"The directive is aimed above all at mines that will begin to close in the future or at those abandoned mines that have been closed down without the proper and appropriate procedures."
"I would like to draw your attention to a specific problem that is highly important for a number of countries."
"This is the issue of mines that have already been closed down and have therefore stopped taking mining waste, while rehabilitation work is being carried out in line with valid European permits."
"Because of the length of time needed to close mines down, this rehabilitation will still be in progress when this directive enters into force."
"In order to avoid the duplication of procedures and an increase in the costs of rehabilitation as a result of the possible requirement for new permits, it would be sensible to make special provisions regarding these cases for a transitionary period under conditions of transparency."
"This was done in the third paragraph of Article 24 of the joint position of the Council."
"The aim of the directive, that from the moment of its entry into force no further damage should occur in the process of closing down mines, would not be in jeopardy if in mines where the rehabilitation process is almost complete, that process could be completed without hindrance."
"I support this part of the joint position."
"Mr President, it is true that the aim of the directive on the management of waste from extractive industries is to prevent and minimise any harmful impact of waste on the environment or public health."
"The aspects of the directive relating to environmental protection require further work, however."
"In places the directive is also irrational, and it will create more red tape."
"Historically, the extractive industry in Poland has been a mainstay of the national economy, and this continues to be the case today."
"It was for this reason that, during pre-accession negotiations, Poland pressed for the relaxation of certain provisions making it mandatory for operators of waste treatment facilities to provide financial guarantees."
"Even highly hazardous industrial sectors do not comply with such requirements."
"After the draft directive had been submitted to Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted amendments that ran counter to earlier decisions made regarding the draft."
"These amendments are extremely disadvantageous to the Polish extractive industry, since the additional burdens they entail will result in it becoming uncompetitive, as well as posing a risk of bankruptcy for the brown coal industry."
"This would present a threat to energy security in Poland."
"The draft directive transfers too broad a range of responsibilities to industrial entities."
"Furthermore, it places hazardous waste on the same footing as inert waste."
"The end result of all this will be a sharp increase in operating cost, and the need to allocate huge sums of money from state budgets to cover the costs of drawing up inventories of facilities and adaptations to the latter."
"It is for this reason that some indication of funding sources is urgently needed."
"Mr President, the proper management of waste from the extractive industries has a significant impact on the environment."
"This is especially true in areas of high mining activity, where it is not uncommon for various raw materials to have been mined for several hundred years."
"In many cases the raw materials in question were exploited wastefully, with both deposits and the environment being destroyed, and little regard being paid to the management of waste."
"The draft directive under debate, and above all the numerous amendments that have been tabled, fail to do justice to the current state of affairs."
"They deal with the issue in an arbitrary fashion, and take no account of the situation in regions where deposits are mined most intensively."
"The proposed inventories of existing waste and waste generated during routine operations will only serve to identify waste management requirements and the related technical possibilities."
"In view of the limits placed on the EU budget, it is unrealistic to expect large amounts of EU funding to be earmarked for implementation of the directive."
"By and large, it will be regional and national budgets that bear the burden of implementing the directive by rectifying the shortcomings that have already been identified."
"The current owners of facilities will also incur greater costs through no fault of their own, and more money will need to be spent on guarantees and suchlike."
"This will mean bankruptcy for facilities that are suffering financial problems, and their waste will then be left unmanaged."
"I propose that certain amendments should not be incorporated into the draft directive."
"These include amendments that point out the obvious, those that set unrealistic deadlines, those that give rise to unjustified increases in costs, of which there are several, and those that limit the opportunities available to Member States to adapt the given requirements to regional and national needs."
"Mr President, this draft directive, a sensible and necessary one, was welcomed as such by the business community as a whole."
"We should establish proportionate and loophole-free rules to apply fairly and uniformly across the whole of European business and industry."
"We also have an acceptable compromise report before us."
"Our aim has been to prevent accidents and the consequent damage to the environment and human health that can result from the handling and disposal of waste materials from the mineral oil-extracting industries, and we have sought to do this by laying down minimum standards to improve the management of this sort of waste."
"Waste from the extractive industries amounts to some 400 million tonnes per annum, equivalent to 29% of the waste produced by the Community as a whole."
"Managing it does of course involve risks; we are all familiar with the accidents in such places as Baia Mare and Aberfan, among others."
"The fact is that ecologically-responsible rules for waste management not only reduce the quantity of waste, but also give businesses an incentive to invest in research into environmental issues associated with the extractive industries and thereby acquire from the world market know-how that they can analyse."
"There are many examples of this: let me give you one from Austria, where one firm has managed to avoid depositing some 100 000 tonnes of minerals used in construction in landfill sites."
"Despite that, there are weak points, one example being the lack of clarity as to the directive’s scope."
"I find it regrettable that a majority could not be found to support the amendment I tabled on this subject."
"I would also like to point out the need for provisions to be enacted to deal with non-hazardous or inert waste, and that these must be proportionate."
"I therefore believe that Amendments 11, 13 and 47 should be rejected and that we should come up with alternative proposals for provisions relating to non-hazardous and inert waste, with separate consideration for these concepts."
"The use of landfill sites for non-hazardous or inert waste should also be allowed for a limited period of time."
"Mr President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening."
"I am extremely concerned about this issue, because once again Europe is trying to bring in and implement a draft regulation that tries to make one suit fit all."
"I do not think this can work and that is where I have a problem."
"We should not be so dictatorial with our directives."
"As someone has already pointed out in this debate, not all quarries that are extractive industries are the same."
"I have no doubt that some of the very large industries will be able to cope with this and take it in their stride, but the small entrepreneurs trying to develop small industries and get them off the ground are probably going to be hit very hard."
"I have no objection when we are talking about hazardous waste, because that always has to be controlled."
"But it will be the smaller businesses where jobs will be lost; they are the ones that will go to the wall."
"Nor do I believe we should bring in directives that are not implemented in the same way in each Member State."
"I have personal experience of this."
"I come from Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and across the border, in the Republic of Ireland, the waste oil directive is interpreted differently."
"In quarries six miles apart, one in Dundalk and the other in Newry, a European directive is being implemented differently in two Member States."
"Waste oil is considered hazardous in the United Kingdom, whereas in the Republic of Ireland it is not."
"This is forcing quarry owners to move from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland in order to compete, because otherwise they cannot."
"I do not believe that we should be producing European directives that can be interpreted in different ways."
"I believe that will happen with this one as well, and quarry owners are not happy about that."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their very constructive observations and to give a number of answers relating to waste from processing bauxite, which was referred to earlier, in order to make alumina: this waste is covered by the directive, which will ensure that repercussions, especially on water, are minimised."
"As regards Mr Nicholson's last remark, which differs from what previous speakers said, about old abandoned waste facilities, the Commission and the Council agree in the common position that an inventory should be prepared."
"Nonetheless, it is better for restoration to be left to the Member States, given that the framework directive on water continues to apply in parallel."
"In addition, as far as the facility to grant exemptions for non-inert waste is concerned, this does not concern the main environmental demands, which continue to apply."
"We need the new directive, which will safeguard environmentally proper management of mining waste both during the day-to-day operation of waste facilities and in the event of a major accident."
"I trust that we shall complete the procedure for this proposal as quickly as possible, so that we can safeguard better protection of human health and the environment, as Mr Davies also said, in a way which really will be pragmatic and will respond to the demands of the various interested parties."
"Now to the amendments: the amendments relating to the scope of the directive are particularly important."
"Amendments 2 and 13 delete the permissible exemptions for non-hazardous, non-inert waste."
"The Commission is unable to accept them for the reasons I explained in my first intervention."
"For the same reasons, the Commission is unable to accept Amendment 11 increasing the breadth of the provisions which apply to inert waste, or Amendment 15 deleting the various permissible time periods before a waste storage area qualifies as a 'waste facility'."
"The common position has already been worded to reflect the relevant amendments which emerged at first reading and safeguards the necessary proportionality."
"As a result, Amendment 47 amending the criteria for classifying facilities under category Α cannot be supported."
"As regards the financial guarantees, Amendment 37 requiring the Commission to approve the relevant national procedures is unacceptable, because it adds bureaucratic formalities without any added value."
"Amendments 7, 38 and 39 are also unacceptable, because the initial text contains a practical method for calculating the amount of money required."
"A number of amendments refer specifically to the protection of water."
"The Commission considers that this issue is already adequately covered by the relevant provisions of the directive supplementing the general provisions of the framework directive on water and by other Community legislation on water which already applies."
"Nonetheless, I am able to support Amendments 29, 30, 32 and 33 clarifying the obligations which apply and referring directly to Community legislation on water."
"On the other hand, we are unable to agree with Amendment 36 bringing ordinary voids under Community regulations in order to prevent water pollution."
"I understand Parliament's concern, but I believe that this issue is adequately covered by the framework directive on water."
"Similarly, Amendment 42 introduces obligations which will need to be applied during the transitional period granted to existing waste facilities, especially the obligation to comply with the framework directive on water."
"I believe, for the reasons I explained earlier, that this is unnecessary."
"Another source of concern to Parliament was the important legacy from the past in the form of closed and abandoned waste facilities causing pollution."
"Even though the need for an inventory of these closed sites has now been included in the common position, I have the impression – as I said earlier – that the additional demands imposed by Amendment 40 and the related Amendment 41 can be covered more effectively at national level."
"A number of the remaining amendments proposed by Parliament are acceptable: Amendment 10 may help to promote the integration of the environment into other policies."
"Amendments 17, 18 and 21 explain the content of waste management plans in greater detail."
"Amendment 27 expressly refers to protected areas."
"The Commission supports these amendments, which pursue the same objectives as its proposal."
"To close, I am happy to announce that the Commission can accept eight amendments in full and a further six amendments in principle or in part."
"I shall file a complete list of the Commission's positions on the amendments with the Secretariat(1)."
"That concludes the debate on this item."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, at 12 noon."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments in full: 14, 17, 18, 21, 29, 30, 32 and 33."
"The following amendments are acceptable in part or in principle: 4, 10, 12, 23, 27 and 39."
"The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 31, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 or 50."
"The next item is a statement by the Commission on dialogue with churches and non-denominational organisations."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to read out the draft declaration on the dialogue between the Commission and the communities of faith and conviction."
"In Declaration 11 annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, it is stated that ‘the European Union respects and does not prejudice the status under national law of churches and religious associations or communities in the Member States.’"
"It also states the importance of respect for the status of philosophical and non-confessional organisations."
"Continuing a tradition of informal exchanges – a long-established tradition – the Commission is conducting, on that basis, a dialogue with all of the Churches, religious communities and philosophical, non-confessional, secular and humanist organisations that wish to take part."
"This dialogue, which mainly consists of exchanging information and points of view, meets with everyone’s satisfaction."
"The Commission believes that such dialogue comes under its normal relations with all members of civil society in the Member States."
"It notes that the draft Constitution includes provisions giving a more specific outline of the links between the European Union, the Churches and the other religious or philosophical organisations."
"As these provisions are not in force, however, the Commission intends to pursue an established practice, which will be developed in parallel with efforts to develop its entire links with civil society."
"The Commission stresses the fact that this dialogue, which concerns religions, the Churches, the communities of conviction and civil society, is conducted in such a way as to respect the principle of equal treatment of all speakers."
"Within the Commission, that means the organisation of meetings with designated speakers, which are held regularly and are open to everyone."
"With regard, more specifically, to the concerns expressed in recent questions by certain Members who were anxious to know why such and such a humanist organisation had not been invited to such and such a meeting with the President of the Commission - meetings that were organised prior to the regular meetings - the Commission should like to make it clear that invitations to such meetings depend upon the specific nature of the subject-matter covered."
"The principle of equal treatment does not mean that all of the speakers should systematically take part in all of the meetings."
"In actual fact, the Commission and its President are free to develop certain discussions with particular speakers to as great an extent as is necessary."
"Therefore, Madam President, the President of the Commission held specific meetings with religious organisations in spring and he of course intends to organise a specific meeting in autumn with humanist organisations."
". I welcome the clear response of the Commissioner on behalf of the Commission."
"I am particularly pleased that the European Commission sees Declaration 11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam as an incentive to dialogue with churches and non-confessional organisations and is not restricted merely to a narrow legal view of the declaration."
"I believe, of course, that in this House there is no need to explain that dialogue is something different from the process of joint decision-making."
"I am also pleased with Article 52 of the as yet unratified European Constitution, which explicitly talks about a dialogue that the Union would maintain openly, transparently and as a matter of course."
"In the work of the Convention I have also called for an open, inclusive and public dialogue in the belief that such a dialogue is both necessary and important because it also entails a closer relationship with citizens with religious or other convictions as they reflect on a common European future."
"In any event I would like this dialogue to contribute to a responsible and unfettered development of new ties and new proposals relating to our future, and to be far removed from the seductive ideological intolerance that we have witnessed on numerous occasions in European history and from which even today we are clearly not entirely immune."
"In the spirit of the declaration and the as yet unratified Constitutional Treaty I expect the Commission to proceed according to transparent rules of the game and transparent procedures, and that it will continue to take a broad approach in the understanding of inclusiveness for participants in the dialogue."
"I am aware that the fact that there are so many old and new religious and non-confessional organisations makes it difficult for the Commission to make a choice, and such a choice may be impossible without some consideration given to the number of followers of each organisation."
"It also seems to me reasonable that, in view of the theme of the discussion, the Commission should be flexible in its choice of participants in the dialogue."
"I would like to add that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have long been aware of the importance of a dialogue of this nature and have therefore organised such dialogues for a number of years."
"We also believe that with new challenges at a European and global level this dialogue is becoming even more important."
"I am thinking in particular of a dialogue with Islam, which is particularly alert to the religious dimension of those with whom it is in dialogue."
". – Madam President, I have to say that I am very disappointed at the Commission's statement."
"It is undemocratic to confine Union dialogue to a select number of faith organisations and to exclude secularist organisations, as this new Commission has done up to now."
"We need a guarantee from the Commission that the dialogue it is engaging in will be balanced and transparent."
"I note that the Commission has not indicated what subjects it discussed with the religious organisations it spoke to in the spring, nor has it told us what it intends to discuss with humanist organisations in the autumn."
"We need a guarantee from the Commission that this secrecy and backdoor dealing with powerful organisations will cease."
"Agendas and minutes should be published."
"We cannot accept secret dialogues with powerful religious organisations, some of which do not countenance internal democratic processes or grant equality to all their adherents."
"This is a critical period in Europe's history."
"It is a time of confusion worldwide, with unrepresentative groups using terror in the name of religion for political ends."
"Dialogue is therefore most important, but it must be transparent dialogue."
"We must know what the Commission is talking about and to whom it is speaking."
"It also needs to be made clear that Europe's democracy is founded on the principle that this Union and the parliaments and executives in every Member State are independent of all religious dogmas."
"That independence is the best defence for European democracy and indeed for members of all religious persuasions."
"It is a principle that has taken centuries to establish and it must not be conceded if we are to avoid a dangerous regression in Europe."
". – Madam President, I welcome the Commissioner’s statement."
"Liberals and Democrats opposed a reference to a Christian heritage in the preamble to the Constitution because the Union also has a Jewish, a Muslim and a secular heritage."
"We do not oppose Article 52, which imposes an obligation on the State to maintain a dialogue with faith groups."
"Cavour’s famous dictum ‘a free church in a free state’ should be the basis for relations between the two."
"Yet it is not only across the Atlantic that a regression can be seen: proposed concordats with the Holy See in some Member States show that the division between church and state in Europe needs reinforcing."
"Relations between Church and State should be based on mutual respect."
"One of the problems of the secular state is that respect has sometimes given way to indifference towards faith groups and occasionally even to scorn."
"Belief is an integral part of the human condition."
"For many citizens, religious faith is a part of self-development, and government at EU- and national level must value and respect individual faith and its expression through faith communities."
". – Madam President, the Commission has provided us here with the very barest of outlines, when we could have had much greater detail of what was being said."
"I also echo the remarks made by other speakers concerning the separation of Church and State and wish that it applied to my own Member State."
"A number of us have been raising questions because we are concerned, for example, when money is involved and given to particular religious organisations for their events, without it being at all clear what the criteria for that decision were and whether they will apply to other organisations, faith-based or not."
"Questions also arise about how organisations signal to the Commission their interest in participating in such dialogues and just what the criteria set by the Commission are for the involvement of particular organisations."
"We have to avoid the ghettoising of certain faiths around certain issues, but ensure that we have a very inclusive dialogue across a range of questions."
"Many of us would also be interested in knowing who decides the agenda for this consultation."
"There are many difficult political agendas around: for example, on how we achieve the Millennium Goals and gender equality."
"It would therefore be useful to know how the agendas are determined and who gets invited on what basis."
"I would echo what my colleague Mr De Rossa has said about the need for a public record in order to allay worries."
". Madam President, three matters of principle are being overlooked in this debate."
"First of all, churches are public-law establishments and are not the same as private associations."
"That is why church services are public and accessible to everyone."
"The relationship between state and church has played a major role in the history of western constitutional law."
"What is all-important is that good public administration is inseparable from sound public morals."
"Procedures alone are not enough."
"Anyone who rejects this basic notion strikes at the roots of our democratic societies."
"Secondly, when inviting bodies to participate in this dialogue, the Commission would do well to draw a distinction between religion and ideology."
"Religion is transcendent in nature, while ideology is immanent."
"It is a God-less religion, a quasi-religion that is motivated and dominated by human desires."
"Ideology does not allow people any freedom and leads to all kinds of slavery."
"I would warn the Commission and the Liberal and Socialist Members of this House against lumping these two very different notions together, as history shows that this results in social disaster."
"Finally, the law that applies in this case is the Amsterdam Treaty, declaration No 11, which the Commissioner quoted just a moment ago."
"It may have slipped your minds, but since the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the Constitutional Treaty really is old hat."
"Madam President, Marx once said that religion is the opium of the people."
"One hundred and fifty years have passed since then, and there is no longer any point to such idiotic statements."
"Churches of all denominations, including the Catholic Church, are a part of Europe."
"They are not only part of European history, but also part of life in Europe today, since it is churches that shape the citizens of our countries."
"Communities and nations are the first to benefit from dialogue, or even cooperation, between churches."
"I can provide many positive examples from my own country, Poland, of action taken by the Catholic Church and other churches."
"There are four places of worship close to my home in the town of Wrocław, namely a Catholic church, an Orthodox church, a Protestant church and a Jewish synagogue."
"All of these different faiths coexist alongside each other in our town and cooperate with the Wrocław authorities, which is a fine example of good cooperation."
"In recent days the churches in America, and particularly in New Orleans, have demonstrated that they are capable of more than the incompetent state administration."
"Madam President, first of all I wish to point out that organised religions have only been around for some 2 000 years, and we are in danger of elevating them to a position that they should not have."
"Of course there should be a dialogue, but it should be on the same the basis as for any other non-governmental organisation."
"We have to ensure absolutely the separation of religion and politics."
"Religions have achieved a great deal on behalf of citizens but, equally, they have opposed advances."
"In my own country, the rights of women, lesbians and gay men have been opposed every single step of the way by organised religion."
"There was a mention of slavery by the previous speaker."
"Indeed, when we were trying to end slavery in the United States, the religions there tried to prevent its abolition."
"Therefore, we should have that dialogue: a dialogue where we tell them what we – the institutions – intend to do, where we listen to their arguments as to why we should modulate or change, but we must have the courage to act in advance of public opinion and in advance of those sectors within religions that would prevent any progress."
"When these meetings take place, the minutes, recommendations and list of attendees must be available for public dissemination."
"If they are not, I would point Members to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, which assures public access to documents held, received or produced by the institutions and the agencies set up by them."
"Madam President, I am afraid that Mr Barrot's statement has not reassured me at all."
"Yes, freedom of religion is a fundamental right in the European Union, but separation of Church and State is one of the basic principles underpinning our modern society."
"In your country, Mr Barrot, the principle of is one of the cornerstones of the Republic."
"I would also remind you that this principle is strongly emphasised in the debate on Islam currently taking place in most Member States."
"We should not apply double standards, but apply the same standards to ourselves."
"Religious and non-denominational organisations are an important voice in society and it is therefore fitting that the EU should have a dialogue with these organisations."
"However, such a dialogue should fulfil the regular criteria of transparency that apply to all activities of the EU institutions."
"Frankly, closed meetings with organisations hand-picked by President Barroso are neither transparent nor balanced."
"The dialogue with churches must be transparent, as has been pointed out by several colleagues."
"The agenda and the minutes should be published on the internet."
"The meetings should take place in public, there should be an established list of participants and that list should be balanced with regard to the participating organisations."
"The dialogue should be organised on an equal footing with the dialogue with the rest of civil society, and I would prefer it to be an integral part of that dialogue."
"Can the European Commission guarantee that it will uphold these principles?"
"If it cannot, can it tell us what its criteria are for this dialogue and can it give them to us in writing?"
"Finally, in reply to a Parliamentary question, President Barroso had agreed to organise the dialogue in the spirit of the EU Constitution, even if it is not in force yet."
"Despite his pledge, and in contrast to his predecessor Mr Prodi, he has called a number of meetings excluding the humanists – you made reference to it yourself Mr Barrot, and you do not seem to think it is a problem; well, I think it is."
"He has been reported to have had several meetings with representatives of the Catholic Church and, notably, the Vatican, thus granting a preferred status to one particular religion."
"I am afraid that your explanation is not satisfactory."
"Madam President, I am shocked by the thoughtlessness with which the Commission has conducted its dialogue with the Churches and the non-confessional associations."
"Firstly, it is true that the Commission says that it regularly forgot to invite the European Humanist Federation to this dialogue, but it took the liberty of inviting in its place the Church of Scientology, which is listed as a sect in various European countries."
"On the basis of which criteria was this dialogue established?"
"Are sects accepted from now on?"
"What subjects are debated?"
"I call for complete transparency in this matter."
"Beyond the issue of dialogue, furthermore, there is now the issue of funding."
"Allow me to return to the World Youth Days."
"On that issue, I cannot believe my eyes."
"This is truly John Paul II’s last miracle."
"That is how a ‘no’ vote from Parliament on the funding of the World Youth Days was transformed into a ‘yes’, following a questionable legal ruse by the Commission."
"That beats the wedding feast at Cana."
"Yet who are they trying to kid?"
"First I am told: ‘Do not worry, the Pope will pay for his own travel’."
"Then, even more reassuringly: ‘Europe does not pay for the consecrated bread, but only for the milk of those taking part’."
"That is how we have become the cash cow of the Vatican."
"Yet on a more serious note, Madam President, I would point out to the Commission, with the full respect that I have for the young people who arrived in Cologne in search of spirituality and hope, that religion does not have a monopoly on this debate."
"Secularism is asking itself exactly the same questions: they are the questions of our civilisation."
"That is why I propose that the 2006 budget include funding for meetings held on the theme of ‘Secularism and humanism within a network of European towns’."
"Madam President, Commissioner, exactly 100 years ago, the President of the French Council, President Emile Combe, declared in front of the Assembly: after having occupied the Church, the Vatican now wants to occupy the States."
"One hundred years ago!"
"Nowadays, the State, the Vatican City, is the religious, in fact the state, ‘organisation’ that you favour in your dialogues."
"Well, it is precisely this State, through its last two representatives, the current one and his predecessor, which does not cease to insult democratic parliaments and democracy itself, by maintaining that those who legislate, like civil society is currently doing in defence of the fundamental rights of life, those people, you, us, are the heirs of Nazism."
"The silence with which you welcome these speakers is shameful."
"I say this in all frankness: if that is Europe, well then, it is still the Europe of the Vatican and not the Europe of those who believe in freedom and religion."
". Madam President, I have listened carefully to the various speeches."
"I should like first of all to briefly point out that a has been published on the Commission web site to give details about this meeting held in spring."
"I should also like to make it clear that, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on access to documents, the Commission can answer any questions concerning the attendance list."
"That is an initial practical remark."
"You are right, the dialogue must be transparent and everything must genuinely be clear for all those people who could be asking themselves questions."
"Parliament greatly emphasises the need for dialogue, provided, of course, that such dialogue is balanced and transparent."
"I believe that I am able to say that such is the intention of the President of the Commission."
"There is no reason for this dialogue to be weighted in favour of any one community."
"I can confirm to you that a specific meeting with non-confessional representatives from civil society, and, in particular, representatives from the humanist movement, will take place in autumn."
"There is therefore a desire for balance."
"Personally speaking, I am totally convinced, not so much by certain remarks made by Mr Combes, but rather by a politician, many of whose works I have read and who I have held in high regard, Aristide Briand, who in fact brought us a law of separation of Church and State, a law that, in my opinion, he caused to command great respect when he had it adopted."
"I believe that, in today’s civil society, it is necessary for governments, both at national and European level, to be in touch with a civil society where faiths, which are undoubtedly different but which respect one other, are expressed."
"That also enables me to state that the phenomenon of sects must of course be fought against with a great deal of determination."
"That is what I wished to say very simply, in the hope that this dialogue might be developed and with respect shown towards all of the conditions that you consider legitimate."
"Madam President, what the Commissioner has said in relation to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is incorrect, and I speak as the rapporteur on that regulation."
"Not only can the list of attendance be requested, but also minutes, agendas, decisions taken and any other material accumulated or discussed."
"Any documents that are requested can be refused only under Article 4 – exceptions – and Article 9 – sensitive documents."
"I should like to reassure the House that it is not only the list of attendance that can be accessed by Parliament and members of the public."
". I support what has just been said."
"For the Commission, it is not a question of playing hide-and-seek in this matter."
"Any dialogue, which by definition is an exchange, must be made public for those who wish it to be."
"That altogether adheres to the spirit of our European institutions."
"That concludes the debate on this item."
"The next item is a statement by the Commission on air safety."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, during August, six major accidents cast a gloomy shadow over commercial air transport throughout the world."
"Every one of them affected European passengers."
"Faced with these tragic events, I, on behalf of the entire Commission, would like to offer my condolences to the victims’ families and to assure them of our profound sympathy."
"The Commission reacted immediately to the accidents by stepping up its contacts with the civil aviation authorities of the Member States concerned in order to gather together all relevant information."
"The Commission dispatched a group of experts to Cyprus in order to assess, at the scene, the air transport situation and to identify the specific needs and difficulties."
"The Commission contributed towards having an action programme adopted by the managing directors of European civil aviation, who met in Romania on 27 August."
"Over and above these reactions, however, we must continue to act resolutely in increasing air safety, in order to enhance passenger confidence and, furthermore, to confront the rapid growth in air traffic."
"Community measures are vital."
"In actual fact, the main objective of an initial proposal in the transport sphere was to increase air safety."
"As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission will strictly monitor whether all the Member States correctly implement existing Community law."
"In this context, it will instruct the European Aviation Safety Agency to carry out inspections of the competent national authorities."
"It is imperative that these authorities perform all of the required checks and dedicate the necessary resources to them."
"I would now like to lay emphasis on pursuing and strengthening legislative initiatives."
"We must improve transparency for the benefit of passengers and to do that we must draw up a Community black list that will need to include all carriers that have been grounded."
"Such a measure will enable us to inform the public but also to avoid different approaches from one Member State to another."
"In actual fact, banning measures must be enforced throughout the entire EU territory and must be taken on the basis of a common set of criteria."
"In order to achieve this, the Commission must be able to promptly extend the banning measures taken at national level to the entire EU territory: citizens from across the whole of the EU must have the same guarantees."
"The proposal for a Regulation on the identity of air carriers, which was submitted to the European Parliament in February, offers the possibility of promptly implementing such a measure, and at this point I should like to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac, the rapporteur for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, who took the initiative to complete the text proposed by the Commission and on which the Council of Ministers issued an agreement in principle."
"Thanks to the work of your Committee on Transport and Tourism – I take advantage of this moment to also thank its chairman, Mr Costa – we will be able to have a far more comprehensive system at our disposal."
"The second aspect concerns the mechanisms for monitoring third country aircraft, which must be strengthened immediately."
"Ramp inspections must be more comprehensive and better targeted."
"To achieve that, the Commission will very shortly submit proposals aimed at transferring to the European Aviation Safety Agency the management of the safety assessment of foreign aircraft - I am referring to the SAFA programme - and at implementing an early warning system between the Member States, the EASA and the Commission."
"Thirdly, the Community must have at its disposal a coherent and uniform set of rules covering all safety-related issues, and, in order to prepare and implement those rules, the role of our European Aviation Safety Agency must be consolidated."
"In this context, I am going to propose a new regulation from autumn extending the remit of the Agency to encompass third country air operations, pilots’ licences and aircraft."
"This extension will allow the European Aviation Safety Agency to intervene effectively in order to ensure that both European and third country carriers are monitored."
"Finally, for my fourth point, Madam President, I would like to stress that moves to strengthen the European aviation safety system must be accompanied by actions relating to third countries and to the ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"The safety standards in force outside the European Union must be raised."
"The European Union is prepared to continue providing its technical assistance to developing countries and to play a major role within the ICAO."
"Only this morning, I received a government minister from Latin America, to whom I explained that we were at the disposal of the States concerned to assist them in strengthening technical cooperation in this area."
"I also hope – I say this before Parliament – that the European Union can occupy a place as such within the ICAO, precisely in order to play an even more decisive role in increasing safety levels."
"To summarise, ladies and gentlemen, I can state that, even before the serious accidents that took place this summer, the European Union, through this draft Regulation on passenger information, had already anticipated the need to offer passengers the opportunity of knowing the identity of air carriers."
"I hope that the entire text, which has been enhanced by the work of your committee, can promptly be adopted by Parliament and can receive the approval of the Member States."
"In this way, we can actually have a black list by the end of the year, based on a set of criteria harmonised among all of the Member States."
"We will thus negotiate a decisive stage in improving the safety of air transport."
". The tragic events of this summer and what has again taken place this morning give us – as you said, Commissioner – a real responsibility to promptly adopt new measures in order to improve the safety of air passengers and the information offered to them."
"Contrary to what the recent accidents would suggest, air safety has not declined over the years and aeroplanes remain by far the safest form of transport in the world; let us be realistic, a zero level of risk does not exist."
"The high increase in air traffic could lead to a rise in the number of aviation accidents and in the number of deaths, with some experts even predicting that by 2020 there will be on average one accident per week."
"That is unacceptable."
"Prompt and effective action must be taken, and it is the duty of Parliament and the European Union to protect the safety of Europeans as far as possible."
"That is why we, like the United States is doing, must put right the existing shortcomings and make provision for a European system which, alongside the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), would do more to increase air safety."
"Within the draft report that I presented on Tuesday before the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I requested, in particular, that a black list based on a set of objective safety criteria be drawn up, which would be valid throughout the entire EU territory."
"The most satisfactory solution for the user is to publish one single Community black list, which is updated by the Member States but which concerns the entire airspace of the EU without singling out the Member State behind each measure."
"To ensure that this list of banned air carriers is enforced throughout the entire EU territory – you have spoken about this, Commissioner – the criteria on the basis of which the list will be drafted must be drawn up at Community level."
"These common criteria based on objective safety considerations would be laid down by the Commission, assisted by a group of experts from the Member States."
"Every carrier included in the black list will be grounded throughout the entire EU territory, as it is unthinkable that a carrier could be declared deficient and allowed to transport passengers."
"The same level of safety must be guaranteed to Europeans, no matter which Community airport they depart from."
"The proposed system would enable us to strengthen coordination among the civil aviation authorities of the Member States, while leaving it to those authorities to take the initiative regarding safety measures."
"The other strand of this report lays down the obligation to inform passengers about the identity of the actual air carrier and creates rights for them in certain specific cases."
"It is desirable, furthermore, to promptly entrust the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) with a key role in checking that the international and Community aviation safety standards are observed, by making it responsible for issuing safety certificates for third country carriers."
"That is why the European Commission must propose an extension of the Agency’s powers and I am pleased to have heard Mr Barrot announce that this proposal would be presented in the autumn."
"The EASA should also have the opportunity to monitor the various national civil aviation authorities, to carry out audits and even to manage a European database that would gather together the details of all of the checks carried out by the Member States on aircraft."
"To conclude, I am delighted that it has been possible for the vote in plenary on this report, initially scheduled for January, to be brought forward to November which, in the event of the report being, as I hope, approved at first reading, will enable the regulation to be adopted at the Transport Council of 5 December, that is to say before the end of the year."
". Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs De Veyrac, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the European Union may have achieved a number of things in the field of air safety, but it has certainly not yet achieved enough."
"In just the one month, August, we had the spectacle of five air accidents, and no sooner has September begun than something similar has come to pass."
"What this again highlights is not only the sad topicality of the debate around the Commission’s proposal for a regulation on information for airline passengers, but also the urgent need for rules to enhance safety in the air transport sector."
"In the interests of greater security, the rapporteur, in her report on the proposal for a regulation, went much further than the Commission proposal, and so let me extend my especial congratulations to her on it."
"I welcome in particular the demand for a single shared list based on shared and harmonised objective criteria, as well as the associated demand for a flight ban to be imposed on the airlines on it."
"Many of those airlines that do not abide by European safety standards are less interested in flying than in making money; they must be listed, publicly shamed, and punished."
"It is only right that I should, at this point, mention and welcome the latest initiative by France and Belgium, whereby lists are to be published of airlines banned from flying in both French and Belgian airspace."
"It has to be said, though, that this again shows us how important it is that the criteria and the list be harmonised; for example, no airline appears on both the French and Belgian lists."
"As it is a fact that members of the European public do not travel only within the EU, I see the option of including worldwide airlines on this list as indispensable, or else the information will not really be relevant to them."
"Passengers also need to be informed as to who is in charge of the flight, and they need better and easier access to information about safety deficiencies."
"It goes without saying that there should always only be one person to whom the passengers can address their concerns or with responsibility for dealing with them."
"As, however, any regulation without consequences would be an ineffective one, passengers must be in a position to draw their own conclusions."
"It would be logical for them to be entitled to cancel their booking and receive not only the price of their ticket but also compensation, but there must also be the possibility of going beyond flight bans and imposing sanctions on the airlines in the form, for example, of administrative penalties if they fail to comply with the obligation to provide information."
"I am glad that we can expect the Commission’s support for this, and that everyone in this House acknowledges that it is imperative that this regulation be transposed as soon as possible."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall only add a couple of points to what Mrs De Veyrac has said."
"She gave a brilliant presentation of her report in committee, and I hope we shall adopt it as soon as possible."
"Before this August, we were probably all satisfied with the air safety situation throughout the world and with the EU’s evident ability to be in the forefront in this area. That is due to the fact that its rules are stricter than those imposed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) internationally; the fact that standardisation and aircraft control issues are now entrusted entirely to the European Aviation Safety Agency; and the prospect that we shall also be dealing with air freight organisations and crews in the fairly near future."
"The air accidents in August 2005, however, require us to act with greater urgency and greater ambition."
"It is a pressing need to which we must not fail to respond, since the number of victims is constantly rising: the serious accident that has happened today in Indonesia means that this tragic August is not yet over."
"In view of all that, I believe that we have to recognise that the area of air safety is, amongst others, an absolute priority."
"It is a goal that has to be pursued without too much concern for national competences – which are now meaningless – and we must leave behind the rather slow progress that has been made so far in defining objectives and procedures, which equally does not make sense."
"We are in a situation in which air traffic is growing rapidly and people respond with whatever is available, using any kind of aircraft, but the dangers are becoming increasingly evident."
"There is much to do and we have to act fast."
"If, in this debate on its future, there is one area of European Union competence that quite clearly lies at Community level, I would say that it is safety."
"We have to take this road, so that even the Member States understand that the sooner they transfer their powers to the European Union in this field, the better it will be for everybody and the more effectively action can be taken."
"Right now, what can we do?"
"We can implement the Commission’s specific proposal to inform passengers of the details of the aircraft actually being used, by providing them with additional information."
"Ultimately, if with this report we succeed in guaranteeing that everybody has the same control criteria, the same safety standards, and the same blacklist of non-compliers applying throughout the EU, with objective, transparent criteria for adding and removing names from the list, then we shall have transformed something that was originally a means of helping consumers into a real instrument for taking action in the field of safety."
"We are aware that it is not enough: at the same time, the Commission must set out the overall strategy that it intends to pursue."
"I am convinced that Parliament – and the Council too, I hope – will agree to follow it so that as soon as possible we can ensure that we meet the expectations of Europe’s citizens."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the aftermath of the dreadful air crashes of which we have been unwilling spectators particularly over the past month, reports of, among other things, the checks carried out, the relative lack of them or their being carried out by untrained staff, have given us a view of a yawning abyss."
"The result of this has been major misgivings on the part of the passengers and the European public as regards the quality of airlines."
"Lamentably, some of this lack of trust is justified; it must now be banished, and for that, consistent, clear and rapid action will be needed."
"As Commissioner Barrot has already said, the checks will be inspected and we will devise common criteria for blacklists."
"I am very glad of that and regard it as quite fundamental."
"Even today, though, I already hear voices from the Member States saying that some of them will not be ready to accept common European criteria, their argument being that these will, as usual, be weaker than their own and thus, perhaps, encourage more propaganda against the European Union and its policies."
"We have to have clear, stringent and comprehensible criteria to prevent that happening."
"They are among the fundamental requirements."
"We have to achieve the highest safety standards possible; that is something we owe to the passengers who rely on us, as, indeed they should be able to do."
"That third countries should participate in this is something I regard as self-evident."
"I also know how difficult that can be, not only for reasons of immediate safety, but also because of the need to prevent what has, unfortunately, happened to some degree in maritime transport happening in aviation, where airlines must not be allowed to operate under flags of convenience."
"It follows that, for the sake of credibility, every effort must be made to get airlines from third countries involved."
"Things have got to the point where consumers cannot find their way through the market."
"We must make it transparent by means of shared and clear lists."
"We also have to equip consumers with information, with consequences and with the right of cancellation, for only then will airlines take the necessary action immediately and without delay."
"As we see it, the credibility of the EU is at stake."
"The protection of airspace and of flight passengers must be given absolute priority."
". – What a tragic irony, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that we are debating air safety today, when just yesterday there was another tragic accident in Indonesia which cost the lives of at least 140 people."
"I should like to take this incident and the accident which claimed so many lives in Greece on 14 August, involving an aircraft operated by a private company in which 121 of our fellow human beings lost their lives prematurely, as my starting point for pondering on the image of the air transport sector recently."
"There have been six international accidents which have cost the lives of approximately 625 people since the beginning of 2005."
"In the last month alone, 500 people lost their lives in four accidents."
"Nonetheless, a few years ago, the former Commissioner for transport maintained that the air transport sector required stabilisation and proposed that the number of national carriers in the Union should be reduced."
"Unfortunately, this is where the biggest problem lies in this sector."
"The persistent will of the European Commission to liberalise the sector has resulted in deregulation and unbridled competition, all at the expense of citizens' safety."
"The new environment being created, with the uncontrolled entry into the market of private capital and the plummeting level of services provided, have caused a drop in safety standards, which cost companies money."
"What we need to do, therefore, and what comes within our jurisdiction, is to amend the air transport directive and the relevant regulations, so that there are no repercussions on safety issues in the companies' fight for profits."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, I was there half an hour after the aeroplane crashed in Grammatiko."
"I arrived there very quickly as a journalist and as a private individual."
"It was a sickening sight."
"You cannot begin to imagine what we saw."
"Children cut to pieces, burned, families wiped out; one family lost five people."
"I shall convey your condolences; but are your condolences enough?"
"Will the families, some of whom are close friends, tell me what the European Union did to prevent the accident?"
"What controls you carry out?"
"Why did you not do what you say you are going to do now about black lists last year or the year before or six months ago?"
"Did we need to mourn 121 people at the heart of Europe in order to realise?"
"Do you not know that there are 'Mickey Mouse' airlines in Europe?"
"Do you not know the conditions under which charter flights operate?"
"Do you not know that Turkey violates Athens FIR with fighter planes and that you are in constant danger when you fly down there?"
"Do you not know all that?"
"All this, and yet you are closing down national airlines."
"People trust in Al Italia, in Lufthansa, in the big companies."
"Now you are closing down Olympic Airways because, apparently, the Greek state is financing it and there is no competition with these 'Mickey Mouse' companies."
"We have got a thousand islands, many of which have airports."
"Who will fly there in winter?"
"What planes will fly there?"
"You are not going to finance the planes that fly down there to people cut off from the capital."
"We finance them and it is precisely because we help Olympic Airways that you are closing down the company and directing us to companies with a brief to kill even more people."
"This is the philosophy which prevails in the European Union."
"We want answers here."
"We want safe flights at long last."
"You said that you sent experts."
"Did you send a flight safety expert?"
"No one visited the scene of the accident."
"You said they went to Cyprus."
"No one came and those who did, your people under your supervision, told us they hardly know a thing about Pipers or Cessnas."
"So who are the specialists?"
"Let us tell the truth in here."
"We are here to protect the citizens of Europe from harm, not to come along afterwards for memorials."
"That is a crime against the people."
"– Madam President, I take the floor as a Member of the European Parliament representing Cyprus, which was hit by the recent aviation tragedy."
"Public opinion in Cyprus has been damaged and is trying to come to terms with the fact that 121 lives were lost, including those of many children, and entire families were wiped out."
"The demand being made by public opinion in Cyprus and, I believe, in the whole of Europe, is that investigations into the exact causes of accidents should not be restricted."
"Responsibility must be sought and ascribed where it belongs under conditions of full transparency and without time-consuming delays."
"Commissioner, I urge the European Commission not to hesitate in pointing out shortcomings, defects and criminal negligence and not to hesitate in issuing the instructions needed to correct all poorly edited texts."
"I welcome your presence today, which illustrates your sensitivity, and I welcome the measures you have announced."
"In the European Union, we can move towards stricter specifications and enhanced control and prevention roles; at the same time, without being against the liberalisation of the skies, we believe that, because of this liberalisation, additional controls are needed by national civil aviation authorities and additional controls by your Commission of the Member States' national civil aviation authorities."
"Madam President, it would be true to say that August 2005 was a black month for civil aviation, and it is a good thing that we are again giving our attention to air safety."
"The Member who has not been following the debate has to be told that – as the Commissioner said – Europe is not reinventing the wheel."
"It has to be said that the Commission presented us with the regulation under discussion even before the accidents."
"It is evident, though, that it is only the one speech that interests him; the matter in hand is of secondary importance."
"We have to work towards guaranteeing the citizens of the EU, and the air passengers among them in particular, safety in every conceivable respect."
"To put it the other way round, that means that there is no room in European airspace for airlines that do not take safety seriously."
"That is why it is important that we should, while addressing this regulation on airlines with the utmost seriousness, pass it into law as quickly as possible."
"The rapporteur has explained it. The proposals are excellent, and, if we combine our efforts, we really can get it over and done with very quickly – at first reading, indeed."
"We have established the European Aviation Safety Agency, which is meant to guarantee a high standard of safety, but must also be given authority over aircraft from third countries."
"We will of course need a list of the black sheep, a blacklist – and not 25 lists, but one single list with standard criteria."
"I already have one for it."
"Last week, a pilot with the company FlyAir took a defective aircraft back to Paris-Orly airport, but, instead of giving him credit for this, the airline gave him the sack."
"That means that we already have one candidate for the blacklist, and I hope that the Commission will do something about this."
"To the Commissioner, I would say that he and his fellow-Commissioners should, in their deliberations, also consider the idea that, not least from the point of view of safety, the bargain airlines might perhaps be tackled a little harder than they have been in the past."
"Apart from that, we are side by side on what is very much the right road."
"Madam President, Commissioner, where this European list, and these European criteria, which will enable you to act promptly when something goes wrong, are concerned, you can count on our support."
"Let us consider, though, the rules we do have: the directive on the safety of third-country aircraft using Community airports (SAFA) is only one year old and is yet to enter into force."
"The agency is only three years old."
"The proposals you are tabling now should have been dealt with at the time when the Commission incorporated a huge number of the items, many of which were rejected, often by the Member States."
"You will therefore not meet with any resistance from us if you ask for a wider role to be given not only to the agency, but also to the European Union, in the person of the Commission."
"It is at the moment politically incorrect to say that Member States should allow their national policies to be coordinated and controlled by the Commission and the European Aviation Agency, but it is in the public interest that we should continue to do so."
"I think that Parliament will accept this view, but I hope that this time round, the Member States too will be somewhat more accommodating."
"I hope that the Council will approve Mrs De Veyrac’s proposals by the end of this year so that we need not wait another seven years, as was the case with the SAFA directive, which was submitted in 1997 and was not approved until 2004."
"This time round, such a thing would simply be unacceptable."
"We must, as a matter of urgency, have this black list and all criteria in place by the end of this year."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, safety is an integral part of the right to mobility that we are called upon to guarantee."
"That is why we have always spoken out against the free-market policies that in recent years have increasingly reduced transport to being a mere product."
"The effects of those policies on safety and on the right to mobility itself must be made perfectly clear and, in our opinion, they should be seen as detrimental and a cause for concern."
"Changing direction means placing rights, and not just profits, at the heart of the strategy."
"What we need are rules, controls and investment."
"The role of transport sector workers is fundamental in this, and it may prove decisive in ensuring that adequate standards are met."
"Good trade union relations are essential, not only to ensure respect for workers’ rights but also to safeguard all our citizens."
"In this context, I must report a serious situation to this House: the discrimination that the largest trade union representing flight attendants is experiencing in Italy, as the board of Alitalia is denying its right to take part in negotiations."
"This is even more serious since it involves a company like Alitalia, which for us has a strategic importance that we want to promote."
"There is a basic rule that needs to be stated: only ‘good’ work will produce ‘good’, safe transport."
"Events have overwhelmed legislators."
"The citizens of Europe rightly expect us to respond swiftly and flexibly to recent events."
"For this reason, I support the proposal of a Community-level list drawing European citizens’ attention to airlines that fail to meet safety requirements."
"I support the proposal that a Community-level list should be drawn up on the basis of common criteria."
"I urge that this legislation be fast-tracked and drafted as soon as possible."
"Many reasons have already been cited, and I would like to add yet another one."
"A variety of unofficial lists have appeared recently, in the pages of a major French daily newspaper, for example, and on the Internet."
"This could have consequences that are difficult to predict; it undermines passenger confidence, is liable to misinterpretation and it misinforms."
"It has happened that the names of a number of audited national air traffic control bodies and airlines that guarantee proper safety standards have also been included in the list published by the newspaper."
"This is unacceptable."
"I therefore urge that the legislation should enter into force immediately after its adoption, and that proposals should be put forward for the transitional period as regards any lists countries intend to publish officially at national level."
"I welcome the Commission’s initiative to extend the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency and the fact that it wants to speed up the legislation process."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was a pleasure to listen to your proposals on setting up a European blacklist and I fully agree with them, just as I agree with everything that is being debated in the Committee on Transport and Tourism concerning Mrs De Veyrac’s proposal."
"I believe it is essential to set standards for control, and we must act firmly on this point."
"I should like to add, however, Commissioner, without just restating what other Members have already said, that I hope that all this really will be included in a programme with greater strategic scope, so that Europe may play a leading role on the world stage in the area of air safety as well."
"If we analyse the frequency of accidents in the various regions of the world, it emerges that – not by chance – North America, Europe, Japan and Australia have the best records, although there is still much to be done, while Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean have the worst."
"The problem is certainly one of carriers, but it is also above all a problem of air bases, since a carrier’s performance depends on the attitude of its management – the relevant aviation authorities – with regard to safety."
"In other words, a carrier from the Persian Gulf or Asia that operates in a relatively rich catchment area will devote greater resources to the safety of its airline."
"In view of this situation, I believe that Europe should put itself in a position to protect its own airlines from increasingly cut-throat competition, by focusing its competitive edge on raising safety levels and not lowering them."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the decision was taken to lift restrictions on air transport, very many of us predicted what, unfortunately, is happening today: the decline in safety and the appearance of high-risk carriers, a kind of equivalent to the system of flags of convenience in the maritime transport sector."
"In any case, rules need to be laid down urgently, and, unfortunately, it is not the first time that our Parliament has insisted on this."
"Yet, the Member States have often turned a deaf ear."
"I would insist on four requirements."
"The first: rules banning high-risk aircraft and carriers, and even the introduction of prior authorisations to be able to take off from, and land on, EU territory."
"The second requirement: the strengthening of checks in terms of number and quality."
"The third: the obligation to provide users with information and transparency."
"Finally, the fourth requirement, which I hope can be included by the Commission, is to improve the level of protection offered to employees who oppose the hazardous operations of their carrier and who should also have the right to withhold their labour."
"It has taken a large number of tragedies for the Member States to publish black lists."
"I believe that everyone here is in agreement in saying that the black lists must be European, and that each time a Member State decides to ban an air carrier, the other Member States must be able to automatically enforce the same ban."
"I believe that we must go further, however, by calling for a genuine principle of authorisation enabling the European Union, with the European Aviation Safety Agency in particular, to establish whether or not the carrier and the aircraft used comply with our safety rules."
"I emphasise this point because a large number of circumventions can occur through a change in name and statutes, even when black lists are drawn up."
"As for the rest, I would emphasise the need to mobilise the Member States, as it has often been Parliament and the Commission that, together, have tried to improve the situation."
"May the unacceptable and dreadful tragedies that we have witnessed serve as a lesson to those in power in our various countries."
"Madam President, I would like firstly to express our sincerest condolences and sympathy to the families and friends of the victims, and I would like in particular to mention the young Eva María Gonzalo Torrellas, who died in the accident in Peru on 23 August, a young woman from Tarazona, in my region, who worked in London and who chose to go to Peru for a holiday."
"I would also like to express my horror at the accidents that have taken place this year, which have wiped out the excellent results of 2003 and 2004 at a stroke, and which, while it remains the case that the air sector is one of the safest sectors, have brought back to the fore the urgent need to resolve significant questions about how to impose legal frameworks, controls and limits on globalisation, so that it does not become a process of increasing insecurity and fear, of half-truths and trade and flag wars within a context of a serious lack of transparency."
"It is therefore urgent that we are able to safeguard a development that many of our citizens have enjoyed: the popularisation and democratisation of the possibility of travelling long distances in order to visit one’s loved ones, to work, to get to know different places and cultures, to enrich our lives."
"It is therefore essential that we work quickly and well and, to this end, I am pleased and hopeful about the improvements being proposed to the Regulation on passenger information."
"Furthermore, we would also like to reiterate that we are in favour of establishing common criteria for producing a European black list with the greatest possible transparency and publicity and which furthermore is uniform and serves to supplement the proposed improvements in the OACI."
"It was very successful in the case of the in a different field of action, and also in relation to the improvements in the OACI; that is therefore what we propose, and we hope that the Commission will also achieve this in the case of air safety."
"There are, however, certain important question marks."
"When we have established the rules, we must apply them, and this raises important questions in the social field: what will happen about crew training, which has been shown to be essential in terms of preventing casualties in an accident such as that which took place in Toronto?"
"What about the confidence and guarantees that must be given to pilots, the greatest experts in safety, who are often penalised by their companies?"
"What about the technical reviews and inspections that are often not even carried out in our Member States, but rather in third countries, even in the case of important national airlines?"
"It is therefore essential to clarify all of this, so that our work may serve as a tribute to the victims, and so that this type of accident does not happen again."
"– Madam President, we still do not know the exact cause of the recent tragic aeroplane crashes in recent months."
"However, they do not appear to have been caused by the sort of terrorist action or attack which we have been focusing all our attention on preventing here over recent months."
"On the contrary, it would appear that they were caused by a fatal combination of human error and mechanical fault."
"I therefore call on the European Commission to immediately extend its independent investigation to an examination of all airlines in Europe, to include two additional aspects:"
"First, the very serious matter of the intensification of the working hours of both flying and ground airline staff over recent years, which certainly affects flight safety."
"Secondly, the ratio between flying time and maintenance time for aircraft which has come about in each airline over recent years again, I suspect, at the expense of safety."
"Commissioner, people are more important than profits."
"If, unfortunately, Europe has a tendency to forget this in numerous sectors in Europe for the sake of unbridled competition, it is time it was reminded of it, at least where human lives are at stake."
"We must not wait for tragedies to happen in order to act; we must act before they happen."
"Madam President, allow me first of all to express my delight at the quality of this debate and at the way in which Parliament has joined together, which will help us to progress more swiftly along the road to improving air safety."
"We had, moreover, already thought ahead, since it was in February that I proposed to the Commission that it adopt this draft Regulation on passengers’ rights, which included the obligation for the Member States to provide any information they had on suspicious carriers."
"As of April, this starting point was followed by an agreement in principle from the Member States."
"Yet, this summer has demonstrated the need to go beyond what the Member States had agreed to."
"I myself had approached the Member States with a view to laying down a common set of criteria and I had still not been able to convince them completely."
"I would like to thank your Committee on Transport and Tourism, and Mrs De Veyrac in particular, for its excellent work."
"We can now hope to benefit from control standards, to ensure that a ban in one Member State extends to the entire European Union, and even, at Commission level, to add a defective carrier to the black list, if necessary."
"Mrs De Veyrac has also mentioned the overall set of data which, at European level, will be far more significant and will enable far more effective action to be taken."
"The Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Costa, whom I also thank, has insisted that the Commission be willing to provide an explanation of its overall strategy."
"I am at the disposal of his committee with a view to listing all of the parts of this strategy: third country aircraft, the regulation that you are going to adopt, the SAFA Directive that must be transposed into national law before April 2006, and, finally, the new draft Regulation that I will present to the Commission at the end of September with a view to entrusting the European Aviation Safety Agency with additional powers."
"This strategy must be outlined as clearly as possible, and I will endeavour to ensure that this happens."
"In actual fact, it is by means of an overall strategy that we will obtain the required outcomes and that we will put pressure I state this clearly on all of the carriers in order that they themselves also genuinely agree to subscribe to this increased safety effort."
"Mr Piecyk, in particular, has stressed the fact that we had discussed the easing of restrictions."
"Let us not forget, however, that the effect of an increase in competition was a certain decrease in tariffs, which opened up air travel to young people and to people on tighter budgets."
"Air travel became more democratic as a result of competition."
"Yet, of course, there can only be competition in this area if it is subject to extremely stringent and clear regulation."
"I thank Parliament for offering us assistance to ensure that this regulation takes effect and is a great deal more specific."
"Mr Sterckx also talked about third countries."
"Why have we taken so long?"
"The Member States, in fact, had very often clung on to their national powers and had difficulty in accepting a certain transfer of powers to Community level."
"Today, the lesson has been learnt, and Parliament and the Commission must henceforth be able to convince, or finish convincing, the Member States that European powers are crucial, not in order to take away national powers, but to check that those national powers are exercised, with the necessary means and the required determination."
"That is how we will succeed in establishing a European air safety space."
"Some of you have also raised the issue of employees."
"The new proposal for a regulation that I am going to present will also include provisions enabling the European Aviation Safety Agency to deal with equipment, pilots, pilot training and flight plans, in such a way as to be able, as it were, to give the crew members both the training and the authority they need to set flight plans and to prevent people from making demands of them that are scarcely, or not at all, compatible with safety."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is the plan that we must now carry out promptly, as many people have stressed, because we can no longer show Europeans evidence of a lack of determination in this area, a state of affairs that would be reprehensible."
"I sincerely thank all of the Members of Parliament who were willing to take part in this debate and I already see it as the sign of a quality item of legislation that should be swiftly adopted in order for us to become operational by the end of the year."
"That concludes the debate on this item."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0212/2005) by Mrs Etelka Barsi-Pataky on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the European programme of satellite radionavigation (COM(2004)0477 – C6-0087/0156(COD))."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 14 July 2004, the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on the implementation of the deployment and commercial operating phases of the European programme of satellite radionavigation."
"You are going to debate this proposal in a few moments."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for having supported the Galileo programme from the very start."
"I would particularly like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for her excellent report and for also having supported, with a great deal of intelligence, the Galileo programme."
"We want to set up, at European level, the first worldwide satellite radionavigation system specifically for civilian purposes, a project that ties in with the European Union’s growth strategy as defined by the Lisbon European Council in 2000."
"It truly is the first great European industrial and space project."
"This is a technology that is developing and being applied at a tremendous rate."
"The capacity developed as part of this programme also means that the European Union will now be first in line to benefit from what is shaping up to be the great technological revolution, following the IT and telecommunications revolutions."
"The development phase of the programme is running smoothly."
"The first experimental satellite is expected to be launched in December 2005."
"This will be followed by the construction and launch of the first four satellites in the Galileo constellation."
"The current development phase will be followed by the deployment phase, and then by the commercial operating phase."
"The system will be brought into operation progressively between 2008 and 2010."
"The institutional framework retained for the deployment and commercial operating phases differs significantly from that of the development phase."
"During those two phases, the construction and then the management of the system will be entrusted to a private concession holder working under the control of the Supervisory Authority, a Community agency created by the Council regulation of 12 July 2004 to act as the licensing authority."
"The choice of a concession contract emerged as the most appropriate way to ensure the success of the programme in the framework of a Public Private Partnership."
"The proposal submitted to you aims to provide financing for the Community contribution to the Galileo programme during the deployment and commercial operating phases."
"It provides for a financial contribution from the European Community amounting to EUR 1 billion for the period of the new financial perspectives for 2007 - 2013."
"This amount will be transferred to the Supervisory Authority, which will make use of it in line with the provisions of the Council regulation of 12 July 2004."
"In addition, the proposal bases the programme on a specific legal instrument, consistent with the future European space programme and better able to respond to the need for good financial management."
"We will need to create a specific budget heading for the deployment and commercial operating phases of the programme, for three reasons."
"Firstly, the programme has now reached maturity."
"It has taken on a dimension that goes far beyond the sectoral policies pursued by the Commission."
"Secondly, the scale of the activities imposes requirements of transparency and budgetary rigour, as well as scrupulous supervision."
"Thirdly, the institutional and budgetary frameworks must be clear and consistent from the point of view of the concession holder for the system, on whom the Community will impose comparable requirements of transparency and consistency."
"I would stress the fact that the financing of the Galileo programme by the Community budget will be time limited."
"The commercial revenues generated by the operation of the system should ensure financial stability over time."
"I would remind you that many third countries China, Israel, India and Ukraine  plan to participate in the programme."
"I would add that the Commission will ensure that the future concession contract provides for the repayment of public financial contributions if the profit earned by the concession holder exceeds a certain threshold over time."
"In conclusion, the proposal for a regulation put before you responds to the requirements arising from proper implementation of the deployment and commercial operating phases of the programme, to the requirement for good financial management and to the need for a grand European project that has reached an advanced stage of maturity."
"That, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say to you."
"I very much hope that Parliament will follow Mrs Barsi-Pataky’s lead and give us all the support that this great project needs."
"It will indubitably bring the European Union many technological successes, and will make it possible to create many jobs connected with its various applications."
"The European Parliament has closely followed the development of the Galileo satellite radio navigation system from the outset, and through its involvement in the legislative process, Parliament has participated in bringing it about and shaping it."
"On the basis of the Galileo programme, a Community infrastructure will be created that truly deserves to be called a project ‘made in Europe’."
"This new global-scale infrastructure differs from its predecessors (the GPS and GLONASS systems) in that it is designed for civil and commercial (and not military) purposes, and as a result has become a joint project of all 25 Member States."
"The legislation before us concerns the financing of the deployment and initial operating phase in the period 2007-2013."
"We could, of course, have placed this regulation on the agenda of the plenary sitting, after agreement was reached on the Financial Perspective."
"I will give you the following reasons as to why we did not do this."
"Galileo is a PPP project involving both Community and private finance, and having a concession holder."
"Negotiations on the concession contract have begun, and so I felt that Parliament needed to make all the decisions that it wants taken into account in the negotiations."
"1."
"It is important that Parliament should state, in its Opinion, that it supports the inclusion of a contribution of EUR 1 billion as a specific budget line in the Financial Perspective."
"2."
"The Community will not only provide financial support for the project, but will also allow the concession holder to retain the revenues from the licences and other related rights, although the Community will retain ownership of these licences and rights."
"3."
"Parliament recommends integration of the EGNOS programme, which ensures compatibility with the American GPS system and is a precursor of the Galileo programme (rather like introducing marketing)."
"4."
"Parliament expects the concession contract to contain provisions relating to the sharing of profits or revenues (from such a time as the project begins to generate profits or revenues, of course)."
"5."
"Since this is a PPP project, Parliament is willing to undertake financial guarantees and to share liabilities (but of course only when it is familiar with the concession contract and able to discuss this issue)."
"6."
"In the interests of the programme’s success, Parliament expects the implementers of the Galileo programme to keep to the deadlines."
"Parliament will check and monitor this constantly, in its annual budget debates."
"7."
"Parliament supports the inclusion of research on GNSS satellite navigation in the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, and at the same time recommends also including development of Galileo user applications in the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, specifically with the involvement of small and medium enterprises."
"8."
"Parliament explicitly welcomes the PPP form of implementation."
"However, given that this is the first Community PPP project, Parliament recommends that it should have observer status on the Administrative Board of the Supervisory Authority, which will be on a one-off basis and will not include implementation tasks."
"This recommendation was also made by the previous Parliament, but I would like to point out to my fellow Members that the European Commission does not agree with it."
"The report was also discussed by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Their opinions are an integral part of the report."
"I would like to point out that I will be tabling an oral amendment tomorrow on the basis of the interim agreement reached with the Committee on Budgets, and the ‘shadow rapporteurs’ are already aware of this."
"The amendment is technical in nature and concerns the withdrawal of the reference to 2004 as base year."
"I would like to express my gratitude for this excellent opportunity for conciliation and cooperation with the European Commission."
"To conclude, I would like to inform Parliament that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy discussed the report several times, and adopted it unanimously at its June sitting."
". Madam President, I served on the Committee on Budgets for many years as the United Kingdom Conservative spokesman."
"I recently moved to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and I have also served for many years on the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"So this evening, although I have to apologise that Mr Lewandowski is unable to participate in the debate, I want to give this project our full backing."
"In the early years, we had reservations."
"We thought that the American system did not need a European alternative."
"However, the British and the Conservative Party have been brought round."
"I pay tribute to the rapporteur and the constructive attitude of the Commissioner on this subject, which is extremely important because of the added value that Europe is bringing to it."
"We have managed to achieve a great deal of progress to date and we need all 25 countries to pull together to achieve success in the future."
"I also admire the way that accountability is uppermost in this proposed regulation."
"Parliament and the Council need to be fully convinced at all stages that the proper steps are being taken and that accountability and transparency are the order of the day."
"I particularly welcome the involvement of the small and medium-sized enterprises, because they see this as a huge opportunity for them to increase their knowledge of technology in commercial concerns and to back up the very large operating body that will provide overall supervision."
"I also agree with the method by which they were appointed; it was slightly contentious at the time, but the results have been successful."
"I wish the project every success."
"I hope we will make sure that accountability is always the order of the day and that any financial guarantees that have to be given by the Council or Parliament are most carefully adhered to."
". – Madam President, I too wish to take my turn in welcoming the Commission proposal and Mrs Pataky's report."
"I am also optimistic that, in taking the Galileo programme to its next two phases, this unique European plan will be able to fulfil its full operational potential."
"Nonetheless, allow me a word of criticism."
"The Galileo joint undertaking, which will continue up to May 2006, made provision in its statutes for the facility for undertakings in the western sector to invest in its capital to the sum of EUR 5 million for large undertakings and EUR 250 000 for small and medium-sized undertakings."
"This was obviously to give the original political agreement between the two administrative members, the European Community and the European Space Agency some sort of corporate form; a corporate form which, supposedly, would be able to attract private capital."
"Unfortunately, not one single undertaking has subscribed to the capital of Galileo."
"However, this was only natural and only to be expected, given that there were no incentives for any such investment."
"It would therefore appear that we have a problem between public/private partnerships in theory and in practice."
"I call on Parliament to address this weakness and to control the Commission accordingly."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must, of course, extend particular thanks to Mrs Barsi-Pataky, with whom I have had a very good working relationship. I have been familiar with this subject area for a number years and it is one I have often had to handle."
"Mrs Barsi-Pataky has got to grips with it with astonishing speed and her cooperation with the shadow rapporteur has been very frank and transparent."
"The result of that has been a very solid vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, with no votes against the report."
"What that also shows is that this House is still backing this project, albeit with misgivings here and there."
"Buying a project, a device, or a system is one thing, but it is just as important to develop one’s own systems and perfect one’s own technology."
"That I see as being the most important thing about this project."
"As has been said, the civil project in the European Union is meant to be set up as a public-private partnership, and the experts believe that it will create up to 150 000 jobs."
"For once, I believe them: their prognosis may well be accurate if we manage to get the project up and running relatively quickly, to find applications for it and produce this solution in Europe rather than importing it."
"If the forecasts are to be realistic, we simply have to succeed in this."
"Having a third of the EUR 3.5 billion subscribed from public funds and two-thirds derived from private sources gives Europe the chance of getting this project on its feet."
"I am optimistic about the prospects for the capital being put up once the projects and the concession contracts are in place."
"What is, of course, important is that we make the public funds available, and that is where I think we may still come a cropper, for the Council has not yet been able to agree on the Financial Perspective, one of the items in which is – of course – this EUR 1 billion for this project."
"We have already done our homework, but if the Council cannot manage to make these resources available and to secure funding by the end of the year, then it will be possible neither to get the concession contract signed nor to put any satellites into orbit."
"If nothing happens by December, then the frequencies are lost to us."
"We have, I think, had more than one moment of decision with regard to Galileo in the past; it is unfortunate that it was always the Council that put the brake on developments for a while."
"I hope we will make it this time."
"My group is giving this proposal its wholehearted backing and will be voting in favour of it."
"I am aware of Mrs Barsi-Pataky’s oral amendments; having conducted negotiations, I think we can go along with what she proposes."
"I do very much hope that the Council’s mind will not be as narrow as the checks on the shirt I am wearing today, and apologise for not having had the opportunity to change."
"I will look more respectable tomorrow."
". Madam President, Commissioner, there is no doubting the fact that this Galileo project is of the utmost strategic importance and, as a public-private partnership of such great dimensions, unique in the EU."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur for her efforts, not only on my own part but also on behalf of my group."
"There is one point on which I would like to give her very strong backing, and that is her demand that the European Parliament, as the budgetary institution, should have a seat onthe Administrative Board."
"Our institution’s budgetary role does indeed mean that we should be fully informed about the financial aspects of the Galileo project."
"There are very practical considerations behind this, for third countries have acquired smaller holdings – China in particular, which bought a share in our project on 30 October 2003."
"Having wanted to invest a total of 20 million in what is a 3.5 billion project, it gave notice of the intention to buy 5 million but paid only 2 million."
"This amount – 0.06%, a thousandth, of the total – puts China in full possession of the know-how that Galileo has to offer and gives it unrestricted access to it."
"I have conducted my own inquiries in Oberpfaffenhofen and seen how our know-how and intellectual property are not secure."
"I ask you, Commissioner, to do everything in your power to prevent our technology from being sold off to others."
"While we want third countries to be involved and markets to be conquered, we must also see to it that our intellectual property is protected."
"Let me particularly draw your attention to an amendment – No 22 – tabled by my colleague Mrs Hall, which is aimed at ensuring that, at a later date, when commercial operations begin, the European Union gets its contribution repaid, in other words, that there is a real distribution of profits."
"This debate is a significant one, and deserves to have more people observing it and listening to it."
"That is something we cannot change."
"I wish the rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, every success in getting her report through."
". – Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Galileo Programme is both very ambitious and extremely challenging in scientific and technical terms, which is why it is so costly."
"As well as attracting a great deal of interest, the programme has therefore also provoked a variety of opinions and reactions."
"On the one hand, there are those who believe that the project makes Europe more competitive compared to the rest of the world, including the United States."
"In most other respects we are lagging behind the latter, for example in scientific and technological fields, but Galileo is superior to its American counterpart, or in other words GPS, which was originally conceived as a military system."
"What is more, at a time such as this, when the European Union is competing for public support against a background of debates on the fate of the Constitutional Treaty, this is an opportunity for us to develop a project that will enable the creation of thousands of new and much-needed jobs, to say nothing of its other benefits."
"On the other hand, however, I entirely understand the concerns that have been voiced over the enormous financial costs of the Galileo Programme, and the risk that this money could be wasted."
"It is not only members of my own group that have raised such concerns, and they are entirely legitimate, given that worrying examples of money being wasted in this way can be found in the day-to-day practices of the different Member States."
"It stands to reason that the European Parliament must ensure that it has opportunities and instruments for monitoring, and that it must ensure that money is spent transparently and effectively."
"Questions have also been asked over whether it is appropriate to exclude the Galileo Programme from funding cuts, in view of the debates being held on across-the-board cuts to the EU budget."
"The Galileo Programme is currently moving out of the development and testing phase, which has been a success, and into the implementation phase."
"Heeding calls for savings, and imposing arbitrary cuts in order to make savings at any price, would be akin to expecting a rocket carrier that originally consisted of three stages to carry an object into space, even if you remove one of its stages."
"The end result will be that we are left with nothing."
"One final comment; I am delighted that the bodies responsible for such matters in the Czech Republic share my views on the future of the Galileo project, namely that it should be seen in terms of a wide variety of possible civilian applications."
"I am also delighted that they are not only in favour of the system being built, but are also taking the relevant practical steps to implement it."
"Madam President, like the EU’s other institutions, this Chamber is forever prepared to get involved in areas with which the EU should not concern itself. The EU is removing Europeans’ national self-determination in area after area."
"The various debates this evening are revealing. No one in this Chamber seems to ask themselves whether what we are debating is a task for the EU."
"The EU’s political legitimacy is therefore in constant decline."
"This may be seen from opinion polls, but rarely in democratic elections."
"Established party structures do not give people the opportunity to express their opposition to the shift in power to the EU."
"It is therefore only in referenda that this popular opposition finds expression in the democratic process."
"This is something we have seen in Denmark, Ireland and Sweden and now most recently in France and the Netherlands."
"I have a political mandate from my electors to resist this concentration of power in the EU, but not in areas."
"There are cases in which I and those like me welcome common efforts at EU level."
"The Galileo project is one such area."
"We are concerned here with developing a European infrastructure in a very important area of high technology."
"The individual countries cannot manage this task successfully."
"With Galileo, we shall make Europe independent of an American system that, in times of unrest, may be interfered with and unilaterally closed down by the United States for military reasons."
"I therefore welcome the Galileo project and recommend that the Chamber support the proposal to implement its deployment and operating phases."
"For once, the EU is on the right track."
"Madam President, now that we are entering the development phase of this remarkable programme, as well as its deployment phase in which all of the space- and ground-based infrastructure will be created, it seems to us that two points are still vague."
"Via the Galileo programme, and in line with the Lisbon strategy, Europe is in the process of creating the first satellite positioning infrastructure on a global scale."
"This will bring us economic and strategic autonomy with respect to the US-owned GPS."
"This autonomy, however, seems to be incomplete, as it reveals a flaw in terms of political autonomy."
"Indeed, even though the intention is to secure personal data and to make the provision of information more reliable, this project, although it respects national sovereignty and strictly follows the subsidiarity principle, is purely for civilian purposes."
"It therefore leaves Europe dependent on the US military system for defence applications, and there is no real guarantee that the service will continue in the case of crises similar to the Gulf War, for example."
"Moreover, the risks involved in the transfer of technology via extra-European international cooperation do not seem to have been taken into account."
"Indeed, in the case of China, a financial partner in the Galileo programme, we cannot ignore the political origin and the potentially dangerous military interests, a field in which space technology can also be used by missiles."
"The same is true of commercial practices that may be reprehensible or else incompatible with European interests."
"In the circumstances, we call on the Commission to present a proposal that aims to safeguard the independence and room for manoeuvre of this programme in order to make Europe truly independent and to limit, or even to avoid completely, the risks of technology transfer in cases regarded as potentially dangerous."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, for having finalised her report in record time."
"When we consider how long it took the Council of Ministers to reach a decision almost a decade  the European Parliament can be proud of having recognised the true importance of the Galileo project."
"European cooperation with regard to satellite radionavigation is an innovative project for the future in view of its public-private partnership, which should be able to create, we are told, 150 000 new jobs in the field of new technologies."
"This is a project for the future that will be able to prove that the countries of Europe are capable of stimulating the growth of new industries, of creating employment and of improving their citizens’ quality of life."
"The management methods of this project raise an important question and we would like Parliament to be informed of the initial results and of the operating methods in this matter."
"Commissioner, not everyone is certain that the management method chosen is the most appropriate one."
"With regard to the heel-dragging demonstrated by the Council of Transport Ministers, I would suggest that the Commission should now initiate projects to benefit from satellite navigation by drawing up alternative itineraries to sensitive points on our motorways, in order to improve the mobility of citizens and to make the most of this new facility as soon as it is available to us."
"The importance of this project for terrestrial research and observation must encourage us to fully exploit it and to encourage space research projects, whether as part of the seventh framework programme or at the EASA."
"To this end, an observer’s position for Parliament on the Administrative Board would enable us to be better informed and to coordinate activities in this area."
"Finally, one last question, Commissioner: do we have the human resources needed to implement this project?"
"Are we sure that the 150 000 jobs will be filled by qualified persons; and what will our future needs be?"
"How should young people prepare themselves so that they can have access to these jobs?"
"Madam President, these days, we can see on a screen where we are and in what direction we should be heading to get to our intended destination."
"It is to be hoped that this useful invention will be used to enhance our well-being rather than to wage war."
"Were such a system not yet in existence, it would have been a good idea to examine at European level whether something like this were technically feasible and could be put into production."
"There would then be a good reason for not farming this project out to accidental inventors and to entrepreneurs who hope to cash in on it, but instead making a joint effort and using Community funds in the process."
"It is now too late in the day for this."
"Europe can no longer be the first one."
"Such a system, originating from outside the EU, is already in operation and has conquered the European market."
"The Galileo plans add not much more than a competitive battle involving existing systems."
"Community funds are now mainly used to subsidise enterprises in the electronics and aviation industries."
"This will cost the European Union and its Member States increasingly more money to the detriment of more useful tasks."
"That is why there are those in my group who have never supported this project."
"Madam President, first of all I must congratulate Mrs Barsi-Pataky on her report and particularly on her proposal to provide the Galileo programme with an ambitious Community budget, following on from what Commissioner Barrot defended."
"I consider a package of EUR 1 billion for 2007-2013 to be justified for three main reasons."
"Firstly, the nature of what is at stake: this programme involves nothing less than ensuring Europe’s independence in space, while at the same time offering a host of new services to professionals and to private individuals."
"Secondly, with Galileo, the EU is fully committed to financing investments in the future."
"Thirdly, this sustained budgetary commitment is justified by the expected return on the investment: according to various estimates, Galileo should be exceptionally profitable, with an expected cost-benefit ratio of 4.6."
"For all these reasons, the EU must make an ambitious commitment to this programme, and I hope that the Council and particularly the UK Presidency, which talked a great deal a few months ago about the benefits of future spending, will go down this path."
"As it is very late, I will not tell you about all the assets, which are real and important, that the town of Toulouse can bring as the headquarters of the Galileo concession."
". Madam President, I will be brief, even though the project is worth discussing further."
"I would like to thank Parliament for the support it is giving to this great programme."
"It is true that the financial perspectives will have to be discussed but, in any event, I think that we must give priority to the billion intended for the Galileo programme."
"The Galileo programme, as Mrs De Veyrac has just said, confirms the European Union’s true independence, and will make possible a number of applications."
"Clearly, these applications must be within the reach of as many people as possible and will provide our small and medium-sized enterprises with many new opportunities."
"There is no doubt that we need to focus on providing the human resources to make full use of the new opportunities provided by this programme."
"I can well understand that Parliament particularly wishes to be involved in this programme."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for her report to which you have responded."
"It is a comprehensive and high-quality report."
"I would also like to thank your Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their support for the European Commission’s proposal."
"Of course, I support Parliament’s concern to feel fully responsible for the implementation of this project, which will be developed within the framework of a public-private partnership in which businesses will have a full part to play."
"It has just been said that there were no private businesses involved in the development phase."
"This is true in the development phase, but during the deployment and commercial operating phases it will be European businesses that, in the context of synergies, will carry this project; and that is the interesting aspect of all this."
"The Supervisory Authority will, of course, ensure that the objectives pursued by the European Union are achieved."
"Mrs Barsi-Pataky’s report goes in the direction wanted by the Commission, which can accept all the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, with the exception of Amendments 13 and 25."
"I am not going to respond to all the points raised."
"Most of the amendments significantly improve the text and make a positive contribution to the programme."
"Amendments 9, 10, 20 and 21 specify that the budgetary authority will be asked to give its approval in cases where financial guarantees or commitments arising from the programme exceed the budgetary allocation provided."
"I give my approval."
"I would also remind you that the Commission has promised that the future concession contract will provide for repayment of public financial contributions if the profit earned by the concession holder passes a certain threshold."
"It therefore accepts Amendments 11 and 22, which provide for a profit-sharing mechanism, while specifying that the Community contribution will not automatically be repayed in full, but that repayment will depend on the profit earned by the concession holder."
"With regard to the EUR 1 billion, I would stress that it is the result of a precise assessment of the costs of the programme and of the desire to get strong financial involvement from the private sector."
"However, the Commission accepts the indicative inclusion of that figure at this stage by means of Amendment 19, while the discussions on the new financial perspectives are underway."
"In contrast, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 13 and 25, giving Parliament observer status on the Administrative Board of the Supervisory Authority."
"It would appear difficult for Parliament, which is the main budgetary control body for the Community as a whole, to both exercise this control and sit, even simply as an observer, on the administrative board of a body over which it has control."
"I would add that there is currently no precedent for this in the other Community agencies."
"The experts appointed by Parliament within some of these agencies are simply experts appointed for their qualifications and do not represent Parliament as an institution."
"I think that Parliament must retain its power of control and must in no way be linked by its presence, even as an observer, on the administrative board."
"I can assure you that the Commission is keen to provide the European Parliament with all the necessary information, including, as some have mentioned, with regard to the protection of our patents and of the most sensitive technologies."
"That is why I hope that we will clearly confine ourselves to our mutual responsibilities and that Parliament will fully assume its responsibility for control."
"I think that, for this reason, it is preferable not to retain Amendments 13 and 25, the spirit of which I well understand but which do not seem to follow the spirit of our institutions."
"In conclusion, I am delighted at Parliament’s work."
"I am convinced that the final point, based on a general interinstitutional approach, will in no way diminish the importance of Parliament’s role and will not hinder the rapid and positive progress of the codecision procedure."
"Thank you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for originating this great project that, we hope, will give the young generation a very positive and dynamic image of Europe."
"I thank you and I hope that Parliament will support this great project by a large majority."
"That concludes the debate on this item."
"The vote will be held tomorrow, Tuesday, at 12 noon."
". – I am delighted that our committee is unanimous in its support for this project."
"It is vital for:"
"- technological reasons: this is an innovative project and is an improvement on the guarantee of services provided by the US-owned GPS."
"- economic reasons: the sector needs to retain an appropriate level of activity."
"- strategic reasons: Galileo improves the autonomy of our defence systems."
"- political reasons, because the project keeps the EU to its purpose."
"The EU has limited itself to creating the conditions for the emergence of the necessary new activities."
"The amendment requiring the concession holder to repay the investment illustrates this spirit."
"The autonomy of nations is strengthened."
"The PRS goes in this direction and enables each country to gain access to a technology that would be unattainable for them on their own."
"This cooperation also includes countries outside the EU."
"In conclusion, this project shows that true cooperation does not need a Constitution."
"This is a good project; let us hope that it will soon find its place in the budgetary plan."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0249/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (optical radiation) (19th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (05571/6/2005 – C6-0129/2005 – 1992/0449(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Őry)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly, on behalf of the Commission, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Őry, on his excellent report and his commitment to carrying this difficult matter through to a successful conclusion, the subject being the optical radiation section of the proposal for a directive relating to the protection of workers against the risks arising from physical agents."
"The Commission continues to attach the greatest importance to all measures aimed at ensuring better protection of workers’ health and safety, for these are factors essential to the quality of life in the work place."
"The latest scientific data indicates that excessive exposure to optical radiation, whether the sources be natural or artificial, may have serious consequences for health, particularly for the health of workers exposed to it in the course of their professional activities."
"Given that the harm caused by exposure to optical radiation does not depend upon whether the source of that radiation is artificial or natural, the proposal includes all cases of professional exposure to optical radiation."
"Nonetheless, the Commission has accepted the approach adopted in the Council common position, which consists of introducing differential treatment to reduce the risks arising from exposure to natural sources such as the sun or to artificial sources such as lasers or ultraviolet lamps."
"Regarding exposure to artificial sources, the proposal lays down exposure limit values and provides for a series of preventative measures, including risk assessment carried out in advance with a view to removing the risks or reducing them to a minimum."
"To avoid placing pointless burdens upon companies, the proposal also points out that the assessment may take account of data provided by the manufacturers of equipment that produces optical radiation when such equipment is covered by a relevant Community directive."
"Regarding exposure to natural sources whose presence and intensity are beyond man’s control, it has not been deemed appropriate to apply exposure limit values."
"In this case, the directive nonetheless emphasises the importance of informing and training workers, as well as of carrying out a prior assessment of the risks, taking account of simple protective measures adapted to the situation on the ground."
"Mr President, I shall shortly have the opportunity to state the Commission’s position on the amendments, but I need to let the debate take place."
"I would also point out that I am dealing with this matter in the absence of Mr Špidla, who has gone to the EU-China Summit."
"I am well placed to deputise for my colleague, all the more so because the subject is that of working conditions, on which I myself have had plenty of opportunities to work."
"I would thank Parliament in anticipation of its letting us have all the information and observations available to it."
"Creating a legal environment that ensures theprotection of the health and safety of European employees has been an unequivocal obligation of the European legislative process for decades."
"This obligation is set out, , in Article 137 of the Treaty of Rome."
"A ‘framework directive’ of the European Economic Community, adopted in 1989, constitutes the basis of the legal environment."
"The provisions of this directive stipulate that, in order to ensure workers’ health and safety, employers have a general obligation to evaluate all possible risks that could have an adverse effect on workers’ health while carrying out their occupational activities."
"The framework directive, then, sets out this general obligation to ensure that workers can be protected from all adverse effects."
"Specific types of risks are not listed in this prescriptive text, because the range of risks constantly changes and expands depending on changes in the occupational environment."
"The employer, however, must be attentive to all risks, regardless of this."
"As far back as 1989, the legislators already intended drafting appropriate legal provisions, tailor-made to fit the different risks, and this was the reason why a specific piece of legislation was drawn up concerning physical risks."
"Following its first reading in 1992, Parliament decided to divide it into four parts, thus giving rise to the different risk-related directives on noise, vibrations and electromagnetic fields."
"The last component, on optical radiation, is now on the agenda for its second reading."
"On issues relating to radiation from artificial sources, a fairly broad consensus was achieved in the course of Parliament’s work and the conciliation process that took place with representatives of the Commission and the Council."
"On the other hand, the question of solar radiation, in other words radiation from natural sources, proved controversial, so I would like to say a few words about it."
"It is a fundamental principle that the employer is responsible for any harm arising to an employee from occupational activities."
"This is incontrovertible, and the earlier legislative provisions still in force today clearly stipulate this."
"Obviously, a distinction must be drawn between different countries, different circumstances and even in terms of radiation, and therefore a great deal of detailed and complicated consultation was necessary before we were able to arrive at a compromise with the majority of our fellow Members."
"The essence of this compromise is that, on account of the extremely varied circumstances prevailing in relation to solar radiation, it would make sense for detailed provisions and specific measures to be elaborated at the level of the Member States."
"In the spirit of subsidiarity, this compromise proposes that, in the case of radiation from natural sources, the task of setting out appropriate provisions should be the competence of the individual countries."
"It is obvious that the situation is very different in Sweden and in Greece, in Spain and in Germany."
"The traditions are different; the culture is different."
"It therefore makes sense to give individual countries the opportunity to define the obligations that employers will be expected to meet."
"At the same time, however, I also consider it an important achievement that broad agreement was reached on numerous issues relating to the report; for example, the Council indicated that it was willing to accept the proposal supported by all political groups in Parliament: to draw up a practical technical guide, which we are now awaiting from the Commission."
"This would help businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, to understand, apply and simply to manage the often quite complex actions they must undertake, especially as regards radiation from artificial sources."
"It would be a great result if this guide were also part of the directive."
"I ask my colleagues and Parliament to support the version of the directive, and those proposed amendments to it, that create a balance between European-level provisions laying down minimum obligations and the practical possibilities and responsibilities of the Member States."
"I therefore ask you to support these compromises."
"Lastly, I would like to thank the ‘shadow rapporteurs’ of all the political groups, my colleagues and the representatives of the Council and the Commission."
"We have worked very hard in recent weeks, and I think we have worked well together."
". Mr President, first of all, I should like to extend warm thanks to Mr Csaba Őry, for he had to work on this very tricky issue under extreme pressure, not only from fellow Members but also from the media."
"I have less appreciation for the Council and Commission representatives."
"I regret that you, Mr Barrot, are unable at the start of the debate to indicate the Commission’s position on this issue and that you are unable to say whether the Commission is prepared to defend the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Moreover, I do not appreciate the fact that the Council representatives have so far not been in contact, particularly because the politicians in the Member States say that we should actually take a different course in Europe, while the Commission’s bureaucrats who pore over this topic say that we must remain faithful to what we have."
"That goes against the grain with me."
"What we have done is to take a decision about a first reading that dates back to 1992 – that is 13 years ago – and we have not reached second reading until now!"
"A great deal has been written about this topic."
"As far as artificial radiation is concerned, we have to be strict when it comes to working conditions; after all, workers’ health is at stake."
"As for solar, or natural, radiation, we would like to take a different approach, which can be done by means of the subsidiarity clauses that we have at our disposal."
"The sun shines for varying lengths of time and with varying intensity from one location to another."
"We therefore consider minimum unit requirements in Europe to be taking matters too far."
"I am therefore delighted that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ response to our amendments has been very positive."
"I believe that the report that is now before us will receive broad support in this House."
"How do we intend to tackle natural radiation?"
"We admit that there is a danger, but Member States, along with employers in conjunction with the Member States, should decide for themselves whether, and when, measures should be taken."
"This principle has been incorporated in the approved report and I would make an urgent appeal to all groups, including the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to give this report their backing."
". Mr President, I thank Mr Őry for his excellent work as rapporteur."
"He worked very closely with all the shadow rapporteurs, improved an already pretty good common position and produced a good draft report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"It is only a pity that that good work was put in jeopardy by the stance taken by his own group, the PPE-DE, and a faction in the Liberal Group on one aspect of the proposal: the provisions relating to the occupational risks arising from exposure to natural radiation."
"Sadly, we have come to expect totally misleading and sensational press releases from the right, misrepresenting important pieces of health and safety legislation."
"When we worked on the issue of industrial noise, we were accused of trying to ban bagpipe playing in Scotland."
"Our work on the risks of whole body vibration was evidently to stop farmers from driving tractors after only three or four hours, even at the height of the harvest."
"Now our work on this proposal is presented as an attempt to force citizens to carry umbrellas."
"This is absolute nonsense."
"The Commissioner himself said that the original proposal envisaged a far lighter-touch approach to natural radiation than artificial sources."
"However, this time I sense something more than an attempt to grab cheap tabloid headlines, something more ideologically driven."
"I believe that those sitting behind Mr Őry and trying to undermine his work think that, with the stalling of much of Europe's social agenda, they have a chance to push for deregulation and the renationalisation of important elements of the social legal base."
"If that is so, then let me tell them that they should think again."
"We will do all we can to stop them in their tracks and continue to improve, and not undermine, worker protection."
"In reality, our amendments on natural radiation have nothing to do with the ridiculous stories fed to the media."
"We are trying to do three positive things."
"First, to make explicit what is already implicit in the proposal."
"We are not talking about expensive duties being imposed on employers."
"Where the employer finds a risk associated with natural radiation, information will be provided to workers."
"In the vast majority of modern occupational settings there will be no risk."
"Secondly, by taking the sentence from the Council, granting Member States a role in determining the criteria to apply to the risk assessment in the light of national circumstances, we are acknowledging the obvious fact that, as both speakers have already said, the risk from natural radiation is somewhat lower in Newcastle than it is in Naples."
"Thirdly, we are trying to provide greater legal certainty for employers."
"Although the right try to deny it, the 1999 Framework Directive clearly imposes a duty on employers to assess all occupational risks."
"The 1992 directive on construction sites certainly goes further and specifically mentions environmental considerations."
"We should use this proposal to introduce greater legal certainty."
"That is exactly what we are trying to do in our amendments, by seeking to highlight the provision of information to workers."
"We are talking about a very serious risk."
"According to Cancer Research UK, skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the UK."
"Cases of skin cancer there have more than doubled since the 1980s. The UK now has more cases of skin cancer than Australia."
"More than 69 000 new cases are diagnosed in the UK each year and over 2 000 people die each year in the UK from skin cancer."
"That is not specific to the UK."
"In Germany, skin cancer among agricultural workers has risen by between 15% and 20% over the last decade alone."
"Please take a look at the statistics in your own countries."
"This is a global, not a national, phenomenon."
"So let us use the EU-wide legal base we have to provide greater protection for all our workers."
". Mr President, I speak on behalf of the whole of the ALDE Group, contrary to what Mr Hughes was implying."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation on this directive."
"I now hope that all MEPs, including the Socialists, will see sense and either completely remove natural radiation from this directive, or at least pass the compromise that we voted for in committee and leave it up to Member States."
"It is absolutely ludicrous to keep it in. I thought it was a joke when I first read it."
"I did not believe that the Council and the Commission could actually be serious about this."
"It would bring the EU into further disrepute if we legislate against the sun in the workplace."
"Apart from that, this is a reasonably sensible directive, to protect people like welders from artificial radiation, but we should not include natural radiation from the sun."
"As the text stands at present, employers would be required to do a risk assessment every day, bringing in technical and organisational measures to protect workers."
"What does that mean?"
"Keeping them in from the sun a lot of the time?"
"Providing protective equipment, such as sunglasses, hats, or sun tan cream, and making sure that they wear them?"
"It is no business of the EU to tell workers that they cannot be bare-chested or wear shorts."
"They are adults."
"Imagine the language if workers were told to cover up when they were trying to get a sun tan from their holiday."
"And how would you prove liability?"
"If a worker gets skin cancer, was it in the workplace, was it on the beach, was it in the back garden?"
"It would in my opinion be a legal nightmare."
"Yes, everyone should be warned about the dangers of the sun, but that should not be up to employers."
"Government campaigns should warn everybody."
"If we pass this directive and include natural radiation, this would be taking the 'nanny state' mentality too far."
"I sincerely hope that all MEPs will either vote to remove natural radiation from the text, or vote for the compromise in committee."
". Mr President, over the past months, a media furore has spread half-truths and untruths in the shape of ludicrous shaggy-dog stories."
"The only thing about the so-called minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (optical radiation) – as the title puts it – to gain a firm hold on the public mind was that Brussels, in its mania for regulation, sought even to outlaw the rays of the sun, requiring barmaids to refrain from wearing low-cut dresses and even banning footballers from wearing shorts in future."
"I am sure that I do not need to point out to the House that this directive is solely concerned with prevention and with protective measures in the workplace and with improving precautions against skin cancers – not least as an occupational illness."
"Essentially, we would have no need of rules and regulations if, for example, the old dress codes to deal with natural optical radiation were still in place, with it being taken for granted that someone working in the sun would wear a hat and clothing to protect the skin."
"Nor would we have much need of them if the sun’s ultra-violet rays were not constantly being made more dangerous by the depletion of the ozone layer."
"It is, alas, an established fact – and one to which a number of Members have referred – that incidences of skin cancer have multiplied over recent years, particularly among those working in construction and agriculture, neither of which can be regarded as privileged occupations."
"The question that we have to answer today is whether or not we want to protect these workers better against optical radiation, just as we do against noise, vibration and electro-magnetic radiation, and do so, moreover, to an equal degree in every Member State, and whether or not we want to guarantee the recognition of skin cancer as an occupational illness throughout the EU."
"We must not shuffle off our own powers and responsibilities onto the Member States, who are responsible for implementation."
"While health is a fundamental asset for every individual, it also has an economic dimension, so we should adopt the Council’s proposed minimum requirements – remembering that they are minimum requirements! – while rejecting Articles 4 and 5, which have been completely watered down."
"As a matter of principle, we Greens share the Socialist Group’s position and call for minimum standards for proper protection at work in all EU Member States."
". – The protection of workers’ health and safety has already been the subject of a number of directives in areas such as vibration, noise and electromagnetic fields."
"It is therefore incomprehensible that members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have voiced their opposition to the adoption of measures aimed at strengthening the protection of workers exposed to natural radiation."
"Under such measures, the onus will fall on employers to assess the health and safety risks, so that the steps needed to reduce those risks can be identified and implemented, for example by means of an action plan involving technical and/or organisational measures aimed at reducing health and safety risks to a minimum."
"That is what happened in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in respect of Articles 4(2) and 5(2), as mentioned previously, in an attempt to ensure that these proposals did not cover workers in relation to optical radiation."
"We naturally feel that workers’ health must be protected, and therefore have difficulty in accepting the Council Presidency’s compromise."
"Of course, Member States may take account of the nature of the activities undertaken and levels of exposure to the sun, and may lay down specific criteria for such a risk assessment to observe."
"What is important, however, is that minimum values be established that take account of the World Trade Organisation’s data, which show that thousands of people in Europe have died of skin cancer, a disease that is on the rise throughout the EU."
"Consequently, workers in sectors such as agriculture, construction, tourism, law enforcement – that is to say, anyone who works in the open air – must be protected."
"This is why we have tabled proposals aimed at reinstating at least basic levels of protection for all workers in the EU."
"Mr President, why do we in this House continue to bring ridicule on ourselves by promoting such egregious measures as this one?"
"In Germany the media have mocked it because of its effect on Bavarian barmaids' bosoms."
"In Britain the press have poked fun at it because it restricts bare-backed building workers."
"I accept that a brickie's cleavage is not a pretty sight, but we have no business in this House making rules about it."
"When will we start to treat European citizens like grown-ups, able to make their own decisions?"
"How long will we continue to treat them like small children, seeking to regulate and control every detail of their lives?"
"How long will we continue to pile cost, liability, uncertainty and vast bureaucratic burdens on employers, making European economies less profitable and less competitive?"
"I have been approached by organisations ranging from the National Farmers Union to the Federation of Master Builders, which are deeply worried about the impact on their businesses."
"Sadly, I have not been approached by any Bavarian barmaids, but my door is always open should they wish to see me."
"This is an unnecessary and damaging measure."
"The only people to benefit from it will be compensation lawyers."
"We should reject the natural radiation aspects of this proposal out of hand."
"Mr President, I would point out to Mr Kusstatscher that prevention and protection – not in people’s leisure activities, but in their workplaces – is a matter of concern to us too, but, if the Commission and the Council have their way, it is evident that building firms will in future have to certify that ultra-violet rays are safe for those of their workers who work in the open air."
"Time-consuming programmes of action to deal with sunburn will be devised; lifeguards in open-air swimming pools will virtually have to wrap themselves up, and serving staff in hostelries with gardens will evidently have to carry not just trays but also a variable parasol or two."
"What is put together here on – and let this be borne in mind! – 42 whole pages, is a burden on businesses, puts jobs at risk and is a cause of justified outrage on the part of the public."
"The rapporteur, Mr Őry, has done a very good job of work in presenting a compromise in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, where it gained a majority, albeit an extremely narrow one."
"What we want to achieve is for the Member States themselves to decide what to do with this ‘sunshine directive’."
"By means of this proposal, we have run up the flag of realism and signalled our opposition to overweening bureaucracy."
"Surely, the failure of the referenda in some Member States – while others hesitate to move on with the decision-making process – shows that the public will accept the European Union only if we concentrate on the essentials, take the issues really seriously and make use of our powers and responsibilities."
"Mrs Lynne is right to say that we risk bringing the EU into disrepute."
"Over ten years have passed since this document on optical radiation was given its first reading."
"The former version of it bears next to no relation to the present one."
"It is irrelevant – and cannot be anything else – to say that we are going to protect workers in the same way right across Europe when we are well aware that the climate zones in our countries differ enormously."
"Workers have themselves learned from years of experience what they can and must do about optical radiation."
"Some can cope with the sun extremely well and other cannot at all."
"They come to their own individual solutions, and in that we must not interfere."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is right to say that what we have seen here is a lack of willingness to compromise on the part of the Council, whose attitude, exemplified not least by this abstruse new proposal, really is far removed from reality."
"Needless to say, the Federal Government still in office in Germany has gone along with it."
"We, the MEPs belonging to the CDU and CSU, will be consistent and reject a Common Position that does not guarantee subsidiarity."
"Let us protect the sun from the European Union and its mania for rule-making!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the controversy sparked off by this directive is disproportionate and, at the same time, undoubtedly reveals two different approaches to the policy that the EU must conduct on protecting workers’ rights."
"I do not believe, Mr Mann, that protecting workers’ health puts jobs at risk."
"As Mr Őry pointed out, this proposal for a directive is simply the fourth part of a set of laws on which Parliament and the Council have already expressed opinions and which is aimed, from a health and safety perspective, at protecting workers against the risks connected with exposure to physical agents. As you know, we have already adopted provisions relating to vibrations, noise and electromagnetic fields."
"In the present case, we are led to draw a distinction between radiation from artificial sources and that from natural sources."
"At the same time, however, there is an element of obscurity – if you will excuse the terminology – in your speeches and reasoning concerning health and, in particular, public health policies: you draw no distinction between the risk to which someone – in this instance, a worker – is exposed because of natural rays and that to which he or she is exposed because of artificial radiation."
"Even if the provisions proposed in the common position do in fact take account of the difference between standing in front of a machine and being exposed to solar radiation due to outdoor work, we need specific policies for each eventuality, even if we do consider that, in the end, what has been implemented by the Community under Article 137 of the Single Act should be enough. In other words, we should take steps to ensure that health and safety measures are laid down for the purpose of protecting all EU workers in their work places."
"Not to do so would be to give up, and that is something we cannot do."
"There is a new risk."
"There is data that cannot be ignored from both the World Health Organisation and our national health bodies, showing that the number of cancers linked to exposure to the sun is on the increase."
"It is increasing, in particular, in occupations involving exposure to the sun, something that cannot be explained merely in terms, for example, of the variables of holidays and other free time."
"There is exposure to the sun in the construction, civil engineering and tourist industries."
"Police in charge of security are also very often out of doors."
"A much longer list of the occupations concerned could be drawn up."
"We therefore have a responsibility, and the proposal being made is reasonable inasmuch as it takes account of companies’ need to be able to meet this type of obligation at low cost."
"It is a question of information, training, assessment and prevention."
"It is, in actual fact, a question of laying down obligations for employers, because the fact is, workers are dependent upon their employers."
"Some people maintain that the proposal is too precise and that the Community and the European Union will make themselves look ridiculous."
"My own observation is that, in the economic field, legislation can never be too precise."
"When it comes to financial regulations, the internal market or the banking sphere, we are adept at voting in favour of precise standards."
"The point is, we need, I think, also to be capable of being precise when it comes to people’s health."
"We do not agree with the notion whereby European standards and rules have to be compulsory in the economic field but whereby subsidiarity and opt-out clauses need systematically to be invoked when it comes to social rights and to the protection of workers’ health."
"That is why we do not want the content of this legislation to be distorted and why, where prevention and the provision of information are concerned, we want all EU workers to be offered standards such as will help combat the development of skin cancer."
"Mr President, I – like most of the other speakers – would like to concentrate on natural optical radiation, or sunlight."
"Essentially, we need to strike a balance between the health and safety of workers and the temptation to over-legislate – to be too prescriptive – and to override the principle of subsidiarity and attempt a ‘one size fits all’ piece of legislation."
"In the last session, when speaking on the Nitrates Directive, I stated that not even the European Parliament can legislate for weather across Europe and I have not changed my mind."
"Therefore, in this context, given the wide variation of climatic conditions across Europe, I consider it appropriate that decisions regarding the health and safety of workers from exposure to sunlight are best taken by the national authorities."
"There is no comparison between the health and safety concerns as a result of exposure to sunlight, for instance, between a Nigerian worker on an Irish building site and an Irish worker on a Greek building site."
"However, this is not an issue to be ignored, and employers have a real responsibility – primarily, I believe, by means of awareness raising – as regards practical preventative measures, whereby employees who work outdoors can make informed choices about their exposure to sunlight and the need to take practical precautions to protect themselves."
"– Mr President, I would like to remind the House that the minimum health and safety requirements applicable to the workplace are already defined as a European competence by the Single European Act, and that employers have been obliged, since as long ago as 1989, to carry out risk assessments, train workers and inform them, providing protective equipment when necessary and keeping documentation relating to these measures."
"The specialised directive with which we are concerned today does no more than lay down the framework for these measures, and does so in a balanced and appropriate manner, including in those situations in which we cannot keep tabs on the source, and so I cannot for the life of me understand why the employers’ associations are opposed to such legal certainty."
"After all, the only alternatives they have are to resort to simple actions such as the provision of notices or up-to-date information on health risks or else to run the risk of court rulings recognising occupational illnesses."
"I cannot understand why they do not go for the cheaper option, and so I regard the CSU amendment as making for greater legal uncertainty and as detrimental particularly to small businesses."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Őry for all his hard work."
"I should also like to thank him for his cooperation on this report, which I had the opportunity to discuss with him as shadow rapporteur for our group."
"I agree with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten that the debate on this report has gone on too long, and that it has been sensationalised by certain press outlets as a result of a lack of clarity in the Commission’s and Council’s positions."
"There is no doubt in my mind that the protection of workers from health risks arising from optical radiation is a matter that should be regulated at EU level."
"After all, such an approach also reflects the findings of the report which I tabled on health protection at work, and which the House adopted some time ago."
"As one of the previous speakers noted, the World Health Organisation has reported that the number of people dying of skin cancer is in the thousands."
"This means that there is a clear need to afford greater protection to workers who are exposed to optical radiation, in particular from natural sources."
"I fail to understand the logic of those Members who wish to exclude natural radiation, and I am likewise opposed to those amendments aimed at allowing employers to decide for themselves whether or not to raise their employees’ awareness about optical radiation and to protect them from it."
"Protecting workers is not cheap, but it is indispensable if we genuinely wish to improve health protection at work."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by adding my own thanks to Mr Őry, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job of work."
"Which way do we want Europe to go?"
"We are experiencing a constitutional crisis."
"We are going through a financial crisis."
"People no longer understand Europe."
"We have to make every effort to get the public back on board."
"The proposed rules on natural radiation in the Common Position will do the precise opposite, being a classic example of excessive regulation and the bureaucratic approach."
"They bear no relation to the European Union’s efforts at deregulation."
"The Commission and the Council are always talking about better lawmaking as a means towards more growth and job creation in the EU."
"My concept of ‘better regulation’, though, is a rather different one; it is that it is with regulations such as these that we must make a start."
"With their requirements for protection against the sun, the Council and the Commission are shooting well wide of the mark."
"The mere fact that a variety of climate conditions prevail in the EU means that there are also many practical considerations militating against a Europe-wide regulation of this kind."
"I do not believe that protecting workers from the sun should be treated with the same importance in Finland as in Spain or Greece."
"We are taking responsibility away from the people of Europe; whatever happened to workers’ personal responsibility?"
"How, moreover, can it be determined whether sunburn was sustained during leisure or at work?"
"What about the problem of liability if employers carry out the comprehensive risk assessments in relation to the sun’s rays, which this directive will finally impose?"
"Let me give you another brief example."
"I had a discussion with a workplace safety and protection officer, who told me how he had stood beside a worker, next to whom was a metre-high jet of flame."
"He asked the worker why he did not put the flame out, to which the reply was: ‘you are the one who is responsible for safety in the workplace’."
"That is an example of why we need to give workers a sense of being responsible for themselves."
"Tomorrow, we in this House will be able to indicate our desire for the dismantlement of bureaucracy and for deregulation, and to send a message to the effect that we have learned something from the referenda in France and the Netherlands."
"Like Mr Mann, Mr Bushill-Matthews, and many other MEPs, I have tabled amendments aimed at removing the sun from the scope of the directive."
"I ask you to support our amendments or at least the compromise adopted in the Committee."
"We must regain the trust of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my own country, we have, for several weeks, had to watch CDU/CSU parliamentarians making a truly grotesque attempt at using this directive on optical radiation for their own purposes in the German election."
"The amendment tabled by Mr Ferber and Mr Nassauer, with its aim of rejecting the Common Position as a whole, now marks the climax of this campaign, and it is truly a sad sight."
"One might have expected an amendment like this from the British Tories, but not from the CDU/CSU; with it, these Members are expressing their opposition to workplace protection in the EU as a whole, and it has to be said that their putting it up for grabs also runs counter to their former position on workplace protection."
"The CDU/CSU voted in favour of all three of the other workplace protection directives; it supported all of them."
"Can someone perhaps explain to me why they want to improve the protection of workers in the workplace from hazards arising from vibration, noise and electromagnetic radiation, but not from those resulting from optical radiation?"
"To Mrs Weisgerber I have to say that anyone who refers, in the title of their press release, to a ‘sunshine directive’, is consciously aiming to misinform."
"You are well aware, Mrs Weisgerber, that this directive is primarily concerned with protection from artificial radiation, but you have nothing to say about that; instead, you take natural radiation and fabricate a bogeyman, hypocritically prating about being close to the citizens."
"All this is obliging employers to inform their workers about the health risks associated with sunlight, a point reiterated with great clarity by our PSE Group’s two amendments."
"Whether – and, if so, how – the workers protect themselves again the sun’s rays in practice is still left to them alone to decide."
"The handing out of notice sheets is surely not too much to ask."
"In the past, doing that sort of thing got a lot done on the workplace protection front."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament also want to allow the Member States to define their own specific criteria for how the risk assessment is to be carried out."
"That does indeed take proper account of subsidiarity, but what we Socialists cannot go along with is workplace protection in Europe."
"Mr President, I echo the remarks of Mr Hughes: this measure has been used by the small-minded, anti-European factions within this House to whip up confusion rather than to legislate sensibly, as nobly demonstrated by Mr Helmer, who made a speech full of nonsense and half-truths, then left, presumably to sit in the midday sun somewhere."
"No serious person would question the desirability of protecting workers from skin cancer."
"In Scotland, despite our northern latitude, this is a serious and pressing issue."
"The question for us is whether the inclusion of sunlight within this measure would achieve it."
"The inclusion of natural light renders, sadly, the sensible proposals within this package unworkable, legally difficult to enforce and practically difficult to manage."
"I am glad to hear the rapporteur mention subsidiarity."
"Hopefully, if all else fails it will allow a greater degree of common sense to be brought through in the application of this measure."
"The Scottish National Party is concerned that these measures, while laudable in aim, will not achieve the desired result."
"Rather, we fear that the inclusion of sunlight in this package will add to the burden upon farmers, fishermen, foresters, businesses in general and others, without necessarily achieving the desired health effects."
"We believe that there is a need to legislate in this area."
"We do not accept that this is the way to do it."
"Mr President, I am sorry that the Commissioner himself cannot be with us today, but I understand he has to be in China."
"I hope the sun is shining upon him there and that he is being instructed to cover up well."
"The previous part-session, in July, was the first attended by the UK as Presidency of the Council."
"We were promised many things: the new Presidency was going to simplify the burdens on business, reduce red tape and provide leadership to make the EU more relevant to the people."
"The whole House, including this side of the House, should support such an agenda if, indeed, it happens."
"This is the first part-session since then, the first chance for all of us to judge the UK Presidency on whether it means what it says."
"Today the judgement is already becoming clear, because what we have on the agenda is more red tape, not less: we have a directive that calls for businesses to record how much the sun is shining."
"The UK Presidency is trying to downplay this whole directive, claiming that it is all very straightforward and that the fuss is far-fetched."
"If that were true, why have I and my colleagues been getting increasingly frantic messages from organisations and individual companies of all sizes, in such major industries as agriculture, horticulture, construction, tourism and hospitality?"
"They have not taken their information from so-called 'misleading press releases' – despite the predictable spin from Mr Hughes and his Socialist colleagues – but straight from the directive."
"They are not just imagining problems for the sake of it; they are detailing specific problems in the common position that the Council simply did not foresee when it nodded it through."
"The Presidency in particular should have very red faces now, though I suspect not from sunburn."
"Our role in this House is clearly to help shape EU legislation that is appropriate and proportionate."
"In its current form, this proposal is neither."
"If the UK Presidency will not give a lead, our political group will."
"We have tabled amendments to throw out the common position completely, to remove all references to natural sunlight and to get some sense back into this directive."
"We are glad to have support from many of the Liberal Democrats, as well as from other political groups."
"However, this whole House should give out the message loud and clear."
"People do not want politicians to protect them from sunlight; increasingly, people simply want to be protected from politicians."
"Mr President, employers have always treated workers’ need for protection as if it were a trifling thing."
"Not only, for example, did it take decades to get occupational illnesses recognised as such, but the provision and wearing of ear protectors in training establishments was not, for a long time, regarded as health protection either, and now artificial and optical radiation, something of such great importance to workers has become a fit topic for polemics by the redtop press."
"Where this proposal for a directive on optical radiation is concerned, we should go back to what the Council proposed."
"It is no more than a polemical trick to compare natural sunlight with a sunbed."
"There is, after all, a difference between a worker being exposed to extreme solar radiation for the whole of the day, and a person doing some sunbathing – which, if they are sensible, will be for a brief period of time."
"In considering these things, we have to bear in mind the demonstrable sharp increase in the risk of skin cancer in Europe, a risk taken by building workers, forestry workers and other workers exposed to the sun in the open air."
"Requiring employers and health and safety officers to provide information on extreme weather conditions when these occur is surely not to demand disproportionate expenditure on their part, and is something that should be taken seriously."
"Greater legal certainly also makes perfect sense from the point of view of both worker protection and insurance and is a necessity."
"It might be added that Members of this House should, where workers are concerned, be guided in their decision-making by an awareness of their problems rather than by ignorance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying something about procedure."
"We are dealing here with a piece of the European Parliament’s legal history, for it was in 1992 that the Commission came to a decision on the subject, and today finds us debating it at – and let me stress this – its reading."
"When we vote on it, as we will do tomorrow, we will be bound by the rule that a majority is required to reject or amend it."
"Speaking as someone who was not even an MEP at the time of its first reading, I have to say that I find it intolerable that neither the Commission nor the Council are similarly bound in the case of a proposal made at a time when most of us were not yet MEPs."
"Even though the Rules of Procedure permit it, I was not able to table any amendments in the Committee."
"That is why we should all press for such curiosities to be done away with."
"It is also a reason why the CDU/CSU has tabled this motion for the directive to be rejected; we did so not because we reject justified measures in relation to unnatural optical radiation, but in order to call on the Commission to come up with a proposal that would be credible in terms of the Constitution and of Lisbon."
"President Barroso and his colleagues always get carried away when analysing the reasons why the Constitution was rejected, and regularly invoke the Lisbon objectives."
"If you put them on the spot on the subject of regulation and directives, the line they take is: ‘the sunshine directive?"
"I was not in office at the time’."
"At the same time, though, there is no shortage of officials in the Commission who quite simply ignore whatever their bosses say."
"Better regulation?"
"Of what interest is that to those to whom the protection of consumers is entrusted, those who are supposed to take action to deal with this?"
"For them, it is ‘business as usual’."
"In Germany, this is not an issue for only one end of the political spectrum;"
"I would just like to remind Mrs Jöns of the President of the German Council of Cities."
"This may have passed her by during the summer recess, but, in any case, the President of the German Council of Cities, who is also at the same time the Lord Mayor of Munich, and, as she will be aware, a member of the SPD, has held up the sunshine directive to ridicule."
"We see, then, that there is in Germany a broad political consensus to the effect that we are in favour of rules that are practicable."
"The compromise would take us closer to them."
"The motion for rejection calls upon the Commission to come up with something better; if it is not passed, I call upon you to at least support the compromise motion."
"Mr President, I think that the right-of-centre Members of the Chamber are trying to make light of a generally serious matter."
"Protection of workers’ health and safety is at the heart of a social Europe."
"This directive is precisely an attempt to improve workers’ conditions by emphasising all the dangers to health to which workers are exposed in the work place as a result of optical radiation."
"Sunlight presents a risk to the many people who work out of doors every day."
"There have been seven times as many cases of skin cancer in the last 30 years, and it is beyond doubt that the risk of contracting skin cancer is far higher for those employed in, for example, the construction sector or agriculture."
"That is the reality to which we have to respond, and those are the figures that make it our duty to demand that, in future, employers inform their workers as to how they are to protect themselves against the sun’s dangerous rays."
"Radiation in the work place is dangerous, and there is a need for common European rules."
"The Commission has been given the task of describing all the risks to which workers are exposed in working life."
"The sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays endanger people and naturally need to feature in the directive."
"For workers, cancer is no less real whether caused by natural or artificial radiation."
"Workers naturally have a responsibility for their own health and safety."
"We demand only that employers also accept their share of responsibility."
"We have found a solution that does not overburden employers and that includes worker protection."
"We can only interpret right-of-centre opposition as another attempt to renationalise labour market legislation."
"It is an entirely incomprehensible point of view, which will distort competition within the EU’s borders."
"There must be common European rules."
"That is the only way in which we can guarantee decent conditions for all European wage earners."
"Mr President, the Commissioner stated that exposure limit values for natural radiation were not deemed to be feasible, and I want to emphasise that point."
"I want to begin by asking the Commissioner to indicate very clearly what the Commission's views are on this debate, on the amendments and on what has happened in the various committees."
"It would have been helpful if we had known your mind before we started, Commissioner, because we are speaking in a vacuum."
"Maybe you agree with what this or that side is saying, but we would like to know where you stand."
"As I see it, we have a good piece of legislation: the framework directive requesting employers to mitigate health risks for employees."
"None of us disagree with that."
"We have already dealt with vibration, noise, electro-magnetic fields and now we are faced with optical radiation."
"I agree with it – it is a good piece of legislation – with the sole exception of the inclusion of solar radiation."
"We need legal certainty in the field of employment, both for employers and employees."
"There is no legal certainty in the area of risk assessment for exposure to solar radiation in the workplace, and it is a legal certainty that in a litigious age it will end up as a lawyers' charter, and nothing else."
"If I choose to spend 10 hours on a beach on Saturday or Sunday, or 10 hours in the garden at 80 degrees exposed to the sun, or on the golf course in very hot sunshine, all the health authorities would say that it was far too long."
"What colleagues have said about skin cancer is absolutely true."
"But if I choose to spend my leisure time taking excess exposure to the sun, then go into the workplace on a Monday, say, and I am working on a construction site, or in the fields, in a vineyard, at a sports venue, beside a swimming pool or wherever, and I am already overexposed through lack of personal responsibility at the weekend, is it my employer's duty to ensure that I should not have any extra exposure to the sun on the Monday?"
"Two hours might be too much in that case, let alone four hours."
"If I am a red-haired, fair-skinned Irish person, two hours' sunshine is the maximum I should get, and with proper coverage from the sun, with a hat, covering up my skin and wearing protection."
"But if I am a dark-haired, brown-eyed, dark-skinned southern European, I could spend six or seven hours in the sunshine to no effect at all."
"What do the employers do, line up their employees on a Monday morning and check their skin types and whether they have been overexposed at the weekend?"
"Or check whether they have been toasted on both sides at Torremolinos during the previous fortnight when they were on holiday and say 'Sorry, you can't go in the sun this week at all'?"
"It is impossible to operate."
"We want legal certainty."
"We want to leave personal responsibility to the individual."
"Yes, we want informed choices from a health point of view – everybody, not just employees, should be informed of the risks to over-exposure – but please, say to President Barroso for all of us, that, if he is serious about Lisbon-proofing regulation and about less regulation being better regulation, then we do not need this nanny-type regulation and solar radiation must be removed from the directive."
"It cannot be left to Member States, since there is a legal problem, I understand."
"Risk assessment cannot be left to each Member State under the terms of framework Directive 89/391, because it is a Community competence only."
"Please tell us what the options are and where you stand on this, Commissioner."
"Mr President, common sense seems to have abandoned the PPE-DE Group and the Liberals on this issue."
"The controversy has focused on a single section relating to a requirement to provide information to workers about cancer risks."
"The media, of course, have had a field day, fed by people who should know better, like Ms Lynne."
"I have heard no-one here today deny that overexposure to sunlight is dangerous and can be deadly, yet we have these games being played."
"The right – both Europhiles and Europhobes – have used this issue as a wedge in their campaign to renationalise health and safety regulations, ignoring the fact that, in an open, competitive economy, if you do not have European regulation, you will have no regulation."
"That would inevitably lead to protectionism, which is already raising its ugly head following the French and Dutch referendums."
"Provision of information on cancer risks to outdoor workers is not a burden on employers; it is an investment in a healthy workforce."
"Mr President, the Commission and the Council are aware that protection against risks from natural sources should be the subject of differential treatment, and the common position reflects this difference."
"I shall therefore explain in detail the Commission’s position on the amendments."
"I very much wish firstly to thank Parliament for its work and for the debate that has taken place."
"During the long and difficult legislative process, the Commission has been keen to do everything to ensure that this document still offers a high level of protection for workers, while avoiding discriminating between workers exposed to similar risks, and that it does so in compliance with framework Directive 89/391 and while ensuring the necessary proportionality."
"The aim has been to enable a compromise acceptable to all the institutions concerned to be reached by the end of the process."
"The Commission is not, then, able to accept what is stated, particularly in a number of newspapers, to the effect that the text of the common position is the result of a fruitless exercise, likely to give Europeans an image of the European Union as something sterile and bureaucratic."
"The Commission thinks that the common position is a balanced text responding to the real dangers constituted by the eye diseases and skin cancers, or melanomas, that are an issue for all Europeans and thinks that it is perfectly in keeping with the terms of the European Parliament’s recent resolution on the promotion of health and safety."
"Obviously, ways must be found of avoiding what could be pointless burdens on our companies and, as many have emphasised, on small and medium-sized companies in particular."
"Amendments 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 36 on the one hand emphasise the need for early detection of health effects and, on the other hand, specify the level of qualifications required by those responsible for medical surveillance."
"The Commission is able to accept these amendments."
"The Commission is also able to accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 34 and 35."
"They improve the text and reinforce and clarify the meaning of the provision concerned."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept, as they stand, Amendments 5, 7 and 37 which propose giving each Member State the competence to legislate on the appropriateness, or otherwise, of employers assessing the risks in the case of exposure to natural sources of radiation."
"Beyond the considerations of protecting workers’ health to which I referred a few moments ago, such provisions would, in fact, be contrary to the obligations imposed on employers by framework Directive 89/391 to take account of all the risks and to make an assessment of the risks in all cases."
"Adopting these amendments – and I would lay some stress upon this, since it is an important point of law – would involve something of a transfer of responsibility from the employer to the national legislator."
"Where employment law and working conditions are concerned, this would, I believe, pose a real problem and would not, in my opinion, make the task an easy one for countries to carry out."
"I would therefore emphasise this point."
"Similarly, and even if it understands the reasons that may lie behind them, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 18 in favour of rejecting the common position, Amendments 21 and 24 that exclude, in particular, taking account of particularly vulnerable risk groups or the effects of interaction with photosensitive substances, and the full range of Amendments 19 to 23 and 25 to 33 which exclude optical radiation from natural sources from the scope of the directive."
"The Commission intends working with Parliament and the Council to find a solution enabling the directive to be adopted as soon as possible."
"Regarding Amendments 4 and 13, which introduce a provision asking it to draw up a practical guide, the Commission is ready to examine the best way of responding to this. At the same time, it is concerned to avoid procedures that might impair the wording of Community legislation governed by an interinstitutional agreement."
"So there we have it, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The Commission wants the amendments that will be adopted tomorrow to enable the text of the new directive entirely to fulfil the objectives laid down by Article 137 of the Treaty when it comes to workers’ health and social protection."
"I would take the liberty of emphasising personally the quality of the compromise arrived at. This has been done by differentiating properly between sources of risk and by authorising – in a simple way, I believe, particularly for risks arising from natural sources – a number of precautionary measures of which it will be a simple matter to remind workers in the interests of their health and which thus complete the provisions enabling the health of workers in Europe to be protected and to be so without our entering into a wealth of detail and complications."
"That is why, Mr President, I think that this compromise genuinely deserves Parliament’s undivided attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon."
"The eye is responsible for the largest share of human perception, so it is understandable that injury to the eye or loss of vision is among one of the most serious of all physical impairments."
"The fundamental interests of workers demand that this directive should come into being as soon as possible."
"We all have an interest in the adoption of this report."
"From our point of view, this is a technical matter and in such instances there is always a good chance of reaching a consensus."
"In the course of the debate, however, some technical reservations have been voiced."
"Knowledge of the risks, use of protective equipment and strict compliance with safety regulations are essential, not only for visual protection but for health protection in all its other aspects as well."
"The range of occupational hazards is extremely broad, and the risk of harmful health effects and of developing chronic diseases is considerable."
"Sunshine is a natural phenomenon that is notoriously difficult to legislate on, and some Member States of the European Union do not have very much of it at all."
"We must also take into account that the directive should provide Member States with the broadest possible opportunity, on as many issues as possible, to formulate for themselves, at national level – in consultation with the social partners and within the framework set by the directive – legislation that best suits their given circumstances."
"There should not be over-regulation, but a balance between the safety of workers and the realities of a given country’s economic and fiscal situation."
"We can and will change the overly bureaucratic approach, but protecting health must always be the primary focus of our efforts."
"The next item is the report (A6-0199/2005) by Mrs Jöns, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity – PROGRESS [COM(2004)0488 – C6-0092/2004 – 2004/0158(COD)]."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will begin by warmly thanking your rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for having carried out a high-quality piece of work and by also thanking the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, Mrs Figueiredo."
"The future PROGRESS programme will play a decisive role in the development of social Europe."
"In this context, it aims to bring together the four Community action programmes on which the implementation of the social policy agenda up to 2006 is based, as well as a series of budget headings concerning working conditions."
"The proposed approach will contribute to simplifying the instruments, both in legal terms and from the point of view of managing them, and to rationalising the budget structure."
"It will also enhance the clarity, visibility, coherence and consistency of the instruments and will prevent overlaps."
"The Commission has always been very keen to ensure that the revised text preserves this simplification and this rationalisation."
"That was the case with the initial proposal, and the majority of the amendments that Parliament has seen fit to suggest are also directed to this end."
"I would be pleased, Mr President, to listen to Parliament’s observations, standing in once again for Mr Špidla, who has been detained by the EU-China Summit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like at the outset to reiterate my thanks to my fellow-members of the Committee for their constructive cooperation, but would also like to thank the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective, which has played a substantial part in ensuring, not only that PROGRESS is now a good instrument for the better implementation of the social policy agenda, but also that we will have enough money to be able to really ensure greater sustainability."
"PROGRESS represents a response to the results of the Eurobarometer surveys, for what the public wants is greater involvement on the part of the EU in the combating of unemployment and poverty."
"For that, though, a primary requirement is for well-organised and structured sharing of experience, with it being particularly necessary that we should promote to a far greater degree the process of learning from one another, whether by supporting European networks, setting in motion Europe-wide studies and analyses or even by means of conferences."
"This is the only way in which we will succeed in maintaining, in future, the highest possible level of social protection throughout Europe, on which, after all, the maintenance of a peaceful society and social cohesion in the European Union depends."
"That is something that the Member States now, at last, appear to have realised."
"Let me now turn to the Commission proposal, to which we have proposed a range of improvements and additions."
"The improvements primarily have to do with an increase in the overall appropriations and certain changes to the way in which they are distributed among the various areas targeted."
"What this boils down to is that we have now voted PROGRESS EUR 225 million more than the Commission originally allocated it, and I might also mention that this sum takes estimated inflation into account."
"There was one of the fields to which the PROGRESS programme applies for which we, together with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, had to fight particularly hard, and that was gender mainstreaming."
"Without wanting to reopen old wounds, I have to say that I am firmly convinced that, if there are in future to be no more officially free-standing action programmes to promote equality of opportunity, reinforcing this in all areas to which the programme relates and measures taken under it is what is needed to win over the Women’s Committee."
"Moreover, our Committee was not prepared to accept the cuts in the resources set aside for gender mainstreaming that the Council and the Commission sought."
"We are reversing many of these cuts, but, rather than taking the money away from other important target areas, we have done this by voting to make the very high flexibility margin of 10% less rigid and thus make it possible for the share allocated to gender equality to be increased by 4% to its present 12% share of the budget for PROGRESS."
"The Committee also regards five points in this programme as being particularly important, and I expect the Commission to support us in this."
"For a start, we want to make the individual target areas more visible, which means that the programme committee needs to have five sub-committees, and also needs to organise for each target area an annual exchange of views on the way in which the programme is put into effect, enabling each of these committees to join with the specialist committees in this House in debating it."
"Secondly, we want the transnational exchange to be maintained in future, for that alone will provide Europe with the added value that we want, and, thirdly, we want PROGRESS to help to really get the experience gained from the programme circulated among the Member States faster than the current programmes have done."
"We in this Parliament do of course now want – and this is my fourth point – to be more closely involved in monitoring the programme."
"As I see it, the mere fact that the programme is to run for seven years makes this an absolute necessity."
"We therefore believe that the distribution of the annual funding around the individual target areas should not be a responsibility for the programme committee but rather a matter for the Budget procedure each year."
"That brings me to my last point, the role of the social partners and non-governmental organisations."
"The Committee found the Commission’s desire to limit their role to no more than the pursuit of the EU’s objectives incomprehensible."
"We regard their involvement in the ongoing development of strategies as indispensable."
"The possibility of participation in PROGRESS must also be open to national and regional non-governmental organisations."
"It therefore follows that the maximum co-funding should continue to stand at 90% and not at something like 80%, which would be a cause of major difficulties to many EU networks."
". – One of the most controversial aspects of this proposal to set up the new Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity – PROGRESS – is that equality between men and women has been lumped into one single social programme, when the issue is not merely a social one."
"Accordingly, in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we have sought to strike a balance between the need to raise the profile of the struggle for genuine equality between men and women and the Commission’s proposal, bringing action on the ground and the existing directives closer together."
"Against this backdrop, the creation of the European Gender Institute is of major importance; it should be granted greater powers and its own financial resources, more so than the Commission is currently proposing."
"Most of the proposals that we adopted in the Committee on Women’s Rights have been addressed, at least in part, in the report by Mrs Jöns, whom I congratulate on her work."
"I should like to highlight the following points: the increase in cofinancing to a 90% ceiling, in light of the difficulties experienced by NGOs and other social organisations working in these areas; the increase in the financial framework to EUR 854.2 million for the seven-year period from 2007; and the change in the financial allocation between the different strands."
"This programme must effectively address the question of the protection and social inclusion of immigrants, the disabled, the unemployed, children and young people, and the elderly, along with issues such as working conditions, the fight against discrimination, and the promotion of diversity."
"I wish to stress, however, that gender mainstreaming and the issue of equality between men and women must be incorporated into all strands and measures forming part of the PROGRESS Programme and all programmes using Community funds, in order to prevent women from being victims of repeated discrimination and to prevent any backsliding on the policy of equality between men and women across a broad spectrum of areas."
". Mr President, I would like first of all to address Mrs Jöns in order to congratulate her on her excellent report on PROGRESS."
"I am equally delighted by the quality of the debates we have had in committee and by the very interesting compromise amendments, of which I would specifically like to point out the following."
"I believe that interesting amendments have been made to the Commission’s text, particularly with regard to Parliament’s role itself."
"It should be recognised, Commissioner, that the Commission’s initial text treated us somewhat as the poor relation when it came to the evaluations of a programme actually extending over seven years (2007-2013)."
"I think it is worth remembering what the Commission was proposing concerning the role of Parliament, namely the simple forwarding to Parliament of an ex post evaluation focused on the entire programme, an evaluation drafted by the Commission one year after the programme’s conclusion."
"I believe that the proposals being submitted by the Commission respond to the need for Parliament to intervene directly and throughout the entire seven-year period covered by such an important programme. They are also particularly acceptable to the Commission."
"Secondly, through the use of compromise amendments, Mrs Jöns has drawn attention to the particularly important role of non-governmental organisations and of social organisations."
"Everyone will be in agreement in recognising that, from a national and transnational perspective, these organisations play a particularly important role in the framework of the specialised networks belonging to them at EU level."
"It is therefore only natural that they should participate in devising, implementing and monitoring the programme."
"It is equally clear that promoting the direct exchange of experiences can ensure a greater understanding of the individual nature of events taking place in different countries; it is, moreover, only in this way that exchanges on strategies, good practices and innovative strategic approaches will bear fruit and endow the evaluations with the quality scientific approach they require."
"I will say one final word on financial and budgetary matters since they remain the core issue."
"It should be pointed out that the sum of EUR 628 million, proposed by the Commission, falls well short of the amount recommended in the Böge report on the financial and budgetary package for 2007-2013."
"I would like in particular to emphasise that the success of the PROGRESS programme essentially depends on the amount awarded to it, and it is clear that the amount proposed by the Commission is by no means acceptable."
"Mr President, I too wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for what is, typically, an extremely good report."
"We have taken a positive view of this proposal concerning PROGRESS and the amalgamation of the previous four programmes."
"This may mean better coordination, less overlap and more efficient use of expenditure."
"Amalgamation is therefore to be welcomed."
"The programme has a role to play in the Lisbon strategy that is, of course, not only about competitiveness but also about a social Europe and a less stratified society."
"It is a fact that unemployment is too high at present."
"Social protection systems and social integration do not operate in ways that are entirely satisfactory."
"Gender equality is not always to be seen, and there is still discrimination."
"This programme is therefore extremely important."
"I wish to comment on a number of aspects also addressed by the rapporteur."
"Firstly, the pooling of experience, including transnational experience."
"It is incredibly important to make the most of the programme’s innovative character, for, at national level, we conduct labour market policies."
"These programmes must be creative and innovative and be extended across national borders so that everyone might benefit from what is being done through different projects."
"Secondly, gender equality should not just be applied specifically in one area. Instead, it must permeate all parts of the programmes and of PROGRESS."
"I also wish to emphasise the accessibility aspects."
"Disabled people are now excluded from the labour market to a greater extent and have more difficulty being integrated into society."
"It is therefore important for the accessibility aspects, broadly understood, to be integrated into, and taken account of in, all parts of the programme so that disabled people can participate in the labour market."
"The same applies to the social integration of people who come from other parts of the world and who are not part of the labour market."
"I myself have experience of working in Sweden on the Swedish programme."
"I wish to emphasise what the rapporteur too mentioned, namely that both sides of industry, as well as non-governmental organisations, must be involved in the whole of the work, designing, implementing and supervising the programmes."
"They will be a major resource in the work being done firmly to establish these programmes at national and regional levels."
"The financial aspects have already been touched upon."
"The Commission’s proposal would make far too few resources available and is too old-fashioned."
"Social Europe is an area on which we must concentrate when we create the long-term budget."
"That is why the proposal by the committee responsible, put forward here in Parliament and recommending more resources, is to be preferred."
"Now, the subject of a social Europe has been taken up by the British Presidency."
"In this context, the need for a properly resourced PROGRESS programme should also be evaluated."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for the excellent job she has done, as well as all the groups and my colleagues in the committee, who have helped, through the amendments they have tabled, to improve an initiative that we are very pleased with."
"In my view, the greatest merit of the PROGRESS programme as part of simplification and rationalisation efforts is the renewal of a commitment to priorities that are crucial for achieving the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives, by providing instruments that are appropriate, albeit not fully balanced."
"When we talk of investment in aspects such as human resources, training, employment services, efforts to achieve higher employment rates, the promotion of crucial qualitative and quantitative employment levels and at the same time an agenda for social cohesion, we have in mind objectives that should not be seen solely as a compensatory or offsetting appendage to a Lisbon Strategy focused exclusively on the economic sphere, but that form an integral part of it."
"For these very reasons, I believe that it is fundamentally important to propose and plan a reinforcement of the financial framework, but we also place considerable emphasis on the success of this proposal, including the section relating to an increase in the cofinancing ceilings, which are essential in promoting a decisive and determining aspect of the programme: an upgraded role for partnership."
"If the social dimension does not play a leading and decisive role in planning and implementation, commitment from the institutions alone will probably fall short of the objectives."
"Other issues have already been dealt with by other Members, and so I have dwelt on just a few points that, in my view, are crucial for the success of an option that is decisive in the relaunch of European strategies for development and the system’s competitiveness."
"Mr President, I welcome the report by Mrs Jöns and thank her for her work."
"In particular I welcome the emphasis placed on social inclusion, gender mainstreaming, people with disabilities and the role of the NGO sector in this programme."
"I also want to throw my support behind calls for an increase in the financial aid proposed and for a co-financing rate of 90%, rather than 80%, in relation to the role of NGOs and social partners."
"Let us be clear: the current economic strategies are driving more and more people into poverty within the European Union, and our hope is that PROGRESS can help play an important role in the fight against social exclusion."
"The strengthening of gender equality should be supported wholeheartedly by this Parliament, especially those elements which emphasise actions promoting gender equality that aim to combat discrimination and access to employment, career development, pay and training, and that fight the causes of poverty and social exclusion."
"This is a real and immediate issue for women in particular."
"In Ireland, for example, the gender pay gap has substantially increased for women and the gap between men's and women's pay in Ireland is among the largest of any EU Member State."
"Irish women are paid 17% less for the same work as Irish men and, according to a recent report by the Central Statistics Office, one-parent families are three and a half times more likely to experience poverty."
"If we want to see fundamental change within society and bring in this fundamental change in mindsets and conditions, we must support this programme and this report. I will be voting for this."
". Mr President, employment and social solidarity go together."
"The greatest social benefit, the greatest solidarity, is for people to have jobs."
"However, fuller employment will not come about through bureaucratic plans and schemes such as Lisbon, which the rapporteur and others seem to think will help and which is now discredited, surely: halfway through its time span and less than half implemented."
"Employment is encouraged by removing restraints and scrapping regulations."
"I point out again in this House that those countries that have not adopted the euro have the lowest levels of unemployment."
"However, it goes deeper."
"In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in July, David Blunkett, the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said that we must not work against Member States, that different countries have different solutions and that defining best practice is the first step."
"Therefore, we must observe what others do and learn from each other, taking and adapting from each other what suits best."
"We must not conjure up new projects with ever increasing budgets."
"The rapporteur rightly says that red tape must be cut through but is sceptical about the European Union's ability to do so."
"Likewise, David Blunkett said that many regulations were being passed which were impossible to implement."
"Just so: the first measure to be discarded is this well-meaning but artificial attempt to create social solidarity."
"I voted against it in committee and I ask this House to do the same."
"Mr President, I should like to respond briefly to what the last speaker said."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of this programme."
"If we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, if we want jobs for everyone, we must help people to achieve this goal."
"After all, people in employment are best placed to meet their own basic needs."
"That is why it is so important that all those disadvantaged groups know that Europe exists and that it can provide them with support in finding jobs, in gaining extra qualifications, in changing working conditions, and so on, and it is for that reason that I congratulate Mrs Jöns on this report."
"I should like to answer two questions."
"I have just received a note to which I can now respond in my own language."
"The first question is: how do you actually arrive at the amount mentioned in your amendment?"
"The amount that was proposed at the time was EUR 854 million, which was still wishful thinking on the part of Mrs Jöns."
"We then thought that such an amount was not attainable, but we subsequently joined forces and arrived at a final sum of EUR 858 million in Mr Böge’s report."
"That is why we have increased the amount from EUR 854 million to 858 million, and I assume that everyone is agreed on this."
"We have also changed the percentages."
"We wanted to do the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality a favour by setting aside more funds for gender equality and we also wanted to put some money aside for working conditions."
"I think that those issues are worthwhile and that they can redress the balance in PROGRESS to some extent."
"Finally, it is because all those minor incidental programmes do not make life any easier that I am delighted with PROGRESS, which will enable us to channel our money, commitment and energy much more effectively."
"I would therefore support everyone involved in this PROGRESS programme, and I hope that those two amendments tabled by our group will make it past the finishing line."
"Mr President, I warmly support my good friend and colleague, our rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, in her work to strengthen this funding proposal."
"It underpins our European work on the critical issues of discrimination and social exclusion that continue to hold back so many people in our societies."
"If the Lisbon Strategy is to mean more than just words, Parliament is right to expect a significant increase in funding for this area."
"If politicians in Brussels are genuinely worried about disengagement and alienation, as reflected by the votes on the Constitutional Treaty and in other ways, it is right for us to insist that the Commission should strengthen, not weaken, the role of both social partners and of non-governmental organisations in this programme."
"I strongly support combating all forms of discrimination."
"As many colleagues are aware, I have a specific interest in working with the disability movement."
"I would like to remind Parliament and Commission that this is the programme which provides the core funding to enable disabled people, and indeed other groups that are discriminated against, to meet and to represent themselves at European level."
"If we fail to allow this, we exclude the most disadvantaged people from our work in the European Union."
"I remember very well the budget crisis back in 1998, when the funding for such NGOs was called into question in a wholly unjustifiable manner."
"It was resolved at political level by the Member States, on the clear understanding that the work of these organisations on combating discrimination is vital in pushing forward the EU agenda."
"Let that be remembered today."
"I want to reiterate that it is important for these networks to be independent and capable of representing the concerns of their members."
"The Commission too often sees them as agencies for promoting and implementing its work."
"No, they must represent the views and experiences of disadvantaged people themselves."
"I believe in gender mainstreaming, but it should apply to disabled people too, with disabled, not able-bodied, people representing them."
"Our amendments, which provide for adaptations, accommodations and accessibility and include publicity, are absolutely crucial in ensuring that disabled people are involved."
"Finally I want to express support for the small disability organisations for blind and people, or people with intellectual disabilities."
"They too have a right to meet at European level and we should not forget them and try and lump people together in large groups."
"There is room for all organisations, large and small."
"Mr President, esteemed colleagues."
"Solidarity is one of the most fundamental principles of European integration."
"In this regard, the neighbouring Scandinavian countries serve as a good model for my home country Estonia."
"Finland, Sweden and Denmark have some of the highest human development indicators in the world."
"At the same time, they occupy positions at the peak of economic competitiveness."
"In order to achieve the Lisbon development objectives and find an appropriate social model to meet the challenges the European Union will face in the future, we should certainly keep their valuable experiences in mind."
"The decision under discussion, which would establish a programme for employment and social solidarity in the Union, is a substantial step towards the creation of a more uniformly developed social environment in Europe."
"In connection with this, I would like to emphasise that non-governmental organisations can be effective partners to national governments, and as motors of civil society, these are also responsive social indicators."
"In order to increase and improve the progress of this programme, and also its implementation, I, as one of the co-rapporteurs, suggested that the rate of cofinancing should be raised to 90% of the total expenses of NGOs."
"This is a significant measure which will especially help the 10 countries that have most recently joined the European Union to catch up more quickly with the others."
"A prosperous Europe is a goal towards which we all strive."
"Today, the new Member States in particular require support in order to work as equals with the other Members, without eating into the other countries’ budgets."
"We must ensure the stability of democratic processes, and this is directly connected with social stability."
"The measure of raising cofinancing is also important because both the associated candidate countries of the European Union and the western Balkan states included in the process can participate in the programme."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, for her expert work, and also you, my good colleagues, for your attention."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, we agree with Mrs Jöns’ report – and I wish to congratulate her – because we believe that safeguarding high levels of social protection and participation of the workers, at a time when the rules of the market and of profit prevail, is our urgent duty."
"We consider that all workers have the right to work and live in an environment of equality and social cohesion and therefore stress, among other things, that immigrants are not second-class workers or citizens."
"The enjoyment of equal rights and equal opportunities and their social protection and integration are non-negotiable."
"The same also applies to people with disabilities, who must also have access to work and whose social integration must be promoted and confirmed."
"The European Parliament can and must have a fundamental role in the monitoring and application of the PROGRESS programme."
"The citizens of the Union and every person must have the right of participation and of equal opportunity in the society in which they live and this can only be achieved when profit policies do not steal a march on social policies."
"We consider that the PROGRESS programme, with the improvements approved by the relevant committees, including the increase in funding, can at least play a role in safeguarding a certain level of social cohesion by giving work to those who have been socially unprotected in the past and, ultimately, by achieving social protection for all workers without cutting corners and without discrimination."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we should talk not about the PROGRESS programme, but about the PROGRESS programmes, which Europe hopes will develop as a result of your Commission's proposal."
"Efforts to rationalise the funding administered by your Commission are praiseworthy and we hope that they will prove to be successful in achieving greater cohesiveness and avoiding duplication when this new programme is adopted."
"Without ignoring the competence of the Member States, efforts are being made to safeguard the and to apply the open method of coordination in the fields of employment, social protection, the organisation and improvement of working times, the fight against discrimination and gender equality."
"Reducing the number of budget lines from 28 to 2 and harmonising the scope of the four programmes which already exist will, we hope, help to make support for the social and political agenda of the Lisbon Strategy more effective."
"I congratulate the rapporteur because, with her ability to take a balanced view, she accepted all the positive improvements proposed by the committees in their opinions, especially by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for which I acted as shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Ι hope in particular that future provisions adopted by the programme committee, assisted by the four proposed subcommittees, will bring about the required simplification in the use and flexibility in the funding of the programmes, so that the participation of European networks and of national and regional non-governmental organisations becomes a reality, so that transnational cooperation is reinforced and mainstreaming to combat all forms of discrimination and gender discrimination and to reinforce participation by women and people with disabilities becomes a reality, so that the European Employment Strategy, which is the key to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, is helped by the social awareness which will strengthen the PROGRESS programmes."
"This programme is designed, therefore, to support the application of protection and of the fight against social exclusion, especially of minority groups, and improvements to the working environment, supplemented by the provision for combining family life and work so that women are given the opportunity to participate in the workplace."
"We are also hoping for measures to combat all forms of discrimination against immigrants and to integrate them by recognising undeclared work, as proposed by the programme."
"Thank you."
"We hope that the objectives of the programme will be implemented."
"Mr President, one of the fundamental principles of Community law is the equal treatment of women and men."
"All the directives relating to this have made a decisive contribution in improving the position of women, who make up 52% of our population and thus constitute the majority."
"Grateful though I am to Mrs Jöns for having reinforced this aspect of the PROGRESS programme, I do take the view that the amalgamation of the five areas of the social agenda is politically mistaken and must not be allowed to remain unchanged."
"Gender equality should have a free-standing programme of its own."
"There are six arguments in favour of this: firstly, the Constitutional Treaty reinforces equality policy; secondly the equality programme, like the budget for it, was formerly a matter for the Committee on Women’s Rights, and quite rightly too."
"Thirdly, the awaited creation of the Gender Institute, gender mainstreaming and a relevant and free-standing equality programme will, in matters of equality policy, make the EU and this House of ours very visible to women; all women will see that Europe is actively working for them."
"Fourthly, the Women’s Committee remains a driving force for the rights of our female citizens and will not agree to those rights being undermined by such things as the planned amalgamation, with effect from 2008, of the DAPHNE anti-violence programme with the programme against drugs, which amounts to an open assault upon women’s policy."
"Fifthly, gender mainstreaming must be consistently applied in all PROGRESS’s pillars, whether in employment, social protection, working conditions or the fight against discrimination, for women are still subject to discrimination in many areas, and, sixthly, what is currently going on runs counter to the Barroso Commission’s commitment to putting equality high up the agenda."
"Although PROGRESS puts women back on the social agenda, pigeonholing them under ‘social issues’, the solution to the equality problem is political in nature."
"We women may have lost the first round, but Parliament’s amendments – and thanks again to Mrs Jöns – have prevented drastic cutbacks in the area of equality of opportunity."
"Let me warn the Commission, though, that, if equality policy becomes even less visible and is taken even less seriously, then support on the part of women will diminish as well."
"PROGRESS depends on them."
"Mr President, the European PROGRESS programme will henceforth encompass the former European Gender Equality programme in the form of a section on equal treatment of men and women."
"I congratulate Mrs Jöns on her report."
"Without doubt, the Lisbon challenges impose the need for an agenda to achieve a rationalised social policy in terms of spending and monitoring."
"Yet, will the new European social policy enable women to gain full recognition for all the functions they perform?"
"Will the value of their work be better recognised by integrating the policy of equality into that of employment?"
"Etymologists set us thinking."
"The origin of the word economy, , house, and , rule, explains that economy is a desire to run a house efficiently."
"In all domestic or professional spheres, in the market or non-market sector, women know how to make use of scarce resources and turn them into something else."
"They know how to satisfy everyone’s needs and desires and to redistribute the outcome of what they produce."
"Around 30% of women’s economic output is not even accounted for."
"That earned the US economist, Gari Becker, a Nobel Prize."
"In my country, behind the Iron Curtain, women did not expect to receive a pay slip, nor unemployment benefit to support those close to them."
"They only worked to ensure their own survival and that of their family."
"Lisbon wishes to fight against impoverishment in Europe and for greater social justice."
"The clearly identified commercial criteria are widely debated here."
"Let us make no mistake, a significant effort remains to be made to identify the work of women, the driving force behind the networks of solidarity, including the economic indicators of our nations’ accounts."
"Solidarity in the economy calls on us to conduct politics in a different way and to establish relations between human beings based on public-spirited and socially aware behaviour that respects everyone’s differences."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the debate on PROGRESS, the new Community programme, is being held at a very important time."
"Firstly, the recently enlarged European Union has as its basic aspiration the difficult objective of economic and social cohesion in today's environment of low development levels and regional and social inequalities."
"Secondly, the European Union is preparing to enlarge towards south-east Europe and to start accession negotiations with Turkey, a large country with serious problems in all sectors."
"These developments relate directly to our political plans and to our financial perspectives."
"Thirdly, the social problems of European citizens which the PROGRESS programme is designed to combat lie at the heart of speculation about the effectiveness of our social model and the credibility and viability of the European Union."
"For these reasons, we expect a great deal of the PROGRESS programme in terms of its structure, its collective and coordinating character, its adequate funding, the potential to mobilise social and economic agencies and, more specifically, to give numerous agencies at national and regional level the chance to participate, because we must not forget that our administration to date is making European citizens say that we are supporting and cooperating with the professionals of the European programmes and not the real, basic protagonists."
"I should like in particular to highlight the need to integrate the gender factor into all sectors in which action is taken, in all evaluations and reviews, both interim and annual, of the PROGRESS programme, as the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality emphasises in its opinion."
"We have a great deal of experience in the European Union today from the application of equality programmes at Community and national level."
"At the same time, women have a great many problems in connection with discrimination, unemployment, poverty and exclusion."
"We therefore need to work in the new framework which we have before us, in the PROGRESS programme, with political perspicacity and appropriate administrative mechanisms, in order to respond to the aspirations of women and resolve their problems."
". Mr President, I thank Parliament for this interesting and important debate."
"I am delighted that the opinion adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs shares with the Commission’s proposal the same desire to simplify and to rationalise, and I would like to say a few words about the Commission’s position with regard to certain major amendments."
"Having regard to Amendment 55 on the inclusion of regional and national non-governmental organisations as potential beneficiaries of the programme, the Commission stresses that this support for national and regional NGOs has not been ruled out."
"Nevertheless, the Commission wished to send a signal to clearly indicate that the programme is first and foremost aimed at NGOs organised at EU level, as they bring a higher degree of added value."
"As regards increasing the financial envelope of the programme, Amendments 66 and 73 together with dividing the funds among the various sections of the programme and the flexibility reserve provided for Amendments 67 and 74 the Commission is not opposed to a debate on these issues but, at this stage, it is not amending its initial proposal and is waiting for an overall agreement on the financial perspectives."
"Having regard to Amendment 59, which divides the Committee into five subcommittees corresponding to the five sections of the programme, the Commission will not change its position with regard to the fact that it wishes to be assisted by only one committee on the PROGRESS programme, even if the members of this committee may change according to the agenda, as is indicated in recital 12a of the amended proposal for a Council decision."
"I am pleased to note that the position of the European Parliament is not very far removed from that of the Commission."
"Inter alia, the amendments aimed at strengthening the role of the European Parliament or, furthermore, at mainstreaming the gender dimension are very much welcomed by the Commission."
"There is no danger that we will lose sight of gender mainstreaming in the new PROGRESS programme; on the contrary, the Commission will ensure that it highlights the aspect of gender which, by being integrated into the new programme, will strengthen the principle of mainstreaming."
"I quite understand the concerns expressed in the draft opinion of Parliament; that is why the Commission will amend its proposal as far as possible in order to respond to this opinion of Parliament."
"Mr President, I will now list the amendments that the Commission can accept in full: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 30, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 46, 47, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62, 63, 68, 69 and 70."
"The Commission can substantially accept the following Amendments, but accept only the spirit of parts of them, and on condition that they are reworded: 4, 11, 14, 18, 22, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 35, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 58, 64, 65 and 71."
"Finally, the Commission must reject Amendments: 9, 16, 23, 33, 38, 50, 51, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 66, 67, 72, 73 and 74."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the quality of its debate on this proposal."
"Thanks to the dialogue between the Commission and the European Parliament, I can say with conviction that the resulting text will take better account of the political objectives of the European Parliament while at the same time having contributed to the effort to simplify and to rationalise, which will be to the advantage of the beneficiaries."
"The PROGRESS proposal submitted to you is essential for implementing the new social agenda."
"This programme will enable us to give financial backing to the instruments we have, such as the open method of coordination, the drafting of legislation and efforts to monitor its application, the exchange of good practices and the action of non-governmental organisations."
"Mr President, that is my conclusion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0202/2005) by Mr Weber, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the application of Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 89/552/EEC ‘Television without frontiers’, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC, for the period 2001-2002 [2004/2236(INI)]."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive is, without doubt, one of the success stories of the European Union."
"In 1989, when the first text was adopted, there were only about 50 television channels in Europe."
"Today, there are 50 times that many."
"The audiovisual landscape has been changed radically by satellite, cable, digital, the Internet and the mobile telephone."
"New media, new broadcasting methods and new services have appeared."
"There is therefore a crucial and urgent need to revise and extend the directive."
"Mrs Reding has announced that she will present these proposals to us in autumn."
"I take advantage of this occasion to congratulate her on her commitment to European television and to thank her for the attention she has clearly given to professionals from the sector."
"I invite her to pay attention to the three parts of this report, to our thoughts on the application of Articles 4 and 5, to the paths we propose for the revision of the Directive and to the significant problem posed by media concentration."
"With regard to Articles 4 and 5, the results are good and these measures must be upheld."
"They are the minimum standards satisfying the most people and it is advisable not to downgrade them, even if pressure is growing to reduce regulation."
"We can, however, propose improvements when it comes to defining the concepts of ‘independent producer’ and ‘work’ or to establishing a more standardised grid of the results of the Member States, for example."
"Revising the directive is not easy."
"We must find the right balance so that the audiovisual sector does not become a purely commercial sector to the detriment of cultural diversity."
"At the same time, however, we must not hinder the development of a sector in the throes of a continuous technical revolution, which is very important for our industries and for our jobs."
"The standards laid down by the directive are minimal as it is, and they have not always prevented a slide towards commercialism and mindlessness in certain Member States."
"Unfortunately, the numerous interviews I have been able to have demonstrate that the general mood is such that the level of regulation will decrease under the combined pressure both of the industries and advertising and also of a number of Member States."
"That is why, together with my colleagues, I call for the legal basis chosen to be one that allows this text to be overseen by the Committee on Culture and Education."
"Without wishing to create hostilities, I am afraid that another committee might tackle this text from a more commercial than cultural angle."
"The proposals that I am submitting are not intended to deviate from the principles of the current Directive, which is based largely on self-regulation and which is not overly prescriptive."
"It does not deviate, either, from the two previous reports by our institution, including the one by my fellow MEP, Mrs Hieronymi."
"This revision of the Directive must enhance a number of fundamental principles: free movement of European television broadcasts, free access to exceptional events, promotion of European works and recent independent productions, protection of minors and public order and protection of consumers thanks to the identification of content providers and to transparency in advertising and the right of reply."
"It must also promote the movement of national works in every country of the Union."
"We produce a great deal. We exchange too little among Europeans."
"We must remedy this shortcoming."
"We must also encourage European content to be shown on television."
"That can of course be promoted through the Media (Plus) programme."
"I would also like us to address the definition of what a work is."
"The ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive indicates what it is not."
"It is not information."
"It is not advertising."
"Yet is it reality TV, for example?"
"I would prefer – as would a number of professionals – an actual definition."
"I could also emphasise the role of public services."
"They must be able to carry out their remit."
"How can we help them to do this?"
"I regret that my fellow MEPs have not followed my proposal for a European Public Audiovisual Service Charter."
"I would also like to invite the Commission to find the means to protect the diversity of television property and to prevent all excessive media concentration."
"Media pluralism is essential in democracy; since the Union keeps telling us that we cannot legislate in that area, it must at least help the Member States to lay down more stringent rules."
"On Tuesday 13 of next week, we are going to hold a seminar on this important issue, in Manchester."
"Since Mrs Reding is listening to us, I would like her to inform us of the developments envisaged by the Commission at this stage of the work, in particular on issues relating to advertising, to the field of application of the directive, to the support measures for the production of European and independent works and to the organisation of the regulation."
"What about adapting the country of origin principle and the principle of media pluralism?"
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Weber for his willingness to engage in dialogue and for seeking agreement."
"I firmly believe that democracy is essentially a system of public opinion and that its quality therefore depends on the quality of what we have come to call freedom of expression, a right that not everybody understands properly."
"For me, freedom of expression is above all the right of each citizen to choose the channels of information he or she prefers."
"Consequently, in order to safeguard that right we must prevent too many media organisations from falling into the hands of a few, and I entirely agree with you, Mr Weber, on the need to combat the phenomena of concentration, but we must also consolidate a situation in which the media are not subjected to criteria laid down on a whim by the government that happens to be in power at the time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe these comments to be very general, and they lead to certain specific considerations which I would like to be implemented in the not too distant future."
"We must combat all initiatives that reduce the quality of freedom of expression."
"It is therefore not acceptable to interfere with the content of programmes."
"Let us stop doing so."
"I do not believe that we should dictate to the commercial television channels how to administer their advertising, because advertising is essential to commercial television. They must respect the limit established by law, but we should not lay down how they must distribute advertising, because they know exactly how to make the source of their commercial survival viable."
"Mr Weber, we must establish the political objective — and this is where we disagree — of putting an end to a concept that I believe to pose certain difficulties: that of public service."
"That concept makes sense insofar as spectral space is limited and the governments must therefore regulate it by means of a system of franchises, which in the end become intimidatory."
"Nevertheless, Mr Weber, you have acknowledged that we are moving towards a world in which television must be redefined, a world in which television means conventional television as we know it, but also television via the Internet, television via mobile phone and television via all the new technologies."
"It is not therefore a scarce resource, and we must restrict State interventionism."
"I hope that in the not too distant future, this concept of public service will no longer be applied to commercial television."
"I would therefore like us to be able to agree on how to redefine the role of public television channels."
"They are fundamental, provided they adhere to the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, that they make the programmes the viewers wish to see and cannot see on the commercial channels."
"Mr Weber, that is the principle of subsidiarity, which I defend."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I believe technologies are changing and that consequently the perspectives are changing too. I also believe it is our responsibility to do our utmost to ensure the new ‘Television without frontiers’ Directive becomes an opportunity to increase the quality of democracy."
"I would therefore like to express my hope that we do a good job."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Weber's report on television without frontiers and I fully support it."
"A proper media policy providing cultural values is crucial to broadening the understanding between our nations."
"When the first legislative act on this subject was approved, my country – Hungary – was not yet a member of the European Communities."
"However, this legislation meets the requirements of our cultural policy."
"As regards this topic, I should like to raise the question: why do we have to regulate the programmes on our television channels?"
"The answer is very simple: because we want to save our national cultures and create a common European identity."
"In order to promote cultural diversity and build up a European identity, we need a stronger exchange of our cultural values, including our cinematographic heritage."
"This new report is a further step in the right direction."
"The so-called quotas generally worked well."
"The cases where they failed to do so should be compiled and studied."
"However, we should give a more precise answer to the question: ‘What is a European production?’"
"How can we ensure that it will consist of as many films with cinematographic values as possible?"
"For me, that is a crucial point."
"I am sure that European cinema helps European people – mainly the young people – to understand each other's sorrows and joys."
"Perhaps having a sub-quota, especially for feature and documentary films, would be an improvement."
"The other question concerns the case of non-domestic productions."
"In smaller countries, such as Hungary, it is not a problem."
"On our television channels, many non-Hungarian and European films are broadcast."
"However, in some larger Member States, there are hardly any non-domestic European programmes."
"As the referendum on the Constitution shows, people from some larger nations hardly know anything about the values of the Central and Eastern European countries or of other smaller Member States."
"The European identity needs and deserves to be reflected, even on the channels of the bigger nations."
"Often our legislation just follows technical developments."
"I hope that, in the light of the digital revolution, we can pass proper legislation in due time."
"That is why I welcome Mr Weber's excellent report."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to repeat what a special and important place the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive occupies within European integration."
"Through the impact it has, it creates a strong and clear link between all Europeans; it remains one of the essential factors of intercultural dialogue and contributes to developing our European identity."
"Mr Weber’s report not only refers to the application of Articles 4 and 5, but also to issues such as the revision of the Directive itself or media pluralism."
"Through my amendments, I was particularly keen to encourage assistance to be given to Europe’s special character so that cultural diversity, freedom, pluralism and independence of the media remain the crucial components of Europe’s audiovisual model."
"I also attached great importance to prioritising qualitative methods of analysing cultural content when confronted by the offensive of private or commercial production companies on the European markets."
"It is therefore crucial, in my opinion, to develop the special European character of content by establishing a link with funding methods."
"This precise point did not need to be developed in this report but it will absolutely have to remain a priority objective during the overall revision of the directive."
"In actual fact, nothing can be truly effective as long as the Member States do not commit to continuing funding public service television and to justifying the use of funds to the European Union."
"Obviously, it is impossible to talk about revising this directive without addressing the delicate issue of advertising."
"With regard to the latter, I considered that its content and regulation ought to be clearly defined, in particular for advertising relating to alcohol, which has a harmful effect on children and vulnerable people."
"I would even consider it crucial to extend the Directive to all audiovisual services made available to the public."
"I therefore hope that the new Directive can lay down legislation that genuinely implements the application of the penalties provided for as regards quotas and advertising."
"To conclude, I therefore ask you to vote in favour of this very satisfactory report proposed by our fellow MEP, Mr Weber."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Weber for his report and particularly to express my agreement with his view which underpins it, namely that this television directive has been a European success story."
"Over recent years, it has been possible to reserve most of the broadcasting time to European works, which is what the directive was intended to do."
"What is also crucial is that the process of integration in which Europe is engaged means that there has to be more exchanging of television programmes between all the European countries."
"In view of the regrettable fact that the percentage of broadcasts produced by independent producers has declined over recent years, more of them should be sought out and more European joint productions facilitated."
"There are two problematic aspects that I would like to address."
"Particularly in the new Member States, there has been an increase in media concentration to a disturbing degree, and that is something of which we must not lose sight."
"Media concentration of such a kind cannot, politically speaking, be in our interests, for media diversity makes for freedom and liberality, and is something that we must defend."
"I agree with Mr Weber about the need for regulation if we are to be able to do that."
"The second crucial aspect is that in adapting the directive to the new technological revolution, and to digital media, we must do everything possible to enable public television, whatever the challenges posed by the competition, to really benefit from these new technologies, thus preventing it from being undermined and put at a disadvantage without anyone noticing. The real test of our success will be media diversity in the public sector too."
"Speaking as a German Member of this House, whatever the high regard in which I hold public television and whatever my commitment to it, I have to say that it must do what is required of it even with the new resources at its disposal and there must be no more of what one might describe as surreptitious advertising in public television."
". – Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Weber, for the excellent report which he has presented and for the fact that he presents a broader picture of the needs and objectives which the TV without Frontiers Directive needs to serve."
"In my opinion, the two major problems against which we need to pit ourselves once more – both the European Parliament and the Commission – in the run up to the review of the directive in the autumn are:"
"Firstly and most importantly, over-concentration of the media, which is damaging pluralism and substantially restricting democracy, as the rapporteur rightly notes."
"However, we also have some experience."
"Until now, this matter has been left solely in the hands of the Member States and over-concentration is increasing and in several Member States democracy is suffering."
"I therefore think that we need to ask the Commission for a common European antitrust policy which will protect pluralism and diversity and prevent the unfair concentration of ownership."
"The second problem concerns the very defence of European television productions, which are a facet of our European identity and of our European culture."
"We need to do whatever we can here to strengthen European productions by reinforcing the circulation of national productions at trans-European level, by supporting joint European policies and productions and by improving how we use and coordinate the positive role of public broadcasting."
"In addition, if we want to talk about quality, the Commission needs a positive definition of what works are, so that ridiculous, reality-type productions do not pass as quality and as European productions."
"I trust that Parliament will play a fundamental role in shaping the new directive in both these sectors."
". Mr President, having lived most of my life under Communist rule, the rules we are enforcing in the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive sound all too familiar to me."
"Back in Communist times, a Soviet directive along the same lines was in force in the Czech Republic, aimed at drastically reducing the number of American films in favour of European productions, except that back then it applied to French and Soviet films respectively."
"According to paragraph 14 of the Weber report, Parliament should endeavour to ensure that the content of television programmes is uniquely European."
"This begs the question of who should decide what ‘European’ means in this context."
"I can assure you that if there is such a thing as a universal European, then there is a simple solution to any concerns he may have in this regard."
"By using his channel selector, together with a small satellite dish and a receiver costing EUR 130, he can watch 1 400 television channels."
"It would be nigh on impossible to regulate his viewing habits."
"We will not succeed in creating a European television oeuvre by means of the Directive."
"The only cultures that exist are national ones, and it will always be the latter that fill European quotas."
"For that matter, the most European programme of all is the American film , since every viewer from Finland to Portugal can understand it in its entirety."
"Hollywood productions are surprisingly European in their universal appeal, and our persistent attempts to keep American culture out of the mainstream of European civilisation and values are laughable."
"I look forward to the time after Turkey’s accession when we will use quotas to deny Europeans easily-understood American films of this kind, and be obliged to broadcast Turkish films in their place as part of a single European culture."
"This amounts to nothing other than the customary social engineering, based on the belief that bans, quotas, regulations and subsidies can be used to create cultural values."
"This belief is entirely misguided, as the only thing that we will create is mollycoddled film directors safe in the knowledge that they can make absurd films that only a select group of relatives, mistresses and friends will see fit to applaud."
"By implementing the Directive, we are providing livelihoods to vast supervisory bodies in the EU Member States and granting subsidies to talentless creators who would otherwise be left behind in the usual competition for viewers."
"We are also perpetuating an ineffective public television system and funding European television stations that attract such a small number of viewers that it is a waste of electricity to run their transmitters."
"Real culture does not depend on regulations or on an endless stream of subsidies."
"It survives at national level, even without artificial precautions on the part of the EU."
"We should abolish the Directive, and leave cultural values in their rightful place, namely in the nation states."
"Mr President, the television directive is indeed one that gives the public a direct experience of the benefits of Europe and the European Union."
"Protection of young people, protection of consumers’ interests, cultural diversity, European content and European productions – all these things are of value and the ‘television without frontiers’ directive guarantees them to viewers in all the European Union’s Member States."
"I am very grateful to Mr Weber for highlighting the success of this and demanding those things that we need if it is to be continued."
"As we are all aware, people not only have a television at home, but are also, and increasingly, able to receive programmes over the Internet or via their computers and mobile phones."
"It is not acceptable that the same transmissions should be subject to different regulations depending on where they are broadcast from, and so it is indeed the case that this directive urgently needs to be revised."
"In a couple of weeks’ time, the Commission and the British Presidency will be holding a major conference on this subject in Liverpool."
"I strongly urge not only the Commission and the Member States, but also businesses and broadcasters, to be ready and willing to really carry forward this directive."
"In particular, I urge, firstly, that the digital divide be reduced, for we need access to all media."
"Secondly, the television directive’s objectives – ensuring cultural diversity, the dual system, protection of young people and consumers – need to be guaranteed appropriately in the new media."
"It is for that reason that this report enjoys broad support from this House."
"– Mr President, television has been a catalytic medium for many years now, informing, educating and entertaining European citizens."
"The European Union is aware of the lack of quality European productions and has set itself the primary objective in the TV without Frontiers Directive of reversing this worrying state of affairs by setting broadcasting quotas in order to promote European and independent productions."
"It is very positive that the European Commission notes in its last report for 2001-2002 that there has been a bigger increase in the number of European works scheduled, with broadcasting of independent European productions fluctuating at around over 10%."
"However, this positive image has a number of negative aspects."
"For example, careful examination of the quotas shows that they are mainly met by domestic productions."
"Although this certainly does not contradict the directive, it does not help to create a European audiovisual area, which cannot come about while European viewers have inadequate access to the audiovisual productions of other European countries."
"It is a fact that joint European productions need to be promoted."
"The report by Mr Weber, who has worked methodically and has received congratulations on a job well done by the entire Committee on Culture and Education, also extends to other important matters, such as safeguarding pluralism and the major issue for many countries of concentration of the media."
"The Commission therefore needs to take serious account of the proposals in the report."
"It is our duty to resist the pressure being exerted for a reduction in the regulatory arrangements in the directive, the minimal rules of which have been unable to reverse the deterioration in programme quality."
"This century's culture of the image is a challenge to us to defend European culture and to channel it as a competitive product to other continents on our planet, given that to date, unfortunately, its citizens have consumed whatever is produced on the other side of the Atlantic."
"This major issue is a cultural and, primarily, a political issue."
"We have seen the extent to which the glamour productions of the United States contrast with the reality of New Orleans."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Weber report contains many innovative and important elements, including a full acknowledgement that the way democracy functions in every country is radically influenced by the media systems and that therefore it is vital to have a system of democratic controls to guarantee that citizens’ rights are not violated by state or private monopolies."
"Not only is it essential for everyone to receive accurate information, but everyone must be able to participate in the management of communication."
"I would like to stress, however, that the issues of information and communication are far more extensive than merely a debate on competition and pluralism."
"A public sector is not enough to guarantee public control of information management; it is not enough for state television to be subject to the government and the parties as is the case in Italy and as, apparently, threatens to be the case in Slovenia; nor is the private sector a guarantee of anything, if all the commercial television channels are in the hands of a few and if advertising imposes decisions and content with regard to both entertainment and information."
"I believe that Europe and Parliament must take a big step forwards in order to understand problems such as this one."
"It is vital for the directive to be revised, but the Commission should bear in mind that the debate goes beyond market-place arguments."
"In fact, television determines the cultural, intellectual and ethical environment of every country, and that in turn determines its degree of democracy."
"Mr President, I have long believed that the audiovisual sector has great potential for Scotland and Europe."
"I myself spent a day on work experience on a film set in Glasgow during the summer."
"I would add my own congratulations to our rapporteur for a very sensible and ambitious report."
"This is not an area lacking in legislation; quite the reverse, the question for us is how effective that legislation is in this mobile digital Internet age."
"I would, however, take some issue with paragraph 21 of the motion for a resolution."
"Scotland has, of course, a specific cultural, national and, indeed, commercial potential and I believe that the Scottish Parliament should be responsible for broadcasting, although fortunately there is nothing in the EU rules to preclude that."
"I also warmly support paragraphs 10 and 11, calling for an extension of the Media Plus Programme."
"This has demonstrated what a positive impact the EU can have."
"I hope the Commission will rise to our challenge and be as ambitious as we are."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report, which is quite balanced, emphasises certain problems and issues that are a concern for anyone who grasps – as we independent supporters of a Europe of the peoples do – the danger, plain for all to see, of a globalisation whose negative effects are to be seen, above all, in terms of culture."
"This is confirmed by the type of message and values or, to put it another way, lack of values that are disseminated through systems for the production and broadcasting of television’s message, which are squeezing our own production and suffocating the free expression of independent producers."
"I therefore believe that it would be a positive step to revise the directive in such a way as to be able to support producers and small and medium-sized enterprises, which are certainly not the recipients of the aid in question, thus restricting and circumscribing the influence of such messages."
"We have not exhausted here, however, the debate over this outright cultural ‘mongrelisation’, being imposed through the globalisation of audiovisual messages."
"This is, however, the central point: European identity is being threatened by the very broadcasting of such messages."
"This is, therefore, the point that we should be debating, and we should have the courage to call a spade a spade, since what we are seeing is actually the pauperisation of everything that is imported from European culture."
"One particular point should be stressed, and it is mentioned in paragraph 38: censoring messages from non-EU channels that incite hatred of our culture, of the West, as was recently the case when the Lebanese channel Al Manar transmitted messages opposed to our civilisation, from sources very close to Hezbollah, via a European satellite."
"– Mr President, Mr Weber has brought his experience to bear in his excellent report and for that I congratulate him."
"Despite the fact that, with the application of Articles 4 and 5 of the Television without Frontiers Directive on the future of European policy in the audiovisual sector, positive steps have been made, there is nonetheless still concern about broadcasting quotas for European programmes, which remain low, making competition with other productions, especially from the United States, difficult to impossible."
"At the same time, I note that there has been a reduction of about 4% in independent productions over the last four years, which is out of keeping with the directive and with efforts to enlarge the free market in the field of the audiovisual media. On the contrary, it restricts the free expression of producers both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the monopoly tactics being applied by other countries in the European Union."
"Unfortunately, infringements of the rules adopted by the European Union on total advertising time, interruptions to programmes for advertisements, scheduling of unsuitable works at specific times and the indirect promotion of banned products, such as tobacco and alcohol, during broadcasts, are just some aspects of an uncontrolled phenomenon for which the Member States are responsible."
"Cultural diversity is impossible without television without frontiers, without a single market and protection of the human dignity of consumers, minors and citizens in general."
"Only with freedom of thought, of provision of services and of protection of producers' intellectual property rights can television without frontiers survive and operate."
"The European Union has a duty to defend the role of the public and private audiovisual media, with respect for the relevant regulations and directives and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Mr President, I would first like to express my satisfaction at the revision of this Directive, because it updates some of the provisions of the ‘Television without frontiers’ Directive, specifically those which relate to the promotion of the distribution and production of television programmes."
"The market alone cannot resolve the problems of the sector with regard to content and furthermore, technological advances must not be left out of the existing legislation."
"All the articles of the Directive must therefore be revised periodically, in order to prevent technological development from being synonymous with a lack of control and in order to ensure that the fundamental principles of the current Directive are maintained. In particular, I would like to stress the principles of the protection of minors and the control of violence."
"Given that quotas of European works are largely covered by national works, I fully support the rapporteur in his advocacy of voluntary initiatives for increasing quotas for non-national European works and I support the proposal to establish more effective mechanisms for compliance with and control of the legislation of the Member States."
"Bearing in mind that the audiovisual public services are key to the development of public opinion, contribute to cultural diversity and pluralism and help to create an awareness of European citizenship, I would like to emphasise the importance of language learning with a view to greater access to pan-European channels and audiovisual works."
"I would also like to say that the revised Directive must safeguard the development of new technologies and new services, in order to guarantee growth of the European economy and job creation, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy."
"Finally, we must ensure pluralism of the media. Concentration is a threat to democracy and should be prevented, as should the granting of licences that do not comply with the law."
"Cultural diversity, freedom and pluralism of the media must continue to be the most important elements of the European audiovisual model."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive before us has aims in common with the Council of Europe’s European Convention on Transfrontier Television."
"In fact, this directive covers almost all the issues that the Council of Europe’s Convention has passed a decision on."
"Both have the purpose of maintaining and promoting the quantity of high-quality European works in television broadcasts."
"It is an excellent objective, but this is one example of the work of the Council of Europe overlapping with that of the European Union."
"In the discussion of this directive we should approach the search for modes of cooperation between these two bodies with an open mind, and clearly identify the areas of responsibility the Council of Europe and the European Union should have."
"It is not sensible to have both bodies dealing with the same issues in exactly the same way."
"Firstly, however, it would be a good idea to agree on common concepts in order to eliminate differing interpretations of what constitutes a European work or independent producer."
"What is most important, however, is that resources should be combined."
"This way we will achieve the best result."
"Mr President, the phrase 'Television without frontiers' seems innocuous and perhaps it is relevant to the television programme, ."
"Some might think it is clever to use early television images of pan-European friendship as a metaphor for EU cultural integration."
"Actually, the concept contains a deeper truth, which supporters of this proposal miss entirely or are deliberately concealing."
"Television is without frontiers."
"Twenty years ago, communist regimes could stop human beings getting across the Berlin Wall, but they could not stop television signals being beamed into East German homes."
"Today technology has moved on and people all over the planet can watch what they like, where they like."
"Yet the EU presses ahead with this paranoid, illiberal plan, with its quotas of European programming, and we all know what chaos quotas can create."
"The fact is that, if viewers want to watch American or any other programmes day and night, then nothing can stop them, certainly not the EU – or is that the hidden reality?"
"In the UK is called 'It's a Knock-Out'."
"Europe's viewers, not the politicians, will deal the knock-out blow to this pipedream project, because ordinary people know that if the EU is the answer, then it must have been a stupid question."
"Mr President, although we are obviously looking forward to the proposal that we hope the Commission will table by the end of the year, the issue papers that the offices of the Commission have prepared in the run-up to the conference on audiovisual policy in Liverpool at the end of this month have not been exactly confidence-inspiring."
"First of all, I realise that a new directive should naturally not stand in the way of the development of a European audiovisual industry, but that should surely not mean that no measures can be taken against the high concentration of broadcasters, whether they be horizontal, vertical, cross-border or otherwise."
"Parliament has repeatedly asked the Commission to table proposals on this subject."
"As everyone knows, that is crucial if we want to retain pluralism in the media."
"I think that the Commission is a little too ready to acquit itself of this task, the excuse being that this falls within the remit of the Member States, in other words that it will not make any proposals, and that I regard as unacceptable."
"The idea of a European observatory, the function of which would be to observe the market and collect data has also been mooted."
"Excuse me, but that is really not good enough. It is a mere palliative and totally unnecessary if not backed up by enforceable measures."
"Secondly, I should like to comment on the position of the national channels."
"A study commissioned by Parliament actually states, in black and white, that the independence of the national channels cannot be guaranteed with any certainty in many Member States."
"The Commission labours under the assumption that policy of national channels is in the hands of the Member States."
"While that is true, I do wonder if we – that is the Commission and Parliament – should not consider routes and measures we should take in those cases where the national governments have turned national channels into virtual branch organisations of government policy."
"Let me conclude by saying that the minimalist starting position that is now before us will lead us straight into American-style situations."
"I assume that here in this Chamber, which is now starting to fill up nicely, there are few Members for whom this prospect is an enticing one."
"Time is pressing, Commissioner; it is time for action."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must stand in for Mrs Reding, who is in London today as part of the UK Presidency."
"I would like first of all to thank Parliament for this broad overview and to congratulate it on the broad support expressed by Mr Weber’s report in favour of the overall approach reflected in the summary documents published at the beginning of July 2005."
"It is a new and comprehensible approach suggesting progressive regulation for linear services (radio broadcasting) and non-linear services, such as video on demand."
"As the report rightly points out, the existing rules must be adapted to structural changes and technological developments, while fully observing the basic principles of the current ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive."
"The fundamental objectives of the directive, including the objectives of an internal market and of public interest, that are still valid, are as follows: free movement of audiovisual programmes on, and between, platforms, whatever their method of transmission may be; free access to events of major importance; promotion of European works, independent productions and cultural diversity; minimum standards of protection for viewers against clandestine advertising; integrity of audiovisual works, in particular films; protection of minors and human dignity, and the right of reply."
"The consultation process has been conducted in complete transparency with the participation of Members of the European Parliament."
"That will also be the case for the important Liverpool Audiovisual Conference, where the future rules on the regulation of audiovisual content will be discussed in six different round tables."
"Having regard to the current Articles 4 and 5, we have taken due note of your concerns with a view to securing a better and more uniform application of notions such as ‘independent producers’ or ‘European works’ through the introduction of clearer concepts."
"I have taken full note of Mr Weber’s wish to give this concept of work a more specific content."
"The measures to promote European works and independent productions were also subject to consultation within the framework of the summary documents covering the same points that were highlighted in the Weber report."
"The consultations demonstrated that the basic principles remain valid, as Articles 4 and 5 have provided a stable and effective framework for promoting cultural diversity and the European audiovisual production sector."
"The idea of organising a European Year of Television and Media, with the aim of drafting a European Innovation Pact, deserves to be considered and shown interest and calls for more extensive investigations."
"A commitment for a year, however, still cannot be made at this stage of reflection and debate."
"I note the concerns expressed in the Weber report about the need to safeguard media pluralism."
"During the Liverpool Conference, a round table will address this crucial issue."
"The Commission acknowledges the importance of media pluralism and, in the context of its powers, pays great attention to issues of concentration and property."
"Several public debates have been initiated to examine whether this issue should be dealt with at Community level."
"This debate showed that there is no immediate solution to this difficult issue."
"What can be said is that there is without doubt a need for a set of measures that include effective regulation at national level, application of national and European competition law and active promotion of media pluralism at national and Community levels by facilitating the movement of European works or by supporting European producers in the context of the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive and the Media programme."
"Those are the handful of points I wished to highlight, on behalf of Mrs Reding, by once again saying to Mr Weber and to all of the Members who followed the debate that the Commission has taken a great deal of interest in this dialogue and in this exchange with Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at noon."
"– The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, I wish to propose an oral amendment concerning a small technical modification: the words 'at 2004 prices' should be deleted in Amendments 6, 7, 8 and 19."
"Mr President, I should like to propose two changes to the original text. Both of them are in relation to the Roma community in Europe."
"Firstly, at Recital 7, Amendment 6, I shall read out the words that I would like to have inserted into the text: '... as well as the particular situation of the Roma'."
"The second change that I propose is in relation to the importance of the positive measures."
"In this paragraph, I propose inserting a whole sentence, which would read: 'Attention should be paid in particular to the case of traditionally disadvantaged groups [such] as Roma and people with disabilities.'"
". – Speaking in my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to point out that the Commission proposal covers all the categories referred to in Article 13, including, that is to say, the groups discriminated against on the grounds of their ethnic origin."
"The fact is, then, that PROGRESS will also give attention to the particular problems of the Roma."
"I find it a shame that nothing was said in the Committee about whether or not there should be explicit reference to them, for otherwise we would have had the time to discuss this there."
"Including a new group at this point creates problems, for we ought then, in fact, to keep on mentioning the other affected groups separately; so far, we have made specific reference only to people with disabilities."
"We should leave it at that rather than starting to include individual groups;"
"Article 13 should continue to apply."
"I might add, by the way, that it was my group that, when we voted in June, stated that we would pay special attention in this programme to the problems faced by the Sinti and Roma."
"In view of all this, I shall abstain from voting."
". I would like to extend very warm thanks to the members of the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective, who have made it possible for us to get, in the shape of the funds we need, a good instrument for carrying out our social policy agenda."
"– In light of the request made by various Members of this House, who would vote for the amendment if it were changed – although we believe that the current wording is more appropriate – I propose that our Amendment 9 should include the following sentence: ‘Notes that the scrapping of quotas in the clothing and textiles sector might have serious consequences for the least favoured regions and might lead to a reduction in regional GDP per inhabitant, a situation that requires a suitable response’."
"That concludes the vote"
"I believe it is of the greatest importance that the EU’s agricultural policy, including the organisation of the market for raw tobacco, should be reformed."
"The present system costs a lot of money. What is more, today’s high agricultural subsidies mean that EU products are dumped on the world market, a state of affairs that has serious consequences for developing countries."
"Today, the European Parliament has voted on changing the regulation on the common organisation of the market for raw tobacco."
"I chose to vote in favour, since the change means that the reform of the raw tobacco market, which has already begun, can continue."
"I do not believe that the EU should support tobacco cultivation."
"As a consequence, I welcome the continued reforms whereby half the total aid to the tobacco sector (EUR 484 million) will, as from 2010, be set aside for restructuring programmes in the tobacco-producing regions, and this within the framework of rural development."
". The Commission’s proposal meets the need to recast Regulation (EEC) 2075/92, which has become obsolete owing to the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) 1782/2003."
"This new regulation is the result of the implementation of the second reform package of the CAP agreed in April 2004."
"A number of articles and the annex should, accordingly, be removed for reasons of legal clarity and transparency. This is due to the scrapping of premium and production control schemes, and to the transfer of the content of certain articles and the annex to detailed rules on implementation and adoption in the raw tobacco sector."
"In light of the need for legal consistency, I welcome the Commission’s proposal, and the favourable opinion delivered by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development deserves Parliament’s support."
". We are voting against this report because we believe that there should be no common organisation of the market for raw tobacco at all."
"We believe that a decision should be taken as soon as possible within the EU whereby tobacco producers should, without delay, operate in a free market and adjust to the situation."
"It is also incredibly inconsistent that, on the one hand, tobacco cultivation is subsidised in the EU and, at the same time, efforts are made to implement health promotion measures and campaigns."
"How long is this absurd situation to be allowed to continue?"
". I welcome these steps to regulate the international trade in raw tobacco."
"However I look forward to the day when this trade is eliminated entirely."
". The British Conservatives today abstained on this report."
"While we welcome long-overdue moves to end the EU's EUR 1 billion-a-year tobacco regime, we feel that the reforms agreed in 2004 do not go far enough soon enough."
"We strongly condemn the fact that tobacco-growing Member States were given the option of retaining up to 60% of the existing aid on tobacco as a coupled payment until 2010."
"Most other CAP sectors have been fully decoupled and we see no reason why such a glaring exception was made for tobacco, a product that kills hundreds of thousands of EU citizens each year."
". I believe it is of the greatest importance that the EU’s agricultural policy, including the organisation of the market for raw tobacco, should be reformed."
"The present system costs a lot of money. What is more, today’s high agricultural subsidies mean that EU products are dumped on the world market, a state of affairs that has serious consequences for developing countries."
"Today, the European Parliament has voted on changing the regulation on the common organisation of the market for raw tobacco."
"I chose to vote in favour, since the change means that the reform of the raw tobacco market, which has already begun, can continue."
"I do not believe that the EU should support tobacco cultivation."
"As a consequence, I welcome the continued reforms whereby half the total aid to the tobacco sector (EUR 484 million) will, as from 2010, be set aside for restructuring programmes in the tobacco-producing regions, and this within the framework of rural development."
". The Commission is proposing to amend Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs."
"In its communication on the European Action Plan on organic foodstuffs and agriculture, the Commission put forward the idea of replacing the current national derogation in the area of imports with a permanent system that makes use of technical benchmarking carried out by bodies appointed by the Community. A certain amount of time must be given in order to develop the new permanent system."
"I welcome the proposed amendment and the favourable opinion delivered by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development deserves Parliament’s support."
". My concern is with the manufacture of gelatine and bio-gelatine."
"Both types of gelatine are manufactured using the same production process."
"The only difference is in the collection and monitoring of the raw materials, those for the manufacture of bio-gelatine being derived only from pigs reared under monitored ecological conditions, with all the regulations applicable to ecological rearing observed and complied with."
"Annex 6, part C of this Regulation includes a derogation for raw materials for the production of conventional gelatine, as non-organically produced agricultural products may, up to a certain percentage, be included in the manufacture of organic products."
"That is only right, since the current demand for gelatine still far exceeds the supply of bio-gelatine."
"There are, in Germany, many businesses engaged in the manufacture of bio-gelatine."
"In order that the production of such bio-gelatine may continue to be permissible, Annex 6, part B of the Regulation must include the following processing aids:"
". I voted in favour of this report, due, in no small measure, to the importance of predictability and stability in business rules and, above all, of there being no legal vacuums impeding proper trade."
"Leaving aside issues that may arise from the delay in drawing up the updated list under consideration here, and the opinion on the content that we shall give when the list is submitted, the priority at the moment is to ensure that the necessary – and, given the abovementioned constraints, feasible – conditions are in place for international trade to be able to continue."
". We wish to reaffirm our opposition, as a matter of principle, to the militarisation of space or its use for military purposes."
"We therefore object to the use of the European satellite radionavigation service GALILEO for military or security purposes, as is currently envisaged."
"On the basis of that principle, we feel that the system could be used as an alternative to the US-dominated Global Positioning System (GPS)."
"Let us not forget that the USA has previously blocked access to this system, so that it could use it in its military attacks on Yugoslavia and Iraq."
"It should be noted that the GALILEO system is being viewed with interest by countries such as China and India, which may become partners in the project, thereby contributing towards the end of the GPS monopoly, and creating an alternative project based on broad international cooperation."
"This project must be used for peaceful purposes within the framework of international cooperation, without jeopardising the citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees. It should be geared towards serving the public through its broad range of applications."
". The Galileo Programme is far from being simply a research project."
"It has taken on great importance for Europe, given that it is the first satellite radionavigation and positioning system in the world designed specifically for civil purposes."
"I voted in favour of the Barsi-Pataky report (A6-0212/2005) on the implementation of the deployment and commercial operating phases of the European programme of satellite radionavigation."
"The purpose of the implementing guidelines of this report is to give satisfactory answers to questions regarding finance and intellectual property, and to provide adequate mechanisms of democratic control."
"The programme must be implemented in a well-balanced fashion, in light of the new public-private approach to implementation."
"Lastly, I feel that the programme will have a thoroughly positive impact on the citizens’ day-to-day lives, in that it will meet some of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy by paving the way for large numbers of jobs to be created in Europe and by strengthening European competitiveness through the body of technology and know-how acquired in the field."
". I voted in favour of the Costa report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Lebanon on certain aspects of air services."
"The various bilateral agreements established in the area of air services are the main instruments for ensuring that our relations with third countries run smoothly, particularly with regard to issues of air safety."
"As a result of this and the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Community’s exclusive competence in this field, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries with a view to replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements."
"In the case of the Republic of Lebanon, the changes proposed by Parliament are corrective in character and relate to the taxation of aviation fuel, to designation clauses and to pricing. There is nothing in these areas to which we object."
". I voted in favour of the Costa report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Georgia on certain aspects of air services."
"The various bilateral agreements established in the area of air services are the main instruments for ensuring that our relations with third countries run smoothly, particularly with regard to issues of air safety."
"As a result of this and of the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Community’s exclusive competence in this field, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries with a view to replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements."
"In the case of Georgia, the changes proposed by Parliament are corrective in character and relate to the taxation of aviation fuel, designation clauses and pricing. There is nothing in these areas to which we object."
". I broadly welcome the EC’s proposal, which follows up a range of measures that have been implemented with the aim of updating the system of controlling fishing vessels in the EU."
"I feel that the work of Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries has made an important contribution to the drafting of the final text."
"I should like to highlight the fact that the date for implementing the proposed measures has been put back to 2008, on the grounds that some pilot projects have yet to be concluded."
"I also welcome the use of Vessel Detection Systems (VDS) and the introduction of an electronic logbook mechanism. I feel that these measures will help to improve the monitoring of fishing zones, and will enable better and more accurate management of fish stocks, thereby facilitating the procedures involved in the gathering and dissemination of fisheries information."
"Provided that they are in tune with the situation on the ground in the different Member States, I feel that the amendments tabled by Parliament deserve a favourable vote in the Chamber."
"We have chosen to vote against this report."
"We are highly critical of the EU’s common fisheries policy."
"However, it is important to be able to see EU vessels reliably complying with the rules."
"We therefore support the principle of electronic registration and reporting of fisheries activities."
"We believe, however, that the costs incurred in putting vessels onto a computer system should not be borne by the EU."
"Individual Member States should decide on the funding."
"The obvious solution is for the whole cost to be imposed upon the fisheries industry."
"The purpose of the Commission’s proposal is to introduce the obligation electronically to record and report information on fishing activities, whereby Member States will be required to equip their fisheries monitoring centres with technology that is compatible with the remote-sensing vessel detection system (VDS). Furthermore, vessels larger than 15 metres must be equipped with an automatic localisation device which makes it possible to survey their fishing activities through a satellite-based Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)."
"The aim is to meet the control and management goals pursued by the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002."
"We have always had our doubts about the introduction of this system, from the point of view of both respect for sovereignty and the cost and effectiveness of such a system."
"The results of the implementation of the pilot project entitled Improving Fisheries Monitoring through integrating Passive and Active Satellite-based Technologies (IMPAST) at national level has confirmed our fears as regards the efficacy and the cost-effectiveness of the system, regardless of the Commission’s overall assessment."
"In any event, it is crucial not only that the implementation of the system takes account of the specific characteristics of the different fleets and Exclusive Economic Zones, but also that Community financing be made available to support the spending on investment and training involved."
". The excessively complex rules which fishermen are expected to comply with, have become more and more burdensome to the industry, as well as enforcement agencies, as the Common Fisheries Policy has evolved."
"In one instance recently, a Scottish boat was wrongly accused of using illegal fishing gear because the enforcement agency wrongly interpreted current rules."
"I supported Mr Casaca's Report because in theory, the use of new technology has the potential to ease some of the burden of paperwork but the best course of action for Scotland would be to scrap the CFP and return fisheries management to local control."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Casaca on his outstanding report on the proposal for a Council regulation on recording and reporting of fishing activities and on means of remote sensing. I fully endorse this report."
"This initiative must be supported. It will lead to improvements in the quality of information and in the effectiveness of fisheries resources management."
". The usefulness and importance of this proposal for a Council regulation deserves the support of all those who believe that the protection of fisheries resources is in everyone’s interests, especially the fishermen and the economies in which fishing plays a major role."
"The fact remains, however, that a proposal does not just have to be useful; it must also be reasonable and viable."
"Many of the amendments that have been tabled, by the rapporteur and other Members of the House, represent a step in this direction, and therefore justify supporting this report. The version thus presented is simply fairer, more reasonable and more viable than the version put forward by the Council."
"For these reasons, and taking particular account of national interests, I voted in favour of this report."
". As there was no debate on this report, I would like to emphasise the importance of data on fishing activities."
"With dwindling fish stocks the collection of accurate data is critical if we are to have a sustainable Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)."
". The readmission agreements between the European Community and third countries are of key importance to the European strategy to combat illegal immigration."
"This readmission agreement, which has been negotiated and concluded between the European Community and Albania, is the fourth such agreement, and follows those already concluded with Hong Kong, Macau and Sri Lanka. It is scheduled to enter into force at the end of the year."
"This agreement establishes Albania’s obligation to readmit its nationals living illegally in the territory of the Member States and reciprocally places an obligation on the Union to readmit nationals of EU Member States living illegally in Albanian territory."
"I voted in favour of this report, which recommends the conclusion of this agreement. I also wish to commend the rapporteur, Mrs Klamt, for her outstanding work on the report and for being proactive in issuing a warning now about the problems that Albania will certainly encounter when the agreement comes into force and about the need to support the country in this effort."
"It is also important that we look carefully into how we can provide support for the reintegration process, in such a way that people can return on a sustainable basis."
". The issue of immigration is one that, as politicians and as members of the general public, we should treat with the utmost importance and place high on our list of priorities."
"The existence of an economic and social model obviously acts as a focal point, something that has happened throughout the history of migrations, and despite its difficulties, this model is clearly a relative success story."
"It cannot be denied that the search for a better life is part of human nature. It does not follow, however, that a successful economic and social system is capable of handling all migratory pressures."
"We therefore need rules, and, more importantly, we need rules that can be enforced."
"Otherwise we would be promoting organised violations and the formation of illegal economic organisations offering an illegal service."
"We must respond to the migration question with both humanity and realism."
"What comes out of the report before us is, in fact, a solution which is both realistic and human and which should send out a message. I therefore voted in favour of the report."
". I welcome the idea of untying the Community’s external aid, and Parliament itself has supported it."
"The point is that a good idea should not produce a bad result."
"The amendments tabled in the report before us are worthy of our support, firstly because it is simply not logical solely to promote competition for its own sake – especially when that competition is realised in a way that is unfair or does not respect rules that we believe are of key importance – and secondly because the purpose of granting aid should be to promote development and not to promote developed economies and our competitors."
"It actually makes perfect sense to attach development aid to the – indirect – financing of developing regional economies, in which case we will be helping to ensure that the aid granted is doubly effective."
"Yet when that serves to promote only developed economies and our competitors, we will clearly only be financing those who do not need financing."
"In this context, and in light of the most relevant parts of the report before us, I voted in favour."
". I welcome this Council proposal and the European Parliament Report as an opportunity for legal clarity in the area of waste extraction but also as a logical way to combat the very large volumes of waste from the extractive industries."
"I have noted the importance of in voting to-day."
"It is fundamental that the EU and its Member States need to focus on the problem of this type of waste and the protection of our environment via requirements on Members States and their industries to have waste management plans; to have inventories of closed waste facilities; to make financial guarantees to national competent authorities for rehabilitation and post-clean up operations; to apply monitoring and management controls to prevent water and soil pollution, all of which are consistent with the ‘Polluter Pays’ principle."
"Balance is required however when voting on a certain number of amendments which would impose a large and disproportionate number of unwarranted burdens on aggregate industry benefiting the environment or society."
". We voted in favour of most of the proposals in this report, which is a second reading of the directive aimed at introducing sound environmental legislation to promote, as the rapporteur says, more sustainable production, lower waste production, long-term investment and businesses with a serious approach to the environment."
"The aim is thus to clarify the Community’s legal situation with regard to the extractive industries, and this would be of great interest to Portugal."
"The Council has accepted a number of amendments adopted at first reading by Parliament."
"Some of the proposals not accepted by the Council have since been reinstated and attempts have been made to clarify others."
"I feel that a historical waste inventory should be drawn up and that measures should be taken to deal with it in cases where it creates environmental problems."
"We now hope that the Council will be receptive to most of the proposals that have been tabled."
"We have chosen to support this report because the handling of waste from the mining industry is partly a cross-border environmental issue."
"However, we are critical of using structural fund resources for drawing up inventories of closed waste facilities."
"There is no good reason why taxpayers in other countries should pay for such measures."
"Structural Fund resources should only be deployed in the case of poor Member States with unusually large needs in terms of drawing up inventories."
"We have therefore voted against Amendment 8."
"The principle should be that companies affected should be responsible for any costs that arise in implementing the proposed legislation."
". I welcome this report which is designed to ensure that we have legislation in place that covers mining waste."
"Mining waste is currently covered by general waste directives, but some serious incidents involving quarrying and mine waste led to the Council to ask for a specific directive on mining waste."
"The only controversial issue is whether a new category of waste for this directive non inert, non-hazardous waste, for example, chalk and lime would be created."
"While this category does not exist in the landfill directive on balance I think there is a sensible case for this new category."
"– I should like to give a brief explanation of my vote on the Sjöstedt report on the management of waste from extractive industries."
"In my opinion, mining would become significantly more expensive for the companies operating in this industry if we were to adopt the draft report."
"This would result in a rise in the cost of constructing public networks, such as roads and railways, and all other public buildings in which aggregates are used."
"There would also be a dramatic increase in state spending on the monitoring of materials that have been extracted but not yet used."
"The end result of all this would be a heavier burden on taxpayers throughout the European Union, without anything positive being achieved."
"It was for this reason that I voted against the majority of the amendments."
"The report on the EU programme for employment and social solidarity (PROGRESS) is all very well, but it is based on the false notion that the Commission can and should prepare general strategies and proposals for how these issues should be resolved for 25 very different countries."
"Instead of the EU regulating matters from above, the Member States should learn from each other through healthy institutional competition."
"No decisions have been taken about the programme’s financial framework because the EU’s long-term budget has been rejected by the European Council."
"The attempt nonetheless to push through the PROGRESS programme, the cost of which will exceed EUR 1 billion between 2007 and 2013, shows a lack of respect for the Council’s decision."
". I welcome this Report by Karin Jons, which stresses the continuing need to fund and support measures designed to end discrimination in employment opportunity, social protection and working conditions."
"In particular I support the rapporteur's intention to better recognise the role of NGOs at local and national level in successfully implementing these aims."
"I hope that the Commission will regularly seek the views of those most closely involved in plans to implement anti-discrimination measures, and ensure that co-financing levels should not be so high as to discourage local networks from participating."
". The Lisbon European Council set out a new strategic objective for the Union, namely to turn it into the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"The Agenda for Social Policy constitutes the Union’s itinerary in the social and employment field as part of the general Lisbon Strategy."
"In this context, the Commission has emphasised the importance of simplifying and rationalising the current situation, by proposing an integrated programme for employment and social solidarity (PROGRESS)."
"The PROGRESS programme is the new Community programme containing the four programmes that currently make up the Agenda for Social Policy and a range of budgetary headings relating to working conditions."
"As regards the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, I welcome the increase in the financial framework, the strengthening of Parliament’s role in the monitoring and the implementation of the programme and the involvement of the social partners and non-governmental organisations."
". I welcome PROGRESS which will make a substantial contribution to achieving the objectives of the social policy agenda under the Lisbon Strategy."
"In particular, this proposal contains much needed attempts to simplify and rationalise by combining specific action programmes."
"However, care must be taken that costs are actually saved, duplication avoided and more administrative clarity and transparency achieved."
"I also support the Rapporteur's steps to strengthen Parliament’s role in monitoring the programme and increase its influence on implementation through measures such as a regular exchange of views with Parliament held by the Commission and an interim report evaluating the results achieved and the qualitative and quantitative aspects of programme implementation."
"Mr President, I would briefly like to present my explanation of vote."
"I appreciate my colleague’s work with regard to the textiles issue."
"I am also pleased that the European Union and China have reached a settlement, but I cannot support the policy of the European Parliament, not to mention that of the EU, in this matter. The reason is straightforward: the principle at stake here should be free trade, not quotas."
"In my opinion, the EU’s policy in this matter has been far too protectionist, and it is consumers who suffer most for that, in the form of higher prices."
"In other words, I give my support to the Commission and those countries that are prepared to open up the textiles market, and not to block it."
"Mr President, I rise to say something about the Saïfi report."
"In principle, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on it, as it is, in substance, a very good report, but there are certain concerns that need to be mentioned."
"It could be said that the report has already been overtaken by events in the shape of the problems – with which we are all familiar – currently arising with regard to imported textiles from China."
"I do, however, think it important that what we have been demanding to date should again be set down in a report such as this one."
"There is a need for further action to address the problem that has arisen in this respect."
"I take the view that Europe has a great opportunity to make its consumers the most emancipated in the world."
"It would, after all, be very interesting to demand, at any rate for the future, the creation of a standard ‘made in Europe’ label, to which stringent criteria would apply, as a means of ensuring that what our consumers buy has been manufactured under the proper conditions, without causing massive damage to the environment and without the use of such things as child labour."
"The creation of such a label might also enable European policy to find another way of responding to these challenges."
". We voted in favour of the report on textiles and clothing after 2005."
"We do not entirely agree with the proposal, and especially not with paragraph 11 where an agreement is sought on more categories of textiles than those that exist in the June agreement between the EU and China."
"We believe that the quota system should be abolished in the longer term and that the EU should open up trade with the rest of the world."
"The ‘Report on textiles and clothing after 2005’ is a very important document to my country, Lithuania, where textile and clothing has a long tradition and the number of people employed is remarkable, so I voted to call on the Commission and the Council to take serious steps and implement effective measures to meet the challenges the EU textile and clothing industry face in 2005."
"Having in mind, that whereas the Union’s textile and clothing industry consists of small and medium-sized companies and is high labour intensive, and the Member States may not adopt measures independently, because they have delegated trade policy to the exclusive competence of the EU, I voted to protect European consumers from the counterfeiting textile and clothing products, and to introduce mandatory origin and company-name labelling for the products in this sector, and that any enterprise wishing to export to the EU must declare its compliance with international social and environmental rights and standards."
"We should also guarantee our support for textile and clothing companies using opportunities offered by the EU Structural Funds after 2005 in compliance with the Lisbon strategy goals."
"."
"It needs to be stressed that the textile sector is the tip of the iceberg: the invasion of the European market by Chinese products affects all sectors, from footwear to food."
"We need appropriate counter-measures."
"I am talking about the introduction of a compulsory non-EU origin label, to be applied to raw materials too."
"I am also referring to the combating of counterfeited products, which damage high-quality production as well as technical and craft-based knowledge assets in the sector."
"It would also be a good idea to conduct awareness campaigns in favour of ‘conscious consumption’ to help European consumers to choose products via legible and clear labelling."
"Finally, we should not forget that behind every Chinese product sold at a low price there are thousands of jobs lost in Europe, and in China human rights that have been denied, the death penalty, repression and child exploitation."
"To conclude, will the Lisbon Strategy arrive in time to finance research and innovation?"
"So, are we sure that we can put aside the idea, as is happening in the United States, of imposing duties to protect our production and workers when outright commercial aggression is taking place, as in the case of the abnormal increases in Chinese exports?"
"We Moderates voted today against the above-noted report."
"The abolition of quotas for the trade in textiles, together with China’s accession to the WTO, have made the issue a very topical one."
"We are opposed both to the protectionist measures introduced in the spring and to those proposed in this report."
"Those who pay the price for the type of protectionism recommended by the report are consumers, who have to pay higher prices; other industries, which have more expensive inputs; and whole regions, which forfeit structural transformation and, thereby, competitiveness – consequences that have become clear to ever more Europeans during the summer."
"In northern Europe, the textile trade was deregulated as early as the Seventies and Eighties, with big advantages for quite a few countries in southern Europe."
"This was a painful process for many regions in northern Europe, but it led to a new competitiveness."
"It is regrettable that those countries that gained so much from this deregulation are not themselves prepared to undergo the same process."
"We have known for 10 years that, in 2005, we should be obtaining new arrangements, no longer involving quotas, for the world trade in textiles."
"The textile industry has had every opportunity to prepare itself."
"A few more years of trade barriers will not help the European textile industry."
"The Saïfi report is designed to combat the increased imports of textiles from China to Europe."
"These have increased sharply since the quotas were abolished on 1 January 2005 when the WTO Agreement on Textiles expired."
"EU leaders should have been able to predict the situation that has arisen and, in time, to adapt to it, but protectionist blinkers have for a long time obscured the EU’s vision where trade policy is concerned."
"Increased protectionism cannot in the long term protect European industry and jobs from ever tougher international competition."
"The best way of facing up to this competition is by investing in education, research and innovation and by making it easier for companies to act in the global market."
"Given the incompetent way in which textile quotas have been dealt with so far, there may however be good reason for drawing up a clear plan for the transition to free trade in textile and clothing products, so easing the strain on those employed in southern Europe’s textile and clothing industry."
"Generally speaking, the June List supports the increased liberalisation of world trade and cannot therefore vote in favour of the report as a whole."
"Nor are we able to support the proposal for an ‘ethical tax’ on international companies because we are opposed to the EU being given the right of taxation."
". Recent developments in the textiles and clothing situation in the EU have only served to demonstrate that our criticisms of the way in which the Council and the Commission have conducted the talks were justified."
"They also show that our proposals to defend this important production sector were appropriate and remain appropriate, particularly for Portugal."
"The so-called ‘Memorandum of understanding’ of 10 June relating to limitations on textile imports served to block the activation of safeguard clauses, after the Commission had done everything to keep the impact of this measure to a minimum."
"Pre-empting the agreement and its entry into force, the major multinational retailers and importers quickly attempted to derail it."
"They enjoyed the immediate support of the (Barroso) Commission, which, in proposing the unblocking of millions of items held at customs, is simply failing to comply with what had previously been agreed."
"We regret the fact that some important proposals that we tabled with a view to protecting this EU production sector were rejected by Parliament."
"Although the resolution contains proposals arising from the opinion delivered by the Committee on Regional Development – proposals that we drew up, such as the setting up of a Community support programme for the sector – it continues to be characterised by the promotion of the liberalisation of the sector."
"Hence our vote against."
". The current dispute with China highlights a growing trend, which is making life difficult for our own textile and knitwear industries."
"I supported amendments which would require that labour standards at sites operated in non-EU countries be monitored, including at sites outsourced by EU companies."
"The ongoing drive towards low-cost imports should not be an excuse to continue utilising sub-standard production facilities with unacceptably poor working conditions and wages."
". The French textile industry is being sacrificed on the altar of Euro-internationalism."
"In my region of the Nord Pas de Calais, there is no end to the jobs being lost in industries."
"In 2004, the textile sector saw the number of its jobs drop by 13%, while non-EU imports are soaring."
"This report proposes nothing new in terms of saving our jobs."
"On the contrary, the solutions recommended in this summit of pro-European jargon are extraordinary, naive and schizophrenic."
"People criticise US protectionism; and they wish to put forward trivial social measures, while proposing in point 44 to help the Maghreb and Turkey!"
"The ultra-liberal hard-line attitude of the extreme internationalists lifts the lid on our economy and our know-how, while in Asia piracy and counterfeiting are a monstrous phenomenon. Meanwhile, the China factory, that ‘market socialist’ State, practises unfair competition through its work camps and underpaid labour."
"At the heart of the economic war, the bilateral agreements and the WTO offer us no protection at all."
"For our part, we want to produce French products in France with French people."
"In other words, we want protection and national preference in France."
"In other words, we want protection and Community preference in Europe."
". This report is symbolic of the widespread autism afflicting the economic and political elite and intelligentsia in Europe."
"The European Union textile and clothing sector is extremely important for the economy and regional development."
"As a result of global deregulation, this sector is experiencing serious difficulties, sustaining relocations, numerous bankruptcies and, as a consequence, job cuts."
"What is Europe proposing in order to defend and protect this sector?"
"A headlong rush towards the dead end of global free trade!"
"The Americans, however, have just shown us that, without borders, there can be no protection."
"In fact, they did not wait until they had plunged thousands of homes into financial difficulty and drafted the umpteenth useless report before they reacted."
"They acted and reacted quickly and effectively, as it was their duty to do to safeguard their interests, first and foremost."
"Following the vote on 29 May, this report and the ideology underpinning it is an insult to everyone who has lost, or is on the verge of losing, their job."
"It contravenes the principle of Community preference and sets the stage for the collapse of this sector in the medium term."
". I have abstained on this report, which does not lay down a pro-active strategy to cope with the seriousness of the situation."
"I also wish to denounce the climb down of the committee, recorded yesterday in a meeting with the Chinese Government."
"To derogate from the agreement on the new quotas that was signed only in July and that was in force from 2005 is unacceptable."
"The commitments made must be respected, and the policy of fait accompli adopted by the large distributors cannot be endorsed, as it would thus put thousands of jobs at risk."
"The committee has delayed bringing in the import controls needed to launch the safeguard clauses provided for in the WTO and it has not organised itself in order to lay down minimum social and environmental rules in international trade."
"Today, it refuses to propose a ‘textile plan’ that is equal to the challenges: a shortage of funds for research and innovation, a lack of significant support for technological and social conversion or for training, and no revival of the Euro-Mediterranean area, with common customs duties."
"Millions of jobs and a still promising industrial sector are being sacrificed by a negligent EU policy."
". The conflict surrounding the imports of Chinese textiles into the European Union clearly brings into focus the effects of the global free market economy."
"Competition leads to a ruthless race to the bottom in terms of working conditions."
"Chinese workers work six long days a week."
"In those degrading circumstances, it is hardly surprising that they surpass European clothing output."
"As a consequence, European workers lose their jobs, which results in a lose-lose situation."
"We should also add the fact that in the poorest countries, 70% to 80% of the workers in the clothing sector are women."
"Free trade is acceptable only if countries are comparable in social and economic terms."
"Until such time as they are, the tough battle between enterprises will claim ever more new victims in the form of mass redundancies and unacceptable working conditions."
"That is why we must press China, but also the UN and the WTO, for improvements in that country’s working conditions."
"The authors of this intervention would like to stress that the high environmental and safety standards are more important than competitiveness."
"It is therefore unacceptable for the high REACH standards on chemical substances to be lowered in order to remain competitive."
"Economic success must at all times come second to human well-being."
". This is a timely report on the situation of the textile industry after the removal of export quotas and the outlook for its future."
"It is clear to me that there is no long term future for European textile producers hiding behind a wall of protection."
"The measures taken to limit Chinese imports must be seen as temporary and used by the industry to restructure and move up-market."
"However, European textile manufactures deserve to operate on a level playing field and open access to our markets must be mirrored by similar access to third country markets."
"Similarly if EU producers invest in new designs and materials they deserve the full protection of their intellectual property rights."
". The liberalisation of the textiles market since 1 January of this year has had a profoundly negative impact on Europe’s textiles industry, and in particular on the industry in Portugal."
"Although I am an advocate of the virtues of a capitalist economy and the open market, we must understand that if we do not protect the interests of our firms with competitive potential – and in the Portuguese textile industry there are a number of examples of competitive potential – we will soon be seeing a country of consumers that produces nothing; and if you produce nothing, you cannot consume."
"It is in this context that we must look at the issues surrounding the opening up of the textiles market."
"If competition is restricted by practices that would be considered illegal in our economy – such as the abuse of workers’ fundamental rights – we cannot turn a blind eye and open the markets up to such competition."
"If we do not allow this to happen in our market, we cannot allow it to happen when the competition comes from outside."
"This has been, and will continue to be, my position in defence of both Portuguese and European interests."
". We should welcome the news today over the resolution to the EU/China trade dispute."
"We voted in favour of the report on the application of Articles 4 and 5 of the ‘TV without Frontiers’ directive."
"It is important for us to show our support for possible ways of developing public service."
"Public service is of great importance for democracy and diversity, and it is important for the EU to safeguard it."
"We also view with concern the increasing media concentration within the EU."
"It is on principle, however, that we are opposed to rules determining how large a portion of broadcasting time should be given over to European productions."
"We believe that broadcasting quotas for European productions and programmes by independent producers would be a very dubious development."
"Above all, these quotas must not be decided at EU level."
"We wish to promote products that emphasise cultural distinctiveness, but we are doubtful as to whether broadcasting quotas are a suitable means of achieving that goal."
"For the above-noted reasons, we have chosen to vote against this report."
". The importance of television in our society has been well documented."
"In this context, the time has come to consider whether, on the one hand, the rules of a liberal economy should be followed to the letter, or, on the other hand, whether circumstances are in place that would justify some sort of regulatory intervention to protect the Community’s interests."
"Language is without doubt one of the defining elements of a community; after all, cultural production and cultural goods are among the most conspicuous expressions of a community."
"Some sort of regulation, guaranteeing the necessary space for cultural expression of any community, can therefore be seen as justifiable, as distinct from state intervention that conditions people’s tastes and choices."
"Yet we must not fall into the conceptual and analytical trap of believing that national culture is promoted by placing limits on cultural access."
"Striking the right balance in the promotion of sufficient space for disseminating cultural production is not the same as imposing cultural consumption or, worse, limiting choice."
"By ensuring that we do not cross that line, we will be able to protect the interests of a community without restricting individual freedoms and the freedom to create."
"The next item is the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for the financial year 2006."
". Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and privilege for me to be able to present today, on behalf of the presidency of the Council, the draft budget of the European Communities for the year 2006, as established by the Council on 15 July 2005."
"I should like to begin by saying to Members that we, in the United Kingdom, have been very grateful and very touched by the messages of support and solidarity in the aftermath of the dreadful terrorist attacks in London."
"I believe we would all, on an occasion such as this, like to reiterate our determination, as the European Union, to tackle on an international level the scourge of modern terrorism as one of the greatest threats facing the world."
"I believe that the European Union has a major role to play in ensuring that we tackle head-on the menace of international terrorism."
"Once again, I thank you very much for the expressions of support and solidarity in relation to those attacks."
"With regard to the budget, I should like to note the historical importance of the 2006 budgetary procedure."
"As the last procedure under the current Financial Perspective, it has a special role in bridging past priorities and future objectives."
"Of course it also needs to provide a measure of continuity and the basis for coherence between two financial perspectives, but it also must offer the prospect of reform and renewal so that future budgets can genuinely meet the needs and expectations of European citizens in the 21st century."
"That gives the two arms of the budgetary authority – Parliament and the Council – a very special responsibility."
"We will need to build on the spirit of cooperation that has developed between us to deliver in 2006 a budget that offers a shared vision for a better future."
"Already, in the short period of time that I have been fulfilling these responsibilities, I value the relationship that I have been able to build with the chairman, rapporteur and members of the Committee on Budgets, and with the Commissioner."
"Whilst it is difficult at this stage of this sort of process realistically to reach any level of agreement, the atmosphere, environment and relationships that are being built are healthy and, hopefully, lay the foundations for a process that will lead to a mutually satisfactory conclusion."
"To give to a wider audience today an example of the benefits of that cooperation, during the conciliation meeting between the Budget Council and a delegation from the European Parliament on 15 July, we were able to agree two very urgent matters: first, a strategy for financing a significant EC contribution to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Tsunami-affected countries, and secondly, the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Slovakia, to help with the effects of a severe wind storm."
"Those are practical, tangible and highly visible actions, important to all of the people that we represent, as well as to the victims of the Tsunami."
"In addition, we were able to reach an agreement on the revision of the Financial Perspective ceilings for 2006, to permit modulation in agriculture."
"Today I acknowledge that, on the question of the Tsunami, there remains a EUR 13 million gap but, in the spirit of the cooperation and progress we were able to make back in July, I am still optimistic that we should be able to close that gap in a relatively short period of time."
"This was a very promising beginning to our relationship."
"It gives me confidence that, if we retain a constructive and permanent dialogue, and with the assistance of the Commissioner, we will be able to find an appropriate agreement on a balanced and satisfactory budget for 2006 by the end of this budgetary procedure."
"Before presenting in some detail the draft budget established by the Council on 15 July 2005, I would like to take this opportunity to recall the main principles which have guided our proposals."
"They are fully in line with the Council's budget guidelines for 2006 adopted in March of this year."
"I think it is very important that we are clear about the priorities and principles which lead and guide the financial decisions."
"That is as relevant in the context of 2006 as it is in any debate about future funding in terms of the next Financial Perspective."
"It is important that we are absolutely clear about the principles, the policies and the challenges which lie ahead for the European Union."
"First of all, the draft budget established by the Council shows due regard for the current Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure."
"This is a point which is worth repeating."
"Secondly, Council gave particular attention to complying with the annual expenditure ceiling set by the current Financial Perspective and to leaving adequate margins below the ceilings – where possible – so that there is some room to finance unforeseen events during 2006."
"Thirdly, regarding appropriations for payments, the Council has remained committed to a limited and controlled growth consistent with sound and rigorous financial management."
"The draft budget takes due account of the implementation rates in previous years and the expected implementation rates in the future."
"It also acknowledges fully the dramatic and welcome improvements in the implementation that we have seen in recent times."
"Securing the right level of payment appropriations for the EC budget is especially important, and I am sure that all Members will be aware that national budgets are so tightly constrained."
"All public spending must be justified and prioritised to ensure continued public confidence and public support."
"In setting the draft budget, Council took an overall approach which kept to those fundamental principles but which also aimed to provide adequate and realistic funding for the European Union's various budget priorities."
"For example, recalling the need for budget discipline, the Council increased the margins for commitments under heading 3: Internal policies, and heading 5: Administration, and created a margin under heading 4: External actions, but without the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument."
"We believe that this is entirely in keeping with Article 12 of our Interinstitutional Agreement."
"By carefully targeting amendments, the draft budget was achieved in a way which continues to meet genuine priority needs."
"The Council also took a similarly carefully-targeted approach to payment appropriations across the budget affecting both compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"While limiting the overall increase of payment appropriations, the draft budget still allows an increase of around 12% for research in light of the priority accorded to objectives set by the Lisbon Strategy and an increase of 9.8% for structural funds, reflecting improved implementation rates."
"Sometimes, when people refer to the word 'cuts', they are not talking about cuts; they are talking about a different level of significant growth in budget headings, and yet sometimes the Council has been accused of proposing cuts."
"We are not proposing cuts in the vast majority of budget headings; we are talking about sustained and stable growth, but not necessarily to the level that others consider to be the best way forward."
"I now want to move on to setting out the draft budget for 2006 in more detail."
"The 2006 draft budget establishes commitment appropriations at EUR 120.8 billion, an increase of 3.7% over the 2005 budget, and it establishes payment appropriations at EUR 111.4 million, 4.9% more than the 2005 budget, and payments correspond to 1.01% of Community GNI."
"Hopefully, you will have all received a comprehensive explanatory memorandum on the draft budget."
"I do not intend to bore you now with a line-by-line explanation – unless you really want me to, and I suspect you do not."
"However, I should draw your attention to the key points affecting the various budget headings of the Financial Perspective."
"I will begin with heading 1, concerning agricultural expenditure."
"Let me stress my appreciation for the agreement that we reached to adjust the Financial Perspective ceiling for 2006."
"That will allow a transfer of EUR 655 million from market expenditure in subheading 1a to rural development in subheading 1b."
"Regarding appropriations, the Council has made an across-the-board reduction in commitments and payments of EUR 150 million, affecting budget lines in subheading 1a greater than EUR 50 million."
"That reduction is designed to take account of under-implementation in recent years."
"However, the Council's position will be reviewed – and this is an important point – in the light of updated forecasts due in the autumn Amending Letter to the PDB."
"I must stress that this modest reduction is in line with the Council's overall approach of controlled growth of payment appropriations, which should apply to both compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"The Council has accepted in full the amount proposed by the Commission for subheading 1b, where it believes the implementation is more effective."
"Turning to heading 2, on structural operations, the Council has adopted the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission consistent with the European Council's conclusions of March 1999 in Berlin and of December 2002 in Copenhagen."
"Payment appropriations have been reduced across the board by a total of EUR 150 million, which reflects the Council's view of the expected implementation rate and is based on past evidence of implementation shortfalls, taking full account of the significant and welcome improvements achieved recently."
"The reduction is applied to both structural funds and to Community initiatives."
"In heading 3, on internal policies, the Council accepted the amounts proposed in commitments for multiannual programmes adopted under the codecision procedure, as agreed following enlargement, as well as the specific amounts relating to Copenhagen commitments."
"However, the Council limited commitment appropriations for some budget lines that are not based on multiannual programmes such as those based on Commission prerogatives, pilot projects and preparatory actions."
"Those decisions followed the Council's examinations of activity statements, which are fast becoming a very important analytical tool."
"In addition, the Council limited the increase of appropriation for the subsidies of certain decentralised agencies."
"It is right that established agencies should face the same budgetary rigour that we expect of central institutions and, indeed, of our own domestic organisations."
"However, it is also fair to allow more significant increases for new and developing agencies."
"The draft budget seeks to make that distinction."
"In considering the level of payment appropriations for heading 3, Council took full account of the need to increase payments, especially for the important research lines that will help to underpin the very important – the central – Lisbon reform agenda."
"However, the Council could not ignore the past implementation record for this heading."
"We suggest there is limited capacity to absorb increases effectively and efficiently."
"In this environment, the Council believes that it would be irresponsible to budget the huge increases proposed in the PDB of nearly 12% across that particular heading."
"The Council has reduced the overall increase to a more manageable and realistic 5%."
"But, very importantly, we should be aware that the draft budget still permits a very substantial increase – and I want to reiterate this – of nearly 12% for research lines, which reflects the priority accorded to this very important policy area."
"The Council has provided adequate funding for heading 3 and established a sensible margin of EUR 210 million under the ceiling."
"I am sure that Parliament will want to keep the same budget discipline principles in mind when considering priorities for this heading."
"I want to move now from heading 3 to heading 4: External actions."
"The Council was concerned to respect the ceilings of the Financial Perspective."
"Consistent with the Interinstitutional Agreement, the Council took the view that all possibilities for re-allocation must be exhausted prior to a proposal to deploy the flexibility instrument."
"You will not be surprised to hear that the Council did not share the Commission's view that re-allocation had been exhausted in the PDB."
"The Council fully supported the Community pledges and consequential budget proposals for the reconstruction needs in Tsunami-affected countries and in Iraq, and it respected the reference amounts for codecided programmes."
"It also accepted the amount for CFSP, as proposed in the PDB."
"However, the Council took the view that there was still scope to bring total expenditure within the budget ceiling and achieved this by a very modest across-the-board reduction in commitments to the remaining chapters, including, for example, for international fisheries agreements."
"A slightly smaller reduction was applied to Afghanistan, which still allows the Community to meet its multiannual pledge for reconstruction assistance."
"After these adjustments, the margin available under heading 4 is EUR 41.65 million, which should allow the financing of the consequences of the forthcoming sugar reforms along the lines we expect the Commission to propose."
"Again, we share a common belief that it is absolutely essential to make a success of sugar reform."
"I hope that we will be able to reach agreement on the final amount for the CFSP budget and the international fisheries agreements in the course of the second reading of the budget for 2006, as foreseen in the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"You can rest assured that we, the presidency, will make every effort to provide the appropriate information about CFSP to the European Parliament on time and in an appropriate form."
"I am sure you would agree that much progress has been made in recent times in relation to that particular issue."
"Moving on now to heading 5, on administrative expenditure, the draft budget aims to respect the ceiling of the Financial Perspective once again and set an adequate margin for unforeseen events."
"With this in mind, the Council established a margin of EUR 130 million, to be achieved through savings in operating costs from interinstitutional cooperation and from budget reductions, to reflect the current vacancy rate for the various institutions."
"The Council's approach was objective and pragmatic, although we can never expect any institution to be entirely satisfied inevitably by the outcome of our analysis."
"The Council accepted the vast majority of the new posts requested by the institutions for enlargement, pre-enlargement and new tasks."
"However, it is true that we applied a modest reduction to take account of the significant delay in recruitment for posts granted in previous years."
"The Council expressed deep concern about recruitment delays and about the need – the centrality – for there to be geographical balance following enlargement."
"I know that Parliament shares these concerns."
"It is regrettable that, due to time constraints, we could not agree a jointly-worded statement on this issue on 15 July, but I have every reason to believe that we can still reach such an agreement which would make it absolutely clear that Parliament and the Council are as one in terms of recruitment and retention, of human resource policies."
"We have recently received a paper from the Commissioner, which we will be considering over the next few weeks, to inform our position on the question of administration and more specifically of posts."
"Moving on now to heading 7, the pre-accession strategy, the Council accepted the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission."
"However we limited the increase for payment appropriations for some budget lines, again taking into account past implementation rates."
"Finally, as regards heading 8, on compensations, the Council accepted the full amounts proposed by the Commission in the PDB, which will help ensure that the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council as regards new Member States are properly fulfilled."
"We believe that this draft budget adequately responds to the European Union's various priorities, making the finances available, but it also respects the important principle of budgetary discipline and sound management of which we – the Council and Parliament – are joint custodians."
"We meet today in an environment where it is more important than ever that we rebuild, that we strengthen the relationship between the European Union, its institutions and the people of Europe."
"Central to that relationship is the credibility of the way we do our business."
"Key to that credibility is the way that we manage our finances, to demonstrate that we are efficient, that we are prudent, but also that we jointly spend money in a way that adds value to the everyday quality of life of the people who live in the European Union."
"We have to close the gap between rhetoric and reality, because one of our great challenges – those of us who believe passionately in the importance of the European Union – is that often people do not see the work that is done in Parliament, the Commission, the Council as making any difference or being relevant to their everyday concerns about their quality of life and standard of living."
"Therefore, it is very important, in the context not only of 2006 but also of the debate on the Financial Perspective for the years ahead, that we constantly have in mind the importance of linking our actions, our words and the decisions that we make with the centrality of making sure that we rebuild and strengthen public confidence and support in the whole function, the work and vision which underpins the European Union."
"A very good place to start would be to reach in a mature way a consensual agreement on the 2006 budget."
"We have major challenges ahead, but we can bridge the gap on that issue – there are significant gaps in some of the budget headings, as we will hear in the debate this afternoon, and very strong differences of opinion about the best way forward."
"However, I believe that in the next few weeks we should be seeking to bridge those gaps."
"We should be seeking to achieve some level of consensus, which will inevitably require compromise."
"If we can do that, it will be a very important building block in terms of the challenges which lie ahead, in terms of the necessary reforms to the way that we budget and make decisions about the future."
"Many of you will have been present when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom made his speech to Parliament very early on in the presidency."
"I think there was general agreement among everybody present – whatever their political ideology, whatever their views – as he outlined the reform agenda and his determination that we achieve that in partnership, that his was a fair analysis of where Europe is now and that now is the time to grasp the nettle and deal with some of the fundamental issues about the future nature of the European Union and its relationship with its citizens."
"The 2006 budget may – in the context of that big-picture debate – feel like a relatively small issue."
"However, if we can reach some level of agreement, if we can show that we can achieve compromise in the interests of continuing progress in these areas, that will go down very well."
"It will be very well received by those who closely observe the way that we do our business."
"I am pleased, Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, to close my remarks and to commend the draft budget to the European Parliament this afternoon."
"On behalf of everyone here, I thank Mr Lewis, who, on behalf of the Council, has presented the draft general budget for 2006."
"The next item is a general debate on the European Union general budget for 2006."
". Mr President, Mr Lewis’ presentation today of the 2006 budget has confirmed the impression that Parliament’s delegation took away from the Conciliation Committee meeting held on 15 July."
"Contrary to its name, this meeting resembled a cataloguing of differences rather than a conciliation process."
"It is indeed true that no one expects consensus to have been reached at this point in the year, but it cannot be denied that the standpoints of the EU’s two budgetary authorities on the 2006 budget are poles apart."
"Even the consensus that has been reached on important but secondary issues, such as modulation, or in other words the transfer of funds to the tune of EUR 655 million from Heading 1 to rural development, cannot hide this fact."
"Our goal is to reach agreement on the budget, but this task will be far from easy."
"The European Parliament is a political body, the members of which, having entered into a contract with their voters one year ago, are mindful of their commitments."
"Much was said at the time, and is still said, about the need to complete EU enlargement and to invest in cohesion to this end, as well as about the need to breathe fresh life into the Lisbon Strategy and to fund the EU’s new ambitions on the international stage."
"At the same time, however, there is no getting away from the fact that we also committed ourselves to strict budgetary discipline one year ago."
"The voting public is firm in its condemnation of undisciplined and hence wasteful spending, yet political ambitions and goals that lack financial backing are nothing but hollow words."
"Parliament must consider the 2006 budget in terms of the experience it gained last year."
"With our backs to the wall, so to speak, we agreed to a level of payments that falls short of our needs in 2005, as has already become clear from the level of expenditure so far this year."
"Furthermore, the 2006 budget must be regarded as a stepping stone to a new Financial Perspective."
"It was with these two factors in mind that we decided that the Commission’s initial proposals of 1.02% of GNI, which is nearly EUR 7 billion below the ceiling set in the Financial Perspective for 2006, were unsatisfactory."
"A huge gap exists between these 2006 budget proposals and the Commission’s proposals for payments in 2007, which will be the first year of the new Financial Perspective."
"This means that it is even more difficult to understand or tolerate the cuts made by the Council, taking payments to just over 1% of GNI."
"This year we have seen the Council taking a more selective and less mechanical approach to budgetary cuts, and I should like to dwell very briefly on the individual headings in turn."
"The modulation that has been agreed from Heading 1 can be counted as a joint success."
"At the same time, however, we expect the Commission to put forward proposals regarding agricultural spending in the long term, as a basis for further discussion."
"Parliament has not been slow to notice that cohesion emerged relatively unscathed from the Council’s cuts, but the preliminary reports that have reached us on the Structural Funds suggest that use of the Funds in 2005 will not correspond to the level specified in the Council’s draft, but will be equal to, if not higher than, the Commission’s initial proposal."
"The pressure is starting to be felt most in Heading 3, that is to say in the field of internal policies, where the largest cuts in relative terms have been made, amounting to over EUR 500 million."
"This makes a nonsense of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, which include investment in research and in small and medium-sized enterprises, and will also make it impossible for Parliament to implement its priorities."
"As far as Heading IV is concerned, however, it is not so much Parliament’s priorities that are in conflict, but the British Presidency’s own statements."
"The arbitrary cuts of around 4% that have been made to all areas, with the exception of the much-favoured common foreign and security policy, will make it impossible for us to meet the never-ending stream of fresh challenges."
"The latter will not merely relate to the tsunami-hit countries or to Iraq and Afghanistan, since the need will arise to fund assistance for other regions affected by natural disasters."
"Compensation for sugar producers presents us with a further problem, and the Commission has also raised the issue of administrative expenses, with the possibility of a freeze on the recruitment of employees from the new Member States."
"To sum up, our debate on the 2006 budget is taking place against a general backdrop of pessimism."
"Yet the European Union is in urgent need of good news, and agreement on both the 2006 budget and sensible figures for the Financial Perspective would be exactly the news it has been hoping for."
"Such agreement could serve to renew people’s faith in the European Union, and it is our common responsibility and task to ensure that it is achieved."
". – Mr President, Mr Lewis, Mrs Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, our warmth towards the UK Presidency does not discharge us from the duty of expressing our disappointment with regard to the budget proposal that has been presented to us."
"As pointed out by President Lewandowski, we expressed our disappointment very sincerely and firmly back in July, at the Conciliation Committee."
"We therefore also confirm today that – while we appreciate the speech by Mr Lewis, with its openness and the delicacy of its expression – all this needs to be translated into definite choices."
"There is, unfortunately, a blatant contradiction between the passionate words spoken by Prime Minister Blair in this assembly and the choices the Council has made regarding the budget."
"The cuts in the budget – or, if you prefer, your budget forecasts – in relation to the agricultural sector and the Structural Funds, although more limited than last year, confirm the tendency towards an unjustified severity."
"If adopted, they would open the door to adjustments during the year, accentuating the divide between expectations, which are, moreover, reinforced by a good funds implementation capacity, and the inadequacy of the resources themselves."
"With regard to internal and external policies, our worries become fears: we are not convinced, Mr Lewis, by the symmetry between the funds allocated for commitments, which have been reduced by a lesser degree than the payment appropriations, nor can an analysis of the most significant cuts provide an explanation in terms of the political message that we all want to give."
"This is how the figures add up: 21 million less for businesses; 33 million less for transport; 279 million less for research; 131 million less for information; 20 million less for education and culture and 8 million less for freedom, security and justice."
"There is an inconsistency between declarations in favour of growth, employment and measures designed to help young people, on the one hand, and on the other hand the reduction of funds in the budget headings, which are vital for achieving these objectives."
"I would like to ask you, Mr Lewis, what all of this means."
"Does it mean that these policies are vital, but must be implemented by the national governments alone?"
"This is the impression that I have; if it is right, then we are in direct conflict, since these policies must be implemented by the European Union too, in so far as they possess added European value."
"In my view, this is the fundamental political problem that we need to clarify first of all in order to take consistent action."
"With regard to heading 4 – the notorious heading of ‘External actions’ – we are demanding that the flexibility instrument be used: with the estimates for heading 4 made beneath the maximum ceiling, as you are asking for, it is not possible to follow up on the traditional priorities of the European Union, the Millennium Goals, emergencies that have arisen over the course of the years – from Iraq to Afghanistan, the tsunami, horizontal programmes and geographical programmes, and now we want, rightly, to add sugar to the list."
"How is it possible to do all this?"
"And what about the dozens of other measures that have been planned, and I say again, rightly so, as external actions?"
"How can we implement such measures with a reduced financial allocation, without even applying the flexibility instrument?"
"I have the impression, and I shall use a proverb to express myself, that you want to have your cake and eat it."
"We are worried and disappointed, but we continue to ask for more reflection on your part and we await, Commissioner, more determined pressure from the European Commission."
"Within this Parliament, in our midst, the idea is growing of a shake-up, of action taken not on impulse but in a considered manner, to open up people’s eyes and recall everyone to their duties."
"We have received no comforting signals on the financial perspective; in fact, I should say that we have received no signals at all."
"This, obviously, increases our concerns and the wave of scepticism among citizens; you rightly referred to citizens as – let us say – the main target of our actions, but among citizens there is enormous scepticism, because the European Union has not put itself in a position to implement its policies."
"Has the UK Presidency perhaps decided to give up on financial perspectives without even giving them a try?"
"Knowing the determination with which Prime Minister Blair faces his battles, we would have expected different signals and we continue to await them."
"But time and deadlines wait for no man: as Mr Blair well knows, faced with the European crisis, to merely scrape by would amount to giving up entirely."
"We in Parliament, and we hope that Prime Minister Blair and the UK Presidency feel the same, cannot stand passively by while Europe declines."
". – Mr President, Mr Lewis, Mrs Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Lewis for his presentation of the budget of the other EU institutions for 2006."
"Clearly, the European Parliament and the Council have different approaches on certain issues regarding the drafting of the budget, but there are also various common threads."
"Both institutions with budgetary decision-making powers endorse the principles of budgetary discipline and the rational use of EU taxpayers’ money."
"The Council is proposing to reduce the administrative expenditure of the EU institutions by 120 million euro as compared with the institutions’ original requests."
"It must be said, however, that in many cases this reduction has been implemented in an ill-considered manner, without thorough examination of the specific nature and problems of the institutions’ work."
"For this reason, the European Parliament will be proposing a review of the reduction in the institutions’ expenditure, assessing each institution’s budget request and new tasks in 2006 on its individual merits."
"It is important to ensure the requisite financing for one of the priorities of the EU budget for 2006, which is preparation for the next round of European Union enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join."
"I believe that the European Union institutions need to adopt a harmonised approach to the hiring of staff from the new Member States."
"With regard to the European Parliament budget, we should note that tomorrow the European Parliament’s Presidium will adopt a decision on the European Parliament draft budget for 2006, which it will forward for consideration by the Committee on Budgets."
"As the budget rapporteur, I believe that the Committee on Budgets will need additional information on various matters in order to be able to take each decision on its own merits, particularly in relation to the European Parliament’s information and communication policy."
"Once again I would like to stress the principle that the level of joint expenditure in the European Parliament budget ought to be set in accordance with needs that have been established following careful evaluation."
"Achieving a ceiling of 20% of joint administrative expenditure is not an end in itself."
"Finally, I would like to add a few words about the European Union general budget for 2006."
"The Council’s proposal to reduce payment appropriations for EU structural funds for 2006 by 150 million euro is incomprehensible."
"Such an approach is indicative of the Council’s unwillingness to fully finance those commitments which the EU has undertaken within the framework of the existing financial perspective."
"Bearing in mind the fact that 2006 is the last year of the current financial perspective, it is important to ensure a successful conclusion to existing programmes and to set a volume of commitment and payment appropriations for the 2006 budget that corresponds with the commitments which the European Union has undertaken."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the opportunity offered to me today to express my opinion concerning the first proposal by the Council, especially since as early as last June following the first reading we had a chance to exchange our views with Parliament and the Council, as well as with the representatives of political groups of the European Parliament."
"I would like to share the idea held by most speakers that the 2006 budget is a special one, as it is the last of the current Financial Perspective drawn up by the Commission seeking to most comprehensively and realistically take into consideration the most pressing needs of the European Union, to complete all the important projects and to prepare well for the new financial period."
"Therefore, in response to the proposal of the Council, I would like to immediately define three areas that in the Commission’s opinion are the most challenging."
"Having first outlined the importance of the European budget for 2006, I should like to focus on three main areas in which the Commission thinks that the major concerns need to be addressed and resolved by all three institutions, including the budgetary authorities in particular."
"Our main concerns relate to Heading 3, where we think that the reductions proposed by the Council are not justified and cannot be supported by the Commission, mainly because the requirements and the amounts proposed by the Commission were based on projects already committed and ongoing."
"We think that such reductions will create many problems for the payment of bills for ongoing projects in the Community in 2006 for the Member States."
"Furthermore, half of the proposed reductions in payment appropriations are concentrated on activities which represent only about 10% of the total budget."
"Surprisingly, no justification is given for concentrating the reductions in this way."
"In Heading 4 the reductions proposed by the Council will create at least three serious problems."
"First of all, the reduction goes against the decisions taken by the General Affairs Council itself, especially regarding post-tsunami reconstruction in Asia and the renewed commitment to the Millennium Development Goals."
"Second, in relation to recent developments in the world, we expect, and have already had indications, that Europe will be asked to assist in the disengagement process from Gaza."
"The third problem concerns the negotiations on the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"All these three elements make it more difficult to accept or look favourably upon the Council's proposal."
"The question of Heading 5 was raised and discussed at length at the 15 July meeting between the three institutions."
"As promised, on Friday I sent to both budgetary authorities additional information on the progress of recruitment from EU-10 and EU-15."
"By 31 July this year, 90% of the recruitment targets from new Member States had been fulfilled."
"We believe that the proposed reductions forwarded by the Council are the result of a misunderstanding between us and may well derive from a technical error."
"We very much expect that, before second reading, we will be able to engage in consultations with the Council in particular in an effort to resolve this issue."
"The proposal on the table today means that for 2006 not only will we be unable to recruit from EU-10, but we will be stopping all recruitment in the Commission, as well as lacking the resources to pay salaries for existing staff levels."
"Taking all this into account and in reply to Mrs Pittella's request that the Commission take as forceful an approach as possible to this proposal, let me say that we are committed to resolving all possible questions in cooperation with the budgetary authorities."
"I call on all sides to show goodwill in this endeavour, as it will be greatly needed if we are to finalise the deal for this year."
". (Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on 15 June 2005 I had a chance to participate in the conciliation meeting of the European Parliament and the Council in Brussels, prior to which the European Parliament had passed a resolution clearly manifesting the position of this European Union institution and its priorities in the formation of the 2006 budget."
"Despite the criticism then expressed by the European Parliament concerning insufficient appropriations for commitments and payments, on 15 July 2005 the ECOFIN Council decided to propose a reduction of allocations for payments by EUR 1.1 billion and commitment appropriations by EUR 478 million as compared to the Preliminary Draft Budget."
"This proposal, in my opinion, clearly demonstrates that the Council virtually disregards the actual needs and commitments of the European Union."
"I would like to remind you that the above resolution of the European Parliament stipulates that the Preliminary Draft Budget presented by the Commission is insufficient and fails from a budgetary viewpoint to reflect commonly agreed-upon political ambitions, in particular those related to the Lisbon Strategy and the need to support small and medium-seized enterprises."
"We also invited the Council to enter into a serious and constructive dialogue with the European Parliament concerning the ways to fulfil these political commitments."
"It is impossible to reach our policy goals, that is, growth of the economy and enhancement of competitiveness, without increased allocations for research, innovation and SMEs, which account for about 90 of all enterprises of the European Union."
"We, the European Parliament, have stressed before and would like to point out once again the important external assistance programmes that could not be foreseen while considering the current financial perspective, for instance those related to Afghanistan and Iraq, and the recently proposed post-tsunami reconstruction package."
"In the Preliminary Draft Budget, expenditure heading IV ‘External Actions’ was already insufficiently funded in our opinion."
"And now the Council proposes a further reduction of allocations under this heading."
"I would also like to draw your attention to other alarming reductions related to specific thematic and geographical measures."
"I believe that the budget amounts and resources must be reconciled anew."
"I would also like to emphasise the importance of the European Neighbourhood Policy including support to democratic developments in the neighbouring States."
"I must reiterate that the accession of ten new Member States in 2004, which is only the beginning of a long-lasting cohesion process, is a new challenge to the cohesion policy, meaning that the implementation of the cohesion policy should focus on regions in order to avoid possible future conflicts between the new Member States and the less developed regions of the EU-15."
"I would like to conclude by once again calling on the Council to be guided by the priorities established by the European Parliament in drafting the 2006 budget."
"I strongly believe that there is no need to remind you that the European Parliament is the only European institution directly elected by EU citizens and in accordance with EU law has been assigned a mission in the formation and implementation of the European Union budget."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Development, I have to say that I regard the budget with which the Council has presented us as unsatisfactory."
"I say that with particular reference to the EUR 150 million cut – for that is what I call it – in payments."
"Over recent years, we have endeavoured, by introducing the N+2 rules, to tie expenditure very closely to commitments and to ensure that the money is actually spent."
"We are, basically, being penalised for our efforts by seeing how there is EUR 150 million less available for payments."
"We are, though, also punishing ourselves, the European Union as a whole, for, at some point in time, we will be called on to stand by the commitments we have made."
"We have always, as a matter of policy, kept the gap between payments and commitments from getting too large."
"In the preliminary draft budget, the Commission really has made only the absolute minimum necessary available in terms of funding for structural policy."
"We want to get them restored, and I urge the Council to follow our lead in this."
". The Council wants to reduce the budget of the European Union by half a billion euros compared to the Commission’s proposal."
"This is in itself unacceptable, but what is particularly unacceptable is the fact that more than one third of these cuts relate to external relations and external affairs."
"The proposed reduction in expenditures on external affairs is ten times greater than in any other area."
"The successes and achievements of the European Union to date have been related in no small measure to external relations."
"We are proud of enlargement, and of our aid policy; we are proud of the fact that we are the world’s biggest donor."
"These priorities are nevertheless absent from the draft, and most conspicuously so from the Council proposals."
"Indeed, not only are they absent; the reductions would affect these programmes most of all."
"Yet I believe that today we very much need to be able to demonstrate successes."
"Europe, the European Union is crying out for such successes."
"However, there is also another problem."
"We are failing to take our own principles seriously; we have failed to do so up to now, and we are failing to do so in this draft."
"The Council has virtually never invoked the human rights clause."
"We support a multitude of countries that make a mockery of democracy and human rights."
"And yet we have a tool at our disposal to do something, since the human rights clause provides the possibility of withdrawing support from countries that fail to observe human rights and the rule of law and it also allows us to increase the support we give to countries that observe these rules."
"One example would be the countries of the western Balkans."
"You, on the other hand, propose making even greater reductions in the support we provide to the western Balkan countries than in overall spending on foreign affairs."
"And yet it is in our fundamental interest to stabilise the western Balkan region."
"It is incomprehensible that the Council should want to give 5% less to this region, and 8% less to Serbia, for example, than in the previous year."
"At the same time, it is very generous as regards European special envoys, whose budget has been set to double over two years."
"In other words, there is to be an increase in something that is of questionable necessity, while at the same time there are to be reductions affecting things that we vitally need."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lewis, when weighing up the draft budget for 2006, we cannot fail to notice that it is a transitional one, and that is what makes it so crucial in terms of the further priorities and ambitions that we share – or, at any rate, should share."
"It is for that reason that I will be forthright in criticising the Council proposal on one score: it is far too cautious and envisages cuts that are massive when seen alongside those proposed by the Commission."
"In order to make clear what I mean by calling this budget transitional, let us take a look at the Böge report and at what we expect of the Financial Perspective."
"There is a major difference between us and the Council; it adds up to EUR 106 billion in the Financial Perspective."
"We believe that, in order to make Europe truly fit for the future, we have to focus on quite specific target areas: research, education, youth, cultural interchange in an enlarged Europe, the environment and renewable energies – and I have recent events in New Orleans in mind when I say that."
"A look at the budget figures in Parliament’s financial perspective and, now, in the Council draft for 2006 reveals that they diverge to a marked degree: the Financial Perspective makes EUR 10 billion available for research, but the Council a mere EUR 4 billion; there are EUR 2 billion for education, culture and young people, over against the Council’s mere EUR 0.8 billion for the same period."
"For energy and transport, Parliament has proposed EUR 2.5 billion, but the Council no more than EUR 1.3 billion."
"From that alone, it is apparent that the Council’s proposals for the 2006 financial year are timid, cautious and lacking virtually any concept of future direction."
"As I see it, the draft budget for 2006 ought, instead, to be a sort of bridge extending into the years that are to come, from 2007 to 2013, and so putting forward such timid and paltry budget estimates as the Council has done is the wrong way to go about things."
"The figures it has quoted to us bear no relation either to the pious utterance about Lisbon as a means of renewal or to the great economic potential that we have to rebuild."
"If I may turn to the communications strategy, let me say that, especially after the failure of the referenda, it must surely be in our interest to do more in 2006, rather than to cut payments or make less use of the flexibility instrument."
"I find it incomprehensible in political terms how, in the face of the many challenges we have to contend with across the globe, the Council can be so timid and cautious in its handling of the flexibility instrument, instead of demonstrating the European Union’s willingness to be a global player in meeting the needs of the world’s many crisis hotspots."
". Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, for several years now I have represented my group and the European Parliament in the July budget conciliation procedure, which is conducted with the Member States after the first reading by the Council."
"It has always been difficult to agree on anything in the summer, but this year it was especially difficult."
"In practical terms, nothing was agreed on, and, as a result, Parliament is free to undertake its own first reading without any commitments to the Council."
"From my group’s point of view, the basic problems are the low level of budget payment appropriations and the budget’s main areas of focus."
"In the Council there is a group of so-called net contributing countries, which are not interested in the value added that results from financing the Union by way of different joint projects."
"Virtually the only thing that the Council seems to be actively interested in financing is the militarisation of the EU."
"Although warfare does not fall within the competence of the EU, the Member States want to finance joint militarisation projects with EU money."
"As far as I understand, the Congo police operation and the mission in Sudan are being financed out of development appropriations, and the funding of militarisation activities is therefore not transparent."
"Although the Constitution, which was rejected in two referenda, is not immediately forthcoming, the political elite in the Member States are implementing some of the articles contained in it, and are establishing, for example, an Armaments, Research and Capabilities Agency."
"The way that the Member States behave is undemocratic, and it is very obvious that many EU joint military activities have no legal basis in the Treaties."
"Instead of the militarisation of the EU, we should start to talk about building a social Europe."
"Only that way will the work of the Union acquire legitimacy, which is to say the general approval of the public."
"In the name of a social Europe, our group has continually criticised the narrow scope of the Lisbon Strategy; because it merely promotes a Europe of major companies."
"We recently criticised the way the Council has kept its eyes and ears firmly closed and cut expenditure, even when compared to the Commission’s draft budget, with the aim of reducing appropriations in the budget to 1% of the Gross National Income of the EU states."
"Stringent budgetary discipline is a good thing, but in this case the Council is advocating a sound thrashing."
"A strategic objective is also there for us all to see."
"In the event of no agreement being reached on the financial frameworks and the matter being referred to the budgetary procedure within the meaning of Article 272 of the Treaty, the grand total for the 2006 budget must, from the point of view of the Council, be as small as possible."
"This is a strategic objective that we cannot accept."
"Our group is also concerned about the strategy whereby the costs of sudden and unexpected expenditure, such as that relating to the tsunami, are to be covered by allocating for new purposes money that had been set aside for purposes approved by Parliament."
"If new, external needs arise, we have to be prepared to allocate new, ‘fresh’ money for them."
"Finally, I wish to say that we need to safeguard Structural Funds payments and increase human resources for the needs of enlargement."
"It is very difficult for us in Parliament to understand the conflict which prevails between the Commission and the Council with regard to their views on personnel requirements and the need for increased human resources as a result of enlargement."
". Mr President, I became a member of the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means where I argued in favour of our keeping to 1% of GDP."
"In view of this, I do not believe we should decide that the surplus from the 2004 budget should be used for expenditure in the 2005 budget."
"I do not believe that the structural fund, which is already growing in size through this expenditure, needs to become larger."
"It already amounts to more than EUR 8 billion."
"I do not therefore agree that I am expressing my displeasure at money not being spent."
"There are obviously reasons for money not being spent, and there is therefore nothing to be lost in examining issues extremely carefully when it comes to new expenditure."
"I am not, however, prepared to return these surpluses to the Member States. I believe, instead, that these funds should be used for the flexibility margin which, in my view, is too small."
"Otherwise, we shall often end up in situations in which we have to acknowledge that we cannot do what is necessary."
"We cannot foresee the future."
"I therefore believe that these resources should be used for developing the flexibility margin and not for developing structural funds."
". Madam President, when the foundations of the European Communities were laid over half a century ago, Poland and the other new Member States were part of the Soviet bloc."
"Our only option was to look on enviously as past conflicts were overcome by means of economic cooperation."
"We believed at the time, and we continue to believe today, that development and solidarity are the main goals of the European Union, which Poland eventually joined."
"Yet any satisfaction one might derive from this fact is marred by developments that are now becoming ever more evident in certain net payer countries."
"These developments are a result not only of an economic slow-down, but also of governing principles of action."
"Excessive labour costs are reducing the competitiveness of these economies, and their overregulation leads to budgetary deficits."
"In turn, the latter make these countries more inclined to cut back on their payments to the EU."
"The current state of progress on the 2006 EU budget is a cause for great concern."
"The Council has once again made cuts to the Commission’s proposal, reducing it by over EUR 1 billion to 1.01% of GNI."
"This is a bad sign, all the more so because the deadlock on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 has also not been broken."
"If the Financial Perspective has not been adopted by spring of next year, the reduced 2006 budget could serve as the basis for future budgets, and the worrying developments I mentioned a short time ago could persist for many years."
"There are currently two approaches to the issue of EU finances."
"The first of these favours spending on development to the detriment of agricultural subsidies, whilst the second gives preference to the social dimension of the EU project over the Lisbon Strategy."
"It would appear that the first of these approaches promotes development at the expense of solidarity, whereas the second promotes solidarity at the expense of development, but it would be mistaken to believe that development and solidarity are alternatives to each other."
"Such a belief would merely boost selfish national interests, and, in so doing, result in a disastrous compromise that delivers neither development nor solidarity."
"Furthermore, it would make real the utopia of ‘more Europe for less money’."
"The main reason why the determination of certain net payers to cut their spending is so worrying is that it poses a threat to the EU’s fundamental goals, namely development and solidarity."
"Unlike in previous years, the European Commission has presented a cautious 2006 draft budget for the European Union."
"Compared with 2005, the European Commission proposed a 4% increase in commitments and a 5.9% increase in payments."
"As a percentage of the GNP, this amounts to just 2% in the case of payments, which is far below the imaginary ceiling of the long-term financial perspective."
"The draft budget for 2006 further widened the gap between the commitments and the payments, as well as between available resources of national budgets and the EU budget."
"The lack of funds to cover key EU policies has therefore been a subject of criticism in the first stage of the discussion about the proposed budget in the European Parliament."
"This is the reason why the budget proposed by the Council came as a cold shower, as it leaves no room for manoeuvre between the proposals of the European Commission and of the European Council."
"A more detailed analysis of adjustments to the budget of the European Commission shows that an overriding majority of 51 items in which the European Council has intervened compared with 2005 (46 items) maintain the trend set in the European Commission’s draft budget."
"Council’s interventions therefore evoke the impression of a technocratic reduction in expenditures under the motto ‘let us cut by one half the increase in expenditures exceeding those of 2005’, and the motto ‘let us take away more where the expenditures are lower than in 2005’."
"This approach by the European Council undermines the atmosphere of mutual trust in the current budgeting process, and could lead to a protracted position war between the key institutions of the European Union."
"Madam President, budgets are about priorities and for the Committee on Regional Development and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, pride of place among these goes to the Millennium Objectives."
"One in five people worldwide have no access to basic education or basic health care, and the chasm is growing every day despite all the pledges by Heads of Government."
"Europe is the world’s largest donor and can make the difference."
"That is why we are not asking for more funds in the first instance, but we are asking, within the EU’s aid budget, for priority to be given to the Millennium Objectives."
"At least 35% of the budget should be spent on these, at least 20% of which should go to basic education and basic health care."
"Within the various geographical budget lines, we have set aside 20% for those two sectors, and we will not hand this over to the Commission until they have shown us specific plans for basic education and basic health care in those regions."
"In 2003, only 2.3% of the development budget was spent on education and 5.2% on health care."
"That is unacceptable."
"Today, with the help of the Committee on Budgets, we want to bring the Millennium Objectives closer. ‘Make poverty history’."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Lewis, except when it comes to the foreign budget, agreeing on the 2006 budget really ought, of course, to be a simple matter, for there is plenty of room for the increases requested by the Commission within the ceiling of the financial perspectives."
"The finance ministers have, however, almost ritually sat down together and slashed away at every possible area. These have primarily been within foreign policy, but payments to structural funds and for internal policy have also to bear the brunt, and that is rather surprising in the light of the far better implementation we have seen in recent years of, for example, the structural fund programmes."
"Research has been cut back, as have the funds for supporting other projects within the framework of the Lisbon process that EU Heads of State no doubt still want to keep going."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe particularly regret the slashing of programmes for developing small and medium-sized businesses – programmes that, for example, help the banks make credit available to small businesses in the new Member States where, with limited resources, a large dispersal effect has been achieved, benefiting economic development."
"We must also deeply regret savings within the transport area, including those in relation to the new agencies for aviation and maritime safety."
"Clearly, nothing is too small to escape the axe."
"Even the subsidy for the successful programme for developing medicines to combat rare diseases is at the receiving end."
"Mr Lewis spoke of dialogue, and I do hope we can obtain dialogue and cooperation. Unfortunately, we are likely to see a situation in which the budget has to be debated with no agreement on the framework for the 2007-2013 budget."
"– Madam President, one of the great orators of Athens, Demosthenes, said, 'money is the root of everything'."
"I am sorry if perhaps you have never heard this and it is not easy to translate, but it means that, without money, nothing is possible."
"We cannot do a thing."
"With the 1% of GDP destined for the budget, policy is impossible."
"Europe is getting poor."
"We have a poorer household than at any other time."
"We import lemons from Chile, garlic from Tunisia, hazelnuts from Turkey and clothes from China."
"There is no development."
"We cannot get Europe out of poverty."
"It is ruining us."
"Europe is getting poor."
"We need to change policy but, instead of changing policy, we go along with Mr Blair, who says that we cannot give money to 4% of the population, to the farmers, even though the 4% feed the other 96%."
"Are we only going to pay money for computers?"
"This is the wrong policy."
"We are budgeting for nations, not for computers; we are not budgeting for numbers."
"Think about the people."
"They are the ones who vote for us, they have the last word."
"Madam President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is concerned about the cuts made by the Council in crucial areas relating to Europe’s influence in external matters."
"Natural disasters such as the tsunami cannot be alleviated by making drastic cuts in areas of political significance."
"This budget reduces the amounts allocated to the European initiative for democracy and human rights and to Latin America and provides insufficient funding for the Neighbourhood Policy in MEDA and for Eastern European countries."
"We cannot accept it."
"We firmly suggest to the Council that it makes use of the flexibility instrument."
"Furthermore, even though it is the moment for making savings, the number of foreign representatives from the EU is growing at an impressive rate, without Parliament being informed as to the relevance of those appointments."
"We will request additional information from the Council before offering our opinion on this expenditure."
"Finally, we insist before the Council, as we did before the Commission, that the budget allocated to the reconstruction of Iraq is entirely managed by the United Nations and not in part by the World Bank Trust Fund, as Parliament has already requested on two occasions."
"Madam President, Mr Szent-Iványi and I have tabled an amendment to reduce the amount for CFSP by 3.87%."
"Such a reduction would bring it into line with all the other external action components, which the Council has reduced by an average of - you have guessed it - 3.87%."
"My Group does not understand why the Council chooses to let external action bear the brunt of the cuts, and points to the inconsistency of reducing the amounts for prevention, stabilisation and democracy-building, while maintaining the amounts for security policy proper."
"I draw your attention to our amendment, in the hope of provoking the Council into giving a serious explanation for these cuts in the external actions appropriation, which are much too drastic."
"The Minister said that the Council found that there was still more room for reappropriation, and that is what it has done."
"With all due respect to the Minister, we find this explanation unconvincing."
"In the absence of any serious justification, I am inclined to believe that these reductions express the half-heartedness of the Member States in entrusting the EU with a strong foreign policy of its own, not to mention the absence of clarity on the roles and responsibilities of the Commission, the Council, the European Council and the High Representative in these matters."
"Madam President, everyone acknowledges the role aid can play in improving development, and President Barroso himself promised EUR 300 million more for aid for trade at the G8 Summit this year."
"As the budget spokesman for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I asked the Commission how much we currently spend on aid for trade, and it took them two weeks to work it out, because it is currently spread over around 120 different budget lines."
"In fact, we spend around EUR 700 million already."
"The Trade Committee believes that we need to bring more visibility to aid for trade, that we need to make it easier to mobilise aid for trade and that we need to send the right signal in advance of the WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in Hong Kong in December that we take aid for trade seriously."
"We are therefore going to propose the creation of a new budget line called 'Aid for Trade'."
"A very modest proposal because, for 2006, we are not actually asking for any money, we are simply asking for a PM line and the creation of a legal base."
"Therefore, in future years, if the political will is there, we will have the legal base to bring under one single heading the aid we already give for trade."
"This will be an important step forward in terms of being able to mobilise these funds in the future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to comment on two points, echoing Mrs Jensen."
"As permanent rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets for the Structural Funds, I would like to draw your attention to the reduction, for several consecutive years now, of the amount allocated to payment appropriations in Heading 2 dedicated to structural actions."
"In the context of a crisis of confidence in a Europe that is apparently no longer able to offer its citizens a reformed economic model, a competitive model, a model that is fit to rise to the great challenges of the 21st century, the Heads of State or Government have thought it appropriate to reduce by EUR 150 million the amount of payment appropriations proposed by the Commission."
"Well, this investment expenditure implemented by the Structural Funds is, as we know and as we keep saying, a major challenge for our European economy."
"Europe needs more than ever to invest in infrastructures in order to maintain its competitiveness and its jobs, undoubtedly just as much in the new Member States as in the others."
"This EUR 150 million reduction is therefore out of keeping with the findings made by our Assembly with regard to the new challenges confronting us."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the major ecological risk to which the draft budget is exposing our continent, as the budget for the agencies as a whole is being maintained at its previous level, in particular that of the European Maritime Safety Agency which, in the wake of the and disasters, was entrusted with the highly important task of implementing better monitoring of discards and of chartering anti-pollution vessels in the event of an accident off our coasts."
"The Council has inexplicably proposed reducing from 29 to …"
"– Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, we would point out that, with the proposals for the 2006 budget, the Commission and the Council have failed to rise to the occasion."
"The Commission has cut the budget for agricultural policy, especially for the guarantees section, by approximately EUR 1.9 billion below the financial limit, on the basis of unrealistic forecasts for purchases of agricultural products in 2006."
"At the same time, the Council of Ministers of Agriculture has made an unexplained linear cut in spending of a further EUR 150 million."
"The result of this overall reduction, which totals approximately EUR 2.2 million, is to create a climate of insecurity for producers, at a time when they are being called upon to apply the new common agricultural policy and the new terms of competition by international trade."
"How will the Commission and the Council be able to address the problems of dairy farmers, of small arable farmers, of wine producers who see quality and products being ousted from the market, and of sultana producers and fruit producers, as well as the problems of young farmers?"
"Will you reply, 'by strengthening research and technology'?"
"That has already been reduced under the Council proposals and has already been reduced by the financial perspectives."
"In addition, the appropriations for rural development may be exhausted, but they are inadequate to meet the real needs of rural development in the face of enlargement."
"As far as the proposed appropriations for equal opportunities are concerned, they are inadequate to meet the real needs which arise from the competitive environment."
"The proposals for the 2006 budget must come up to expectations and to the demands of modern Europe and, more importantly, of its citizens when it is the final budget, a budget which relates directly to the financial perspectives."
"Madam President, I agree with one point made by the President-in-Office of the Council in his statements this afternoon, namely that we have to spend the funds as wisely as possible and that we must have a realistic budget."
"As far as this economy is concerned, I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is aware of the statistics that show that European expenditure, which falls within the remit of the European Parliament, has increased by 8% over a ten-year period, while Member State expenditure has risen by something like 23%."
"I do not therefore believe that it is for the Council to teach us a lesson in responsible budget management."
"The cuts are unsurprising, as usual."
"There will always be cuts in agriculture."
"I understand that cuts are being made this year because certain budget lines are high and can therefore be cut back."
"The ad-hoc procedure has been in place since the Amsterdam Treaty."
"As the Council itself states, we will have a realistic estimate in October."
"Why not wait for that?"
"The Council also wants to cut back on pilot projects and preparatory actions."
"But why?"
"Some of those actions are excellent and certainly now, with avian influenza, we will need to do more in this area."
"Finally, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether, in his view, the Council has kept to the agreements made in 2004 about the Council informing Parliament on the common foreign and security policy on a regular basis and at a high level."
"The Council has, in my opinion, not kept its word."
"Madam President, we in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have held intense debates over recent months, with the imminent negotiation of the Seventh Framework Programme and other important initiatives in mind. Our debates have allowed us to clarify our needs and objectives in relation to science, technology and innovation."
"We must make use of all we have learnt when working on our budget for 2006. This budget must be governed by the political approach and the priorities we have been establishing, and must not contradict them in any way."
"If we want to pursue the Lisbon Strategy and the recommendations of the Locatelli report, this Parliament cannot under any circumstances accept the proposed reduction in all the headings relating to research and the promotion of innovation in small and medium–sized businesses."
"Similarly, the significant reduction in the headings for research on sustainable energy systems and on sustainable land transport contradicts what we have been hearing and advocating repeatedly in our Committee. What is more, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament do not agree with the drastic reduction in the headings aimed at combating serious diseases."
"– Madam President, in the budget before us there is a clear discrepancy between the aspirations and the rhetoric of the Union in the area of employment and social affairs. It also reflects the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the funds involved in its implementation."
"Whilst I welcome the Commission’s decision to bring forward the pilot project of the European Year of Workers’ Mobility, I was sorry to learn that at first reading the Council cut the appropriations proposed in the preliminary draft proposal by EUR 2 million."
"Given that the budget is already low, this reduction amounts to a glaring lack of political will to make this pilot project a success story, rather than merely a desultory campaign."
"I also regret the paucity of appropriations for EURES, the essential instrument for developing the single European labour market, which is tantamount to discrimination in relation to the amounts requested and obtained by Parliament this year."
"The funds earmarked for social dialogue have also been cut in relation to the preliminary draft proposal, which runs counter to Parliament’s position."
"What is more, the European Social Fund has also seen its proposals reduced."
"At this rate, how can we hope to establish a more social and more competitive Europe?"
"No chance!"
"Madam President, first I would like to thank everyone for their amicable approach."
"The Council’s 2006 draft budget is based on payment appropriations amounting to 1.01% of the EU’s Gross National Income, which is to say approximately a billion euros above the 1% limit."
"This, moreover, was achieved by cutting expenditure by half a billion euros as a matter of course."
"As the new Member States are only just starting to become involved in the EU budget, the Council’s proposal shows that the 1% ceiling for expenditure, as suggested by certain states, will be impossible to put into effect."
"The 2006 budget will be the last to be drafted with reference to the current financial perspective."
"Unless a new financial perspective is established, the institutions will find themselves in a situation in which there is no agreement between them, and that would lead to total economic uncertainty and stagnation in the EU."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission presented its preliminary draft budget in June, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was less than enthusiastic about it."
"As we see it, the funds provided are simply not adequate to facilitate the proper implementation of European environmental and health policy and our policy on the safety of food."
"We now have 25 Member States, yet there is to be only less than a 1% increase for environmental matters, and, in public health, no increase whatever beyond the 2005 level."
"That alone is ridiculous enough in the eyes of some Members, but now the Council has excelled itself by cutting the estimates, which were low enough in any case."
"In their speeches on television and in public, all the members of the Council talk endlessly about their desire to build a citizens’ Europe."
"Here in this plenary, we have just heard that there is to be another rise in people’s standard of living in Europe, even though the funding for such a policy is being withheld."
"Now that really is what I call confidence-building!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I simply wanted to say to you that I find this impromptu meeting, which is unusual in the budget procedure, to be peculiar. In my opinion, it makes little sense."
"On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I also wanted to express our disappointment faced with the sombre cuts made to programmes that Parliament feels very strongly about, such as PRINCE concerning information for European citizens, and in particular faced with the cuts that have been made in headings promoting new resources for SMEs."
"Finally, in order to have a worthwhile European policy, human resources must first be given to the committee."
"That is what is missing in the draft budget proposed to us and, on behalf of my committee, I wish to inform you of our utter disappointment."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I wish to inform the House that the Committee was guided by three considerations when formulating its position."
"The first of these was projects in the field of transport policy, the second was the report on European tourism, and the third and final consideration related to the fact that this is the last year of the current Financial Perspective."
"The position adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism is as follows."
"Firstly, we wish to boost funding for the implementation of the planned Trans-European Transport Networks by EUR 120 million, and we are opposed to savings in this area."
"Secondly, our aim is to introduce a budgetary line for tourism, for the first time in history."
"Thirdly and finally, the Committee unanimously rejected the Council’s proposal, in particular with regard to measures to prevent marine pollution."
"Our guiding principle in this respect was that we are helpless in the face of the air and land-based disasters that we experience or witness."
"We should ensure that we are not helpless in the case of disasters at sea, and that we are capable of responding to such disasters."
"Madam President, the Hague Programme states that, in the area of justice and home affairs, our first priority is to create full-blown policies to promote fundamental rights for all and policies strengthening citizenship."
"We note that, up to now, the European Union budget continues to prioritise the strengthening of repressive policies."
"We wish to find a fair balance between freedom and security."
"The budget must also be balanced, and we very much hope that we shall move from important speeches to action."
"It is not enough for our leaders to state their desire to promote citizenship and equal opportunities."
"They must act and give us the resources for implementing this much-vaunted policy."
"The European Union has a great challenge to take up: equal opportunities for all."
"We know that all forms of violence are rooted in injustice, and it is in our interests to equip ourselves with the resources to fight against injustice."
"Madam President, if Europe wants to be accepted by its citizens, we have to be perceived to be working for them."
"This is most evident in Category III, and it is there that the Council has made the most swingeing cuts."
"If we want to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-led and dynamic region in the world, we have to put aside more money in the budget for this."
"Mr Böge’s report serves to show Parliament the way to go about this, with investment in education, research and youth, and consistent application of gender budgeting – from which, however, we are light-years away!"
"Plans, the Lisbon Strategy, the Youth Pact, ambitious action programmes in research, culture and the media – all these things you adopt and then slash the funding needed for their implementation."
"If we want people to approve of our policies, we have to act in accordance with them."
"I am grateful to Mr Pittella for laying bare the contradiction in what the Council is doing, and I call on the Commission to join this House in taking an approach that will equip us with a good budget that will come across clearly to the public."
"Madam President, the laying down of a sustainable common fisheries policy will do nothing to make our tasks in this area less daunting."
"Let me give just a few examples to illustrate why it is so extraordinarily difficult to enforce the Community’s requirements without the funding to do so: the restructuring of the fisheries sector in the new Member States, improved controls in fisheries, international fisheries agreements such as the forthcoming one with Morocco, fisheries research to provide better data on the basis of which to manage stocks."
"It is for this reason that we endorse the Commission’s preliminary draft budget and reject the Council’s."
"– A large number of us, if not all, maintain that the internal market is the political and economic mainstay of the European Union, and thus we cannot permit that the funds allocated for next year to this crucial sector, be reduced by more than a third: from 12 million euros to 7.66 million."
"This reduction goes against all that which we have discussed here in the past months."
"We also have to make sure that one of the most positive and visible features in this sector, that is, consumer protection, be given the necessary resources to be able to operate."
"It is not possible that with a much greater European Union with many more consumers whose rights we have to defend, the funds allocated to this sector will be even less than those for 2004."
"We also have to learn from what happened a few years ago, we have to see that our consumers will be more informed and better prepared so that abuses are reduced to a minimum when the new Member States introduce the euro."
"These are the proposals which my friends in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection agree about."
"That concludes the debate on this item."
"The next item is the joint debate on the report (A6-0255/2005) by Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the Fourth Amending Budget for 2005 (Tsunami) (11220/2005 – C6 0239/2005 – 2005/2079(BUD)),"
"and the report (A6-0254/2005) by Mr Reimer Böge on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the use of the flexibility instrument (Tsunami) (SEK(2005)0548 – C6-0127/2005 – 2005/2083(ACI))."
". Madam President, Mr President–in–Office of the Council — who is no longer present — Commissioner, it is not usual to hold a debate on an amending budget."
"In fact, other amending budgets are presented in this Parliament without any debate, even when the financial sum involved is greater."
"We should recall that this amending budget for aid for the tsunami has required two different trialogues. It took up a significant part of the conciliation procedure of 22 June and furthermore, it has led to long and complicated discussions amongst the three institutions."
"I must acknowledge the efforts made by the President–in–Office of the Council at the time, particularly since he is British, and the British are very tough negotiators."
"I must recognise that he showed a degree of flexibility without which it would not have been possible to reach an agreement."
"A solution has always been sought on the basis of the Council’s original position, which was completely unacceptable to the other two institutions."
"The Commission originally presented a proposal for the funding of aid for the reconstruction of the countries affected by the tsunami which we in Parliament considered to be acceptable and logical."
"I recognise that if the Council had shown greater flexibility from the outset, we would be in a position to vote today for the European Commission’s original proposal. This is because the European Parliament had faith in the Commission’s proposal despite the fact that it involved reprogramming, which also has its drawbacks, as our colleagues in the Committee on Development quite rightly pointed out."
"We in the Committee on Budgets believed that such reprogramming was inevitable, but we demanded that it be confined to the Asia programmes or that, at least, the duration of the aid scheduled be extended."
"Nevertheless, both the European Parliament’s statement and the statement by the Council in January of this year said that none of that EUR 350 million, which amounts to the bulk of the reconstruction aid, could be financed from the budgetary headings already committed."
"To put it another way — and this is what the Committee on Budgets and this rapporteur have been saying throughout. The new financial resources are necessary in order to fund new external commitments."
"This was our main point of disagreement with the Council and the reason for so many failed negotiations. The outcome has been that it has taken nine months to adopt a final decision."
"It has unfortunately taken that long to reach a decision on the mobilisation of all of this aid in order to present it for the approval of this House."
"The Council intended to finance part of this reconstruction aid by sacrificing programmes already established by the European Union."
"Finally, the agreement has been reached at the expense of the emergency reserve, which was the solution proposed more modestly by the Commission in order to gain the agreement of the Council."
"We in Parliament insisted in particular on the mobilisation of the flexibility reserve but, in the end, we have decided to accept a proposal mobilising the emergency reserve to a greater degree than we felt was prudent."
"Let us hope that there will be no need to mobilise any more than the sum currently available in the emergency reserve during the last few months of 2005."
"The President–in–Office of the Council said in the previous debate that he is optimistic about the additional EUR 13 million that we have to fund in 2005."
"I too am optimistic, since, as the report makes very clear, we still have EUR 293 million in the flexibility reserve to mobilise."
"I am therefore sure that we will be able to find that 13 million in the flexibility instrument because at this stage we feel it is unrealistic to think that 13 million can be obtained in the final budgetary implementation of 2005. What is more, I do not believe I would be able to present a proposal of that nature in Parliament."
"In conclusion, what is clear is that the European Union may well be top of the league when it comes to issuing important and solemn declarations which affect all of the institutions and represent a commitment in the external field. Unfortunately, the Union is in bottom place when it comes to turning the declarations it signs so solemnly into financial commitments."
"I hope we draw all the possible conclusions and lessons from this process and that, from now on, we can act much more quickly when it comes to unblocking aid to other countries."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we heard earlier some very statesmanlike things from the British Presidency of the Council about the demands of foreign policy, accompanied by some calculations with virtual figures, but, as regards the compromise that has emerged from negotiations and that we unfortunately have to discuss today, I agree entirely with what was said by Mr Garriga Polledo in his capacity as rapporteur on the amending budget, namely that it does in fact stand in contradiction not only to these statesmanlike utterances but also, for example, to the response to this great catastrophe heralded by the Council conclusions of 7 January this year."
"It follows that what we unfortunately have to discuss is a marvellous example of the credibility, of the occasional haggling and of the questionable timescales, all of which evidently exemplify the only response to inevitable and current challenges that the European institutions can sometimes manage."
"This should be a lesson for all of us as we prepare for the negotiations on the post-2007 budget framework and on the instruments that will be needed in future."
"At the outset, the Commission came up with a proposal that envisaged such measures as the use of the flexibility instrument to the tune of EUR 98 million."
"From a total of EUR 170 million, EUR 15 million have emerged in this amending budget, while the EUR 13 million that we have not yet come up with are to be found from somewhere over the coming months."
"It is also worthy of note that funds have been reallocated from budget lines that were already intended for this region."
"The Council, and its British Presidency, cannot escape questions as to how all this can be in line with the great Millennium Goals, to which they, in their statements, have repeatedly affirmed their commitment."
"Let me remind you that, as we read the situation, the Council does not exactly appear to have simply goggled like a rabbit confronted with a snake and said: ‘No, we cannot give more than 15 million, or else we will have used up the 200 million in the flexibility instrument for 2005.’"
"If the N+2 rule had been applied, there would have been plenty of margin available."
"While I am on this subject, the point has to be made that it was the European Parliament that said, from the very outset of the negotiations following the Heads of State or Government’s adoption, in 1999, of Agenda 2000, that Category IV was chronically underfunded, in the same way that foreign and security policy and the neighbourhood policy were likely to be chronically underfunded if the Luxembourg compromise for the new Financial Perspective were adopted."
"With the worst-case scenario in mind, we insisted on the provision of a flexibility instrument and were partly successful in negotiating one."
"Events have proved us right, for the fact is that unforeseen measures have made it necessary for this flexibility instrument to be resorted to every year, so what I want to say is that the embarrassing situation in which we find ourselves as regards time and resources obliges us to agree to this compromise."
"I would like to make use of this debate to reiterate that we, not least in the course of negotiations on the next Financial Perspective and the instruments associated with it, will do everything possible to introduce greater flexibility and more room for manoeuvre."
"Let me repeat what the plenary said in the relevant report, namely that Parliament will regard that aspect of its position which refers to the creation of reserves for emergency situations as non-negotiable."
"You will be familiar with the figures that we quoted on that occasion."
"We sometimes get the impression that the Commission, and particularly the Council, would rather not negotiate about figures at all."
"At the end of the day, though, we will have to come to an agreement on them and find a way in future to deliver responses of this kind faster, more promptly, and with greater credibility than we have done in these proceedings."
". Madam President, the tsunami affected large numbers of people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives."
"The response of the European population, European governments, the European Commission and the Member States was overwhelming."
"In Sri Lanka alone, institutional and public commitments came to about EUR 5.8 billion."
"In Indonesia some EUR 8 billion has been committed."
"However, promises and delivery, pledges and action are very different."
"I have just returned from Sri Lanka and Indonesia."
"In Indonesia I talked to Mr Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, head of the Indonesian reconstruction agency."
"He told me they cannot spend the money as quickly as we think they can."
"He thought he could spend it in four years, while the President of Indonesia wants to spend it over a period of five years."
"In Sri Lanka, I regret to tell you that very little has happened."
"Nothing much has changed."
"The government is blaming the international NGOs and the NGOs are blaming the government."
"I am the budget draftsman of the Committee on Development."
"We adopted that opinion yesterday in my committee."
"I tried to explain that, although the needs of the Commission are paramount, I recognise that it has to make commitments, put money in the trust fund and then start spending those funds on whatever projects we have undertaken."
"The capacity of Sri Lanka and Indonesia to absorb this huge amount of money transparently and properly is minimal."
"The Sri Lankans are still shifting paper around while people are still living in tents."
"Nothing has changed in the last seven months, since 26 December 2004."
"It is a tragedy and a scandal."
"However, we need to understand that, no matter how generous we are in giving and in wanting to help the people most in need, absorptive capacity and the ability to act fast in times of crisis are limited."
"As we have seen in New Orleans, even the most powerful nation in the world is unable to cope with tragedies of this kind."
"It has taught us that our Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has more expertise and is better prepared to deal with these emergencies than any other institution in the world."
"The one positive contribution we can make is to teach people what we have already learned on many occasions."
"One of the things we can do with the tsunami and in New Orleans is to give advice and guidance."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it took us nine months from the day this disaster struck to sort out the funding for reconstruction."
"That is no cause for rejoicing, but rather a cause for concern and a reason to take an inventory of our own options and capacities."
"When one considers the causes underlying this, one can certainly describe what the Council and the Member States have been getting up to as ‘kangaroo politics’ – a lot of leaping around with an empty bag."
"One problem that would not go away was that, although Parliament had rightly called on the Council to do what it had promised, the Council, unfortunately, did only half of it and with a great deal of resistance."
"I find this highly regrettable."
"Having given undertakings, it then left it to Parliament to deliver on them."
"The debate on the technical aspects of funding was largely intended as a substitute for money."
"While that is ineffective, it is very much what one would expect from the conduct of many Member States, for, although 22 of them committed themselves to a programme of reconstruction, only nine of them have, according to the Commission’s website, handed over any money so far."
"In the same time, only three of them have come close to finishing all the things they undertook to do."
"I might add that the website was last updated on 20 May this year, so the Commission is in no hurry to bring its achievements in the area to people’s attention."
"As I am told that that is the most up-to-date information on the progress of the debate, I would like to congratulate the Council Presidency on being, according to the statistics available on that site, well ahead so far when it comes to doing what it has promised."
"We have to ask ourselves what Europe’s promises of aid in the aftermath of such calamities are worth."
"Let me remind you also of the Iranian city of Bam, stricken by an earthquake a year before the tsunami."
"To date – at least according to the ‘Red Crescent’ – 17% of the aid promised from around the world has actually materialised."
"We keep our word; if we cannot manage to fulfil our commitments, it is better not to make people empty promises."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to talk about the amending budget for which we have been waiting for so long."
"It relates to the activities that we committed to financing in order to support the reconstruction of the countries affected so seriously by the tsunami in December 2004."
"Like you, I deplore the Council’s attitude. The budgetary authority has taken all this time to release the promised funds."
"In January, or even back in December, the EU promised EUR 350 million."
"Nine months later, we are only just going to manage to donate EUR 170 million over 2005."
"On 27 April, the Commission proposed a preliminary draft budget and called for the necessary mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to a level of EUR 98 million."
"The Council, however, would not hear of this mobilisation."
"You know, it is a terrible thing, this Council’s slogan is ‘Hands off my money!’"
"It is terrible that we have a budgetary authority that takes on responsibilities and commitments, but refuses to see them through."
"We have therefore had to negotiate bitterly in Parliament over the last few months in a struggle to extract EUR 15 million from the flexibility fund."
"That is why we have had to reallocate EUR 60 million from other humanitarian actions in order to reach a balance and to find the EUR 170 million."
"I have to tell you that we consider this to be a scandal, because no poor country has become richer; quite the opposite, poverty is spreading in all these countries."
"There is still EUR 70 million in the emergency reserve; let us hope that we will not need it at the end of the year."
"Of course, we support this agreement because it is urgently needed by the populations and citizens affected by the tsunami."
"But what a mockery!"
"Gentlemen of the Council, I would ask two things of you: first of all, do not make any more promises, because you are never able to keep them."
"Secondly, I must tell you that you have notified us, but what good is the Council’s commitment with regard to the financial perspectives?"
"I now turn to Mr Böge to say: let us take account of this event, of this problem, when negotiating the next financial perspectives."
"Even where the Council has taken note of it, it does not keep its word or its commitments."
"Yes, the European Union really is sick."
"The citizens have noticed it, but in general the fault is with the Member States, who have forgotten that we need to build the European Union together, for the citizens of Europe, but also for the position and the generosity of Europe, because we have a duty towards all the countries of the world, and more particularly towards the people affected by the tsunami."
". Madam President, the Amending Budget No 4 before us and the use of the flexibility instrument aim at dealing with the tsunami catastrophe in Southeast Asia."
"The European Union wants to contribute EUR 350 million in the form of rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance to the areas affected by the disaster, of which EUR 170 million will be granted this year."
"Approximately EUR 85 million of this is ‘fresh’ money."
"The amount is considerable, the next largest after that pledged by Australia and the United States of America."
"It shows that the EU is endeavouring to have a responsible role in dealing with major catastrophes."
"In December, the EU managed to set aside EUR 123 million in this year’s budget, of which food aid accounted for EUR 23 million, and the emergency relief reserve EUR 100 million."
"Now the issue is one of reconstruction assistance."
"Reconstruction is a huge project."
"It means clearing up entire regions, the repair and construction of homes, and reviving the economy."
"With this purpose in mind, the revival of fishing as a means of livelihood, for example, is vital."
"It is a positive sign that the European Parliament and the Council should have reached consensus on financing arrangements in July."
"Recently, cooperation between the Council and Parliament has not been exactly brilliant in matters relating to the budget, and that reached an acute stage in the complete deadlock in talks on the financial framework in June."
"The fact that consensus was reached even on this important issue shows that positive results can be achieved in the work of the EU, if only we can recognise our joint responsibility."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Grybauskaitė and representatives of the Council, I would like to start by thanking Mr Böge and the other speakers for their unambiguous statements earlier on in the debate, particularly in view of the serious wrangling that has gone on between our three institutions over the past nine months."
"I will join them in recalling how, in response to this dreadful tsunami disaster and for the benefit of the world public, the Council announced Europe’s intention of making available EUR 350 million worth of aid for the tsunami’s victims."
"That was announced at the beginning of this year and was intended to run throughout 2005 and 2006."
"While we had a share in making this commitment, it is also, of course, by it that we have to judge the Council."
"We have already heard about the fierce debates that have gone on, particularly in relation to the so-called flexibility instrument."
"About these, I have to come to the same conclusion as some of the previous speakers, namely that the debates we have had over the past nine months with the Council have sometimes been a cause for real shame, and I can do no other than forthrightly criticise the Council for the way it handled them."
"I also take the view that the funds made available for other aid programmes in Asia, which some now want to use for emergency aid, must be replaced whatever happens; the Millennium Goals demand it, and I believe that the credibility of the European Union is at stake here."
"If you make promises of that sort and want global public opinion to give you credit for them, you must also have the political guts to put these resolutions into practice and make the necessary resources available."
"Like others who have spoken before me, I regard the compromise that has emerged from our negotiations as highly problematic."
"I do believe, though, that the European Union had to consider the victims’ needs and could not have waited any longer to vote these funds once and for all and to make them available, for to do otherwise would have adversely affected its credibility."
"I cannot, however, forbear to criticise the Council in strong terms for their petty-minded and obstructive approach to negotiation, particularly when set against what they have made known to the world."
"Despite that criticism, and in view of the difficult negotiations that await us in 2006, I call upon them to ensure that these negotiations take a different course and that we will again be able to avail ourselves of the flexibility instrument for emergency situations such as these – that is to say, in the way it was intended to be used."
"A challenge such as that should not be met with a small-minded response."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"As a member of the Committee on Development, I visited, together with Mrs Morgantini, the chairman, Mr Deva, the rapporteur, and other Members, the areas hit by the tsunami, and in particular the Indonesian region of Banda Aceh."
"The scale of the damage is truly remarkable: entire communities have been destroyed and swept away by nature’s fury."
"The local population, however, despite suffering from the loss of material goods and of loved ones, is rolling up its sleeves and rebuilding its future."
"Europe, as was its duty, did not shrink from the obligations of solidarity."
"Not only did the institutions take swift action, but many, very many ordinary citizens also thought it their duty to help out and make a contribution."
"As part of these comprehensive, rightful and appropriate efforts, the proposal by the rapporteur that EUR 100 million be allocated in 2005 for reconstruction and recovery should be supported. This figure is in addition to the EUR 123 million already provided for humanitarian aid and the commitment to pay the remaining sum of EUR 250 million in 2006 and 2007."
"As representatives of European citizens, however, we also have the responsibility to intervene with the relevant authorities, particularly in Indonesia, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, to ensure that the aid reaches the people quickly and that as a result work is done and the necessary steps are taken to achieve effective, visible and concrete improvements in the living conditions of these peoples."
"Madam President, I have risen to speak in this debate on amendments to the 2005 budget and the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument because I believe that the proposals contained in the Garriga Polledo and Böge reports will enable the European Union to honour the commitments it has entered into vis-à-vis the countries hit by the tsunami."
"I should like to take this opportunity to draw Members’ attention to three problems of a more general nature."
"Firstly, it is an unfortunate fact that natural disasters of various types, all of which result in enormous human and material losses, are becoming an ever more frequent occurrence."
"The Asian tsunami, the hurricane in Slovakia, the floods in Austria, Romania and Germany, the fires in Spain and Portugal and the recent disaster in the United States are merely some of the disasters that have happened this year."
"What this means is that we must set aside significantly more funding in future EU budgets to enable us to provide assistance to countries affected by natural disasters."
"Secondly, promises of assistance are easy enough to make, but a great deal more difficult to put into action."
"A good example of this is the funding for areas suffering the consequences of the Asian tsunami, which is an issue that has already been raised today."
"The European Union pledged EUR 350 million to this cause, but is still attempting to find sources of funding to meet this commitment, which after all is not excessively high."
"Thirdly, I would draw the House’s attention to the overly long procedures that are in place for organising funding to deal with the aftermath of natural disasters."
"A good example of this is the aid for Slovakia, where a hurricane destroyed large swathes of forest in the Slovak Tatras."
"The hurricane hit the country in autumn 2004, but it is only now, one year later, that we are sending money to Slovakia to help the country cope with the consequences of this natural disaster."
"Such criticisms notwithstanding, I am delighted that the European Union is so actively involved in measures across the globe aimed at overcoming the consequences of natural disasters."
"I am quite sure that this House’s adoption of the Garriga Polledo and Böge reports, which we are debating today, will help ensure that money is made available more rapidly for such matters."
"Madam President, this issue has been discussed for quite a long time."
"It is of course good that we have now obtained a decision and an agreement."
"At the same time, I am, on behalf of the Committee on Development, disappointed at the result."
"We have always opposed a situation in which resources already appropriated to genuine development purposes within the Asia budget are now partially reappropriated to this disaster."
"We have also always maintained that we should, as far as possible, safeguard the disaster reserve and make use instead of the flexibility instrument."
"We now have only EUR 53 million left in the disaster reserve, with a good four months of this year still to go."
"What do we do if another disaster occurs somewhere in the world?"
"Our arguments have not succeeded."
"That does not mean that they are lacking in relevance or weight. On the contrary."
"We shall support this proposal but go on working to bring about a situation in which efforts in connection with major disasters like this must in the first place be funded from new resources and through the flexibility instrument."
"We hope, moreover, that we shall as far as possible safeguard the disaster reserve so that we can take action in the event of further major hardships."
"Finally, I would hope and believe that the resources now set aside for reconstruction and readjustment will be used in the wisest possible way and that, above all, as many aspects as possible of disaster preparedness will be incorporated. In that way, we shall not be making the already vulnerable people who live in that region still more vulnerable."
"Madam President, we finally reached a decision before the holidays; this was not easy, and the decision was quite some way from the first Commission proposal."
"The experience was a painful one for all of us, mainly because we were slow in delivering on our promises and the respective budgetary authorities were not sufficiently sensitive to each other's positions."
"This experience showed how difficult it is to solve our internal problems and at the same time to help those in emergency situations in the world."
"Finally, however, we reached a decision, and I hope that you will vote in favour of the mobilisation of the EUR 15 million from the flexibility instrument in this plenary."
"Regarding the EUR 142 million on which a decision has already been reached, I can inform you that the commitments have been made."
"Therefore, from our point of view, we have done the best we can."
"In response to your remarks, I would emphasise that we did everything we could in the way we could, but, of course, the know-how we have on improving administrative capacities to absorb aid can and must be shared."
"The Commission will do this in the best way it can."
"The Commission understands that, for this year, the issue of the financing of the remaining EUR 13 million is still to be solved."
"The Commission will be in a position to come forward with a proposal on the matter by the end of this month."
"That concludes the joint debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0330/2005)."
"We will be taking a number of questions to the Commission."
"As part of the European strategy for the Balkans, the Thessaloniki European Council (June 2003) called for the extension of the Europe-wide system of diagonal accumulation of rules of origin to include the Western Balkan States with the aim of boosting economic growth through support for the export trade."
"To this end, the Commission is in the process of setting up a zone for the accumulation of rules of origin, initially comprising the EU, Croatia and FYROM."
"FYROM has, in fact, already concluded a bilateral free-trade agreement with the EU."
"What measures has the Commission already taken to ensure that products exported from FYROM to the Member States of the EU are not shipped under the constitutional name of that country but under the name recognised by the UN and the EU?"
"If, nevertheless, the FYROM authorities persist in using their constitutional name on the accompanying documents, certification or any other documentation relating to the exported products, what measures will the Commission take to uphold the collective decisions of the EU on this matter?"
". I want to express my thanks to the Member who tabled this question, because it is a very relevant issue."
"At the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003, the Commission was invited: 'to prepare the extension of the pan-European diagonal cumulation of origin to the countries of the region in a manner consistent with all relevant Community policies and dependent on their administrative capacity'."
"The Commission is currently analysing different possibilities to allow diagonal cumulation with the countries concerned."
"In any case, any further possibilities of cumulation for the Western Balkan countries will be built on the basis of the stabilisation and association agreements developed under the stabilisation and association process."
"The current SAA linking the EU with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in force since 2004, and specifically Protocol 4 thereof, clearly sets out the requirements and procedures for granting preferential treatment to products originating in that country, including the movement certificates and other proofs of origin."
"The text of the agreement refers to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the only designation of the country and accordingly that is the only name that can be taken into account as the country of origin on the movement certificates and other documentation required for preferential treatment to be accorded."
"Consequently, Member States' customs administrations should not grant preferential treatment to goods which do not comply with the relevant provisions of the stabilisation and association agreement."
"– Madam President, I should like to give special thanks to Commissioner Kovács for his reply. It was a comprehensive reply."
"I would just like to point out that the European Commission is obliged under the Treaty to defend the ."
"The includes the decisions taken by the European Union on the provisional name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"I should like to ask if the reply which he gave and the concern of the European Commission which he illustrated will also be included in the text of the opinion being prepared by the European Commission on the eligibility of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to become a member of the European Union."
". Moreover, I think it is important that administrative cooperation and mutual assistance be provided for in the agreement between the customs authorities of the EC Member States and of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in order to ensure the proper application of the protocol and the correctness of the information given in the movement certificates or invoice declarations."
"That completes the first part of my answer."
"According to the world's largest security software company, 'the world faces a threat of “blockbuster” proportions from new 3G mobile phone viruses and increasingly sophisticated PC “spyware” programmes'."
"The US authorities have decided to adopt a 'get tough' approach to computer hackers and pirates who are now threatening to inflict massive damage on world economies."
"Will the Commission indicate what concrete measures it is taking or intends to take to try to stop this form of criminality?"
". Cookies, adware and spyware and similar types of software are regulated by Article 5(3) of the e-Privacy Directive."
"Under this provision, accessing any user's terminal equipment, such as a personal computer or a mobile phone, or storing information on that equipment is allowed only if the user is given clear information about the purpose of such activities and if the user is offered the right to refuse it."
"This is a general rule when such devices are intended for a legitimate purpose, but the situation is different if the purpose is malicious and the intention is to harm a computer system or its user."
"These forms of malware are clearly banned by the e-Privacy Directive."
"As is generally the case with European Union directives, the choice of remedies, penalties and enforcement tools lies with the Member States."
"However, in February 2005, the 25 Member States went beyond the e-Privacy Directive by adopting the Framework Decision on illegal attacks against information systems."
"Under this Framework Decision, spyware-related activities involving illegal access and interference with information systems are punishable by criminal penalties of no less than one to three years' imprisonment, and of no less than two to five years' imprisonment when committed by organised crime."
"However, legislation is not enough on its own and may produce the expected results only if it is combined with other measures, such as complementary enforcement measures, industry cooperation, including standardisation research, and better user awareness."
"As far as enforcement measures are concerned, the EU has a contact network of spam authorities – CNSA that aims to ease enforcement cooperation between national authorities on spam and related issues."
"The last meeting of this network was mainly devoted to spyware, often spread via spam, and the challenge it represents for enforcement authorities and industry."
"Spam, spyware and adware are just examples of the many security threats that risk undermining the value of the internet and of electronic communications."
"The Commission is therefore planning to put forward a strategy for a secure information society that puts together various actions to make electronic communications networks safer from fraudsters, harmful content and technology failures, and to increase trust."
"Another big step towards improving internet security was taken by the Commission in 2004, when ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency, was established."
"This Agency has already hired its first members of staff and developed its work programme, and, in August 2005 – just a few days ago – it established itself in its headquarters in Heraklion, Greece, and will soon be fully operational."
"ENISA will help the Community, the Member States and, consequently, business communities to prevent, address and respond to major network and information security risks."
"I thank Commissioner Reding for her comprehensive reply."
"I am encouraged by the measures that are already in place for dealing with this threat."
"I believe it is the most devious and heinous threat that faces the world and especially the world economies."
"Will the Commission take further action on the likely developments?"
"This is an ever-changing situation and the inherent dangers are very great."
"I should therefore like to know what planning will take place in future."
". Let me reply briefly to the honourable Member by pointing out that the establishment of ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency, will provide a tool that will enable us to react very quickly to any emergencies or new developments which may occur."
"In addition, the strategy for a secure information society, which I will present very soon and which will then certainly be discussed by the European Parliament, will be a second tool enabling us also to react at legislative level, if necessary, and if new technological developments and new abuses of those technological developments occur."
"As the author of the question is not present, Question No 40 lapses."
"First inconsistency in the White Paper entitled 'Prospects for the EU in 2005', the UK states that the financial perspective must cover the needs of the new Member States."
"In its document entitled 'Financial Perspective - Why 1% is not realistic', the Commission explains that 1% of GDP entails a huge cutback in funding for Bulgaria and Romania as well as for the full integration of the 10 new Member States. Nor will the 1% enable an agreement to be reached to ensure financial balance between the 25."
"Second inconsistency the strengthening of competitiveness urged by the UK Presidency is incompatible with its 1% proposal."
"How does the Commission intend to cooperate with the UK Presidency to break the current deadlock over the financial perspective without loss to the new and old Member States and without losing competitiveness?"
". The questions have been very politically important for us, including the question I received from Mr Vakalis, but at this stage it is very difficult precisely to guarantee any results during the negotiation process."
"That is why I would like to say that I organised a reply in quite a general political manner and I would like to read out this answer officially."
"As the Honourable Member implies, the deadlock on the financial perspective has done nothing to reduce the urgency to reach an agreement."
"There is a real risk that the necessary measures will not be in place to allow Union policies to be delivered effectively beyond 2006."
"We must remain focused on the goal of a better balanced budget with a good compromise between existing spending on our tried-and-tested policies, and our new policy agenda for growth and jobs."
"The Commission will provide full support for the UK Presidency, and looks forward to working to promote a timely agreement."
"The Commission also looks forward to the efforts of the Presidency of the Council to lead the debate and take the initiatives required to reach a compromise."
"When there are significant differences between Member States on the function and the focus of the EU budget, the need for compromise is very clear to everybody."
"The Commission will continue to work actively to find a compromise which will enjoy the necessary support amongst Member States, and will allow for the agreement of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to the interinstitutional agreement setting up the new financial perspective."
"– I should like to point out to the Commissioner that I read her interview with on 18 February 2005."
"It was a truly surprising interview."
"I should like all my honourable friends to hear part of this fantastic interview and I should like you to tell me at the end if you have changed or if today you will change anything about what you said."
"I quote, because the text needs to go down in history: I believe, the Commissioner says, that the proposal of the Six is not possible and that we shall reach a percentage of over 1%."
"We continue to support the Prodi proposal of 1.4% because all it does is to add up the financing for policies decided by the Council, such as agricultural policy, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the Lisbon Strategy, the trans-European networks and increased spending on research and development."
"All these policies, like enlargement, were decided at the summit, not by the Commission."
"If the Council does not want to pay, it must tell us where it will make cuts."
"What will you change today, Commissioner?"
". I thank you for your kind words."
"If the final question is whether I am going to change my view, then the answer is 'no'."
"I stand by the opinion I have held until now."
"Putting aside the United Kingdom's individual position, would you agree that, in its capacity as the Presidency, it is making strenuous efforts to find consensus in this matter, by touring Member States and discussing with them the different objectives?"
"There is a wide range of views about future financing but, as I understand it, the United Kingdom, as a Presidency, is trying to be the honest broker and bring together these divergent views."
"Do you accept that it is making genuine efforts in that regard?"
". There were a lot of perceptions and hopes."
"I share your hope that the Presidency will want to reach a deal."
"If that were the case, we would be very supportive."
"As Questions Nos 42 and 43 deal with the same subject, we will now take them together."
"Following the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the media and society as a whole are engaging in ever more frequent discussions about ‘the democratic crisis in Europe’, ‘the distance between the bureaucrats and the citizens’ and the fact that ‘people’s real lives are being ignored’."
"For the most part these are populist slogans that seek to use the wave of Euroscepticism for political gain."
"However, as the outcomes of the aforementioned referenda have shown, there is a real difference between the official position of the EU and its Member States and the opinions of the public."
"This is a sign that calls for decisive action, especially as the governments of EU Member States are often keen to take the credit for positive initiatives (including those backed by the Commission), while they blame ‘Brussels bureaucrats’ for negative, unpopular or unsuccessful decisions."
"What is the Commission’s position, and what plans does it have to address the matter?"
"More specifically, how do the Commissioners view the situation?"
"Are there plans for new measures to be taken to project the idea of a united Europe and provide information on the EU’s practical achievements?"
"How is the Commission going to coordinate its actions in this field with the governments of the EU Member States?"
"The Commission recently announced what it calls its Plan D, for democracy, debate and dialogue, recognising that much must be done in order to explain to European citizens why the EU is involved in key issues that concern them, such as jobs, the economy, pensions and so on."
"Can the Commission indicate in advance of the White Paper that is scheduled to be presented later in the year any of the new initiatives that it will propose with a view to improving communication with EU citizens?"
". For this Commission, communicating with the citizens of the European Union has been a key strategic objective from the start."
"This is why we have been engaged in a lengthy and comprehensive analysis and consultation within the Commission itself and in an equally comprehensive dialogue on this issue with many of the actors concerned, and Parliament in particular."
"As a result, the Commission has developed a new approach to European communication based on three strategic principles that all clearly put the citizens at the heart of European policies."
"Firstly, the Commission will further improve its efforts to listen to citizens and to take their views and concerns into account."
"Secondly, it will better communicate how its policies affect their everyday lives – an aspect mentioned by the honourable Members."
"Thirdly, it will go local and adapt its communication to the different citizens' sensitivities according to their country, region, language, and their age, sex, profession, etc."
"On 20 July 2005, this materialised in the adoption of the internal action plan to improve the way in which the Commission communicates Europe."
"The aim of this plan is to improve the organisation of the Commission's ongoing communication work on the basis of the three principles."
"Concretely, this plan gives details of 50 very pragmatic actions – most of them to be carried out immediately, i.e. within the next 12 months – to make the Commission's existing comprehensive communication work more professional and effective."
"For example, the Commission will make better use of those communication tools that most people prefer – i.e. the audiovisual media and the Internet – and will do this in the language they understand."
"It will provide its staff with specific training in communication skills and recruit communication specialists as well."
"It will integrate communication aspects into policy formulation right from the beginning and it will reinforce the Commission's representation offices in the Member States and help them better focus on acting as our ears and spokesmen on the ground by simplifying and reducing their administrative burden."
"However, communicating with European citizens is a task that goes far beyond the Commission's remit."
"Therefore, the next step will be the White Paper on communication, which is meant to engage all stakeholders and all institutions."
"In this paper, the Commission will set out the policy vision and the initiatives that it thinks have to be undertaken in the medium and long term, in cooperation with other actors."
"Among these actors are the European institutions: Parliament, in particular, has an essential role to play."
"Both the Commission and Parliament already have long-standing good cooperation in this area, which has gained even further momentum in the last months."
"However, if we really want to achieve substantial change in European communications, it is true that it is even more urgent to enhance cooperation and coordination with the Member States in order to set up a strong partnership with their governments and regional authorities, civil society and the media as well."
"The White Paper will address the role of all the stakeholders and launch a broad consultation procedure in order to give them the possibility to define and organise their input."
"Based on the results of this dialogue, common actions will be defined."
"Good communication is essential for a healthy democracy."
"However, the public debate on Europe in the first half of this year has shown that at present there is no agreement or understanding about what Europe is for and where it is heading."
"This is why we need not only a new approach to communication, but also a good discussion about the future of Europe as a whole."
"Accordingly, the Commission is developing a plan D – as I have called it – where D stands for dialogue, debate and democracy."
"This is also in line with the declaration by the Heads of State and Government at the June European Council stating the need for a reflection pause to organise a broad debate."
"In order to reconnect Europe's citizens with the European project, they and their organisations must be given a stronger voice, and we, the decision-makers, must develop the ability to better listen to their concerns and expectations."
"The Commission's role in this process would be that of a facilitator, providing support to Member States and civil societies to make this plan D happen. However, it is essential to avoid as much as possible a top-down approach, as democracies are by definition bottom-up."
"Again, this is not something that the Commission or, for that matter, the EU institutions can do alone."
"If we are to succeed in creating a more citizen-driven Europe that can meet the challenges of today's globalising world, Europe's policies must also be solidly anchored in the governments and parliaments of each Member State."
"Thank you for your good and thorough answer."
"I would like to add to what has been said by the Commissioner that we should probably add your blog, which I read on the Internet and of which I am a great fan, to what has been listed here."
"And now the question: according to public opinion research, when unpopular governments actively promote a good idea, the outcome, as a rule, is contrary to expectations and people do not support the idea."
"Half jokingly, half seriously, I would like to ask you: would not it be worthwhile to recommend that unpopular governments refrain from, let us say, active promotion of the idea of a united Europe?"
". One part of the analysis of the problems we have entered into is that there is too much of what we call the blame game."
"The institutions are blaming each other."
"The Commission will, of course, use the argument of Member States not wanting to do this or that, or not implementing policies."
"The Member States or their governments are keen to take credit for something that is going very well, but if something happens where they have to compromise, they will say it is the fault of Brussels."
"Parliament is also part of this blame game now and then."
"We have to create, first of all, a modern story of why we need European cooperation."
"When people have been asked in Eurobarometer opinion polls, for example, most have said that it is a good idea to cooperate."
"They see the added value of working together to counter so many of the problems that one nation can no longer deal with alone."
"But we also have to address young people to get them on board. We have to have some kind of common message of why we need the European Union."
"The peace argument is of course still valid but it is not enough."
"The young generation needs arguments about how we want to deal with today's problems and tomorrow's problems as well – the ones that they face and are affected by."
"We also have to ask for Member State governments, of whatever political colour they might be, to be loyal to the project and to be able to explain the pros and the cons, the problems and the challenges of being involved in such cooperation."
"However, first and foremost, we must deliver results, so that people can see that this brings an added value to Europe."
"We work together and we are able to solve some problems for citizens by working together in this European project."
"I welcome the Commissioner's general response and I also welcome the white paper, but I do not agree with her."
"I think people need to be told that the European Union is an unprecedented success, compared with anything that went before at any time in history, following unprecedented consultation."
"There are consultation groups and citizens' groups; if you had put a group outside Pilate's palace they still would have told you to free Barabas."
"What we need is an 'L' plan, not a 'D' plan."
"We need leadership to go out and tell people that 60 million people died in the first half of the last century and this project – this unprecedented successful project – is about ensuring it never happens again."
"You cannot have prosperity without peace and stability."
". I can only say that I agree."
"Leadership is definitely needed as well."
"European leaders have to speak out and advocate what we are doing and be able to defend it."
"I could not agree more."
"I support what the Commissioner has said on the information communication policy, which is laid out as a very clear and coherent attempt to communicate better with Europe's citizens."
"I wonder whether she has had a chance to look at the preliminary draft budget to see what impact that might have on her ambitions?"
"Because, without joining in this blame game, it seems to me that the Council will complain that citizens do not understand Europe, but is it prepared to make the means available for the Commission to run a proper information campaign?"
". Thank you very much for wanting to support me in asking for the resources to be made available."
"Of course, fine words are all very well, but we also need the resources to put them into practice."
"That is what we are involved in right now, in discussing the budget for 2006 and the future financial perspective as well."
"It is very important that we accompany these actions with the necessary resources."
"I am happy to announce that I have secured the support of the Commission for a further 50 posts to strengthen the representation offices."
"These offices operate in each and every Member State and are familiar with the debate."
"We have to equip them in the best possible way so that they can communicate with their own citizens, in their own language, where they understand the conditions, the sensitivities and the debate."
"I thank you for your support."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I want to ask what is actually being done about the disinformation being disseminated about Europe and the European institutions."
"Is this disinformation being put about by European citizens, or does it originate from outside Europe?"
"Above all else, who is paying for it?"
"Would the best response to it not be to train journalists to counter it?"
"Let us then endeavour, every year, to get a hundred young journalists to come to Brussels, with the best among them to receive an internationally recognised award."
"I see it as a matter of absolute priority that Europe be communicated, and we MEPs in particular, being a House of over 700 specialists, are ready and willing to do it."
"First of all, we are investing much more in providing a rebuttal service; this is also a way of responding to the lies that circulate about the decisions taken here or in the institutions."
"This is, of course, a reaction, but we also have to be proactive in order to avoid ending up with all these lies or half truths circulating about what is going on."
"That is why we also have to engage in education and training for journalists, for example."
"Indeed, we invite a number of journalists from Member States every year and these courses are very popular."
"These are exactly the kinds of proactive activities we want to improve in order to improve communications."
"We are working together with Parliament and the Council to make the rebuttal service more effective."
"It often comes from the media; of course, I do not know how much comes from outside Europe – it is impossible to say – but a lot comes from our own media, and we will work with the other institutions to improve the rebuttal service and to be quicker and sharper in how we respond."
"Is it not the case, Commissioner, that both Parliament and the Commission are going about their information work in the wrong way by often concentrating on four-colour printed matter that nobody reads and which just lies around in information offices?"
"It is clear that misunderstandings about Europe arise when national governments say what suits them rather than giving the full facts."
"There has been debate in Germany about our being the paymaster of Europe."
"Different arguments are going on in other countries."
"Would it not be helpful if, even on the same day on which a falsehood or half-truth is put into circulation in any one country, an association or a member of the government or a Commissioner were to speak out and give the national press the real facts of the matter?"
"It would cost nothing and would engender in the national capitals a certain fear of giving voice to falsehoods or half-truths."
"Communication with the press is the name of the game, and, so far, nothing has been done in this area, perhaps because the Commission does not have the nerve to speak out against certain national governments."
". I share your view that we rely too much on written material, on documents and brochures."
"We produce thousands of these brochures every year, but where do they end up?"
"How many of these brochures are really read and how much do we invest in the Internet, because this is where young people and the younger generation look for information on just about everything?"
"We have to invest and strike a better balance in how we respond or where we put out information, taking account also of modern traditions."
"We have to do both, but the balance has to be improved."
"This is one of the actions in the action plan that I presented before the summer."
"We have to have state-of-the-art technology."
"We have to be more accessible and more reader-friendly in what we do on the Internet, for example."
"It is all about using the tools that we have available in a much more effective way."
"We have to continue to search for the best ways."
"But what one person calls a lie, another person calls the truth."
"This will always be an ongoing debate, but we have to be more effective in putting facts and figures out."
"That is the role of the Commission, and the other institutions as well."
"The Commission has previously claimed that the EU's lack of legitimacy in the eyes of citizens and the prevalent scepticism regarding the draft EU Constitution were due to inadequate communication."
"In other words, there was nothing wrong with the EU or with its draft Constitution: the problem lay in people's ignorance."
"Following the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the Commission has launched Plan D, in which D stands for democracy."
"Does this mean that the Commission has changed its assessment?"
"Does the Commission now consider that the EU institutions have already gained too much power at the Member States' expense and would gain even more if the Constitution entered into force?"
"Or does democracy merely mean that more communication, that is, political propaganda from Brussels, will persuade citizens to change their attitudes and accept the EU as it is now and as it will be in future under the terms of the draft Constitution?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission must communicate the facts about EU issues and give people opportunities to make their own judgments and choices. It should not spread political propaganda."
"Informing people is one of our responsibilities in serving the public."
"It is about transparency and accountability."
"This is an area in which the Commission has cooperated constructively with the European Parliament for a long time."
"On 20 July, the Commission adopted a package of measures designed to improve communication and with the help of which we wish to show in a clear and pragmatic way how we can improve the dialogue with people throughout the EU."
"It is also proof of our commitment to more dialogue, consultation and debate about the role of the EU."
"Our measures are based on three principles: listening better, describing how EU policy affects people’s everyday lives and giving the message a local slant."
"The first principle in particular, that of listening, shows that we are prepared, and have the will, to continue with further democratisation."
"It is about more actively soliciting people’s views and, right from the beginning, taking account of these when new policy and legislation are drawn up."
"Mr Lundgren asks me whether I believe that the EU institutions have already been given too much power at the expense of the Member States and would be given still more under the proposal to establish a constitution for Europe."
"My answer is no."
"Firstly, the fact is that every decision to give powers to the EU institutions is an independent decision by the Member States."
"Moreover, the purpose is not, of course, to the role of the national governments but to their opportunities to achieve goals of common interest."
"It all sounds very splendid when Commissioner Wallström says that listening is imperative and when she emphasises the voluntary nature of democracy, with the people’s views being passed on to those given the power to govern."
"However, the whole of the debate we are hearing here in the Chamber, not just today but at other times too, shows of course that what actually happens is precisely the opposite."
"We must remember what has happened."
"We have put forward a proposal about establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"Referenda on this proposal have been held in two founder Member States, with the people voting against it."
"Surely this cannot be treated as a problem to be solved through more propaganda offices and more money for providing information etc."
"Must we not respect these votes as a grass-roots decision, that is to say one rejecting the Constitution?"
"If these two ‘no’ votes in two important founder Member States of the EU have not exactly plunged the whole of the EU into a crisis situation, they have in any case sent shock waves of a kind through the institutions."
"That is also why we are asking ourselves what the explanations are for these ‘no’ votes."
"What is the import of the ‘no’ votes in the Netherlands and France?"
"It is important to carry out this analysis and simply to listen to the arguments that were used."
"We have a fair knowledge of what these arguments were in both France and the Netherlands and of what the explanations for the ‘no’ votes were."
"The votes also reflect a situation and problems that are more far-reaching and that exist not only in those countries but also elsewhere around Europe."
"In my opinion, too much of this project has been reserved for a fairly small political elite, this being a situation we must change."
"People today demand more of our democratic systems."
"They are better educated and better informed, and they want to be involved and to feel that they can influence matters."
"It is in this area that we must improve the way we operate."
"As I see it, there are also two routes to go down: one involving a right and the other an obligation."
"The right is the right I have as a person to be given information about what is going on, how decisions are made and what is being decided of relevance to me, my everyday life and my future."
"The obligation is the obligation of these democratic institutions to inform people about what is happening, what decisions are being taken and how people can be involved and exercise influence."
"We cannot pretend that we do not have this obligation also to inform."
"Some people call this propaganda but, for me, this is a very important task of ours."
"Providing information should be one of our fundamental tasks."
"It must, then, be done in a professional and efficient way."
"Can you imagine other institution of this size not being engaged in public relations or the task of communication, that is to say having no relationship with those people whom you in Parliament have to represent and with whom we should have some dialogue and discussion."
"Madam President, this is a point on which I would like to express my agreement with the Commissioner."
"Of the 13 countries that have ratified, two have done so by means of referenda."
"Those votes are of no less value than those of the countries that have withheld ratification."
"The European Parliament is legitimated by reason of being directly and democratically elected."
"The Commission derives its legitimacy from the European Parliament and from the governments elected by the national parliaments, and this entitles it to argue politically the case for objectives held by a majority of its own number."
"I therefore want to ask you again whether it does not make sense for it to get involved in day-to-day political debate."
"If, for example, a manifestly false assertion is made in a given country, should a contrary position or correction on the part of the Commission not be communicated on the same day via national press conferences or by other means, so that such views cannot take root?"
"Mr Brok, examples I can mention are cases in which obvious errors are contained in assertions made, statements issued or debates conducted in an individual Member State."
"In those cases, the representative office would respond and make sure it introduced a correction or immediately stated what were the facts of the matter."
"I believe we must be much more alert to such cases and that we must respond locally."
"Such a debate cannot always be conducted centrally from Brussels or Strasbourg. Instead, debates conducted locally or in the Member States must be responded to."
"I do not believe we have been particularly effective in this area."
"I believe there is much more to be done to ensure that people have the facts explained to them, especially in the case of highly topical debates."
"I welcome the initiative concerning the plan for debate, dialogue and democracy."
"Obviously, different institutions should provide information about their activities."
"Clearly, we politicians should go home and provide information about what is happening here in Parliament and then conduct a dialogue based on the decisions we take."
"In addition to the local view, which I believe is very important, I wish, however, to address an aspect I have not heard touched upon in this Chamber today, namely the fact that politics at EU level needs to be integrated not only into national politics but also into local and regional politics."
"For example, issues relating to the environment and to the labour market are, of course, of topical interest at all levels."
"Are you working to integrate politics at different levels so that people have more identifiable reference points and are able to appreciate the value added by the European dimension?"
"That is perhaps one of the most difficult tasks we have, namely to ensure that the national politicians also have this dimension integrated into what they do."
"Out of curiosity, I looked at the agendas of local councils."
"I looked at different local authorities in Sweden in order to see what in actual fact ties in with the decisions taken by the European Parliament."
"In every case, there were at least three or four issues that could be directly linked up with the debates conducted in this Chamber and the decisions taken here. Naturally, these were issues of common interest, such as those relating to the environment, trade or competition."
"That is why it is important for local politicians to be able to explain that these are concerns we share with other European countries."
"That is why we also have regulations that are European in scope."
"It is in this way that we must try to solve the problems and to adjust the regulations so that they are applicable at all levels."
"That is certainly what will take the longest time before it has become a natural part of the political debate at all levels, but it is something for which we must strive."
"The debate is one in which we must engage with the Member States, the governments and the political parties."
"You in particular have an important role to play in ensuring that people are aware of these matters at all levels."
"The way in which waste legislation is enforced varies widely between the Member States, and even between regions within the same Member State."
"There are also wide differences in waste legislation itself within the European Union."
"This leads to large volumes of waste being transported across borders, with cases of fraud by criminals operating in the area of waste-related crime regularly being uncovered by the judicial and police services."
"Does the Commission plan in the light of the opinion given by the Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice in case C-176/03 to take steps to draw up a legal framework for combating waste-related crime at EU level, and what, in the Commission's view, are the priorities with regard to combating waste-related crime?"
". As you know, the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on 15 March 2001 to combat offences that damage the environment."
"In particular, this proposal specifies that Member States shall ensure that certain activities are criminal offences, when committed intentionally or with serious negligence, as far as they breach the rules of Community law."
"It particularly refers to the fraudulent cross-border transport of waste referred to by the honourable Member in his question."
"On 27 January, however, the Council adopted, instead of this proposal for a directive, a framework decision based on Title VI of the Treaty on European Union."
"This text criminalises a number of actions that damage the environment, committed either intentionally or by serious negligence, and makes them liable to criminal penalties."
"This list of offences includes the unlawful disposal, treatment, storage, transport, export or import of waste, including hazardous waste, which causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury to any person."
"The Member States had to adopt the measures necessary to comply with this framework decision before 27 January 2005."
"The Commission is currently studying the national transposition measures notified to it by the Member States in order to provide the Council, as specified by the framework decision, with a report enabling it to check, no later than by 27 January 2006, the extent to which Member States have taken the measures necessary to comply with the framework decision."
"That said, the Commission, which, with the support of the European Parliament, went to the Court of Justice of the European Communities to challenge the legal basis adopted by the Council, is waiting for the judgment to be delivered shortly, on 13 September I believe."
"As Mr Staes mentioned, on 26 May 2005 the Advocate-General delivered conclusions that are very favourable to the Commission’s position, as Mr Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer suggests that the Court annul the relevant provisions of the framework decision of 27 January 2003."
"If the Court follows its advocate-general, a new legal instrument, this time a Community one, will have to be adopted to protect the environment through criminal law, including to prevent the fraudulent cross-border transport of waste."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am indebted to the Commissioner for his exhaustive and correct chronology of the facts, and I think that this question is very timely."
"Indeed, if the Court of Justice pronounces its judgment on 13 September, the Commission will need to take prompt action to deal with something that is – in my view –a serious crime."
"You, Commissioner, are responsible for justice and police matters."
"This is a serious crime and represents a risk to the environment, very often also a risk to food safety and public health, and those engaged in it are also often criminals linked with the mafia – a term I use in its traditional sense."
"I would therefore ask you, as Commissioner, to act as soon as judgment has been passed and that you ensure that we can create a sound legal framework for this."
". Yes, of course, I fully share your point of view."
"If, on 13 September, the Court supports the Commission’s opinion, which is shared by the European Parliament, the Commission will very quickly launch an initiative in this vein."
". The Commission wishes to underline that there is no current requirement on air carriers to provide to the United States API data on passengers for overflights."
"As you probably know, the United States authorities are considering a so-called emergency amendment, which would require airlines to check all passengers against a United States no-fly list for all flights overflying the United States."
"The Commission would seek opportunities to discuss any such proposal which could have implications more generally for international air travel."
"The European Union has a rigorous policy on aviation security, but that does not include a no-fly list."
"The inclusion of persons in a no-fly list, however, does not mean that they are guilty of, or suspected of, involvement in criminal activity or other wrongdoing."
"Rather, the United States authorities, on the basis of wide range of information, have determined that the individuals in question should not be allowed to fly to or over the territory of the United States, either because their presence in the United States is deemed unwelcome or, because by travelling on an aircraft they might pose a security risk."
"Such decisions and the criteria on the basis of which they are made are exclusively the domain of the United States Government, which alone is responsible for them."
"Although the occasions on which flights are diverted are relatively few, we recognise the concern and inconvenience they may cause."
"The Commission will, therefore, pursue clarification of the United Nations no-fly list in talks with the United States, as I promised earlier in the summer."
"For example, early and effective communication to airlines of an up-to-date no-fly list is an essential aspect."
"The Commission is in the process of seeking to elucidate further with the American authorities on that criterion, in order to prevent in the future cases of false positives."
"I will be discussing this and other issues during my next meeting with Secretary Chertoff in Washington in early October."
". Commissioner, basically you are saying that you do not yet have the answer to this question."
"You are saying that we do not know how you get on to such a no-fly list, so we do not know how you get off it."
"I should also like to ask if you know who has access to these lists."
"Is it the American authorities?"
"The airline companies?"
"European authorities?"
"If a citizen is on a list for all the wrong reasons, then what can they do to be taken off it?"
"I do not think that your reply is satisfactory."
"We asked what the criteria were for being placed on such a list."
"I believe that is still a valid question."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that my reply must be extremely short and I would like to repeat that it is a fact that these decisions are the exclusive responsibility of the US Government."
"Europe, the European Union, I say again, and this is a matter of fact, does not have any competence to obtain authority or to require a reply on the criteria that govern inclusion in this no-fly list."
"We believe that it is not necessary to supply the no-fly list for Europe, but we are in contact with the United States to obtain those clarifications that we have not yet obtained."
"As I have said, I will go to Washington in person to obtain, among other things, a reply to this question."
"Madam President, the delegation for relations with the United States visited America a few weeks ago."
"The question now arises of whether it might be possible to draw up a common catalogue of persons who present a risk to security."
"I believe it to be important that there should be a transparent catalogue of criteria on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Does the Commission already have any ideas about this?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view this is an idea that can be taken further."
"As I said, it would be possible first of all to provide for the communication to the airlines of persons included on the no-fly list, to be provided suitably in advance of the aircraft’s departure, precisely to avoid cases such as those that have occurred of errors being discovered when the aeroplane is already in flight, with route diversions as a result."
"Then there is the possibility of achieving a substantive dialogue on the criteria for inclusion on the no-fly list, to which there would obviously be restrictions connected with the national sovereignty of the United States, which to date has not agreed to make these factors known precisely."
"We are talking exclusively about overflying the territory of the United States, not about flights from and to the United States."
"– You had a meeting with the US minister responsible in June 2005 on these issues and, in a written reply by the European Commission to my question on the subject, you say that the minister, Mr Chertov, asked you for more controls on passengers and cargo, improved used of technology for such controls and the removal of obstacles to the operability of mechanisms for imposing controls."
"I ask you specifically, and I would be obliged if you would not reply with generalities, what are the specific US proposals to the Commission and which of these proposals does the Commission accept?"
"Which does it say ‘yes’ to and which does it say ‘no’ to?"
"That was months ago."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, no specific proposals have been made – it has merely been repeated that there is a need to avoid, through upstream control, the possibility of persons suspected of serious offences, and in particular terrorism, being on an aeroplane flying over the United States."
"Our request to the United States was obviously not intended to interfere in the issue of US national security, but to obtain a guarantee regarding compliance with privacy in the handling of personal data."
"In response, a decision has been taken to set up an office and an authority responsible for the protection of personal data within the United States Internal Security Department."
"Pursuant to the legislation of the United States, such an authority is and will be responsible for all cases of contravention of the rules on proper handling of personal data."
"This is – and I repeat – a result obtained at the request of the European Union."
"With regard to other possible specific proposals – and I would like to say this once again – I believe that the only effective method is a direct personal meeting with Secretary Chertoff, and that is what I intend to do in the second week of October."
"What is the current state of affairs with regard to two key EU projects in the area of internal security proposed in my 1998 report, namely an EU police academy and common external border controls?"
". Indeed, as the honourable Member proposed in his 1998 report, it was precisely Parliament’s resolution on the effects of the enlargement of the European Union on cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs that resulted in the creation of a European police academy and of a Community service with regard to external border controls."
"I think that we can now be very proud that these two proposals have already become a reality."
"With regard to the first proposal, as you know, the European Police College (CEPOL) was established by the Council Decision of 22 December 2000, and I think we can say that it is now in a position to fulfil its role."
"Two Council decisions in 2004 gave it legal personality and named Bramshill in the United Kingdom as its permanent headquarters."
"A proposal presented by the Commission in October 2004 with the aim of improving the legal framework of the CEPOL is waiting for formal approval from the Council."
"I think we can tell you that a political agreement has already been reached within the Council itself, in June 2005."
"As Parliament’s reservations have all been resolved, I think that the decision will be formally approved in the course of September 2005."
"The proposal relating to the setting up of a specialist European service for external border controls, too, has led to the establishment, by the Council Regulation of 26 October 2004, of a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States."
"This agency, based in Warsaw, has started work and already has a budget of more than EUR 6 million for 2005."
"Madam President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for that outstanding and welcome answer."
"Can I just ask a supplementary question? I would like to know the present state of thinking about the idea that the Police College should be made even more of an institution, particularly by being made subject to Community control and being funded from the Community budget."
"What is the position on this issue?"
"As regards the external borders, I would like to ask whether thought is already being given to the possibility of joint units on them, or whether this is not yet being done at present."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the proposals to improve CEPOL – the police academy – will move in the direction of more rigorous control by the EU institutions and certainly in the direction of more substantial funding."
"In my view, one of the most important tasks is training the officers in the police forces of the 25 Member States."
"With regard to the European Agency for External Borders, however, the actions have obviously not yet been defined in the sense that you wish."
"Personally, I have always said that I was in favour of joint training for all the Member States’ border officials, so that if in the future the conditions warrant it, we will be able to prepare a European border officials force and a border police force."
"Opinions still differ on the matter, but to me it seems necessary for the Agency to be able to start to help the Member States immediately in operational checking activities at the borders."
"On this point, I can say that the first task I have entrusted to the Agency concerns the Mediterranean, and in particular support for certain major measures relating to the control of the Mediterranean’s maritime border, partly with a view to strengthening relations with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean – in other words, a task that is extremely important for Europe."
"On 10 May 2005, the Commission presented to the Council an action plan, designed to be a tool for the implementation of the Hague Programme for the period 2005-2010."
"At the same time, the Council proceeded to set up the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Regulation (EC) No. 2007/2004)."
"Can the Commission say how operational cooperation will be organised between the Member States?"
"Will the Agency organise joint operations to deport immigrants (Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No. 2007/2004) despite the declared opposition of the European Parliament?"
"Has the Agency decided, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No. 2007/2004, to set up branches in the Member States?"
"In which areas?"
". As you probably know, in its annual work programmes, the Agency for External Borders will, on the basis of the results of its risk analysis, identify a number of operational activities to be carried out each year by Member States together with the agency."
"In addition, Member States can also put forward proposals for joint operations and pilot projects which the agency may then decide to co-finance."
"The agency shall evaluate the results of all operational activities carried out under its aegis."
"If Member States carry out operations at external borders outside the framework of the agency, they shall report on such activities to the agency."
"As regards the joint return operations, it follows from Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 that the agency shall provide Member States with all necessary support in organising joint return operations."
"The agency will at this stage not carry out return operations itself, but only provide technical assistance to Member States."
"In this context, it should also be noted that the agency shall identify best practices on the acquisition of travel documents and the removal of illegally present third country nationals."
"A credible European migration policy necessitates the use of return operations in order to uphold the integrity and effectiveness of the asylum and immigration systems of the Member States."
"However, such return operations must always be carried out in full respect of the human rights and safety of returnees."
"The Commission expects the agency to play a major role in developing and promoting at European level the highest possible standards in this regard."
"The Hague programme asked for the establishment of common standards for persons to be returned in a humane manner and with full respect for their human rights and dignity."
"It called for the submission of a Commission proposal."
"On 1 September 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive providing for clear, transparent and fair common rules concerning returns, removal, temporary custody and re-entry which take into full account, I repeat, respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the person or persons concerned."
"Finally, as regards the internal organisation of the agency, the Commission can inform you that the management board of the agency decided on 30 June 2005 to launch an evaluation of the need for establishing specialised branches on the basis of the results of this evaluation."
"The management board will decide if and where the agency shall establish specialised branches."
"– Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"As you know, the Commission and the European Parliament take a different approach to this specific issue of addressing immigration flows and there is a great deal of concern within the European Parliament about not touching on basic human rights."
"I ask you directly: will you take account of the opinion of the European Parliament?"
"There have been occasions in the past when you have proceeded in the opposite direction."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the term ‘respect’ for Parliament signifies sincere and transparent confrontation."
"This morning I confirmed my readiness to present to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs as early as next week the whole package of proposals that the Commission approved only last week."
"It seems to me that I have been rather swift in being ready, as the competent committee in Parliament will be the appropriate forum for the expression of all the opinions formulated on this subject."
"Following the appointment of a new Director of EUROPOL, the positive impression made at his appearance before MEPs on the Civil Liberties Committee in June 2005, and a positive visit by MEPs to the EUROPOL Headquarters in April 2005, can the Commission give details of how it views the future cooperation between EUROPOL and the EU Institutions?"
"What view does the Commission take on the accountability arrangements between EUROPOL and the EU Institutions, including the Commission?"
"What view does the Commission take of the failure of Member States to ratify the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 (2002/465/JHA)(1), in reaction to EUROPOL, which would allow joint investigation teams to be set up to tackle such issues as illegal trafficking of human beings, drugs trafficking and other forms of organised crime?"
". Of course, as you know, several of the provisions in the Protocol to the Europol Convention of November 2003, which has so far been ratified by 16 Member States, aim to improve Parliament’s involvement in the work of Europol: forwarding the reports on the activities of Europol and of the joint supervisory body and the five-year financing plan, consultation on any initiative by a Member State or by the Commission regarding Europol, and the possible appearance before Parliament of the Presidency of the Council, possibly accompanied by the director of Europol."
"That is why the Commission urges the Member States to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible."
"Europol’s participation in a supporting role in joint investigation teams is expressly provided for by the Protocol to the Europol Convention of 28 November 2002, which has not entered into force."
"At the moment, it still needs to be ratified by five Member States."
"Indeed, that Protocol cannot result in Europol being given operational powers until the Member States themselves have implemented the framework decision of 13 June 2002 on joint investigation teams."
"On this point, the Commission shares Parliament’s opinion regarding the disappointing outcome of the instruments transposing the framework decision."
"As it is a field that falls outside Community competence, unfortunately may I say  the Commission does not have the right to institute infringement proceedings against the Member States that have not implemented this framework decision."
"Nevertheless, Europol has participated in a number of cross-border investigations that do not fall within the precise framework of the joint investigation team and, at times, has coordinated some of them, such as Operation Ice–Breaker on 13 June 2005 targeting Internet child pornography, during which 153 searches were carried out simultaneously in 13 different countries."
"Involvement in this investigation enabled it to strengthen its position."
"Finally, in its 2002 communication on democratic control over Europol, the Commission supported the idea of a joint committee of national parliaments and the European Parliament responsible for discussing matters related to Europol."
"It would be worth relaunching this idea."
"In this regard, the Commission is quite willing to participate in this type of parliamentary meeting."
"As you may know, two half-day meetings have been scheduled in Brussels in October, between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, specifically regarding parliamentary control of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"Four sub-topics are on the agenda: the European arrest warrant, Eurojust, Europol and the exchange of sensitive information."
"Mr Frattini, although you do not have the formal powers to take infringement proceedings, as you quite rightly stated, can you use your influence to determine a greater transparency between Europol and the institutions?"
"In a recent report on Europol, all sides in this House felt that transparency was totally lacking."
"However, we felt that the work of Europol was hugely valuable and that it is an effective organisation with a new director trying to invigorate the organisation."
"Given the importance of the topics that it deals with, can you use your influence to increase the transparency arrangements, which will only make the organisation more effective?"
". Yes, I fully agree with you on that point."
"I will do all I can to put political pressure on Member States to strengthen transparency and to try to make relations between Europol and the European Parliament and other European institutions more transparent."
"In terms of accountability, has the Commission sought a report from Europol on its apparent failure in detecting and impeding the progress of three international terrorists who fled as fugitives from justice in Colombia, before publicly appearing last month within the European Union, in Dublin?"
"If the Commissioner is not in a position to provide me with the information today, will he undertake to write to me on that subject?"
". We do not have that information yet, but I can reassure you that I will give you all the necessary information when it is available."
"As the author of the question is not present, Question No 51 lapses."
"Madam President, on a point of order, Mr Frattini has been answering questions for well over 20 minutes."
"Should we not move on to the third part of Question Time?"
"At the end of July the Commission intends to announce its assessment of the compatibility of Germany's visa rules with European law."
"What measures will Germany have to take to re-establish procedures for assessing visa applications which accord with EU rules?"
"Is the Commission aware whether such measures have been taken?"
"If appropriate, does the Commission intend to bring infringement proceedings?"
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has dealt with this matter and gone into it thoroughly following a written question by Mr Wuermeling, who recently received a written reply."
"The issue, as many of you will probably know, concerns the conformity of two reference circulars, one adopted in 2000 and the other in 2004, regarding the issue of visas and the circulars on specific subjects implementing the two reference circulars."
"The first circular, adopted on 3 March 2000 and known as the Völlmer circular, has been deemed by the Commission not to be in line with the principles of the Common Consular Instructions currently in force."
"We then examined the subsequent circular, adopted in October 2004, which replaced the previous circular from 2000."
"The conclusion that we came to, after our first stage of thorough examination, is that the 2004 circular remedies the general issue of conformity with the Common Consular Instructions in force."
"We also said, however, to the German authorities in our reply, and also of course to Mr Wuermeling, that, even though overall the 2004 circular seems to be in line with the Common Consular Instructions, clarifications, specifications and improvements in drafting are necessary in the text of the circular in force, adopted in 2004."
"We have also asked the authorities of the German Federal Government to provide some replies on the specifications required, and I can assure you that contact with the relevant authorities is continuing."
"Obviously, I intend to provide further replies as soon as the answers have been given to the Commission."
"I am much obliged to the Commissioner for the detailed written reply to the question which has now been provided."
"As the Commissioner has just said, the German visa decree of 26 October 2004 warrants further clarification, especially on the subjects of false statements by visa applicants and false documents."
"Since the Commissioner has also stated very clearly that there is no scope for national provisions in the Common Consular Instructions on Visas, I should like to know whether the 2006 revised version will put an end to this once and for all."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Klamt for this broad question."
"Let us remember that the lesson to be drawn from this incident is that we should harmonise the system for the issue of visas by the European Union Member States to an even greater degree."
"Let us also remember that on a subject such as the issue of visas, if the documentation is incomplete there cannot and should not be room for any doubt or uncertainty, not even in terms of interpretation."
"This is why the proposal for a revision of the Common Consular Instructions, which we will submit in early 2006, will be even clearer as regards incomplete information provided by an applicant, and as regards cases where elements are found to be untrue; the rule will be absolutely binding: a visa cannot and must not be issued."
"– I am very much obliged to the Commissioner for his clear statements on the ‘Volmer decree’, which simply was not in conformity with the law."
"I should like to emphasise once more that this is not a matter for Germany alone, because many people entered the EU on a German visa and then moved on to other Member States."
"Therefore, I wish to ask the minister to reiterate his assessment of the magnitude of this ‘incident’ and the extent of its adverse effect on Europe."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while I do not for the moment have exact data at my disposal, I can say that the impact of application across the board of rules contained in the Common Consular Instructions on visas has an extremely significant impact on the European Union, in so far as it affects thousands of people who request entry and who apply for a visa."
"In addition, as you said, this is not a German issue in a narrow sense, but concerns the need to ensure that all consulates in all the European Union Member States prevent the entry on a properly issued visa of anyone who cannot demonstrate that they fulfil the legal requirements laid down by the Common Instructions."
"If flexible interpretations of the rules occur, even if they are not breaches of the instructions in the strict sense of the word, the impact can nonetheless be extremely significant."
"As the author is not present, Question No 53 lapses."
"Resettlement of refugees is an important instrument in finding sustainable solutions to serious and protracted situations involving refugees."
"However, at the present time, only a few countries in the world accept refugees through resettlement."
"The EU could play an important role by introducing a common refugee quota."
"More Member States should take part than at present to enable the EU, in close cooperation with UNHCR, to work more strategically and to coordinate resettlement with other long-term efforts, such as targeted aid for assistance with return and reintegration."
"In the Hague Programme, the Council has called on the Commission to develop regional protection programmes in partnership with third countries and in cooperation with UNHCR, including a joint resettlement programme for those Member States wishing to take part."
"Has the Commission been able to launch a joint resettlement programme yet?"
"What view does the Commission take of a permanent resettlement programme within the framework of EU cooperation?"
"What are the Commission's views on the willingness of the Member States to take part in a joint resettlement programme?"
". The regional protection programmes, which were adopted last week by the Commission, aim to help, in a spirit of co-ownership and co-responsibility, third countries which have large refugee communities or are faced with large numbers of asylum applicants beyond their protection capacity."
"Voluntary resettlement will be an important element in every regional protection programme in terms of providing a lasting solution for refugees and demonstrating the partnership element to the third countries involved."
"Resettlement can help alleviate the burden of the regions of origin and consequently enhance their protection capacity."
"With regard to the development of an EU-wide resettlement scheme, the Commission believes that it is more appropriate to follow a step-by-step approach, as resettlement is a policy that is new to most Member States."
"At present, the objective pursued by the Commission is to maximise the protection benefit and overall impact of the resettlement activities to be undertaken under the regional protection programmes."
"The objective is therefore to encourage and facilitate to the greatest possible extent Member States' participation in the EU resettlement effort."
"In order to achieve that objective, the Commission services are working on an amendment to the Council decision of 2004 establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2005-2010, which would envisage that resettlement activities could be substantially financed by the Community as of 2007."
"This proposal is due to be presented for adoption by the Commission in October – very soon."
"As one of the stumbling blocks to any new policy initiative lies in budgetary support for its implementation, the financial underpinning of such a new policy is vital, as you understand very well."
"The Commission believes that the possibility of contributing to the actual resolution of protracted refugee situations through the strategic use of resettlement in the framework of regional protection programmes, combined with a strong financial underpinning of resettlement activities to be implemented in this context will provide – I am convinced – Member States with the incentive to participate in EU resettlement initiatives."
"The Commission has noted that several Member States are currently considering setting up their own national resettlement programmes."
"Moreover, there is no broad consensus among Member States on the need for a coordinated and systematic approach to addressing protection issues in regions of origin and an increasing acknowledgement of the fact that the targeted use of resettlement has the potential to deliver comprehensive and effective solutions to protracted refugee situations."
"Finally, on the basis of the evaluation of the pilot regional protection programmes and taking into account the operational and logistical needs of managing resettlement on an EU scale, the Commission will examine the appropriateness of bringing forward a proposal for a more structured approach to resettlement at EU level, which might lead in the long term to the development of a permanent EU resettlement scheme, something I firmly hope to see."
"I wish to thank Commissioner Frattini for this gratifying decision."
"As you know, I come from Sweden which is one of those countries that have been very committed to this issue."
"In the general debate about refugees we have had so far, we have not talked about this as an important solution."
"I am therefore looking forward to reading the forthcoming proposals and would thank you again for your answer."
". We will work in this direction."
"Since the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 55 to 94 will be answered in writing(2)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, although the success of this legislation has been mentioned, it is something that should be emphasised again and again."
"I shall tell you in a minute why I find the pedantry, and sometimes even the simplicity, of this debate distasteful."
"We have tabled amendments in committee – I have even tabled them myself – stating the need for this legislation to enter into force more quickly, the reason being that we have waited so long for it, on behalf of the children in the European Union."
"In addition – and this I say for Mrs Toia’s benefit – the role of the Paediatric Committee, which is to be set up in accordance with the legislation, must be enhanced."
"We have an interest in a strong Paediatric Committee, and what is more one which takes the lead."
"I agree with Mr Bowis, Mrs Grossetête and all the others who have said that we need the MICE research programme, another EU initiative."
"This must be given a proper basis in law, and the proper place for it is in the Seventh Framework Research Programme."
"I would ask Commissioner Verheugen to urge the Commission that scope and funding be made available for this within the Seventh Framework Research Programme."
"I have said that this is a great success, and so I regret that this success is not being given due emphasis in this debate."
"I find it cheap, pitiful and even shameful that this debate has focused almost exclusively on the extension of patent protection."
"It is interesting that there has been no discussion of the ten-year extension of data protection for medicinal products whose patent protection has expired: ‘PUMA’, as it is known."
"We should ask ourselves why this is not being discussed: because it creates a level playing field, as it were, between generic medicinal products and pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in research."
"Yet a dispute of which I have seldom seen the like in this House has developed about a six-month period to be given to those pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in research who still have a patent, or are applying for one. I would ask all of those who have a fixed opinion on this whether they have spoken to patients’ representatives;"
"If what Commissioner Verheugen said does happen, and there is an incentive to procure more medicinal products more quickly, it will be marvellous; it will be exactly what we want."
"We do not care whether someone earns half a million more or less in the process."
"There should be considerable benefits to research, and children should also stand to gain. That is what patients’ and parents’ representatives are saying."
"I am a relatively long-standing Member of this House, and do not want to see it split into two, with the countries and representatives of countries which have no research-oriented pharmaceutical industry but only a generics industry objecting that six months is too long, and others saying the opposite."
"Our sole concern should be doing what is best for patients, which is what the Commission is proposing."
"The majority of my group will be supporting that, and so shall I."
"Like my forespeakers, I would like to thank rapporteur Mrs Grossetête for her work on this important document."
"Its aim is to improve the current state of affairs, which is untenable from the medical point of view and, from the ethical point of view, it is unfair to children, to say the least."
"I believe that it does not require medical education to understand that a child is not just a miniature adult."
"Children are individuals whose metabolism is very different from that of adults."
"It is not possible to simply reduce the dose of medication needed to treat a child proportionately to its weight."
"For, we know that medications often have side effects that are well tolerated by adults, while they may lead to serious health complications in a child."
"I realise that it has not been easy to acknowledge the medical viewpoint, requirements and recommendations of the physicians while at the same time respecting the often legitimate claims and demands of the pharmaceuticals industry. But, what bothers me more, is that the discussion about this directive in Parliament concentrated on whether patent protection should last six months, three plus three or four plus two."
"Our ultimate aim is a healthy child."
"If, as a by-product, we have a happy pharmaceutical company, then we have achieved what we have intended and had to do."
"Mr President, children must have safe medicines, adapted to their needs. That is an obvious requirement of legislation."
"With a patent extension as long as six months, we are, however, paying an unnecessarily high price for having the pharmaceutical companies fulfil obvious requirements."
"The pharmaceutical companies already have multiannual protection and EUR 100 billion in their coffers for purchases. They can tolerate a 1% increase in costs much better than already depleted public budgets."
"We must not transfer even more money to these companies. In doing so, we should finally end up with safe medicines for both children and adults, but with no one able to afford them."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have put forward a compromise amendment involving a maximum of four months, with the further limitations described by Mrs Breyer."
"If this is unacceptable, Parliament will show that it is more attentive to the pharmaceutical companies’ lobbyists than to the needs of children."
"– Mr President, the regulation on the safety of medicinal products for paediatric use is a necessary and sensible alternative that puts an end to a long period of uncertainty surrounding medicinal products in the paediatric sector. The Commission’s proposal was well-balanced and was based on impact assessments."
"A six-month extension of patent protection as an incentive for pharmaceutical manufacturers is reasonable."
"This period is based on the results of the impact study and is a clear, fair basis for calculation for all manufacturers."
"I am pleased that a majority in Parliament supports this fixed period."
"Variable patent protection is impracticable and entails a considerable administrative burden."
"In addition, the duration of a patent must never be dependent on a product’s sales figures."
"The international competitive situation of the research-oriented pharmaceutical industry demands that we take a look at Europe’s attractiveness as a research destination."
"This is another reason why I see no material arguments in favour of the reduction in the fixed six-month period that is still under discussion."
"Mr President, I am not a paediatrician nor am I a pharmaceutical industry expert but I have some expertise in that we have two small children: Oliver, who is three and a half years old, and Emilie, who is eighteen months."
"To Mrs Grabowska I would like to mention, by the way, that fathers do actually go and buy medicines for their children: I did last time on Saturday at the Genvall pharmacy."
"I support the proposed regulation and I also support Mrs Grossetête’s excellent report, and I wish to raise three brief points with regard to it. The first, which is something we all know, is that research into medicinal products for paediatric use is not good business."
"In my opinion, this proposal for a regulation is an incentive for further research, and should be supported. My second remark is that the six month supplementary protection proposed by the Commission and Françoise Grossetête is a good thing, as at present we rely too much on the use of medicines intended for adults as medication directly adapted for children."
"My last point is that I think it is ultimately a question of whether we conduct clinical research or learn through our mistakes when children have received the wrong drugs. I would support the first option."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and the Commission statements on liberty and security: responding to the threat of terrorism whilst protecting the rights of citizens."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking you for the opportunity of addressing the European Parliament."
"I want to take the opportunity to set out the approach that the British Government will follow in its conduct of the Presidency of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will be occupied by myself and my colleague Baroness Ashton, who is with me today."
"I start from the proposition that the European Union has been a massive force for good."
"Thirty-five years ago, when I was a student, we campaigned for democracy in this continent, to remove the fascist or military dictatorships which then existed in Greece, Spain and Portugal, and the totalitarian dictatorships which then ruled much of eastern and central Europe."
"Those campaigns succeeded as, it is worth pointing out, did the campaigns in other parts of the world, for example Southern Africa and Latin America."
"In fact, 11 of the 25 current European Union Member States have since emerged to democracy as full members of the European Union."
"It is a magnificent achievement which we should continue to celebrate."
"Of course the nature of our societies has changed dramatically over these years, economically, socially and technologically."
"It has changed in the composition of our communities, which vary across the Union, with many communities of differing races, faiths and histories living together."
"But in all of this I believe that it is our duty to promote a society which is based on the true respect of one individual for another, one culture for another, one faith for another, one race for another."
"It is our duty to promote the view that democracy, and not violence, is the means of bringing about change and governing ourselves."
"We have to defend our values of respect, tolerance, freedom and democracy against any who wish to destroy or replace them with some other doctrine, particularly if they seek to use violence to promote their ambition."
"That is part of the history of the European Union, but it must be central to the future of the European Union too."
"As we look to that future we have to acknowledge that, despite the fantastic record, many of our citizens remain highly sceptical about the European Union, to such an extent that in some countries the national referenda rejected the proposed new Constitution in a way which suggested more deep-seated concerns."
"I believe that a deep reason for these doubts is that the European Union does not appear to give sufficient priority to offering practical solutions which make a difference to some of the issues of greatest concern."
"I am referring specifically to serious and organised crime, including drug dealing and people trafficking, to illegal migration and false asylum seeking, and to countering terrorism, whatever its origins."
"These issues top the political agenda across Europe, and they are often the most potent in mobilising political activity, often in a reactionary and even dangerous way."
"They can even be used by poisonous demagogues to undermine the very democracy which has in some cases so recently been created."
"It is not difficult to see why these threats motivate anger amongst our peoples."
"The threat from terrorism remains very real, as we tragically saw in London in July."
"In 2004 over 100 000 women were trafficked in the European Union and over 8 000 people die each year from drug use, as crime and misery is fuelled in every part of the continent."
"Illegal migration and a system of control which is too loose raise concerns in every city."
"I therefore believe that the whole of the European Union – but in particular the Justice and Home Affairs Council – needs to give real priority to tackling these issues in a practical and systematic way."
"It is that conviction which will inform the UK Presidency. In so doing I suggest three principal approaches."
"The first is that in our globalised world no single nation can tackle these problems alone, even in its own country."
"In a world with millions of international journeys and economic transactions every year, ideas of ‘splendid isolation’ or rhetoric about ‘the White Cliffs of Dover’ can do nothing to address international criminality, terrorism or serious and organised crime or address patterns of international migration."
"The need to fight terrorism and serious and organised crime means that we need more European cooperation and not less."
"The truth is that in each of these areas we will all, including within our own countries, achieve most by sharing experience, information and resources and by identifying and then targeting the threats systematically and consistently."
"I make the apparently obvious point that these threats are best tackled internationally, since there remain political parties and other organs of opinion within the European Union which believe that protection from these types of threat can best be secured by the construction of higher and higher fences between us, whilst the truth is the opposite – our best chances of success lie in deeper and deeper cooperation."
"The second principle that must underlie our approach is to strengthen the foundation of practical and pragmatic police and intelligence work."
"In each of these areas – organised crime, terrorism, immigration, asylum – we have already taken action at the European Union level."
"For example, we have agreed the European Arrest Warrant, common rules on penalties for and definitions of terrorism, people trafficking and other serious crimes."
"We have rules on police and judicial cooperation and we have established Europol and Eurojust to support their work."
"We have also strengthened freedom to travel within the EU and established the European Borders Agency."
"There is of course more that we can do and are doing. We have agreed a comprehensive programme of action in the Hague Programme and the Counter-Terrorism Action Plan."
"These contain many sensible, practical measures that will make a real difference to our citizens. If we want to demonstrate the real value of the European Union, we now need to work together to deliver on those commitments."
"I would like in particular to highlight the need for practical European Union support for intelligence-led operations and cross-border prosecutions, the development of joint teams to combat drug dealing and people trafficking, the sharing of information to facilitate joint work and the development of a European criminal intelligence model."
"In the field of migration and asylum, I hope that in this Presidency we will succeed in securing significant European Union readmission agreements with certain countries such as Russia, Ukraine and Morocco, and develop pilot regional protection programmes."
"In the field of civil justice, we will focus on the proposal to facilitate small claims and the establishment of a single European order of payment and other measures."
"These are all important practical steps, which I hope will command widespread support from this Parliament."
"But it is the third principle which I believe poses the greatest challenge in its modern application."
"That principle is that we need to use intelligence effectively and intelligently to target, track down, identify and convict the criminals who, through terrorist violence and serious and organised crime, threaten the security and strength of our society."
"Indeed I would go further: it is only through the effective and intelligent use of intelligence that in our modern world we can contest the criminality which attacks us."
"Of course criminals and terrorists use modern technology – the Internet and mobile communications – to plan and carry out their activities."
"We can only contest them effectively if we know what they are communicating."
"Without that knowledge, we are fighting them with both hands tied behind our backs."
"Of course the criminals know that and actively and consciously organise themselves to take advantage of our weaknesses."
"It may seem obvious to state that we need to collect and use intelligence against the threats that we face."
"But the European Parliament and national parliaments throughout Europe need to face up to the fact that the legal framework within which we currently operate makes the collection and use of this intelligence very difficult and in some cases impossible."
"The rules that currently govern our law enforcement bodies seriously inhibit their ability to protect us against criminals."
"Information is the lifeblood of law enforcement operations and it is that information which enables our police and agencies to prevent crimes with the minimum of impact on our daily lives."
"To tackle organised crime and stop terrorist groups before they carry out their activities, they need a clear picture of who the criminals are, what they are doing, where they are and how they communicate with each other."
"Often that picture is pieced together after the fact."
"But if we are to be effective in dismantling organised crime groups we must analyse intelligence and information so that we can target our efforts on the most dangerous criminals."
"However, that need is not always reflected in the rules that we apply to our police."
"This is not a sterile debate about principles; it is about practical measures to contest criminality and our opponents."
"That is why the UK Presidency, following the proposals set out in the Hague Programme, has placed on the agenda proposals on the retention of telecommunications data, establishing a second generation of the Schengen Information System and putting in place a new Visa Information System."
"That is why we argue that internationally consistent and coherent biometric data should be an automatic part of our visas, passports and identity cards where we have them – and I would even suggest driving licences as well."
"That is why we will work strongly to agree with our international partners, including the United States, the best measures for consistent international use of passenger data."
"These are all important and difficult measures. They can only be achieved through international agreements, particularly in the European Union and between the European Union and its partners throughout the world."
"They all require hard-headed discussions and practical agreement."
"This Presidency accepts that, in considering proposals in these areas, it is incumbent upon the advocates of change, such as the British Government, to make the case that measures of this kind have the practical advantages against criminality that I believe they do."
"That is why I am publishing today, as I promised the LIBE Committee in July in Brussels that I would, an explanation of the cases for some of these measures, in particular those relating to retention of telecommunications data."
"I hope that Parliament will look closely at the case that we put forward."
"My colleagues on the Justice and Home Affairs Council will be considering these issues carefully at the informal Council meeting in Newcastle later this week."
"But I believe that the central point for us to remember, as we consider these issues together, is that we now possess many hard-won rights such as the right to privacy, the right to property, the right to free speech, the right to travel and the right to life."
"Those rights are actively threatened by criminals and terrorists."
"We have a duty and a responsibility to help protect them for our citizens through practical measures."
"As we consider how best to do this, rights will always and inevitably have to be balanced."
"What matters in each case is that the steps are proportionate and that the protection against abuse is effective."
"I believe that our proposals offer that."
"Let me just cite the example of retention of telecommunications data."
"This is proving invaluable in the current investigations into the London attacks and in many cases in the UK it has proved essential to solving crimes, often months or years after they were committed."
"Communications service providers already retain much information for business purposes, but data protection obligations in some countries pressure them to erase data that has no business purpose."
"That means that catching a murderer or stopping a terrorist attack may depend on which mobile telephone company a victim, suspect or witness uses or has used, or which European Union country they were in."
"Some argue that to require telecommunications companies to retain data they use for billing purposes is an intrusion into privacy, or that it imposes undue costs on business."
"However, in the United Kingdom we have successfully established a system, in partnership with a major service provider, to retain essential data for up to twelve months for the cost of EUR 1.2 million."
"Compared to the average costs for forensic work on a single murder case of over EUR 0.5 million, that is an acceptable cost for the state to bear."
"Others have argued that we are asking for too much data, for example, that there should not be a requirement to retain unanswered calls."
"In many cases, however, this is data that has already been collected by the companies for their own purposes."
"All that we are asking is that it be retained and made available to law enforcement under national law."
"There is perhaps a more general concern that the proposal is an unnecessary invasion of privacy or that it is disproportionate."
"I do not believe that it is, because in many cases, some of which I have set out in the document I am circulating, the victim’s right to justice was only achieved through the retention of telecommunications data."
"Similarly, with the Schengen Information System, the next generation enables our law enforcement agencies to exchange information about individuals wanted for arrest or to be refused entry to the European Union, as well as information on lost and stolen documents or other objects."
"This is a critical tool for ensuring our collective security and for guaranteeing our rights."
"Equally, without a new system in place, the new Member States will not be able to lift their internal borders with other Schengen states."
"The Council and European Parliament will have to work together over the coming months to agree on the legal framework for the system."
"In my opinion, we will need to do this quickly so that the system can be put in place by early 2007."
"We all need to be sure that we are striking the right balance between our collective security and our fundamental rights."
"In so doing, we need to be sure that we have thoroughly explored the question of whether the Schengen Information System II should be a control system or whether it can be used more effectively as a tool for law enforcement."
"In making judgements about this, we need to reflect on the balance between the civil liberty being affected and the increased security being achieved, to ensure that any changes we make are proportionate and reasonable."
"This also applies to the Visa Information System, where we need to ensure that those with a legitimate right to travel can do so, while those who seek to exploit our freedoms are deterred."
"Increasingly, people use multiple identities to hide their movements."
"Biometrics are the most effective way to ensure that we can prove someone's identity."
"A comprehensive database of visa applications with biometrics matched to each applicant will mean that genuine travellers are able to prove their identity easily and travel more freely."
"Governments will have a clear idea of who is entering and leaving the European Union, with the reassurance that they have the legal right to do so."
"The use of biometrics also means that if people destroy their documents or are found overstaying we are able to identify who they are and where they come from."
"The Council and European Parliament will need to work closely together to agree and adopt the Visa Information System regulation."
"The Council aims to have the system up and running in consulates from the beginning of 2006."
"Given the substantial lead-in time for the equipment of posts and training, there is real urgency to adopt this regulation as soon as possible."
"Each of these examples is a practical measure that can enhance security and demonstrate the practical benefits of working together."
"In each case they will enhance the sharing of information. They will not lead – as some have argued – to the mass surveillance of our citizens or to unnecessary invasion of their right to privacy."
"However, I understand concerns that data may be misused or abused or that some people will be wrongly identified."
"That is why we need to ensure that in each case there is a clear legal basis for the exchange of information and that the basis should include the appropriate safeguards against abuse."
"Of course the proposals that I have set out are an enormous agenda for this Presidency and we will do our best to promote it."
"However, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government I also want to say that we believe that it is necessary to look very carefully at the way in which the jurisprudence around application of the European Convention on Human Rights is developing."
"The Convention, established over 50 years ago in a quite different international climate, has led to great advances in human rights across the continent."
"Its achievements must be fostered and developed and not undermined, but I believe that in developing these human rights it really is necessary to balance very important rights for individuals against the collective right for security from terrorist violence."
"Our strengthening of human rights needs to acknowledge a truth which we should all accept: that the right to be protected from torture and ill-treatment must be considered side by side with the right to be protected from the death and destruction caused by indiscriminate terrorism, sometimes caused, instigated or fomented by nationals from countries outside the European Union."
"This is a difficult balance to get right and it requires all of us, as politicians, to ask where our citizens – who elected all of us here – would expect us to draw the line."
"I believe that they expect from us not only the protection of individual rights but also the protection of democratic values such as safety and security under the law."
"The view of my government is that this balance is not right for the circumstances which we now face – circumstances very different from those faced by the founding fathers of the European Convention on Human Rights – and it needs to be closely examined in that context."
"I intend to discuss with colleagues in the Justice and Home Affairs Council how we might best address these issues in a manner consistent with our international obligations."
"I believe most strongly that the peoples of this continent want to be assured that the legislative regime which defends human rights must be used to defend the rights of all our citizens in a balanced and considered way and that it is our duty to discuss this openly."
"In conclusion, I believe that the ‘no’ votes against the Constitution should be taken as a wake-up call to those who believe in and support the European project to focus on what matters."
"The right to safety and security is a fundamental concern for all our citizens."
"Here we can show that Europe can and does deliver real benefits to our citizens."
"We in the European Union have a responsibility to rise to that challenge."
"It is not an area where we can fail them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the European Parliament for this important opportunity, which I shall use to reiterate, both personally and on behalf of the Commission, as has already been done on other occasions, our sympathy for the pain of all those throughout the world who have suffered and continue to suffer the consequences of terrorist attacks."
"If I may, I should also like to congratulate Charles Clarke on his commitment, on the measures deployed in a terrible, complex situation, and on the way you English people acted in July, which you describe with a word that I like very much: resilience."
"Our European Union – the citizens, the Institutions and the Member States that make up the European Union – our Union alone can make all the difference in a battle that no individual state can even think of winning on its own, no matter how strong, proud or well-prepared it may be."
"It is only here, right here, and by acting together that we can now and in the future win the fight against the enemies of our democracy, that we can offer concrete proof of our solidarity and profound empathy with all the victims of terrorism, whether in Europe, the United States, the Middle East or the many Arab countries that have also often been targeted by terrorism."
"Our task, the commitment that we have undertaken and must assume again today before the citizens of the 25 Member States, is to promote an overall strategy in the fight against terrorism."
"In my view, this strategy can and must be founded on three main principles: prevention, protection and reaction."
"Europe cannot and must not fail in this task because, confronted with a threat that is and will remain serious, confronted with the challenges of terrorism, in the aftermath of New York, Madrid and London and of all the attacks in the heart of friendly, neighbouring Arab countries, Europe now has an opportunity to live up to the expectations, both rational and emotional, that its citizens have held for some time."
"We are being called upon to act as respected leaders on the international political stage, leaders in a challenge that promises to be protracted, unfortunately, yet decisive for the future existence of our democracy."
"In my opinion, what is needed above all is a political response, not a response composed of special or emergency laws; what is needed is a vision for the future of a Europe that is at once a land of security and a land of rights."
"This first kind of response, in my view, is called prevention."
"Such prevention must first of all strike at the political design of an international terrorist network which attacks and rejects the cardinal values held by Europe and by democracies, which attacks citizens’ fundamental rights – one of the pillars of European integration."
"We have to lay bare the deep roots of violent radicalisation and the recruitment of terrorists."
"We want to do so – and we have to do so – by fostering an open dialogue with both religious and secular communities and of course with the countries of the Arab Islamic world, in order to find a common ground of values, a genuine universal citizenship that we are all invited to share."
"It is a kind of citizenship of which we Europeans are the proud and also jealous guardians, because it is based on the right to life, on the right to full respect for human dignity, on equality for all the women and all the men on earth."
"Such values will and must have political expression."
"We – the Commission – shall therefore make our contribution to the debate: in a few days’ time, in fact, on 21 September, we shall issue a communication to Parliament and the Council on violent radicalisation and the recruitment of terrorists."
"We must then develop international cooperation measures: Europe working together with international players, alongside the United States, alongside the countries of the Arab world, alongside all those who are fighting because they, like us, are victims of terrorism."
"We must do so, in my opinion, by closing the financial channels and cutting off the sources of funding that sustain terrorism and terrorist organisations."
"The second line of action is protection."
"We are working towards enabling citizens to enjoy a basic, fundamental right, which is the right to live in safety, the right to live our daily lives without fear."
"By the end of this year we shall be ready to put forward a European programme to improve the protection of critical infrastructure."
"It will be a complicated project that will require a great deal of research into security technology, which is why we are promoting a thorough dialogue between the public and private sectors, as clearly both are involved in a project that aims at ensuring that the infrastructure supporting people’s daily lives is more secure than it is today."
"We must also put in place an effective reaction capability and increasingly promote effective cooperation between the investigating authorities and the intelligence community. Our objective is to try to create a genuine European network aimed at developing the principle of availability, a decisive factor in encouraging the exchange of information, which – where it is available – can sometimes be vital in preventing a terrorist attack."
"That is one of the many tasks that, in my view, are very important, on the path towards establishing that mutual trust among the Member States that we are trying to achieve."
"The European arrest warrant has been approved, and it has turned out to be a successful experiment, as shown by the recent events in July."
"The next task will be the European evidence warrant, another important means of improving mutual trust among the Member States’ authorities."
"Precisely on the subject of mutual trust, we are trying out an operational capability for cooperation that does not depend on legislation but on the will of the Member States’ authorities – above all on the political will of the Member States – to work together."
"Wherever possible, we are aiming at less legislation and more operational cooperation measures."
"We never tire of repeating – as I have done several times here in Parliament – that in thinking about and working at improving security we have to maintain a firm, practical balance between investigation requirements – the right to investigate and to repress very serious crimes – on the one hand, and other fundamental rights on the other."
"I shall clarify straight away why I say ‘other’ rights: I believe that the right to security and, hence, the right to life, the right that we all have to walk around our cities without fear, is a pillar on which our fundamental rights rest."
"In short, we have to know how to balance both investigative activities and the defence or protection of the right that we all have to privacy."
"That is an essential point that we shall, of course, take into account when we set out our proposals."
"We shall put forward a proposal for a directive on the retention of telecommunications and Internet data, and in October we shall put forward a proposal that is perhaps even more politically significant: the first structured proposal on data protection in the so-called third pillar, that is to say in the area of cooperation among police and investigation forces."
"The latter proposal could, for the first time in Europe, set up a truly European institutional framework to safeguard people’s privacy; as you know, such a framework does not yet exist."
"We shall debate the content of proposals to retain personal data. Above all, amongst other safeguards, there will be a clear guarantee that data can be used only for a certain period of time after being gathered, only for specific purposes, and only under the control and supervision of free and independent authorities, particularly the investigating judicial authorities."
"One need only remember that there are currently 25 different bodies of law on this subject in Europe: there are Member States that keep data for up to several years, whereas others do not make the same data available to investigators because they destroy them straight away."
"Lastly, as Mr Clarke has said, there are even situations where one company retains and holds telephone usage data on its customers and another company does not."
"We must all understand, therefore, that only the harmonisation of a European framework can make us stronger even in this extremely sensitive area."
"We have to be aware that we are fighting against time: security cannot wait for us and we cannot afford to give those faceless people who want to attack us any more time."
"Understanding is needed, but so is determination."
"The European institutions, this Europe of ours, which has just endured the referendum crisis, has been dealt a further blow, an attack aimed at the very heart of our cities."
"We are very well aware of how important our response is now and how much an effective, well-balanced response will help the future of the European project and, above all, our citizens."
"That is why I agree that we urgently need to make a decision, as Mr Clarke said. However, I also consider it essential that Parliament should, by right, play a leading role in this undertaking at this time, more than on any other occasion, and that it should be fully involved in an institutional process that allows for as much dialogue and sharing of responsibilities as possible, especially through initiatives adopted in accordance with the Treaty."
"In conclusion, we must demonstrate our common good will: Europe and its Institutions – this Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"It is not just a matter of our common destiny; we must also make Europe take the political lead, which means giving our citizens a response."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot regard the despicable terrorist attacks in London on 7 July as anything other than yet another assault on our Western civilisation and on our shared ideals of democracy, human rights, freedom and peace."
"On behalf, then, of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to express to you, in your capacity as the British President-in-Office of the Council, our sympathy with the victims and also our profound sense of solidarity."
"When the news reached us in the Conference of Presidents, where we were at the time, we were deeply impressed by the way the people of London responded with wise and calm determination and got back to something like normal life."
"If terrorism is to be denied any chance of destroying our Western civilisation, that is what we need, and for that I pay tribute to the people of London."
"The terrorist attacks on London are the latest in a series of appalling events – New York and Washington, Bali, Casablanca, Istanbul, Madrid on 11 March 2004, Beslan a year ago, as well as others."
"Today’s debate must, as it is intended to do, make clear that we will be unstinting in our efforts to wage war on terrorism with words and deeds and with the utmost determination."
"Although the European Parliament, the Commission and the Member States have recently moved closer to a common approach to combating terrorism, the problem is that many of the measures adopted have not been properly transposed into the laws of individual Member States or have not been implemented by these within the time limits specified."
"I therefore urge the Commission and the Presidency of the Council to do everything possible to ameliorate that state of affairs."
"It was as long ago as 2001 that the European Parliament defined what role the European Union should play in the war on terrorism."
"Mr Watson, who was at the time the Chairman of the relevant committee, drafted that report, as he did the 2002 reports on the European arrest warrant and the common concept of terrorism."
"It was on 7 June, only a few weeks ago, that we adopted a very comprehensive package of eight reports on anti-terrorism."
"We know – and both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner said so in their speeches – that Europe must act as one in combating terrorism from within and without."
"That does of course mean that the Member States must work closely together, but also, and especially, that there must be action on the part of the institutions of the European Community."
"The war on terrorism is above all else an intellectual and political struggle, for the object of terrorism is to destroy the free social order under which we live; it is for that reason that it cannot coexist with democracy."
"If democracy is to fight back against terrorist attacks, that requires no more and no less than that we avail ourselves of all the legal means available."
"I am profoundly convinced that the war on terrorism can be won only if we wage it within the bounds set by our democracy and by the rule of law, not least international law."
"It follows that there must be no lawless areas when it comes to combating terrorism, but what that also means is that we must now regard it as our common task to guarantee the security of our citizens wherever we can."
"In the aftermath of the Second World War, through the process of European integration, the European Union was very successful in bringing people prosperity."
"One of the core tasks of this European Union of ours is now, by means of common action, to bring them more security."
"The more we – by which I mean you, the British Presidency of the Council, the Commission, all of us together – succeed in guaranteeing that the public are kept safe from terrorism and criminal activity, the more the European Union will, in turn, be accepted."
"Let us all, then, take action on a truly common basis."
"What I have to say to the Islamic world is that terrorism, in the minds of those who spread it and engage in it, is often associated with, and justified by, religion."
"To justify it in those terms is to pervert Islam."
"Over recent years, I have visited something like twenty Islamic states, most of whose people, along with their governments, want peace rather than a clash of civilisations."
"So can we please never fall into the error of identifying terrorism justified in Islamic terms with Islam as a whole?"
"We want, instead, to work together with Islamic states, in peace and as partners."
"It is now our common task to do something real and tangible."
"My colleague Mr Mayor Oreja, our coordinator Mrs Klamt, and Mr Kirkhope, will have more to say about that, and it will be very practical."
"What matters now is that we should not content ourselves with words, but do what has to be done, with Parliament, the Commission and the Council acting together."
"In so doing, we have to make it clear that we are willing to engage in dialogue with all those who seek to hammer out the issues peaceably, but we will wage war on those who do not seek peace."
"There must be no doubt as to our determination, and so I hope that our common cause against terrorism – which, Mr President-in-Office, is yours, the Commission’s and our own – will meet with success."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, listening to the speeches by Mr Clarke and Commissioner Frattini gives one the impression of having been transported ten years back into the past."
"Ten years ago, in this House, we were having the same debates."
"Mr Clarke is of course right; it is of course the case that the European public regards the European Union as very definitely competent to address such issues as the combating of criminal activity, terrorism and the trade in people and drugs."
"Every Eurobarometer survey shows what the public think the EU ought to be doing, and high up the list are the effective combating of criminal activity, protection against the threats presented by terrorism and by trafficking in human beings."
"Mr Clarke says, and he is right to do so, that we need to work together more, and I will quote him verbatim: ‘in our globalised world, no single nation can tackle these problems alone’."
"How very true that is; it is for that reason that we need more cooperation, which must be founded on mutual trust."
"Listening to Commissioner Frattini, though, we learn that it is this same mutual trust that is absent, and that, if the Member States work together, their 25 different legal systems mean that they do not trust one another, for one country will store data for five years and another will get rid of it at once."
"What remains unchanged over ten years is that the EU Commissioner responsible for these matters declares that the European institutions need more powers and responsibilities, while all the governments, including your own, say that everything is just fine as it is, in the third pillar."
"Until such time as we resolve this contradiction, we can hold as many debates in this House as we like, but we will not achieve a greater degree of efficiency."
"That is what we in this House must spell out to both the Council and the Commission."
"You, in both of these institutions, must get a move on!"
"Time is pressing upon us."
"Having delivered what you, Mr Clarke, rightly described as a wake-up call in the referenda, the public want us to combat terrorism and crime in an efficient manner."
"There are things that they want us to take seriously."
"One is the idea that there is a European identity, the result of which might well be common and effective European policies."
"In Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Finland, nobody saw the London bombings as merely attacks on London; they felt them as attacks on all of us, on every single citizen of Europe."
"What is apparent, then, to me from what is going on politically is that there is a system of values that matters to all the people of Europe and that they want to join together in defending."
"What that means, then, is that a values-oriented basis for this European Union of ours has been in place for some time, and so the EU can certainly be entrusted with the defence of these values."
"That is an important point, and in two respects: on the one hand – and this is where I am 100% behind Mr Clarke – that we must not be squeamish."
"I realise that that is a rather sloppy use of language."
"Those, be they terrorists or criminals, who threaten our values, have no inhibitions; they have no respect for fundamental civil liberties."
"It follows that we have to answer them in the same clear terms: on those who resort to violence, terror and criminal acts the hand of the forces of security and public order must come down hard."
"There is no other way."
"Another measure of a democracy’s strength, though, is that it is able, at the same time, to show itself tough and also to guarantee its upright and law-abiding citizens their fundamental civil rights."
"You mentioned the principle of proportionality, and that is the solution to this problem; rigour on the one hand, and guaranteed fundamental civil rights on the other."
"It is a solution we must achieve, but we will manage that only if EU institutions on the one hand and national institutions on the other trust each other and cooperate with one another."
"The last thing I have to say has to do with the question of how we deal with fundamentalists."
"No matter what sort of fundamentalism we are talking about, there is no room for it in Europe’s civil society."
"What has to be said about Islamic fundamentalism is that no Christian society will succeed in isolating Islamic fundamentalists; that is the particular task of moderate Islamic societies that tend towards democracy, and one particular place where such a society is to be found is Turkey."
"It is in Turkey that an Islamic government is engaged in establishing our western values on firm foundations; it was at that government that the attacks in Istanbul – to which Mr Poettering referred – were aimed."
"We should not, then deny access to the road to Europe to governments like that – Turkey’s in particular – or to a society like that, for if it turns out to be possible for our values to put down roots in an Islamic society, it demolishes the Islamists’ thesis that such a thing is impossible."
"That, too, is part of the active war on terrorism."
". Mr President, no civilised person could excuse the indiscriminate barbarity which claimed the lives of 52 innocent civilians in London on the morning of 7 July, a city which had only the previous day celebrated the plurality, diversity and tolerance which had won the admiration of the International Olympic Committee and helped award it the 2012 Olympic Games."
"Following the terror attacks in Istanbul and Madrid, nobody can deny that terrorism today is a serious challenge for Europe."
"My Group welcomes the commitment of the UK Presidency and of the Commission to improve policies to strengthen security across the European Union."
"We are concerned, however, that these policies should be measured, proportionate and value-driven."
"We do not agree with the President-in-Office when he said in London that the human rights of the victims were more important than the human rights of the terrorists."
"Human rights are indivisible; freedom and security are not alternatives: they go hand in hand, one enabling the other."
"As Thomas Paine warned: 'He who would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself'."
"Much as the public may dislike it, suspected terrorists have rights."
"They have the right to a fair trial."
"They have the right to be interrogated, not tortured, by the police."
"They have the right to legal counsel and to representation in a court of law."
"And, if convicted, they have the right to be imprisoned in a European jail."
"There should be no exception for third-country nationals."
"There is a worrying tendency in Member States to deport people considered to be threatening public order, national security or the rule of law, to countries where they may face torture or worse."
"It is deeply troubling when the tools of justice and public order themselves violate the European Charter of Human Rights and well-defined international standards."
"To suspend those values and invoke a form of summary justice would, in the words of the lawyer Cherie Booth 'cheapen our right to call ourselves a civilised society'."
"The language of the war on terror leads too easily to the justice of Wyatt Earp and 'High Noon', a point illustrated by the tragic death of Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes at the hands of the UK authorities on 22 July."
"Governments have been all too eager to exploit the fear factor in this matter."
"In Italy, stop-and-search powers have been given to the armed forces."
"In Germany, police surveillance in public places has been stepped up."
"In France, CCTV cameras cover the public transport system."
"Any of these measures in themselves may be justifiable but, in a climate of fear without proper democratic oversight and control, they foster insecurity."
"No wonder that faith-hate crime has risen across the European Union and many Muslims feel they are being criminalised."
"It would be particularly ill fitting for those of us who were teenagers in democracies in the 1960s – sometimes called the 'freedom generation' – to deny our children the standards of justice for which our colleagues from central, eastern and parts of southern Europe fought so bravely."
"Liberals and Democrats agree with the UK Presidency that anti-terrorism measures need to be implemented fully and rapidly."
"Why are 7 of 24 instruments considered by Justice and Home Affairs ministers on 24 May still not implemented in all Member States?"
"Why are six unratified EU conventions still occupying ministerial time, when framework decisions could be more easily implemented and enforced?"
"Why have Europol and Eurojust not been given the capacity to operate?"
"Why has the EU's antiterrorism coordinator not been allowed the cooperation he deserves from national capitals?"
"The Council sometimes laments Parliament's objections to security measures that it wants to introduce."
"But the European Parliament would feel far more comfortable in agreeing to urgent measures if it was satisfied that the Council was operating in the normal framework of democracy."
"A framework decision on data protection to accompany data retention measures, for example, would overcome the understandable fears of many colleagues that rights are being eroded."
"A commitment to legislation in the first pillar, with transparent policy-making and guaranteed rights, would enhance the moral standing of Europe's response to terror."
"A serious commitment to sharing criminal intelligence information – perhaps the biggest challenge – would be welcomed and supported by this House."
"The nub of our dilemma is that the State is the main protector of both our security and our liberty."
"If the European Union is to provide security against supranational threats, it must guarantee liberty supranationally too."
"President-in-Office, Commissioner, if you are prepared to work with Parliament in that kind of dialogue, you will have the full support of Liberals and Democrats in this serious issue of tackling terror."
"Mr President, one of the things that I noticed in the presentation from Council was that we were not only talking about terrorism but also organised crime. I think that is extremely important when we are looking at some of the measures which are before us."
"Because, if what we are saying is that the activities of what we acknowledge is a handful of people really have the power to sway and transform civil liberties within the European Union, then part of the battle that we always ascribe to terrorists has already been won."
"I think that is an extremely worrying factor."
"My Group would thoroughly agree with what Mr Watson has said to the effect that human rights are universal."
"They are not divisible, they are not negotiable and they are not applicable only to certain groups."
"We know from our own experience in the United Kingdom, when we were dealing with terrorism from the IRA years ago, that we could often see that convictions took priority over evidence and over correct police procedure."
"That is something we need to be aware of and bear in mind."
"I am more than slightly concerned when I hear the Minister talking about the need to re-evaluate the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The debate in the United Kingdom and elsewhere is already starting to refer to an 'inconvenient' Article 3, which is the one that deals with inhumane and degrading treatment and which cannot be derogated from."
"In the United Kingdom, we have already derogated from Article 5."
"I agree that we need to build on the European Convention, we do not need to dismantle it and we do not need to 'nuance' it so that it catches those that at the moment we are choosing not to support because, when we look at the history of certain of those terrorist groups, they have been supported in the past by certain of our governments."
"We also need to be wary of creating a feeling amongst people that everyone is a potential terrorist or criminal."
"We need a strong civil society, as Commissioner Frattini pointed out, one which is democratic, in which people feel they can participate and are not excluded on the basis of their race or religion."
"My Group is concerned about the publication of the code of conduct for not-for-profit organisations and would be interested to know what the basis is for putting that within a context of terrorism and criminality."
"People involved in not-for-profit are often some of the most active and constructive citizens that we have."
"This feeling of suspicion is something which also feeds radicalisation and fundamentalism, which can be based on race as well as religion."
"We look forward to further moves dealing with race hatred and xenophobia within the European Union."
"We would also be interested to see what the foreign policy link is going to be in this discussion on radicalisation."
"Much of what we are hearing this morning is based on the concept of a benevolent state."
"We want to know where the safeguards are going to be, what the political oversight is going to be, how that is going to involve the European Parliament and our national parliaments and what redress is available for those who find themselves caught up and on lists that they should never have been on in the first place."
". Mr President, none of us here underestimate the seriousness of the terrorist threat, none of us have forgotten or dismissed the terrifying and quite horrifying images from New York, Bali, Casablanca, Madrid, London or Sharm-el-Sheikh."
"We are all aware of the need to strengthen police and judicial cooperation to destroy these criminal networks."
"We – the Commission, the Council and Parliament, including, of course, our group – can agree on all of these points."
"This consensus breaks down where the tightening up of security and the erosion of civil liberties start."
"I will return to that in a moment."
"I would add that we also disagree with this kind of excessively common Western conscience that prevents us from seeing the terrible flaws in our own systems."
"I want to say a few words about that."
"Finally, we cannot follow those who refuse to consider seriously the roots of the menace we are fighting."
"I will start with the tightening up of security and the erosion of civil liberties."
"In the name of the fight against terrorism, it seems that anything goes."
"We were given a new illustration of this danger following the tragedy in London."
"The shoot to kill policy recommended by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and adopted by certain Member States led to the worst case scenario this summer: the death of an innocent person."
"We think that this method has no place in a state under the rule of law, whatever the circumstances."
"The end does not justify the means."
"That is why the concept of a war on terror seems to us to be so dangerous."
"It is in this context that we will examine very attentively the content of the new draft directive on data retention."
"Parliament’s position on this matter was clear, and it must be respected."
"Europe’s motto must not become, , ‘supervise, suspect, suppress’."
"My colleague Mr Catania will discuss this point further during the debate."
"Next, I referred to the endless references to our values and to Western values."
"This leads, whether we intend it or not, to endorsing the idea that the world is divided into ‘them’ and ‘us’, with ‘us’ being the reference point and ‘them’ being the source of the problems."
"All of us here can still remember Mr Berlusconi’s appalling remarks following the attack on the World Trade Center."
"We should, he said, be conscious of the superiority of our civilisation."
"Commissioner Frattini has just used rather different language, and that is all to the good, because Western-centrism makes us blind to the injustice, oppression and humiliation spread throughout the world in the name of the West, from Jenin to Abu Ghraib or Fallujah, or from Grozny to Guantanamo Bay."
"Then, suddenly, this blindness comes back to hit us like a boomerang."
"This leads me to our third point of disagreement, in particular with the UK Presidency, which is refusing to listen to anyone who stresses the truth, even though it is becoming more and more obvious, namely that the war in Iraq, officially justified in the name of the war on terrorism, is, in reality, producing a continual stream of terrorists."
"Even the Royal Institute for International Affairs itself, for pointing this out very clearly, was taken to task in no uncertain terms by Mr Jack Straw, who said: ‘the time for excuses for terrorism is over’."
"If condemning this war equates to making excuses for terrorists, then Mr Straw should remember that he encounters such accomplices of terrorism in the very heart of the Council."
"For example, his new Spanish counterpart, Mr Moratinos, who is well acquainted with the Middle East, declared after the Madrid attacks, and I quote, ‘the strategy pursued by the American administration and other Western countries has failed in a devastating way.’"
"Mr Prodi himself, who has become more perceptive since he left the Commission, told the newspaper last year, with regard to the conflict in Iraq, that, and I quote, ‘terrorism, which should have been stopped by this war, is infinitely more powerful today.’"
"These are the issues - respect for freedom, dialogue between cultures, and rejection of the war - that we must be able to discuss openly and from which we must draw the right conclusions."
"Then the just fight against terrorism will unite us all and will take a huge step forward."
". Mr President, there is a long-established principle in the European Union, established, in fact, by Jean Monnet himself, of the beneficial crisis: whenever something is going badly wrong, whenever national governments are concerned as to what to do, when the public are deeply fearful, then the answer, of course, is more integration and more central control within the European Union."
"I have been watching this debate ever since the appalling attacks in New York four years ago, and that is what people in the European Union have tried to do at every attempt. It is perfectly clear that is what Mr Clarke and the UK Presidency intend to do."
"Of course, I understand clearly the argument that telephone communication information can help us to track down people."
"But Mr Clarke said that we should share this information provided that there was a clear legal basis upon which to operate."
"What clear legal basis is there inside this European Union?"
"There are no rules in the European Union; it does as it wishes."
"It would be a terrible mistake to entrust this organisation with that amount of information."
"We should be moving forward together by cooperating, but of course that is not the approach, is it?"
"No, we cannot have Interpol; we cannot have normal extradition treaties between Member States!"
"We have to have Europol; we have to have the fatally flawed European arrest warrant."
"At every stage, cooperation between nation states goes out of the window and central control from the European Union comes in."
"I was flabbergasted to hear you say, Mr Clarke, that this is not a sterile debate about principles."
"I would have thought that at this, of all times, we ought to take a step back and have a real think about good principles."
"In the case of the United Kingdom, is it worth us losing the presumption of innocence before guilt?"
"Is it worth us losing our right to trial by jury?"
"Is it worth us losing habeas corpus, our basic protection against the police state?"
"Is it worth us losing all of these things in the name of the war on terror and in the name of pushing yet more of our law-making ability towards the European Union?"
"I would say that it is not, and, in practical terms, none of what you are proposing will work – remember that the Madrid bombers and the New York bombers all had valid I.D. I am sorry, Mr Schulz, but there is no such thing as a 'European identity'."
"We should be dealing with this at a nation state level and cooperating together, rather than thinking that the European Union can solve any of this. It will not."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office, Mr Clarke, and Commissioner Frattini for their speeches today."
"I would also like to have put on the record of this House my absolute horror and condemnation of all terrorist acts, speaking as somebody who comes from the island of Ireland and who understands the effects and impact of terrorism, the way that it can undermine not only that very basic human right, the right to life, but can also undermine the power of the State, the power of the institutions and the right of good and free-thinking people to undertake opposition to political movements and go about their daily lives."
"We can all point to individual examples and different times when terrorist acts have so horrified us that we have wanted to respond according to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."
"We have been very lucky in a lot of ways in that, at those times of crisis, many of our leaders have been able to stay calm and wait for the intelligence information to come through before responding to the threat."
"In this debate today, we must likewise remain calm and not give in to the narrow jingoism that some people encourage, but rather focus on creating a better European Union, that European Union which is made up of a Europe of nation states, where those nation states with their own democratically-elected governments determine and decide what they will cooperate in, what they will do and whether they will have laws, directives, framework agreements or merely bilateral agreements."
"That is the essence of the way democratic control should work in the area of liberty and security."
"Because, when we look through the history books of the 20th century and of the 21st century, terrorism and its impact – and the human devastation it causes – are as great today as at the start of the 20th century."
"But, likewise, the same mistakes that were made by governments at the start of the 20th century seem to be repeated today at the start of the 21st century."
"When we hear talk about utilising jurisprudence in the work that is being done with regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and building on that, of course we should all be heartened to hear that our laws and our policies will be guided by those principles."
"But at the same time, the actions that we see after those words sometimes appear to undermine those very basic core tenets contained in the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Too often when we bring in special laws and new laws in response to these kinds of emergencies or situations, they stay on our books after the emergency has passed and can be utilised again and again."
"Of course we must have cooperation."
"Of course we must give the tools to our security services to ensure that they are able not only to prevent terrorism, but also to capture the perpetrators of terrorism, those who finance terrorism and those who are involved in other forms of criminality, whether it be drug-trafficking, money-laundering or people-trafficking."
"We have seen the horrors of people dying inside container trucks in ports around Europe."
"We have seen the horrors of people dying in boats trying to come into Europe because of the abuse of their human rights by people-traffickers."
"Let me hasten to add that I am not one of those people who say that all governments are wrong and all opposition groups or all non-governmental groups are right."
"There is a balance to be struck between the rights of the individual and the rights of the common good."
"We must become the heralds of a new world, a world that recognises those fundamental and basic rights of freedom, the right to life, the right to liberty, the right to security."
"With all of those rights comes a responsibility."
"We enter into a social contract with our governments."
"We abdicate some of our own individual rights and freedoms in the interests of the common good to make sure that our world, our countries, our towns are better and safer places."
"But, in giving away those individual rights and freedoms, we also expect the same responsibility on the part of those in power."
"We expect the same responsibility on the part of those who run our security forces not to abuse that right and not to abuse the tasks that we have given them."
"The common good that the authority of the State serves is only as strong as the certainty in the minds of its citizens that their rights are protected and their responsibilities are clear."
"Mr President, Jihad networks are operating across Europe, and in mosques, a holy war is being waged against our European open society."
"Following the cowardly attacks in London, it should be clear to everyone that it is time, now more than ever, for tough and comprehensive measures against the Trojan horse that Islamic extremism represents in our society."
"I am therefore right behind a number of recent proposals and declarations that have been made in the wake of the events in London."
"For example, the French Home Affairs Minister, Mr Sarkozy, is quite right to propose the introduction of much stricter controls on mosques."
"Equally, Mr Beckstein, the CSU Home Affairs Minister of Bavaria, is quite right in stating, and I quote: ‘we have to know what happens in every mosque and we must be present and gather intelligence where extremist ideas are being preached’."
"Accordingly, the British Government will deport those who call for holy war, who incite violence and who gloss over acts of terror."
"It is at last taking action, and the other Member States would do well to follow in Britain’s footsteps."
"To return to the title and content of the declarations, I should like to make it clear at this point that the stricter controls of mosques do in no way entail a violation of the freedom of religion."
"When John Howard, Australia’s Prime Minister, said a few days ago that he is in favour of an infiltration of Islamic schools and mosques, he also made it clear in the same breath that his government does in no way want to interfere in the freedom of religion."
"He did formulate the obvious message that his government has the right to know what sections of the Islamic community support, or incite, violence."
"Indeed, that and that alone lies at the heart of the matter."
"Our open society is entitled to defend itself against its enemies."
"Freedom of religion can never be a licence for undermining our European society on European soil."
"In that sense, I should like to praise the courage of the Czech President, Mr Klaus, who is the only Head of State or Government who dares establish the link between Islamic bombings on the one hand and, on the other, the multiculturalism by which our own values are diluted to the extent where they no longer exist."
"We as Europeans must therefore put an end to lax immigration policy that allows the annual influx of 10 000 people who refuse to adapt to our laws, our standards and our values."
"When a country like Spain amnesties 700 000 illegal aliens in one fell swoop, then that is a recipe for lawlessness and encourages new waves of illegal immigration."
"It is high time we revisited a number of international treaties and assessed to what extent they need adapting to today’s requirements."
"The Geneva Refugee Convention springs to mind, that dates back to 1952, right in the middle of the cold war, a time in which we were faced with Europeans wanting to escape Communist dictatorships."
"The same applies to the European Convention on Human Rights, which should be revised as a matter of urgency."
"The intention is not to question the basic ideas of these conventions, only to ensure that they are no longer used by ill-intentioned people."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the United Kingdom Presidency for coming here to make this important statement."
"Terrorists constantly seek to undermine our way of life, believing that we are weak and lack the strength to defend our democratic values, and we must always prove them wrong."
"But it is vital that we prove the terrorists wrong by our actions, not just our words."
"In this respect, is there not a salutary lesson to those of us who debate and legislate here?"
"We need to review the delicate balance of civil rights, – and I agree with that – but it is very important that those who go about their normal lives – their normal, innocent and lawful lives – should be protected."
"I deprecate the sanctimonious twaddle of Mr Watson, representing the Liberals."
"Of course each terrorist deserves justice; justice has to determine innocence and guilt."
"But I believe that we have to understand that the nature of justice, as it is meted out to terrorists, and the standard of justice that is available to protect the innocent, must be of a different level."
"I hope he understands that; hopefully, this House believes that – I and my colleagues certainly do."
"On the actions that we need to take, it is of paramount importance that the law enforcement authorities be given the tools necessary to defend us, without being hamstrung by too much bureaucracy."
"Flexibility and adaptability are vital in the face of mutating threats."
"The terror threat is not new, nor does it recur in the same way each time."
"Over the last three decades, we have seen Black September, the IRA, the Red Brigades, ETA, Bader Meinhof, animal liberationists, bombs on the Paris Metro, American Embassy bombings in Africa, then the attacks in New York and Washington in 2001, Madrid in March 2004 and, of course, in London in July this year."
"Those are just some of them, there are others."
"We have seen some successes, as targeted measures against some of these organisations have brought results."
"Only recently, several members of ETA were arrested on the basis of a joint operation between French and Spanish authorities."
"When I hear remarks like those from UKIP, it worries me."
"Yes, some of us argue against harmonisation, but we also argue for cooperation between law enforcement authorities."
"Without that, in an international setting, we cannot detain some of the worst criminal elements that go around the world."
"I was proud to be the rapporteur for this House on joint investigation teams, as I know the Presidency-in-Office is aware, in 2001. They are a good example of targeted, effective, cooperative effort across the EU, without excessive bureaucracy, and we must be prepared to develop this level of cooperation, particularly now that we have the advantages of technology."
"President-in-Office, you mentioned the issue of data retention."
"Since the advent of DNA testing and mobile communications of a world nature, we have available to us tools for good and for bad."
"They can be used by criminals as well as to the advantage of a great number of people who want to pursue their business and private interests."
"We must make sure that where criminality is involved, we use the new technologies to the greatest advantage."
"One of my last jobs in the Home Office in the 1990s was to set up the Criminal Cases Review Commission."
"Prior to that, I and colleagues had the onerous task of determining whether a case should be referred back to the High Court because of an alleged miscarriage of justice."
"It was an onerous task, but one which I was prepared to undertake whilst I had the powers to do it."
"I did refer cases back where I believed people might be innocent, where new technology – DNA particularly – was coming in to give extra evidence."
"We should always remember that in the modern circumstances criminality does not stand still either."
"We may have the technology now, and we must use it because if we do not use it, with the proper safeguards, then the criminal element will be ahead of us in that game, as they have been ahead of us in violence, in their lack of respect for democracy and in actions which are completely abhorrent and unacceptable – or should be – to all of us in this House."
"Thank you for coming, President-in-Office."
"We will support you."
"I am particularly pleased to be able to participate in this debate under the key words of protecting order and security on the one hand, and providing guarantees aimed at protecting civil liberties and personal integrity on the other."
"No one disputes the fact that peace in Europe depends essentially on effective coordination of security resources and cooperation among the Member States."
"However, it does not depend only on this."
"Mr Pöttering, Chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats [PPE-DE Group], was right when he said that terrorism was of an intellectual nature."
"Yes, terrorism is of an intellectual nature."
"However, have we considered that the roots of terrorism are within us European citizens too?"
"Have we considered that every instance of exclusion engenders hatred?"
"Have we considered that the sense of being alien, the loss of national identity or the sense that one’s religious identity is under threat create a void that fundamentalist brainwashing can seep into and invade?"
"Have we considered that the roots of terrorism also lie lurking in insincere or empty political rhetoric?"
"And if we have considered these things, then let us speak out with a big exclamation mark! There is work to be done, so let us take stock of the tasks facing us."
"If terrorism is of an intellectual nature, then we must get to know each other’s culture, and this duty of learning applies in both directions."
"Those who are perhaps seeking to make a new home for themselves in Europe must get acquainted with Europe."
"The citizens of Europe must familiarise themselves with the world beyond Europe, with its culture, its religion, its troubles, its history and its aspirations."
"Irrespective of prejudices, we must coexist with the world beyond Europe, and children must learn what that world is like through stories, youngsters through school and adults through the Culture 2000 media programmes."
"I am glad that this debate has laid emphasis on cooperation with religious communities, and I welcome the words of Commissioner Frattini."
"Commissioner, You established the Conciliation Committee responsible for consulting with religious communities."
"I merely ask you to conduct this dialogue not only with European Christian communities, but also to involve representatives of Muslim communities and put their desire for and love of peace to use in an effort to mitigate the intellectual roots of terrorism. Fellow parliamentarians, security and freedom have been the key words in this debate."
"We Hungarians know, we have learned from experience, that being free is the same as not being afraid."
"I would like to thank the British Presidency for making a life without fear the focus of their Presidency."
"Mr President, Mr Clarke, Mr Frattini, you have just reminded us of the need to respond to the threat of terrorism whilst, of course, still protecting citizens’ rights, and, whatever our conceptions of Europe, I think that the time has come, in the next four months, to show that the executive and the legislature will move forward together, and will not go down any other route."
"I would like to apply this perspective to the very idea of the citizen and to the ambitious legislative programme that you have presented."
"Indeed, allow me a slight digression."
"A French philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, said something painfully applicable to today."
"In the modern constitutional state, he said, a citizen is any person who, whilst being subject to the law, can at the same time consider himself to be the author of that law; subject to, but also author of the law, be it only through his elected representatives."
"Is this true for European citizens in these painful and historic times, and indeed we cannot forget the courage of your people, of your fellow citizens, Mr Clarke, nor of course the direction taken by your government’s response?"
"Do the citizens consider themselves to be both subject to and the authors of this law?"
"Is it true for us, as Members of Parliament, when we are presented with texts on which we have to vote within imposed deadlines, of course, and when we adopt amendments that will not even feature in the ministers’ files during their deliberations?"
"This really has to stop."
"I have my doubts and I cannot help but regret the lack of an adequate response from the Council to the recommendations put to it at its meeting in The Hague and during the assessment of the Tampere Programme."
"You will therefore not be surprised, however willing you are to do everything necessary to progress, to see Parliament insisting so forcefully that its deliberations must be taken seriously and its prerogatives respected, particularly when the Treaty itself recognises the need for codecision."
"With regard to the protection of data and of citizens’ safety, which are of concern to all of us, it is a matter of implementing the provisions both of the Treaty establishing the European Community and of the Treaty on European Union."
"Therefore, in conclusion, can we expect the Presidency to take true account of the European Parliament’s position and make a commitment, as soon as it wants and in a very short timeframe, to serious negotiations?"
"Finally, I would like to say to the High Commissioner that the Commission has stated that it is prepared to respond to Parliament’s expectations, and it is in the process of preparing appropriate proposals that arouse our interest and justify our expectations."
"Mr President, we are seeing a growing and very worrying number of situations worldwide in which states are using the argument of the fight against terrorism as the basis for a policy of repression of other non-terrorist groups, or to violate the most fundamental rights of people assumed to be terrorists."
"There are plenty of examples, in Pakistan, China, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Yemen, Kenya and many other countries besides, and often the defenders of human rights, as the United Nations’ Special Representative, Mrs Jilani, pointed out, are among the first victims of the fight against terrorism."
"In Tunisia, for example, the government adopted an anti-terrorism law in 2003, a law that claims to support international efforts in the fight against terrorism, but that in fact attacks the basic rights of citizens, peaceful activities of civil society, trade unions and political parties."
"With regard to the United States, we are aware of the violations committed in Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, where hundreds of non-American nationals are detained indefinitely, without being subject to legal proceedings and with no likelihood of a trial."
"Nor can we ignore the very serious accusations made, particularly against the United States, by international NGOs such as Amnesty International, according to which a number of individuals arrested as part of the war on terrorism are being detained in unknown locations."
"These accusations are backed up by official reports discussing the situation of ghost prisoners, held secretly in prisons and transferred from one place to another to hide them from the attention of the International Committee of the Red Cross."
"No less serious are the accusations made by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch against countries within the European Union the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Sweden  who do not hesitate to return alleged terrorists to countries such as Syria, Egypt or Uzbekistan, where the risk that they will be tortured or mistreated is very high."
"Such practices are contrary to international rules on respect for human rights, particularly the non-refoulement principle."
"The Member States of the EU, as we have seen, are not to be outdone."
"We cannot fail to be concerned, too, by a draft Commission recommendation to the Member States relating, Mr Frattini, to not-for-profit organisations, which states in its introduction that there is evidence that not-for-profit organisations have been used to fund terrorism and other criminal activities."
"A generalisation of that kind, such a lack of nuance in a Commission document, is particularly unforgivable and concerning."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we agree on the fact that terrorism is the enemy of humankind, and we are concerned that after the London attacks the matter is back on this Parliament’s agenda, partly because in June it had been discussed in a number of reports and also in connection with the subject of data protection."
"The fight against terrorism must not be associated with the fight against illegal immigration or with asylum policies, as it has been by Mr Clarke today."
"Drawing such a parallel is specious and, at a pedagogical level, dangerous: does anybody seriously think that terrorists arrive in Europe on board makeshift boats?"
"In my opinion, victims should not be turned into killers: migrants are the weak link in a system that sustains terrorism, but they are certainly not the cause of terrorism."
"Moreover, if the extent of tragedies can also be measured by the number of deaths, then terrorism should not even be considered a priority for the European Union: the real tragedy in Europe is the number of migrants who drown in the Mediterranean Sea because of our laws and practices that turn them away."
"The number of those who go to their graves in the Mediterranean is a thousand times greater than the number of deaths caused by terrorist attacks!"
"A serious omission hangs over this debate: Mr Clarke and Mr Frattini represent the two European countries that have most contributed to the war and the military occupation of Iraq."
"Their analysis is wrong if they do not see the relationship between the war and terrorism."
"Their analysis is wrong if they do not see that the war and terrorism fuel each other, just as Islamophobia and Islamic fundamentalism fuel each other."
"The phenomenon can be seen not only in Iraq."
"According to a study recently published by a UN agency, over the last three years, that is since the military occupation started, opium production in Afghanistan has grown exponentially: the drug is the main source of funding for the terrorist organisations."
"Terrorism will not be beaten by war or even by this obsession with security, so proposing an Orwellian system of surveillance of Europe’s citizens is unacceptable."
"Data protection is a means of making security prevail over freedom and justice."
"Stefano Rodotà, a respected lawyer, has stated that data protection is like torture for the third millennium: the aim of both is to extract information."
"I fully agree with that view and that statement."
"Furthermore, it has not yet been shown that data protection helps to defeat terrorism, nor do I believe that the two examples that the UK Presidency put forward in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are sufficient."
"Finally, I believe that certain initiatives require the consent of Europe’s citizens and that it will not be easy to build a consensus on this issue."
"I do not think that the European Union should try to get out of its crisis by using this distortion of security."
"The European Union will only succeed in becoming a strong and institutionally credible political force if there is popular consent for its model of society, and I believe that that is the lesson to be learnt from the French and Dutch referenda."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that terrorism cannot be fought by means of war, but it cannot be fought either by philosophising about rights and safeguards, as several speakers in this debate have done: we all know that the enemy is among us."
"It is rather pointless and also specious, then, for a certain respected speaker to come and tell us that he has visited the so-called moderate Islamic states and found good people who do not want war or terrorism."
"Well, I suggest he pays them a quick visit, for instance, at a different level, on a different issue, one associated with culture, the considerable cultural difference that exists between them and us."
"He could go to Tunis, for instance, where a poor Italian mother had to take refuge in the Italian Embassy to protect herself and her young child’s right to return to Italy, as she was being pursued by the courts of that country, because in Islamic countries, even moderate ones, when a ruling has to be made in a dispute between a Muslim and a non-Muslim, the decision is a foregone conclusion."
"It is just that the woman in this case has turned to President Borrell Fontelles to uphold her right, and this Parliament is certainly sensitive enough to ensure that that regime will hear what it has to say."
"I was saying, then, that the danger is in our midst, and so I welcome those preventative measures that Mr Frattini has mentioned so opportunely."
"This is what we must do: take preventative action, certainly; strike right where the danger lies, not among the bargeloads of wretched people reaching Lampedusa – they are certainly not the danger – but among those who recruit and organise them in not all but a great many mosques, not all but many prayer centres."
"It is encouraging to see that the Italian Government is doing very well in that respect, by targeting those who disseminate hatred and tension, those who create and propagate that culture broth."
"Here we continue to philosophise about data collection and so on – which means we are always a long way behind the Islamic networks, which are multiplying – and we investigate very little."
"Mr Clarke did not even mention the problem of terrorist funding. Fortunately there are those who have researched the subject more thoroughly, as we have heard."
"It is a very important issue: just this morning the newspapers are saying that terrorist organisations in France – and all credit to French intelligence for having reported it – have even taken over a vast industry: sportswear and sportswear sales to young people."
"Therein lies the danger of communitisation, which is the subject of so much demagogy."
"The danger is in our midst; it is in our houses and in our cities in Europe."
"That is where we must act with firm, targeted measures, without giving in to the indulgent attitudes of which we have heard too much in this Chamber."
"Mr President, terrorism is the enemy at Europe’s gates, and has unfortunately become part of life in Europe today."
"We must not remain defenceless in the face of these criminal activities."
"It is for this reason that both individual countries and international organisations must use all the means at their disposal, even if these result in a temporary and partial curtailment of civil liberties."
"This is a point I would particularly like to stress, and we should be open about the fact that these liberties should be deliberately sacrificed for the sake of the security of the European nations."
"It goes without saying that this process must be subject to checks and monitoring, and that pressure groups, parties and governments must not exploit the fight against terrorism, which after all has widespread public support."
"I should like to say to Mr Clarke that the UK Government deserves praise for its introduction of a simplified procedure for deporting individuals involved in terrorist activities in the UK."
"One of the key proposals I would make to the UK Government and to other governments of EU Member States is that readmission clauses should be incorporated into agreements with Russia, Ukraine and the North African countries, in particular Morocco."
"We should state quite firmly that Europe must show solidarity in the fight against terrorism, and that this will hopefully be the case both now and in the future."
"I welcome the fact that the debate immediately following this one will focus on the situation in the Middle East."
"Terrorism is also a problem in this region, where it is directed against the state of Israel."
"Israeli citizens therefore deserve our praise, and we should learn all we can from their methods of fighting terrorism."
"The Tel Aviv government should also be praised for its consistency in following the roadmap, for its vision of the future and for its efficiency in implementing its policies and getting them through the Israeli parliament."
"At the same time, however, our sympathy should be with the thousands of Israelis who have lost their homes in the Gaza Strip, where they had lived for decades."
"We should also acknowledge the efforts of the Palestinian Authority to achieve security in the region, even though these efforts have not always been successful."
"The reason why I refer to this issue is that the fight against terrorism in Europe is not an isolated struggle, and that we are not cut off from the rest of the world in the war against terror."
"Mr President, the definition and specification of the rightful political role of the European Union and its institutions in the fight against terrorism is, I believe, an extremely urgent objective for this Presidency of the European Union."
"What I am saying is not inspired by Europeanism, rather, it is a fundamental need for each of the nations suffering from terrorism."
"It is needed in order to imbue the Union with real meaning, it is something we all need, all us Europeans, and it is needed because, if the European Union is not able to play a role in the fight against terrorism, the question ‘what is the European Union for?’ will inevitably arise."
"If, in the face of fear, there is no union, and that is perceived as the European Union's stance, then what is the European Union for?"
"That, of course, would not just be a disaster for the European Union, but would also be a wasted opportunity for the Member States, as they would be unable to use the value added offered by the Union to combat this phenomenon of terrorism."
"The European Union must be an essential political element in the fight against terrorism, especially for the Home Affairs Ministers."
"I know these Ministers face many urgent issues, they require many instruments and tools, but I believe one of the main urgent issues for the upcoming European Council is that you, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, need to be able to promote a European political project and that you need to find the European Union useful and effective in the fight against terrorism, because it is you who are going to need the Union most over the coming years."
"I am talking about a European Union political project rather than about an exhaustive list of measures which, at the end of the day, we are not able to communicate."
"It is clear that the European Union must promote measures on biometric data, which was mentioned by Mr Clarke or, undoubtedly, the retention of data or whatever the Home Affairs Ministers require, but we must place the emphasis on the political dimension, on a European political project."
"We spend a lot of time in this Parliament talking about technical and legal measures, but very little time on the political effort the European Union requires in order to combat terrorism."
"We cannot carry on putting the cart before the horse; we must provide the European Union’s action with the essential political dimension."
"So where can we find the European political project?"
"What I mean is that, in the face of Islamist terrorism, the terrorism of those who claim to defend Islam, the terrorism of Al Qaeda, the important thing is for us to understand that this is an emerging phenomenon, about which we know almost nothing."
"We do not know its rhythm, its timing, or how it chooses which nations to attack."
"We simply do not understand it."
"We need a European political project based on information and on intelligence in order to understand the phenomenon and evaluate the organisation we are dealing with."
"We must be able not just to take measures, but also to ensure that European citizens know and understand what we are doing."
"We do not devote either time or political effort to explaining what we are about and European citizens are not aware of what the European Union does."
"They only see national police forces."
"As far as they are concerned, the European Union plays no part in the fight against terrorism, they do not recognise us, they cannot visualise what we are doing."
"That is why it is so important to make an effort to create information fora for national police forces, led by the European institutions. We need a European information centre, in which the security forces can access databases such as EURODAC, SIS or VIS."
"In short, ladies and gentlemen, a political dimension is required."
"It is not possible to fight against terrorism."
"To say we are fighting international terrorism means nothing."
"What we are fighting against is a particular organisation and I am therefore concerned that the leaders of the European institutions dare not call the organisation we are fighting by its name."
"I do not care whether we talk about Al Qaeda, about Islamist terrorism, about radical or fundamentalist groups, or about groups which claim to defend Islam, but terrorism’s main advantage is its diffuse nature. Clearly, therefore, the European Union must deal head on with a problem of this nature by adopting all the instruments of the rule of law and on the basis of our unequivocal respect for the defence of human rights."
"Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, it is obviously necessary to rethink our fight against terrorism."
"We must eradicate terrorism at the root, punish the perpetrators severely and hunt down the ringleaders without mercy: we are in agreement on that."
"However, it is vital that we stop the ‘sticking-plaster’ approach and that we consider dealing with the root of the problem and new measures for combating terrorism."
"It is worth repeating that these measures for combating terrorism must be in line with our legal rules, our rule of law and our democracies."
"For example, we have raised the issue of the kidnapping of citizens and residents of Europe from the very territory of the European Union by the CIA."
"Certain Member States have instituted legal proceedings to find out why their citizens have been kidnapped and taken to third countries where they have been tortured."
"The Commission recognises that this constitutes a violation of fundamental rights, but refuses to deal with the issue."
"It is the duty of the European Union, however, to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens."
"How can we respond to their legitimate concerns?"
"Rethinking our fight against terrorism means dealing with its roots in poverty, exclusion, discrimination, in a word, all injustice."
"We must find the means to combat exclusion, in our societies but also in less developed countries, and we must fight against injustice all over the world."
"All advanced civilisations have understood that it is justice and equality that are most effective in countering violence."
"On the other hand, we need to train, to educate, to develop critical faculties, to fight against blindness when there are human beings prepared to self-destruct, to kill themselves even when, for example, they have just created life as was the case for one of the London terrorists; we understand that we absolutely must act from the top."
"Only early and effective integration into our societies can put an end to this brainwashing."
"We absolutely must understand that integration must not remain purely superficial and that integration is not assimilation."
"Every citizen of our countries must truly feel like a citizen, recognised and respected as a person."
"As I said, where there is a feeling of injustice, there will be violence, there will be hate; and when we add to this climate the manipulation and indoctrination of the weak-minded, that is when we are faced with terrorists."
"The range of measures is vast, but it is only by pushing all the levers that we will prevail."
"In conclusion, I would like to return to your proposals, Mr Clarke."
"We support you when you say that we need deeper cooperation."
"We will certainly gain more by sharing our experiences, our information and our resources."
"We will only succeed at European level, but the European Parliament wants to be fully involved: if we work together, then we will make progress."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I will say at the outset that I am in favour of the measures proposed by the UK Presidency to fight the terrorist threat and terrorist actions."
"We must not choose the wrong target."
"It is not the anti-terrorism measures you are proposing that form a threat, but terrorism itself."
"Acting without excessive security, but also without weakness, is the best way of avoiding the traps set for us by the terrorists and of responding clearly to the expectations of the citizens."
"The retention of data regarding telephone and Internet communications has already demonstrated its worth and must be encouraged, provided that it has a legal basis, that the cost problem is taken properly into account and that the period of retention and the conditions of use this is essential  are specified."
"We are waiting for clear answers and new proposals that respond to the objections expressed by Parliament."
"Urgent decisions, very urgent ones, involving Parliament and the Commission, must be taken without delay."
"In addition, we must be able to use all the available technical measures such as, for example, surveillance cameras and biometric elements in identity cards."
"Finally, I would stress the fact that the exchange of information between states, international cooperation, as you said, is an essential element."
"There is no need, in this regard, to put forward new proposals."
"Parliament was almost unanimous in adopting three reports that I had the honour of presenting, which aimed to promote these exchanges."
"I would therefore encourage the UK Presidency to reach a clear conclusion, with our support."
"I also call on it to demonstrate the political will to improve cooperation regarding intelligence, which is the main form of preventative action."
"Ethically and politically speaking, we must also get sincere Muslims to condemn preachers of violence clearly, publicly and unreservedly and the responsible authorities to prosecute these preachers and deport them without any weakness."
"There are some behaviours, some statements, some principles that are incompatible with our concepts of freedom, human rights and public peace."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can no longer, without reacting, regularly hold three-minute silences in memory of victims of terrorism and hope that that will be enough to prevent the terrorists from acting from the shelter of the alibis they call on."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was only natural that we should begin today’s debate by invoking the need for balance – a balance between security and the right to freedom, but pain, rage and a sense of powerlessness too, cause us all too quickly to lose a sense of balance in what we say."
"I was very pleased to hear Mr Schulz’s criticisms of the Council Presidency and its preparedness for real European cooperation, but then he, too, was so carried away by zeal as to make the sweeping statement that we must not be squeamish and must respond to terrorists in the language they understand."
"In what language, though, does terrorism speak?"
"It speaks the language of hatred, contempt for human dignity and freedom, and violence, directed without either discrimination or scruple, numbering even the innocent among its victims."
"Such is the language of terrorism, and we will not respond to it in kind, but with language of our own."
"The only way we can defend our values is to live by them; by adhering precisely to the law, by using force only with the greatest of reservations, by providing the utmost protection for the innocent."
"That is our language, and, if we lose our balance under public pressure when we speak, we lose it even more when we act."
"You, too, Mr President-in-Office and Home Secretary, spoke about balance, but you had nothing to say about the absence of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which closer cooperation in Europe depends, or about guaranteeing the right to freedom."
"You utterly disregarded the Constitution and the fact that its rejection in France and the Netherlands was demonstrably not a rejection of the European constitution-making process, but an expression of disappointment at unfulfilled expectations."
"Intergovernmentalism, too, along with the failure of European integration to make progress, had a considerable hand in it."
"It is not the rules of war that we should be discussing but the determination to defend rights, freedom and democracy."
"You said nothing about the way in which parliaments are being circumvented."
"You had nothing to say about the precarious nature of democracy, about prevention and cooperation between secret services and police forces, any more than you had anything to say about this House’s criticisms of shoddy reports that fail to clarify whether the means used are proportionate, appropriate or necessary."
"I do not believe that it is enough, if you want to get your hands on new policing resources, to throw around words like ‘terrorism’, ‘people-trafficking’, or ‘international crime’."
"This Europe of ours will defend itself primarily by simply being Europe – a free democracy founded not upon hate, but upon law."
"Mr President, terrorism is nothing new."
"It is an ancient phenomenon that is used to disrupt a society and foment unrest and instability."
"Unfortunately, various Member States are already familiar with acts of terror that date back before Islamic terrorism, to, for example, the 1970s and 1980s, when the fight against terror went hand in hand with opinions on data protection that were held at the time."
"Today, we require new ways and techniques of tackling terrorism, with due respect shown for the freedom of individuals and guarantees of security for our society."
"I therefore wonder if, in the light of how terrorism used to be traced and fought, we might not have got our ideas about privacy out of proportion."
"I gather that many Members are reluctant to endorse far-reaching measures, but the restrictions and objections presented here in Parliament do not make it easy to work with data, and so I would ask Commissioner Frattini whether concrete measures can be identified that could boost confidence in the Commission and Council proposals."
"I am thinking of data storage in closed computer systems that do not communicate via the Internet."
"I would urge you to make clear and concrete pledges that will remove Parliament’s concerns."
"Mr President, Mr Clarke, Vice-President Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, many of our Member States had, and are still having, problems with terrorist attacks."
"In Germany, we had the Red Army Fraction, Ireland has the IRA, and Spain ETA, all of which tried to pursue their objectives by means of violence."
"The attacks they carried out were cruel and lacking any justification, but the acts of terrorism we have seen so far were carried out for reasons of history or ideology and limited to one country or one region."
"The ‘9/11’ events in the United States gave terrorism a wholly new dimension, and it acquired an unequivocally European one with the attacks in Madrid on 11 March and in London on 7 July."
"The conflict is no longer a merely national one; the Western world faces a massive threat."
"What the atrocities in London showed was that the perpetrators do not pass through porous borders in order to carry out terrorist acts in Europe."
"They are people living among us, who have taken our nationalities, attended our schools, people who go out to work and appear to be part of our society."
"These were not people who were denied opportunities by being on the fringes of our society."
"To all outward appearance, they were inconspicuous members of it, but they evidently did not feel any attachment to our lifestyles and values."
"Far from it; these terrorists set out to kill indiscriminately as a means of turning Europe, our values and our lives upside down."
"Some of them had been living in our midst, as our neighbours, for years or even decades."
"That does not mean, though, that they were living with us."
"The attacks on London in particular showed that the idea of the ‘melting-pot society’ has failed."
"Tolerance, when misconceived as ‘do as you like’, does not result in a colourful and fruitful, tolerant and open, mix of cultures, lifestyles and opinions."
"What this misconceived tolerance does produce is parallel societies, groups to which we have no access, about whose activities we have scarcely any idea, and which function within our society with the aim of destroying it."
"That is why there must be a response to this threat by the Member States and the European Union as a whole, using not only legislation but also the machinery of law enforcement."
"Together and in cooperation with each other, we must protect our citizens."
"There is a need for rigorous measures at European level, which need to be transposed at national level without delay, thoroughly and purposefully."
"One of the measures we have already adopted is the European Arrest Warrant, the purpose of which is to extradite criminals from one Member State to another quickly and with relatively little red tape."
"That can help to put terrorists and those behind them out of action more quickly."
"In Germany, though, this essentially good European measure has proved a failure."
"The courts were obliged to set at liberty a German of Syrian origin who was suspected of involvement in the terrorist attack in Madrid."
"You may well ask why."
"It was not for lack of any anti-terrorist legislation in Germany."
"The current red and green Federal Government made such a botched job of implementing the European Arrest Warrant that German law had to give way to the German supreme court, with the result that a terrorist suspect had to be released from custody and the Spanish authorities can no longer prosecute him."
"What this shows is that mistakes made in one Member State can affect the security of people in all the others."
"If what happened in Madrid or London is not to be repeated elsewhere, integration into our society has to be taken seriously."
"The right of permanent residence should be made conditional on a desire to really immigrate and the willingness to adopt a new manner of life, new forms and standards in a new homeland."
"We have to make it clear that European society offers human rights, democracy, freedom, the equality of men and women, concern for our neighbours, social justice and much more, while, on the other hand, requiring people to adopt our democratic values, our conception of freedom and of its defence."
"While action in the spheres of policy-making, the law and the criminal justice system are necessary, a European consciousness and sense of European identity must come into being to unite us, not merely economically as an economic and currency union, but as a community of values."
"We must have something to set against ideologies that tend towards extremism and radicalism and find their ultimate expression in terrorist acts and suicide bombings, and that something is a society whose citizens live together and stand by each other because they live in a society that they share, that is worth living in and worth working for, and in the construction of which they had – and have – a part."
"– Mr President, Minister, I know from our numerous discussions that you are highly sensitive to the question of protection for citizens' fundamental rights and personal data."
"However, it would have been a good thing if, instead of three, you had proposed five basic guidelines: not only international cooperation, not only the need for effective police cooperation, not only the need to use modern technology, but also laws and institutions for the protection of personal freedoms at the same time, together with political and social programmes to combat the phenomenon of terrorism."
"Personal freedoms and the fight against terrorism are not mutually exclusive."
"If citizens feel, even for no real reason, that they are being monitored excessively, then they censor themselves and that is a threat to democracy and a victory for the terrorists."
"All this is important when it comes to examining proposals to keep records of European citizens' electronic communications."
"Today you demonstrated to us that access to these data is extremely useful in all instances."
"You also demonstrated to us that, in certain cases, it was necessary."
"However, the Presidency has not yet tabled a study referring to all cases where access to these data, even if useful, was not necessary."
"I would be obliged if you could do so."
"The test, I would remind you, is not that the measures should be useful or even that they should be important."
"The test is that the measures should be necessary."
"They must also be proportionate."
"We must assure citizens that records of their telecommunications which are kept for long periods of time will be absolutely safe, not only against abuse by the state, but also – and I would emphasise this – by private individuals."
"Not everyone who works in a telecommunications company is an angel."
"Consequently, there can be no legislative initiative on the matter without provision for and independent judicial, government and parliamentary monitoring in practice, in order to ensure that neither private nor government service providers can trawl through these huge databases for illegal purposes and that they are effectively protected against hackers."
"Minister, today there is as yet no framework for data protection under the third pillar, under which the Council is promoting its initiative."
"Withdraw it and let us all work together on the forthcoming initiative by the Commission and Mr Frattini."
"You are right to refer to the negative results of the rejection of the Constitution by certain Member States."
"However, the rejection was the result of the feeling of many citizens that their voice is not heard in Europe and denying Parliament a codecision role in decisions of such import obviously does not help."
"To close, Minister, it says in the paper you circulated to us, and I quote:"
"'In the future, some criminals and terrorists will adapt their use of technology to make the retention of this data a less important tool for investigations.'"
"In other words,you foresee that in future these measures will not be necessary at all."
"Have you made provision or will you make provision, when this happens, for the use of data retention to stop or not?"
"Mr President, Mr Frattini and Mr Clarke, Europe must provide its citizens with security, but real security, not just a false sense of security."
"We do not need grand statements."
"We urgently need action: closer cooperation and exchange of information; full and rapid implementation of agreed measures; not just more data collection, but also much better use of the available data."
"Europol and Eurojust must finally be allowed to play a full role in combating crime and terrorism."
"I welcome the coherent vision set out by Mr Frattini, with a proper balance between security and liberty, stressing the need for European cooperation for more effectiveness."
"Frankly, I find it much more convincing than the one-sided wish list for tougher measures by the Presidency."
"The Member States argue that they take these measures to protect our democracy, but they do so by circumventing parliamentary scrutiny because it is terribly inconvenient."
"I also firmly reject any suggestion that the Convention on Human Rights should be watered down."
"I believe that we are on a slippery slope here."
"To speak of striking the right balance has become a commonplace."
"No-one will say that the want to strike the wrong balance, but tellingly the Presidency's paper does not even have a chapter on civil liberties."
"Let us not forget that people are nowhere safer than in our open, free and democratic society."
"I should like to raise three specific issues."
"With regard to passenger data, Mr Clarke insisted on legal safeguards against abuse, but we all know that the PNR agreement with the US lacks precisely that."
"EU citizens have no proper means of redress in the event of mistakes and abuse."
"No-fly lists are another concern."
"On what basis are people included on such a list?"
"Who has access to these lists?"
"If someone is on a list for the wrong reasons, how can he be taken off the list?"
"The usefulness of data retention for investigations and prosecution is undisputed, but the need for blanket surveillance has still not been convincingly demonstrated."
"Furthermore, much more needs to be done in the area of human intelligence, that is, the old-fashioned spies, rather than focusing exclusively on modern technology, even if that is sexier."
"Mr President, a completely safe society is no police state."
"A police state is a suspicious and insecure society in which no one wants to live."
"Constantly increased police powers will never prevent all terrorism and organised crime but only undermine democracy."
"The best weapon is reduced recruitment to crime syndicates and terrorist groups, brought about through tolerance, social cohesion and lower levels of poverty and through permitting legal immigration."
"When people do not feel oppressed or excluded, they are not such easy recruits."
"Biometric passes are not as effective as you maintain, Mr Clarke."
"Have you read the report by the American Court of Auditors?"
"Not all suspects are identified."
"Innocent unskilled labourers with unclear fingerprints are in danger of being stopped."
"The costs are ."
"For the EU alone, biometric passes would cost approximately EUR 10 billion."
"They are not worth the money."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I agree with Mr Clarke’s remarks about the need to make the fight against terror one of the EU’s priorities. Terrorism is one of the most serious threats to democracy, human rights and economic and social development."
"The terrorist threat affects us all."
"Any act of terrorism against a Member State should be viewed as an attack on the EU as a whole and on the shared values that form the basis of our civilisation."
"The Union should therefore, in an expression of solidarity, take all possible measures effectively to protect the rights and freedoms of its citizens; let me stress, the rights and freedoms of its citizens."
"Firm and effective responses are required, given the degree to which terrorist networks are organised and their capacity to operate across borders, and for that to happen there must be a high level of cooperation and coordination at both national and international level."
"Issues of security have acquired fresh urgency in the light of the most recent terrorist attacks."
"Measures must be put in place and then effectively implemented by the Member States, such as stepping up stronger international cooperation by means of checks at external borders, including the establishment of the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS); making travel documents safer and bringing in biometric data; blocking the financing of terrorism; stepping up exchanges of information and making the best use of information systems so as to enable Europol to be used more effectively; and setting up common measures, in areas such as prevention, preparedness and consequence management."
"We must also fight for swift and fair ways of providing assistance to the victims of terrorism, who are the innocent hostages of inhuman violence."
"Accordingly, we hope that the Commission will, at the earliest opportunity, present us with proposals on prevention, protection and the fight against terror."
"I welcome Mr Fratini’s statement on the forthcoming presentation of initiatives on critical infrastructure and the protection of personal data."
"I should like to finish by stressing that the fight for greater security can only be pursued within the framework of the rule of law and provided that essential freedoms and the citizens’ rights are protected."
"The recent case in London of a young Brazilian killed by the police serves to remind us that if our societies descend into barbarism, the terrorists will have achieved their objective – to destroy our societies and our framework of values."
"Mr President, today’s debate on the measures we must take together to fight terrorism and terrorists is one that I regard as crucial."
"I appreciate Mr Clarke’s pragmatic approach and sense of purpose when he says that we should manage to achieve a few things in the six months of his presidency of the Council with responsibility for these things."
"At the same time, I also very much appreciate the Commissioner’s remarks about the social context in which we should deal with the problem of Islam-inspired terrorism."
"I should like to add my own comments about the partly political dimension to the fight against terrorism, because there is, in my view, an important connection between domestic and foreign policy where terrorism is concerned."
"The threat of terrorism we are facing is a perfect example of external and internal policy being interlaced, not only in the physical sense when individuals and groups from outside the EU enter it with terrorist intentions, but even more so because we are dealing with networks and ideas that know no borders."
"These ideas often explicitly deal with the relationship of Europe, or the west, with the rest of the world."
"Moreover, terrorists wrongly justify themselves by reference to their religion, which is also the religion of many of our fellow citizens, and this causes tensions that, in turn, force us to face a very difficult and precarious task."
"We cannot deal with those threats only by taking internal security measures."
"We will therefore also need to accommodate them in our foreign policy, and that involves more than mere cooperation with police and security services in third countries."
"We must also examine our relationship with, and our policy in respect of, the countries in the Islamic world."
"It is time for a realism that is different from that which has determined our policy so far."
"In many countries, corruption and misgovernment are far more likely to bring forth radicalisation than policy itself, and we must make democratisation and the modernisation of government into our policy’s key priorities."
"While we share this objective with many Americans, we must also avoid the radical approach that many Americans, particularly neo-Conservatives, embrace with regard to the democratisation of the Middle East."
"It would be useful for Europe to examine the example of the OSCE, whether this organisation that we have developed in Europe could also function in the Middle East."
"Apart from that, it is vital to be consistent in our actions, both in terms of the various Member States’ policies and between what we say and what we do."
"If we could help resolve the problems in that region in that way, this would also benefit the relationship between the different communities in our own community."
"Our foreign policy should provide us and the moderate Muslim majority with arguments in the debate with radical elements."
"We must translate the dialogue with the countries of the Islamic world directly into our dialogue with the Muslim communities within our own society."
"Only in that way can we isolate within its own faith community the small minority that thinks it can achieve something by the use of extreme violence."
"Our foreign policy is an essential piece in the internal security puzzle."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe can and must react firmly and adopt whatever measures are needed to respond effectively to terrorist crime, which is a new cancer in our society."
"We therefore agree with the measures contained in the revised action plan on terrorism."
"We must certainly maintain all the efforts and all the measures designed to implement and strengthen Eurojust and Europol, the European arrest warrant, cooperation and information exchange, the monitoring and tracing of bank transfers, the increased use of CCTV cameras and interception of telephone and telematic communications, and the freezing of assets belonging to suspected terrorists."
"Of course, we realise that in doing so we run the risk of restricting the exercise of certain fundamental rights, such as privacy, but it is equally right and proper – and at this moment a top priority – to protect the rights of society as a whole, rights that are just as fundamental and under even greater threat."
"We find ourselves in a genuine emergency situation, whether we like it or not, and therefore we must find the strength and courage to support measures which, in order to protect a higher collective good like people’s security, may exceptionally and temporarily, and at all times subject to authorisation from the competent judicial authorities, also restrict individual rights."
"Zero tolerance on terrorism does not mean failing to observe the fundamental principles inherent in our legal systems, but it does mean always operating fully within the law."
"We therefore strongly condemn the kidnappings organised by the CIA on the sovereign territory of Member States, as in the case of an Egyptian citizen in Milan on 16 February 2003."
"We also regret the so-called licence to kill that is all too often issued to police officers on the basis of suspicions without being clearly justified on the grounds of self-defence, as unfortunately happened recently in a European country."
"In conclusion, I say yes to the law on terrorism and yes to the resolute, determined fight against terrorism, provided that it is conducted within the law and in the name of the law."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we know that today’s terrorists operate on an international scale, their violence crossing borders and destroying on a scale previously known only in time of war."
"We also know that this is why we have, in theory, a new definition of security that combines elements of internal and external security, but we have to be clear about the fact that we have manifestly not yet succeeded in bringing together internal and external security in any practical and effective way."
"It is also clear that there are some circumstances under which international responses are a better way of addressing this cross-border phenomenon, for example when the culprits are trained in country A, planted in country B, commanded by people in country C and the act is carried out in country D. That is why cross-border cooperation is needed; the President-in-Office of the Council himself quoted a number of examples involving neighbouring states where closer cooperation was needed, and I think that this closer cooperation should involve those involved with both internal and external policy."
"It is more important to concentrate on this than to keep on tightening the screws at home and restricting the freedom of individual citizens."
"Mr Wiersma quite rightly said that cooperation and exchange of data between secret services is much more important than the harassment of individual citizens of our Member States; it is also more effective."
"It is also noteworthy that, whenever terrorist acts are committed, the Member States come together in Council to make fine statements, but nothing actually gets done."
"This is true of almost all the Member States."
"This ‘naming and shaming’ list is impressive, and it is right to include my own country, which, as Mrs Klamt mentioned, has not implemented the Arrest Warrant;"
"I might add that it has also, for example, failed to transpose into law the convention on judicial cooperation in criminal matters of 29 May 2000, the protocol to the convention on judicial cooperation in criminal matters of 16 October 2001, the protocol of 27 November 2003 amending the Europol Convention, or to execute orders freezing assets or evidence dating back to 2003."
"All these lists will be ineffective, and so I urge the nation states to at last do the homework to which they have agreed and get a grip on dealing with this cross-border phenomenon rather than constantly making new speeches to absolve themselves of blame whenever a terrorist act is carried out, after which – yet again – nothing happens."
"In so doing, they are cheating the public, and we should make it clear that we will no longer put up with it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that I wish to express my solidarity with the British people and my admiration at their fortitude."
"I would like to make three comments with regard to the three approaches suggested by the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Firstly, I agree with the fundamental point he made at the beginning in defence of the values we share, namely democracy and respect for human rights, which have enabled us to create a peaceful and united Europe."
"It is on that basis that we have to respond to the apparent clash of civilisations, and each of us has problems with fundamentalists."
"I believe that, on the eve of the United Nations Assembly, it is important for us to jointly defend the alliance of civilisations. In this case, a proposal has been put forward jointly by the governments of Spain and Turkey, and I believe the British Government takes a positive view of it."
"Secondly, I understand that, according to what Mr Clarke and Commissioner Frattini have said, we are seeking to consolidate a legal framework in the fight against terrorism and also against international crime, aware that the Constitution is not yet in force. In this connection, I would say to Mr Clarke that although some people have said ‘no’ to the Constitution, many more have said ‘yes’."
"I believe that during this period of reflection we must continue working to ensure that this Constitution provides us with a legal framework, and I believe that Mr Clarke, a committed pro-European, can do much within the British Government to convince it of the virtues of this Constitution."
"I would urge him to make such an effort."
"Thirdly, with regard to intelligence and cooperation amongst information services, which accounts for at least 70% of the fight against terrorism, I am going to make a single reference to a point Mr Clarke has discussed at some length, namely the issue of telecommunications."
"When we talk about protecting privacy, we must bear in mind that there is a greater good that justifies an active policy."
"Mr Clarke referred to the case of London."
"I can tell him that in the case of the Madrid attacks, what allowed the police to ascertain the identity of the terrorists quickly was precisely the availability of mobile phone data. Furthermore, this prevented many more victims, since the terrorists were ready to carry on killing."
"I believe we must take this very much into account when it comes to protecting privacy and the common values of our society."
"Mr President, the consequence of adopting a shoot-to-kill policy in response to the terrorist attacks in London is that the UK is now directly responsible for the killing of an innocent man based solely upon his appearance."
"He is, of course, a victim, but there is another casualty and that is the state of human rights and civil liberties within the EU."
"Certain EU governments are targeting individuals through stop-and-search procedures based entirely upon racial profiling."
"However, if the security services openly state that they are targeting young, ethnic-minority men, the rest of society may also begin to view those who fit this profile with suspicion."
"Intercommunity relations will be devastated."
"Our response to the terrorist threat must be intelligence led and, therefore, requires the contribution of the very communities that these policies are pushing to the fringes of society."
"Only through a healthy, constructive dialogue can we root out and tackle anger and hatred."
"The protection of the human rights of EU citizens who just happen to fit a particular description should not be mutually exclusive from the tracking of the perpetrators and prevention of these terrorist attacks."
"Public security is of paramount concern, but the Presidency must acknowledge that undue restrictions on the liberty of our citizens simply fulfil the ultimate goal of these extremists."
"If we do not avoid extremist responses, we may feed the very beast we seek to destroy."
"Today, Europe has an opportunity to respond to extremist forces within our borders in an intelligent, strong, liberal manner, considering our citizens as equal, unless and until any one of them actually takes actions which threaten the security of our society."
"Then our response must be united, relentless and firm, but always proportionate and based upon the rule of law."
"Let us not allow our reactions to deliver that which the terrorists' actions can never achieve."
"I hear much talk of the targeting of mosques."
"I am a European Muslim."
"I received my religious teaching in that very same mosque system."
"It taught me to be a good, contributing citizen who is proud to be European and British."
"Please do not confine millions like me to a second-class citizenship simply because of our appearance and by ignoring our contribution."
"In conclusion, I repeat, President-in-Office, let us not allow our reactions to deliver to the terrorists that which their actions can never seek to achieve."
"Mr President, the balance between individual freedom and the security of society as a whole forms an essential element of our democratic fabric."
"This balance, however, should never be beyond reproach or discussion."
"I agree with Mr Clarke that, in this time of increased threat, this balance must be re-examined in a bid to protect our collective freedom."
"It is indeed crucial that in this context, a cross-border approach be adopted in preference to any other because, as Mr Brok said a moment ago, a lack of security and crime do not stop at the border."
"You made a comment on how the issues of asylum, human trafficking and drug smuggling should be tackled."
"These are the very cornerstones of the Constitutional Treaty and I am pleased to hear you attach importance to this."
"I hope that the British Presidency, at this time of – as you phrased it – a European wake-up call, will in any event commit fully to achieving those core elements of the Constitutional Treaty as yet."
"I would now like to turn to the balance between freedom and responsibility."
"As Mr Poettering, our group chairman, said, most Muslims in Europe are very attached to our European values."
"If, however, you want to tackle the small individuals who cannot appreciate those values, we should have the courage to define the boundaries more clearly."
"I would make two points in this respect."
"First of all, we will need to dare extradite radical Imams who come from abroad, from outside Europe, to brainwash people over here."
"Your government in England has tabled proposals to that effect at national level, as has my government in the Netherlands."
"Do you not think, given the fact that we have open internal borders, that this clear policy should be adopted across Europe?"
"Would the Commission, in tandem with the presidency, like to promote this?"
"Secondly, canvassing for the Jihad is a problem, for we practise freedom of opinion."
"We will need to clamp down on those who canvass people for the Jihad."
"Is it not time we penalised the entire canvassing activity as such in our Member States?"
"At present, doing so is a nigh impossible task."
"All too often, undesirable organisations also slip through the net."
"Some countries ban organisations, others do not."
"Do you not think that overtly undesirable organisations should be dealt with in the same way across Europe and that we should obstruct terrorist organisations that are on the European list in the same emphatic manner across the Union?"
"You only need to look at today’s events."
"Let me single out just one example, that of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a radical Muslim organisation that is opposed to democracy and in favour of radicalisation."
"This organisation, that is active in Europe, is strictly banned in Germany while neither the Netherlands nor Austria, where this organisation is also active, put the slightest obstacle in its way."
"Surely that cannot be the Europe of 2005?"
"Can we expect you to tackle organisations such as those at a more European level?"
"Can we also expect clearer policy to be adopted, and will you, with regard to terrorist organisations, such as Hezbollah, take a clear stand at long last?"
"My final point concerns the transfer of data."
"You as President-in-Office of the Council have the right to ask our Parliament to revisit data retention, but could we then call you to account about something that the terrorism coordinator, Mr De Vries, says time and again, namely that the ineffective cooperation between Member States means that he is unable to get secret services to exchange data?"
"Let us lay our cards on the table here."
"The problem, according to him, is that information held by the English secret service is not being exchanged at European level."
"Can the President-in-Office at this point condemn this and state that the British Presidency will ensure that, in future, information between secret services will be automatically exchanged as a matter of priority when the security of us all is at stake, as agreed after the attacks in Madrid and New York?"
"– Mr President, Mr Clarke, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament cannot fail to agree that we urgently need to respond to terrorism, and it also considers that this response must go hand in hand with strict protection for human rights."
"When we speak of human rights, we mean a strict, pragmatic view of human rights, not merely an abstract, virtual debate."
"If we agree to abandon that long-established level of protection for human rights and regard for these fundamental rights, we shall have given the terrorists their first resounding victory, that is to say that we shall have shown that our values – values on which we claim our Western civilisation is founded – are actually fragile, shaky and utterly partial."
"Mr Clarke, allow me to put to you some questions that have arisen in part from certain omissions that we noticed in your speech."
"Commissioner Frattini has appropriately spoken about prevention, and hence about seeking causes."
"This Parliament would like to know whether it can have an answer to a plain and simple question: was the war one of the causes that led to the spread of terrorism on this planet, or not?"
"‘Reaction’ is the word Mr Frattini used. Our question, however, is whether there is a limit to the use of forms of summary justice, as Mr Watson mentioned."
"That is not an abstract or philosophical question."
"A judicial inquiry is under way in several countries – we were talking about it just yesterday, Minister – in Sweden, Germany and Italy, regarding the responsibility of the US secret service and the compliance of European secret services in the kidnapping of a number of European and non-European citizens, who were taken to Egypt, Syria and other Middle Eastern countries to be interrogated and tortured, and in some cases killed."
"What is the Council’s position with regard to the inquiries that are under way?"
"We are aware of the Commission’s position, which is very clear: it will not tolerate any further human rights violations of such seriousness."
"Lastly, Minister, is the principle of proportionality still valid in the European institutions?"
"Many of my fellow Members have asked questions about data retention, and at the moment we have two radically different ideas, two different approaches."
"On the one hand the Commission talks to us of specific purposes under the control of an independent authority; on the other the Council intends to collect all data without any kind of selection."
"Where will the balance lie; what will the role of this Parliament be in establishing this balance; and more generally what will the political role of this Parliament be?"
"Will we only be called on to agree and ratify decisions, or will we also be able to fulfil our safeguarding role?"
"We would appreciate an answer to these questions, Minister."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the acts of terrorism in London last summer showed again how vulnerable our open democracies are."
"Again, innocent people are hit on the way to work."
"How do we protect ourselves when our own fellow citizens, including respected neighbours and popular family men, are suddenly turned into ruthless death machines?"
"More than ever, cooperation is needed to help prevent, investigate, expose and arrest those who plan terrorist acts or other cross-border crime."
"The culprits are well ahead of both police and politicians precisely when it comes to cross-border cooperation."
"We must become much better at cooperating successfully to the same degree."
"We talk a lot but, as fellow Members have already pointed out, very little has happened."
"Our counter-terrorism coordinator, Gijs de Vries has of course pointed out on quite a few occasions of there being too much talk and too little action."
"No one is inclined to put their money where their mouth is, as they say."
"In particular, the intelligence work about which Mr Clarke talked with such commitment is really central."
"Europol and Eurojust must be given many more resources and perhaps be developed into some kind of European FBI that can coordinate and lead preliminary and other investigations and perhaps even go in and make arrests."
"It should be possible to coordinate information and intelligence from the various Member States."
"The fight against criminality is always an important balancing act between the need for security and tough measures and the need for individual privacy."
"Developments in recent years have forced us all in some degree to lower our standards regarding privacy."
"For example, cameras in public places are accepted more and more."
"They also played an important role in the work done by the police in London to identify the terrorist bombers."
"Every measure must always be carefully weighed up."
"I have so far not been convinced by the arguments for developing extensive systems for storing data, telephone conversations, e-mails and text messages."
"Developing these would be a very major encroachment on privacy, with a high risk of the systems being abused in many ways."
"The fact is that most of us, after all, are not criminals."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks of 11 September, Madrid, London and Sharm El-Sheikh and those that have taken place in other cities in Asia and Africa demonstrate that terrorism has acquired not only a new face but also new strategies, organisation and weaponry to strike at our democracies."
"Therefore, confronted by the changing nature of the terrorist threat, we must update and adapt the countermeasures needed to defeat the enemies of freedom."
"In order to defend its citizens’ right to security, Europe must make every effort to equip itself with the operational means and the legislation to forestall and to counteract Al Qaeda and its allies."
"The Council, Commission, European Parliament and Member States must act fast to bring in joint measures, especially on sensitive issues that involve both security and the right to liberty."
"Harmonised measures are needed, for instance, on the expulsion of those who preach hatred and violence and are a threat to security."
"Italy – and I am delighted that the Netherlands agrees on this point – expelled an imam yesterday and is preparing to expel some more people in the next few days."
"Harmonised measures and a sharing of political and economic responsibility are also required in the area of border controls and illegal immigration, as are harmonisation and coordination in the work of the police and intelligence services."
"I therefore welcome the proposals put forward by the UK Presidency and by Mr Frattini."
"I refer to the collection and retention of telephone usage data: if such data had not been used, one of the authors of the London attacks would not have been arrested in Rome."
"Terrorism cannot, however, be fought or beaten just with a firm hand – with due respect for human rights, of course – that is, just through legislation and the work of the police and intelligence forces."
"In short, just one hand is not enough: the hand of politics is also needed."
"Strong action is required from Europe and from the Member States in order to involve moderate Islam in this fight: I am thinking of Islamic councils that can isolate the violent and the preachers of hatred and can ensure that the Muslims who live in Europe are not exploited by them."
"We must not confuse Islam with terrorism, but we must condemn those who, in the name of extremism, try to stop young European Muslims from going to state or officially recognised schools in favour of Koranic schools."
"That is a worrying trend – there is a blatant example in Milan – for it aims at preventing the integration of immigrants in Europe so as to create pockets of illegality."
"Just as individual countries cannot overcome the current threat on their own, Europe cannot do so on its own either."
"Broader cooperation is needed, certainly including the United States and also the moderate Arab countries, which also lie in Bin Laden’s sights."
"For all these reasons, the Forza Italia delegation in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will support the Union’s actions in the fight against terrorism, since they will simultaneously protect both the human rights and the security of everyone who lives in Europe."
"Mr President, I admit that I am not neutral in relation to the fight against terrorism."
"I fully support the approach and the priorities suggested to us today by Mr Clarke on behalf of the British Presidency."
"I would therefore like to take advantage of his presence today in this Chamber, and that of Commissioner Frattini, to insist on the need for us to act and to take the political initiative."
"Fighting terrorism means more than pursuing and arresting the criminals and comforting the victims."
"It means more than police cooperation and solidarity."
"It is not a matter of reducing the operative powers of the Home Affairs or Justice Ministries, it is a question of responding effectively and responsibly to the threat terrorism poses to democracy."
"Terrorism is an option: a despicable, cowardly and cruel option."
"Its actions are not predetermined by any ideology, any religion, any social or political situation, and nothing can justify them."
"An effective policy must be capable not just of detecting and bringing the people directly responsible for the crimes to justice, but of acting to deal with the roots of terrorism too, and with those who legitimise terrorists' actions. After all, it is not just those who place the bombs who are terrorists, but also those who, for example, instil hate into young people born and educated within a democracy, a hate that turns them into fanatics and leads them to murder their neighbours and terrorise millions of innocent citizens, as was dramatically demonstrated by the attacks in London or by the ETA attacks in Spain over 27 long years."
"Europe needs a clear voice which the citizens can identify as our political position in this field."
"European citizens, and also terrorists, must see that we are not resigned to living with terror. The citizens must be aware that we are prepared to take every necessary decision and to use all the instruments available under the rule of law to safeguard their security, to ensure their liberty and to defeat the terrorist strategy."
"In a democracy, security is an instrument at the service of liberty."
"We all know that there can be security without liberty, but there can be no liberty without security."
"Only a plural, democratic and secure society can guarantee the full exercise of freedoms."
"Both rights are inalienable and we must make them compatible."
"As well as expressing my support for the measures announced, therefore, I call for a transparent and agreed common European anti-terrorist policy. Such a policy would strengthen democracy, restore the citizens’ confidence in their institutions, and make the terrorists lose all hope."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office – Home Secretary – I would like to add my welcome to you and my recognition of the enormously difficult challenges you face."
"We support your emphasis on the need for implementation of effective practical measures and better international collaboration, but I have a cautionary word: I feel sure there are some useful contributions that the EU can make in the fight against terrorism, but it has a nasty habit of merely seeking to extend its own powers on the back of a crisis and not necessarily doing anything of real practical value."
"I trust your antennae are sensitive to this tendency."
"I am the last to imagine that terrorism will be defeated merely by more intensive security measures."
"It has to be fought by every means, politically, diplomatically, financially, through the engagement of the communities from which terrorists draw their support, through sensible media coverage and through the education of public opinion."
"To date, we have not been very good at any of these."
"But before involving the European Union, Mr President-in-Office, let us put our own house in order."
"We have constituents from East Anglia, from Cambridgeshire, in the Parliament here today and, like me, they wonder when the Government is going to appoint a minister for homeland security."
"And it might not be a bad idea if we were to secure the borders more effectively in the United Kingdom."
"We are not hamstrung by compliance with the Schengen Agreement, yet we have no idea who enters or leaves our country and at least half a million illegal immigrants should not be there in the first place."
"We needed the Pakistan authorities to tell us that the London suicide bombers had been to Pakistan and probably on to Afghanistan, where they underwent terrorist indoctrination and training."
"We know that the protections of our free society have consistently been abused by extremists who live in Britain while supporting, financing and recruiting for a host of well-known terrorist organisations."
"No wonder London is widely dubbed 'Londonistan'."
"UK-based organisations which support terrorism in Britain or abroad must be closed down."
"May I just say how appalled I was at the view expressed by Mr Watson, the Liberal leader, that terrorists have the same human rights as their victims."
"Mr President-in-Office, you have a lot to do."
"You have our support for robust, effective and proportionate measures."
"Mr President, I welcome the statements from the President-in-Office of the Council and from the Commissioner."
"However, I want to address my words to the Members of this House."
"After 11 September, the bombings in Madrid, London and Turkey are a wake-up call."
"We have heard the Council and the Commission being urged to act."
"Of course they have to act, but so does the European Parliament."
"Terrorists and organised criminals use modern technology while we, in this House, argue and debate whether our police and intelligence services should have access to the same tools and the same technology."
"We argue in defence of the right of privacy whilst our citizens' lives are being physically damaged, undermined and sometimes terminated."
"Ordinary men and women look to us to make their lives and their communities safer."
"Yes, we must achieve a balance on privacy, on the retention of data and the use of data, but not to the point where we hand the terrorists and criminals an advantage that undermines our own way of life and gives them the opportunity to commit further atrocities."
"In this House we must end the interinstitutional argument and act collectively with the Commission and the Council to achieve agreement, with checks and balances on data retention, the use of biometrics, passenger name records, Schengen Information System II, VIS, police and intelligence cooperation."
"Balance is essential."
"But remember this: terrorists have no respect for democracy and even less respect for human rights, except their own."
"Political extremists will exploit the vacuum we create by our inaction and our prolonged deliberations, undertaken comfortably within our secure environments."
"Our citizens fear that we have lost touch with reality and do not understand their fears, their needs, their lives."
"Extremists will and do use the explosive cocktail of terrorism, immigration and asylum and the fear of the stranger to pursue their own agenda, which will diminish the rights of the vulnerable."
"We must be practical and sensible in our approach, but we must act."
"Freedom of movement across the European Union is seen as the biggest single benefit of being a member of the EU."
"That new right has been acquired because we have ceded another right."
"We have consented to the fact that information can be collected, retained and used on us."
"Had we not ceded that right of privacy, we would not have freedom of movement across the European Union."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council started off by saying that the citizens of Europe were disappointed and dissatisfied."
"They are indeed, but why?"
"It is because we, the European Union, are not making a good enough, credible enough or convincing enough job of doing what they expect of us."
"Why are we not doing that?"
"It is not out of any lack of commitment or of the necessary will; what we lack is power, and what certain of the Member States lack is the will to back up words with deeds."
"Some Members constantly deplore the mania for regulation, but I regret the lack of greater regulation of security matters at European level."
"I call on the Council to give us the resources, to give us the tools, to give the Community the powers to do what Europe’s citizens rightly expect of us."
"Let us have from you, at last, not only words, but also action!"
"If the European Union wants to be the answer to globalisation, we need more of the European Union and a common foreign, security and defence policy to give tangible form to the concept of political union without delay."
"If the European Union wants to deliver a credible, serious and speedy response to the menaces of terrorism, drug use, people-trafficking, illegal immigration and corruption, we need more money and more of the European Union."
"If we are serious in wanting more growth, more jobs created, more and better research and development, better social security and to fight more effectively against poverty, we need more money and more of the European Union."
"What we do not need is for more demands to be made on the EU, more pious lipservice and buck-passing."
"We need more policies, more of a will to joint action, more determination, more political action, more European Union."
"The European Union goes the furthest towards solving all those problems for which national borders present no obstacle."
"For terrorists, egoists, extremists and opportunists, an EU with powers returned to its Member States is the best of friends; a common Europe, a strong EU, is their most deadly adversary."
"Mr President, it has already been said that the two speeches that we have heard this morning differ somewhat in the approaches they reflect."
"Mr Frattini spoke about attacking the political and social structures of terrorism."
"He spoke about dialogue between cultures and religions and about the promotion of fundamental rights and freedoms, not just as a goal but as a strategy to combat terror."
"Mr Clarke's words reflect a more practical approach: he outlines concrete and practical measures to strengthen the police and justice systems."
"Both are necessary and both are equally valuable."
"Terrorists have struck in New York, Madrid, London, Turkey and Amsterdam."
"When I was in Morocco just after the terrorist strikes in Casablanca, the streets were dominated by enormous billboards with the text – do not touch my country, do not touch my neighbours, do not touch my fellow citizens."
"This is also the response that we, as Europeans, need to give: 'do not touch Europe'."
"It does not matter who you are or what excuse you think you have found for your perverse and nihilistic, violent ideology."
"If you hurt our fellow citizens, we will find you and you will be punished."
"Mr Clarke is right, the lack of faith in the European Union structure reflects a lack of trust in its ability to act."
"In order to be effective, however, we need so much more than a strong police force."
"We need a fundamental understanding of the problem we face."
"We need a joint insight into the networks that recruit young men and women in our inner cities and in our prisons."
"We need a common stance on democracy and rights and a common strategy on their promotion in Europe and beyond."
"We need to abandon the simplistic idea that promoting security automatically means limiting fundamental freedoms."
"We also need to forget the simplistic notion that limiting privacy automatically promotes security."
"In order to convince European citizens of the value of our measures, we need to take the measures that we can prove are necessary."
"The case for further data retention has not been sufficiently proven; the case for human intelligence and for understanding the problem has."
"We need a dialogue on the place of Islam in society and about the future of multiculturalism – we need Frattini's approach."
"However, we also need the down-to-earth approach that I read between the lines in Mr Clarke's words."
"'Do not touch my country' – it does not matter who we are, what our religion is or where we are from: if you hurt our fellow citizens, you hurt us."
"Do not touch Europe or the values it represents, the values that allow us all to live together in peace."
"Mr President, I believe the problem needs to be properly defined."
"It should be defined as a sustained attack on our democracy, and it therefore seems to me to be of little use, in a democratic society, to place liberty and security on an equal footing."
"In an exceptional and very serious situation we must put in place special measures that are appropriate for the current circumstances and have a legal basis, but this needs to be done with determination, boldly and without concessions."
"There is another hidden side to this debate, which I would now like to mention."
"I am referring to the much-discussed problem of the storage of data."
"It has not been said, but I will say it now, that behind all of this there are pressure groups and unacceptable economic situations."
"I must also add Mr President, that economic and security interests cannot set against each other and still less can they be camouflaged behind the guise of an apparent violation of public freedoms, even on a temporary basis."
"Mr President, I am fully on the side of the victims, of the British people and their government, and I support it unreservedly. I am on the side of democratic judges and police forces."
"I shall end, Mr President, by talking about something I am very well aware of."
"They can hear us, they have ways of hearing us, yet we do not want to know what they say, but when they say it and to whom."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are not in fairyland, we are engaged in a democratic and determined fight against terror."
"The subject of our debate today is liberty and security."
"These two concepts are interdependent, since without freedom and fundamental human and civil rights there can be no security, whereas without security it is impossible to establish freedom, human rights and the rule of law."
"I say this as a representative of a new Member State that was deprived of freedom and occupied by a foreign power for many decades."
"One of the reasons why citizens of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and other countries were in favour of joining the European Union was because it would mean a strengthening of the rule of law, of human rights and civil liberties and, of course, of security."
"The public is well aware of the fact that international terrorism, international organised crime and illegal migration cut across borders, and that in this age of globalisation no country is in a position to solve these problems alone."
"What this means is that intensive cooperation is needed in all these fields."
"It is for this reason that I welcome the comments made by Mr Clarke, who emphasised intergovernmental cooperation and cooperation between police forces, as well as the exchange of information between intelligence services."
"I also welcome the initiatives launched by Commissioner Frattini, such as the new rules relating to the common asylum and immigration policy and the proposal for a directive on the retention of telephone and Internet data."
"All public opinion polls show that the European public wants Europe to cooperate more in the field of security."
"I should therefore like to call both on the Council and, above all, on the Commission to step up cooperation, since the public believes that more Europe means greater security in this field."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nobody in this Chamber is unclear about the need to take more, and appropriate, action to combat terrorism and criminal activity."
"What increasingly worries me, though, is that policy-makers at the national and international level can think of nothing better, when new problems arise, than to respond to them with new regulations, new directives and new measures."
"I am all in favour of the police and the security forces being given new instruments, but I do think it important that the need for these new measures be demonstrated."
"I think it matters that existing measures should be – as they are – effective."
"How do things stand with cooperation between the Member States?"
"As Members have just said, that, after all, is the real problem as regards internal security and the fight against crime."
"We have 25 legal systems, none of which are harmonised; our exchange of data is inadequate and not enough information is exchanged between the secret services."
"Once measures are decided upon, what do we do with them?"
"Are they, or are they not, implemented in every Member State?"
"I really would like to see a list detailing where the gaps in cooperation are, what has been done about these measures and their implementation and just how well existing institutions function."
"That is the sort of list we need if we are to be able to decide what else is necessary."
"It is then that I – we – will be open to the possibility of considering new instruments, but I have to tell you, Mr Clarke, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that every single measure needs to be shown to be necessary."
"It gives me pause of thought that this House has spent a year asking for proof of the need for these measures to retain communications data, and that it is only now that we are being given specific examples of why they are needed; even so, that is not evidence, but individual examples of cases in which it was of use."
"That annoys me; grateful though I am that these examples were at least provided, I have to tell you that they are not enough."
"Commissioner Frattini hit the nail on the head when he said, just now, that if we adopt new measures, it must for a start be clear that only certain types of data will be used for a certain period of time and only for specific purposes."
"This is not about saying either ‘yes’ nor ‘no’ to the whole lot, lock, stock and barrel, but rather about the vital importance of guaranteeing a discriminating and proportionate approach."
"I also expect Parliament – which Commissioner Frattini has just said he wants to involve – to be taken seriously."
"As things stand at present, the Council is not prepared to give Parliament a proper say as regards the retention of communications data, and that is not on."
"Mr President, following 11 September 2001, the United States, on the pretext of maximising security, have been waging an underground, and for a time secret, war."
"It involves what we could call the ‘relocation of torture’, made topical recently when an Egyptian citizen was kidnapped in a street in Milan, allegedly on the orders of the CIA."
"The Italian Public Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for the thirteen American citizens involved in the seizure of the alleged terrorist, who was sent to Egypt to be subjected to special treatment."
"Cairo acknowledged it had received him as a result of extraordinary procedures."
"Those procedures are known in CIA jargon as ‘extraordinary surrender’, which is equivalent to the subcontracting of torture."
"A person suspected of being connected to terrorism is kidnapped and sent to a country, normally an Arab country, specialising in that art."
"Secretly, and without respecting any rights, the individual is removed from the territory of the United States, and hence its native principles, which fortunately reject such behaviour, are not violated, since the interrogations take place on foreign territory."
"To the question on these issues put by three Socialist Members, the Commission replied that it is impossible for it to take action since this involves kidnaps carried out by a third country on the territory of Member States."
"I can understand that, but nevertheless, the Union does have close links with the countries responsible for the scandal I am referring to."
"I therefore believe that, although the Community has no competence, the Council should be concerned to make it very clear that Europe acts differently in its international relations."
". Mr President, we have had a very good debate this morning."
"I am not in a position to respond to everything that has been said, but I simply wish to make four points for the House to consider."
"Firstly, I very much welcome the style of the debate and the approach."
"I appreciate the contributions by Mr Poettering, Mr Schulz, Mr Watson and Mr Cavada, in particular Mr Cavada's remark that the time has come to work together in the next four months to reach an agreement on how to proceed."
"I welcome these indications of an approach, which were widely shared in the debate today, and, on behalf of the Council of Ministers, I can say that we want to work with you to resolve these questions in a positive way."
"The second point, however, is that for me this debate has illustrated the dangers and the desire of some political forces to spread poison, malice and disinformation about these difficult and problematic matters."
"I refer in particular to the contributions of Mr Claeys, Mr Farage, Mr Borghezio, Mr Karim – a particularly ignorant and ill-informed contribution – and Mr Van Orden."
"It is very important that when we have this debate we look at the true facts and discuss them in a proper way, because unless we solve these problems others will use them for their own purposes."
"My third point is a very important point of principle."
"Mr Voggenhuber said that we must defend our values by working within them."
"I agree entirely."
"To avoid any doubt, I absolutely respect the legal framework and the rights that need to be respected."
"I shall take one example that has been mentioned, the terrible, tragic shooting of Mr de Menezes by the police the day after the bombings in London."
"In the United Kingdom legal system we have an independent police complaints committee which will investigate every aspect and report publicly and conclusions will then be drawn."
"The police and security services are properly accountable to society as a whole, even when a very tragic error has been committed."
"That is what should happen!"
"There is always a danger of errors and, of course, this Parliament is right to say that we have to ensure there is scrutiny and accountability."
"However, I say – certainly for the British Government but also for the Council as a whole – that we commit ourselves to such a legal framework and the terrible killing in question is an illustration of being able to do just that."
"I will just add one other point."
"We have had suicide bombers in our city, people ready to blow themselves up, to destroy in terrorist attacks."
"It is legitimate for the police to consider how they can deal with that problem."
"I wish we did not have the problem, that we did not have suicide bombers at all."
"I wish I could snap my fingers and they would disappear."
"I cannot – they are here."
"In these circumstances, it is right for our police and security services to give proper thought to how we deal with a threat from that quarter, subject to scrutiny and debate and subject to operating in a legal framework."
"But that is what this Parliament should be about: asking what the correct procedures are in these areas."
"That is why I say yes, we work within a legal framework."
"But I also say to my friend Mr Watson that human rights are indivisible, that is true, but we also have to recognise that there are individuals and organisations seeking to destroy these human rights and we have to defend ourselves against them against those people who want to destroy those very human rights for everybody."
"That is an obligation we have in addressing them."
"My final point is in response to the criticisms that I did not sufficiently address the question of social and political action on Islam. I accept those criticisms."
"They were well made."
"Mr Lambrinides, Mr Wiersma, Mr Barón Crespo and Mrs Roure – with her points about justice – are all correct."
"We need to have a policy to address these questions and to take them forward."
"We need to understand Islam; we need educational, social, and political action on that."
"As Mrs Roure said, we need to focus on a foundation of justice; we need to say that this nihilism is a perversion of Islam rather than Islam itself."
"As Mr Mayor Oreja said, we need to understand the role of organisations in these areas."
"I do not have time to address the issues about Iraq that were raised by Mr Wurtz and Mr Fava."
"All I will say is that the 9/11 attacks took place well before the Iraq situation and terrorist atrocities have been committed over a period of time that has to be taken into account."
"I hope and believe that during this Presidency we will take the decisive step to get all the institutions of the European Union – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to raise the quality of our work on serious and organised crime and terrorism, and I commit myself to work in that direction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank you for the quality of the debate that we have had, which shows how the Council, Parliament and the Commission are strengthening their resolve to work together."
"Some of you have stated – Mr Schulz did so very forcefully, as did Mr Barón Crespo – that we often have long, protracted debates about the same subjects."
"That is very often the case in certain institutional areas."
"You are right, Mr Schulz: we did indeed include measures in the Constitutional Treaty that would have enabled us to make progress; for the time being, however, such progress will not be possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in reflecting on the future of Europe and in addressing security as a priority area for European action, we shall have to place greater emphasis on the fact that, if we are serious about wanting to reduce national rivalries, we must create a more solid and more cohesive institutional common ground in Europe."
"That common ground does not exist at present; meanwhile, terrorism and cross-border organised crime are unfortunately changing and developing much faster than our European institutions."
"That is a problem that we have to face when our citizens call for a response – the EU policy response that many of you have emphasised."
"How should we act now?"
"I shall just take up a few of the suggestions that I have heard, starting with Mr Brok’s: fewer new laws, fewer new legislative initiatives and more implementation of the existing rules."
"That is a principle of which I have become aware during my first seven months – not a long time – working in the Commission: many Member States are seriously behind schedule in implementing the rules that already exist; there still remain institutional rivalries, which are being worn down through the joint work of the institutional players."
"That is why I have proposed a mechanism within the plan of action for permanently monitoring the implementation of existing rules, so as to evaluate whether and to what extent we are progressing – and you have endorsed that."
"Furthermore, I myself and the Commission services will, of course, undertake to provide the Member States that request it with the technical assistance they need to implement the existing rules on terrorism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall ensure that I refer back to you periodically – I shall do so every six months – regarding implementation methods, and whether the existing rules have been duly implemented and by whom, but to do that I shall need your firm political, not legislative, support."
"Lastly, a final thought about Europe’s political strategy."
"Mr Poettering and then Mr Mayor Oreja, amongst others, spoke of a primarily political response."
"I agree wholeheartedly and say: let us involve civil society more – the religious and civil communities that throughout Europe represent this great reality that is our reality – and let us work with them to eliminate the deep roots of terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists."
"Something that I have already mentioned to you and will mention again in this Parliament is that we intend to call openly for involvement and commitment from Islamic communities that feel that they are communities living at the same time within a European context."
"We shall also ask them to make a gesture of responsibility: in this open dialogue we should like to hear the prayers in mosques sometimes – more and more often – include a clear, strong condemnation of any act that seeks to destroy human life."
"That is the dialogue and the partnership of values on which our political action must be based."
"As the Commission, we shall also make a contribution to the international strategy of Europe’s security measures."
"We shall issue a communication to Parliament and the Council to examine with you the best way of involving international players in this thoroughly universal challenge that affects everybody."
"We shall also call for support – I have heard some speeches to this effect – and some positive assistance from the vast world of the volunteer sector and NGOs to help us in detecting movements of funds and the transparency of financial transfers."
"I can say that I personally shall meet representatives of non-governmental organisations and, until there has been a thorough debate, we in Brussels do not intend to issue a unilateral executive document."
"We shall hold back and ask for their help; the transparency of financial transfers is indeed one of our preventative weapons for fighting terrorism."
"One final thought: I have heard many of you – I remember Mr Lambrinidis in particular – mention the need for the people and civil communities not to feel excluded from this great, concerted, political endeavour to defeat terrorism."
"If the citizens feel distanced from this great challenge that we have in common, then we – the Commission, Parliament and the Council – will have lost effective contact with the source of our democratic legitimacy, that is to say the citizens."
"That is a factor, ladies and gentlemen, that perhaps lies at the root of the mistrust and distance that led so many people in France and the Netherlands to say ‘No’, because they felt excluded and distanced."
"In the fight against terrorism we need to keep them close."
"Mr President, I ask that you take note of the fact that I made, when speaking on behalf of my group, a comment on which Mr Voggenhuber seized in his speech and interpreted to mean that I would like to see the security forces respond to the use of violence by terrorists and criminals with the same sort of violence or a similar overall way of dealing with such persons."
"The only possible explanation for why Mr Voggenhuber placed this construction on my words is that he was not giving me his full attention."
"Let me therefore say that the substance of what I said was that those, whether terrorists or criminals, who disregard human rights and attack society have to reckon with the full rigour of the security forces, but I did add – and will take this opportunity to repeat – that it is also a measure of democracy’s strength that it guarantees fundamental civil liberties to all, even to people such as these."
"That is our group’s position, and no other interpretation is tenable."
"That concludes the debate."
"– In the aftermath of the brutal attacks on London, which we vehemently condemn – just as we unequivocally condemn all forms of terrorism, including state terrorism – a new offensive is underway at EU level, using the London attacks as its pretext, to justify the latest appalling violations of the citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees. At the same time, the fact that policies such as the aggression and military occupation in Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan in themselves fan the flames of terrorism has been deliberately swept under the carpet."
"Among the measures on the table is, once again, the proposal to check telephone and e-mail records and retain them in a European database, which, as far as we know, would be carried out without any checks and balances in place. Such a measure would be disproportionate and it is highly doubtful that it would work."
"All of the evidence points to the fact that, despite what is being trumpeted, this security offensive has been a failure in relation to its stated aims, the worst aspect of which is that it has undermined the citizens’ rights and freedoms."
"In the name of this security offensive, Jean Charles Menezes, a Brazilian citizen, was brutally and appallingly murdered on his way to work by the British police force, putting into practice its policy of shoot first and ask questions later."
"Mr President, I have read Monday’s Minutes and note, to my regret, that they do not include my name, even though – as the lady Members sitting next to me can confirm – I was, as usual, present punctually for the beginning of the sitting."
"I ask that the Minutes be amended accordingly."
"Mr President, when will Parliament's Bureau and its Presidency get a grip on the shambolic procedures that we use when it comes to voting?"
"We were told that we would vote at 12 noon."
"It has now gone 12.30 p.m."
"How can we expect people outside to take us seriously if we cannot organise ourselves properly in here?"
"The Presidency must do something."
"As you know, Sir Robert, I have every sympathy with your position."
"I will certainly convey that to the Conference of Presidents, but the list of speakers is put forward by the groups."
"We endorsed the agenda on Monday, but I take your point and we will try to improve in future."
"Mr President, at the same time that I am addressing you, the Tunisian League for Human Rights is being surrounded by the army."
"I call on you to take note of this and to take immediate measures."
"I am well aware that this is not an urgent matter today, but emergencies exist that cannot wait until Thursday afternoon."
"That point is noted."
"There will be a meeting of the Maghreb delegation this afternoon at 3 p.m."
"Mr President, I have the impression that we did not vote for Amendment 15."
"It fell because Amendments 23 and 31 were adopted."
"That concludes the vote."
". The report before us and the proposal for a resolution contained therein offer us an opportunity to pay tribute to the speed and the spirit of solidarity and responsibility with which the EU acted in response to the tsunami disaster last December."
"Naturally, the only possible vote in this instance is a positive one."
". Portugal is well aware of the value and importance of mobilising this fund when the disasters that strike us reach a scale that requires the solidarity of the Union and our other partners."
"In view of the necessary technical evaluations, and given that Slovakia has introduced a request to cover the damage resulting from the storm of 19 and 20 November 2004, we therefore have a duty to support the mobilisation of the Fund in question."
". I welcome the immediate response from the EU to the Tsunami disaster."
"The goodwill generated by this however, could be lost if projects on the ground are not sustained."
"The Commission must maintain a careful focus on helping the victims of the Tsunami by not only spending money, but spending it effectively."
". This proposal for a revision of the financial perspective 2000-2006 stems from the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) adopted by the September 2003 European Council, which provided for a reduction in direct payments (subheading 1a), known as ‘modulation’, for the purposes of financing rural development policy (subheading 1b)."
"This proposal raises certain fundamental questions regarding the CAP and agriculture spending."
"We do not deny the need to grant structural aid to the rural world and to increase that aid."
"In the debate on the reform of the CAP and the new financial perspective 2007-2013, we tabled practical proposals aimed at increasing appropriations for rural development, with specific regard to compensation payments and organic farming."
"This must not be done, however, at the expense of the market pillar of the CAP, or as part of a philosophy of replacing this pillar with rural development, as put forward by the British Presidency."
"Transferring funds from the market pillar to rural development is a way of introducing cofinancing by the back door, which amounts to the renationalisation of CAP costs."
"This proposal also undermines the principles of modulation and capping, which should help to redistribute aid more fairly among countries, production sectors and farmers; in other words, cutting aid to the major holdings ..."
". I voted in favour of the Garriga-Polledo report."
"Parliament made an undertaking to urgently respond to the rehabilitation and reconstruction needs in the wake of the devastating tsunami of 26 December 2004."
"We must therefore provide ourselves with the resources needed to meet those challenges, whilst safeguarding ongoing development programmes and of course without jeopardising our other priorities."
"In this regard, I welcome the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for the financial year 2005, totalling EUR 15 million for the purpose of financing reconstruction and rehabilitation measures in countries affected by the tsunami, as it is an appropriate measure that is worthy of my support."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs and all my colleagues who have voted to provide Slovakia with 5.6 million euro from the European Solidarity Fund to replant the forests destroyed by the gales in the High Tatras in November."
"This is the culmination of the initiative of those Slovaks who set out to organise an exhibition on the Tatras in Strasbourg."
"The European Parliament’s gesture is a display of solidarity with all those who know and love our alpine regions and who did not wait passively for the aid that Slovakia will be provided almost 10 months after this natural disaster."
"Last summer, enthusiasts from 17 European countries re-planted the green belt on the sides of mountains, remedying the damage done to the woodlands estimated at 195 million euro."
"Every day an average of 95 volunteers worked on the Water Forest Project organised by the Ľudia a voda (People and Water) NGO."
"This interesting project, carried out under the auspices of a Government committee and of other institutions, could become a pilot project for other countries as well."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues have abstained on this report regarding the surplus in 2004."
"Conservatives believe that the EU budget must deliver value for money for the EU taxpayer."
"We therefore feel that, in this instance, we are not prepared to criticise the Commission for this underspend."
". This report addresses the surplus resulting from the execution of the budget for 2004."
"The under-spend of payment appropriations is one of the principal components in the final balance of the 2004 budget."
"Compared with previous years, the implementation of Structural Fund programmes has improved considerably. Yet the challenges now facing the EU cannot justify this underspend."
"This is particularly true of pre-accession aid, which we feel could raise serious problems in the near future."
"It is therefore of crucial importance that the Commission improve its implementation in 2005, so that results show a significant reduction in the Union’s surplus."
"To conclude, I voted in favour of the Garriga Polledo report, as I had no objections to any of his pertinent observations."
"Experience has shown that the EU is unsuccessful at providing effective disaster aid."
"Each Member State should instead set up, for example, a solidarity fund designed to help countries hit by various natural disasters."
"Coordination should be adapted to the specific circumstances that attend each individual disaster and take account of the priorities of the countries affected."
"The June List therefore chooses to vote against the reports in spite of their being, in terms of their objectives, justified and worth taking seriously."
"Mr President, I should like to say something about the Őry Report, starting by saying that I utterly fail to comprehend how a monstrous piece of legislation such as this can spend twelve years being tinkered with in the Commission, the end result being the insight that a piece of legislation on optical radiation is, as it relates to the rays of the sun, perhaps not exactly what the European man and woman in the street expect of Europe."
"We, in Europe, should pay less attention to things like sunlight, which many people – who also know how to protect themselves against it in their leisure time – regard as perfectly normal, and concern ourselves instead with the things that people really do expect Europe to do something about."
"By that I mean, not solar radiation, but the problems of the world such as the war in Iraq and the increasing problem of terrorism – quite different issues, indeed, and I can do no other than ask not only the Members of this House, but also the Commission, to learn from what has happened, which this vote has prevented from doing too much damage, and to concentrate their attention in future on matters that are of relevance to Europe and cause the members of the public to feel that we concern ourselves with the things that concern them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to make a statement in relation to Mr Őry’s report, which I voted against, since I find it almost ridiculous that we want to regulate every detail of the public’s lives from the European level downwards."
"I see the treatment of Europe’s citizens as children in every area of their lives as a profoundly Socialist approach."
"I would rather that, instead of adopting a directive, we had mounted an information campaign, pointing out to the public the hazards presented by artificial and natural radiation."
"People must continue to take responsibility for whether or not they expose themselves to natural radiation."
"I regard it as positively cynical to waste this House’s valuable time on a debate on a sunshine directive, while leaving unnumbered thousands of people, many of them children, to die of hunger and thirst under the African sun."
"It is to that that we need to find answers."
". Though very supportive of relevant and appropriate health and safety provisions pertaining to employees, I cannot endorse the inclusion of natural sources of optical radiation within this Directive."
"Employers already have a duty to assess the risk to health and safety and to introduce appropriate control measures as specified in the Framework Directive (89/391/EEC)."
"Thus exposure to the sun is a known risk, for example to the agriculture and building industries, and is already sufficiently catered for."
"The inclusion of natural sun radiation in the new Directive will disproportionately affect small agricultural and construction businesses and add unnecessary administrative costs, particularly in the Northern regions of Europe."
"The wildly varying climates in the various EU Member States are enough to make it clear that European legislation on natural optical radiation is not appropriate."
"Whilst provisions specific to exposure to artificial radiation are appropriate, the inclusion of natural sunlight radiation caused me to vote against this Directive as excessive and burdensome in its ambit and impact."
"The foolishness of this proposal suggests that the people of Europe are more in need of protection from Brussels than from the sun!"
". I am appalled by the position on solar radiation adopted by the majority of MEPs – that is, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the liberals."
"The proposals that they rejected were aimed at obliging employers to assess the risks to health and safety of exposure to natural sources of optical radiation, and to draw up and implement an action plan comprising technical and organisational measures intended to reduce to a minimum the health and safety risks of workers who work in the open air, without prejudice to the Member States’ obligation to lay down specific criteria for carrying out risk assessments taking account of the nature of the activity and the exposure in question."
"That majority did not only block the adoption of the proposals that we tabled but also rejected the common position accepted by the Council on this issue, which took a similar line to ours, insofar as it proposed better protection for workers exposed to strong solar radiation, in light of the WHO’s warnings regarding the increase in cases of skin cancer."
". I am a firm supporter of social Europe and of the protection of employees from hazards at work."
"The road to hell is paved with good intentions, however."
"The European Union and Parliament in particular have a natural tendency towards over-regulation."
"That is the case with the directive providing for protection not only against artificial radiation, but also against natural radiation."
"Since the dawn of time, humankind has been able to adapt to the natural climate."
"The desert Bedouins dress differently to people from the North."
"Why should we want to churn out regulations governing workers’ exposure to sunlight from Sicily to the Arctic Circle?"
"Would it not be sufficient to apply what is today pompously referred to as the precautionary principle, namely basic caution, instead of legislating left, right and centre?"
"The report is about protection in work places against exposure to optical radiation."
"We support a minimum level of health and safety protection in work places, but we basically believe that this can be provided by the Member States themselves."
"We support, however, the amendments involving reduced bureaucracy for companies."
". The right-wingers’ rejection of the directive to protect workers from optical radiation testifies to a high degree of cheap opportunism on their part and represents a stab in the back for those affected by it."
"Serious consideration of the dramatic increase in the incidence of skin cancers among workers – over 90 000 cases according to German trade associations and a figure that has increased tenfold since the 1970s – cannot but result in action!"
"To radiation, national borders present no obstacles."
"That is why I vote for European regulation to protect workers and against the Christian Democrat motion for the rejection of the Common Position."
"I cast my vote in favour of a European solution that lays down the maximum level of protection for workers who are exposed to optical radiation."
"Dramatic changes in climate make it necessary that more attention be given even to natural radiation."
"The rapid rise in the incidence of skin cancer in Australia should be a warning to us in Europe."
". I voted for the various amendments which deleted natural sources of optical radiation from the scope of this Directive."
"The misguided attempt to include sunlight was a gift to the ultra sceptics, who enjoyed putting about such stories as ""Brussels seeks ban on sunlight""."
"Of course our constituents should be aware of the health risks of over-exposure to the sun, but EU-wide regulation from Brussels is not the best solution, nor is burdening employers with yet another obligation."
"The responsibility for informing our peoples about the effects of sun on their skin should rest firmly with the member states and devolved governments."
"There is after all a marked difference in the climate between Scotland and Greece for example and therefore health advice would be best tailored to suit local circumstances."
". I have recently received a large number of letters from professionals in the hotel, catering and construction industries who have informed us of their legitimate concerns regarding a common position of the Council on the exposure of workers to optical radiation."
"When examined more closely, this recommendation is, in fact, mind-boggling, leading one to wonder just how seriously the wording can be taken."
"The need to improve and better manage the safety of workers exposed - in industry, for instance - to artificial optical radiation is understandable, but why was it necessary also to take an interest in so-called ‘natural’ optical radiation?"
"Why is there this desire excessively to regulate the working conditions of people exposed to the …sun to varying degrees?"
"Besides attracting ridicule, these proposals which, if implemented, would produce inconclusive results, clearly look set to increase restrictions, particularly for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"Against the backdrop of international insecurity that is turning our countries upside down and of an economic and social crisis and crisis of identity, this kind of unbelievable proposal demonstrates once again the degree to which these pro-Europeans who want to control everything are out of touch with reality."
"That is why I opposed this new gimmick which, with its administrative overkill and the financial stranglehold it exerts, is in danger of placing a dark cloud over many of our businesses."
". A lot of hot air has been generated over this directive on the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents."
"Owing to the splitting of the proposal, the common position is concerned only with the specific minimum requirements for the protection of workers from risks to their health and safety arising or likely to arise from exposure to optical radiation."
"This has led some to try and caricature this as the protection from sunlight directive."
"In my view despite attempts to ridicule the proposal it does strike a good balance between protectionism and over-regulation."
". As Labour spokesperson on Employment and Social Affairs, I voted for this piece of legislation today because I believe it will protect workers across Europe in a key health and safety area currently not covered fully in national legislation of Member States and will be protection for workers in my constituency of London."
"Some MEPs have tried to remove the issue of natural 'sunlight' from the Report."
"As a Labour MEP, I backed the UK Government and the Council line to back the common position as we believe it is a good balance between protectionism and over regulation."
". The growing demands to improve working conditions and to protect workers’ health and safety are a positive sign of economic development."
"A balance must be struck, however, so as to avoid making unreasonable demands by over-legislating."
"As regards the issue before us, it is important to make a subtle distinction between employers’ responsibilities and the precautions that all workers must take in both professional and private life."
"Balance and moderation must therefore be found and, broadly speaking, I feel that the rapporteur has succeeded in that aim."
". On behalf of the British Conservative Delegation of the EPP-ED Group, I would confirm that we voted against those amendment references to the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe because following the referenda outcomes in France and the Netherlands they no longer have the relevance they may have had when drafted."
"We support the overall direction of the Report and accordingly have voted in favour of the report."
"We have today voted against Mrs De Sarnez’ report because we believe that it contravenes Swedish legislation on freedom of the press and of expression and its clear rules governing media independence."
"The report contains proposals as to how minors might best be protected from harmful and unsuitable content on the Internet. We have nothing against such protection, but see it as a very important issue."
"However, the report also recommends that the Member States introduce a right of reply in connection with all the audiovisual and information services on the Net, as well as introduce rules on media ownership."
"For these reasons, we have chosen to vote against the report as a whole."
"Ensuring that minors do not have access to broadcasts or services for adults in the field of audiovisual services is obviously a very important issue."
"We believe, however, that to prepare legislative measures at EU level in order to protect minors’ physical, mental and moral development in relation to these services would be the wrong route to go down."
"Web hosting will always exist around the world, outside the EU."
"As has been observed, a lot depends on sound parental control, and parents now have the opportunity to install filters on their computers."
"The draft report has positive features, but it goes absurdly far in proposing, for example, that a domain name, such as .KID, be set up at secondary level."
"We believe that it is up to the democratic institutions in each Member State to solve these alarming problems."
"The EU should offer a framework for common standards within this area, to which the Member States can subscribe, rather as happens with the Schengen Agreement."
"We have definitely voted against all the amendments referring to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"That treaty has been rejected."
". This report, which starts off with the best of intentions, quickly becomes an unbelievable mishmash."
"The explanatory statement began well, however, and the report was obviously concerned with envisaging greater protection for minors not only against the scourges of pornography, paedophilia and violent images and content, but also – and this has been forgotten – against the incitement to use drugs or to behave dangerously, as well as recruitment and enrolment in fanatical and terrorist operations."
"The subject area was rather vast and our policies, I am afraid, rather too weak for the purposes of looking more seriously into these extremely alarming facts and attempting to deal with them in order to protect our children."
"Instead of doing that, the report strays from the point, spreads itself too thinly and jumbles together anything and everything."
"Pornography is certainly in there, but so too is the fight against discrimination, as are teacher training and, finally, the right of reply, though it is not really clear of what possible benefit this might be to minors."
"The report’s technique, which is commonplace in this House, is to evade the political issue, notwithstanding the host of good intentions."
"Once again, it makes this text obscure, abstruse, ideological and, therefore, completely ineffective."
". I wish to express my full support for this recommendation, which is aimed at ensuring an effective level of protection of minors and human dignity in all audiovisual and information services."
"Young people spend more and more time on the Internet, where millions of pages with pornographic content can be found."
"Accordingly, both providers and users have a responsibility to ensure that this new technology can be used with confidence."
"The protection of minors entails politicians, businesspeople, teachers and parents working together."
"Education syllabuses must include Internet education programmes aimed at children, but also for adults and parents, and information campaigns must be set up to alert the general public to the dangers posed by Internet use."
"I particularly welcome the creation of a domain name (.KID), which would provide a secure Internet area regularly monitored by an independent authority."
"Lastly, service providers should start to provide easy-to-use parental software and offer subscriptions to access services intended specifically for children with automatic filtering at source."
"This would make it possible to restore a degree of confidence in the use of the Internet."
". It is vital that the protection of young people from harmful content on the internet as in broadcasting keeps up with technological developments."
"This report makes it clear that self-regulation is good but insufficient protection for children against harmful content."
"The report calls for a variety of measures to improve protection including automatic filter systems for Internet access for children and for the Commission to organise an information campaign for all citizens on safer use of the Internet and a Europe-wide toll free helpline with information on filters."
"This issue is extremely complex but I hope in the light of the adoption of this report the institutions can cooperate to find continuing effective ways to protect our young people."
". The content that can nowadays be found on the Internet presents huge challenges in terms of the protection of minors and human dignity, and clear responses to those challenges are required."
"This report proposes a range of measures relating to education and the training of teachers and trainers, codes of conduct and information on illegal or suspicious activities on the network."
"It also proposes measures that the European authorities could take to improve the gathering and exchange of information."
"The industry and the authorities at national and European level should consider steps that they can take to enhance the protection of minors."
"There is no doubt in my mind that we must all play a proactive role in finding ways of increasing the much-needed protection of minors, the protection of human dignity and the fight against crime and illegal activity."
".– The very title of the Commission recommendation reveals the real intention of its authors, which is to leave the profitability of the entertainment and Internet industry well alone."
"Secondary measures are being formulated which are directed at governments, the industry and parents and teachers and which do nothing to change the present wretched situation."
"The only proposal which would have been of substantial value would have been an express ban on the production and broadcasting of radio and television and electronic material with disgraceful content which insults human dignity."
"As far as minors are concerned, industry is typically left unaccountable while additional incentives are proposed for the use, for example, of special filters for violent, racist and pornographic images."
"The burden of responsibility falls solely on parents to take lessons in how to use the Internet so that they can help their children."
"The amendments by the Committee on Culture and Education do not differ substantially in any way from the foregoing."
"Consequently, once again human dignity and the harmonious physical, mental and moral development of minors is getting into the Procrustean bed of the European audiovisual industry and the Lisbon Strategy, in other words of the savage exploitative system of the profitability of big business."
"It is for these reasons that the parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the relevant texts."
". I welcome the Commission proposal which aims to improve the health of European children by facilitating research, development and authorisation of medicines for use in children."
"I am delighted that such an important opportunity has arisen for children to enjoy the same access to innovative new medicines as adults already enjoy."
"I recognise and agree with the need for rewards and incentives to industry which will encourage the development of paediatric medicinal products."
"I have closely reviewed the discussions and debates on how best to achieve this and I can support the Commission’s proposal regarding the SPC extension, in tandem with the review mechanism proposed in the Regulation."
"I agree with the principles of transparency and public accessibility which are at the heart of the proposal to amend Article 40 to include a provision for public access to paediatric clinical trial information."
"However concerns raised by industry regarding the possibility that public expectations may be raised prematurely with regard to some products and commercial sensitivity of information are also valid."
"This report contravenes a very important principle of EU cooperation, namely the country of origin principle."
"It proposes that an EU paediatric authority be set up to assess, approve and monitor paediatric medicines and encourage their production."
"There are, however, no good reasons for centralising this activity in a new EU authority."
"The report is also based on the notion that the pharmaceutical industry does not think it profitable to develop special paediatric medicines."
"That is not very convincing."
"If there is demand, there is also supply."
"If there is anything that companies in a market economy are good at, it is identifying niches and manufacturing products for them."
"If it is true that there is a great need for special paediatric medicines, the solution should be sought on the demand side through the authorities in the individual countries."
"The whole report is permeated by efforts to extend the EU’s influence and develop new bureaucracies."
"For these reasons, we have voted against the report."
". The intention of this proposed regulation is laudable."
"It makes sense to improve the treatment of children by increasing the research, development and approval of medicines which are suited to the metabolism of the child."
"I regret that amendments tabled by my Group were not adopted."
"These would have made it a requirement of the approval mechanism to consider whether significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments had been achieved."
". I warmly welcome this proposal."
"A decade or more after the USA, the EU is at last set to adopt legislation requiring the testing of pharmaceutical products for children as part of their approval process."
"These new rules should ensure that more drugs are developed for children and that they are administered in safe and effective dosages."
"In return for pharmaceutical companies carrying out mandatory clinical trials for drugs intended for use in children they will be given financial compensation."
"The financial compensation proposed by the Commission involves granting companies an extra six months Supplementary Protection Certificate, that is, a form of extended patent."
"This must be monitored to ensure that it does not lead to excessive profits."
". Labour MEPs support the principle of awarding incentives to pharmaceutical companies in order to stimulate the necessary research and development."
"We therefore support the concept of extending the SPC, but question the Commission proposal for an automatic six-month extension."
"We feel a variable length SPC extension would have been better and fairer, because the amount of incentive would better have reflected the costs of research."
"Of the options on the table, we therefore supported the three- plus three-month extension."
"We did not, however, support the option of a fixed four- or five- month SPC extension, because this risks being unfair to smaller companies."
". Our desire to improve children’s health has been the driving force behind the Union’s policy on support for research and development into new medicinal products for paediatric use."
"This report contains a number of measures to ensure that all research and development regarding these medicinal products, and the final authorisation for their paediatric use, be reviewed by independent authorities that are specialised in this field."
"Furthermore, the report proposes coherent measures on administrative deadlines, whilst safeguarding quality levels and ensuring that exchanges of information in the field can take place."
"This is a field of research that is capable of bringing us great joy in terms of fighting disease. We must therefore take care to ensure that all measures that we take reflect the need for quality and rigour in pursuit of these goals."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Grossetête report."
". These new rules are long overdue."
"Fifty per cent of medicines used to treat children in Europe have not been tested and are not authorised."
"Every parent wants to have the peace of mind of knowing that a medicine used on their son or daughter is safe."
"These new rules would go some way towards guaranteeing this safety, which at present is not clearly established."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted for the report by Mrs Grossetête with much conviction, and would, moreover, like to congratulate her on the work she has done."
"In her report, she has managed to strike the right balance."
"I am therefore very much in favour of extending the patent protection of paediatric medicines by a fixed six-month term."
"The alternatives available (such as two plus four, three plus three) are unviable practically speaking, involve much red tape and threaten to neutralise the positive stimulus that this legislation gives to scientific research."
". I know from direct personal experience that the burden placed upon businesses, especially SMEs, by the obligation to administer VAT is very significant, and therefore I support moves such as this to simplify the process."
"I also strongly believe that there should remain with Member States a reasonable degree of flexibility, such as in setting turnover thresholds and applying reduced or zero rates of VAT."
". I welcome the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as regards the introduction of administrative cooperation arrangements in the context of the one-stop scheme and the refund procedure for VAT."
"The aim of simplifying VAT is an admirable one."
"I support the various amendments striving to establish better cooperation between taxable persons and tax administrations, also those that help to improve cooperation between Member States’ tax authorities."
"The Rapporteur suggests to introduce a minimum limit of EUR 50.000 for exemption from VAT."
"The suggestion concerns only first 3 years of the activity of a newly established SME."
"This new lower bound of exemption contributes to SME's brisker economic performance, generating more employment across the EU, further realising the Lisbon objectives."
". One of the basic rules that has long been taught by economists is that the cost of levying a tax should be lower than the money accrued."
"That goes without saying."
"There is another rule, however, which is that the payment of taxes should be as simple as possible, so that the cost of the tax is not pushed up by a ‘bureaucratic tax’, which is both short-sighted and, more to the point, inefficient."
"In this context, I welcome the initiatives aimed at simplifying the processes of charging, paying and refunding VAT."
". The EPLP does not accept or agree that the thresholds for calculation of VAT are best dealt with at EU level."
"It is up to Member States to promote the most appropriate calculations, especially for their micro-companies."
"This allows Member States to fulfil their promises the Lisbon agenda, in making appropriate allowances for such businesses, and to set an entrepreneurially sensitive approach."
"The next item is the statement of the Council and of the Commission on the situation in the Middle East."
"Mr President, it is a great and genuine honour for me to be here in the European Parliament today on behalf of the Council."
"I personally welcome the opportunity to discuss the situation in the Middle East."
"We are witnessing a new chapter of that region’s history, which brings with it both opportunities and considerable challenges."
"I would like to begin by welcoming the historic progress made by Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the northern West Bank."
"The European Union commends the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority for their commitment to overcoming the difficult challenges they both face."
"We are pleased that the disengagement process has so far gone well, with the avoidance of significant violence."
"The Israeli Government, with the assistance of the Palestinian Authority, carried out the disengagement plan effectively and quickly."
"The security forces evacuated the settlers sensitively but with resolve and determination."
"In short, they managed a difficult task well."
"We applaud the close coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and encourage them to continue on this path."
"We are keen to see that disengagement is a success across the board."
"To this end, we welcome, and urge the continuation of, the restraint shown by the majority of Israelis and, indeed, of Palestinians."
"The success of the disengagement process so far encourages both parties to continue their cooperation on the remaining steps of the process, not least in their close work with the Quartet’s Special Envoy for Disengagement, James Wolfensohn."
"He has presented plans for action to support Palestinian economic and institutional development in the context of disengagement and beyond, identifying key areas where progress would be needed."
"These include transport links, border crossings, customs issues between Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, the link between Gaza and the West Bank, and air and sea ports."
"The international community has pledged its full support."
"Freeing-up of movement within the West Bank is essential to Palestinian economic revival."
"Improved access for people and goods, while maintaining security for Israelis, will also be crucial to creating a sense of hope for the Palestinians."
"Taking full advantage of the opportunity of disengagement and promoting continued reform of Palestinian institutions – as set out at the London meeting on March 1 – will be our two main priorities during our Presidency."
"In this context, the European Union will work closely, of course, with Mr Wolfensohn in order to help realise plans to make Gaza economically viable after the Israeli withdrawal."
"It is also important that we look beyond disengagement to advance the political process and to take advantage of the opportunity it represents."
"After disengagement, both sides will need to focus on making progress against their roadmap and Sharm El-Sheikh commitments."
"In Iraq, we have also witnessed another important step forward following the publication of Iraq’s constitution as recently as 28 August 2005."
"We congratulate the Iraqi people on reaching this important milestone in the political process."
"Drafting the constitution has, of course, been difficult."
"All of Iraq’s communities have worked together to draft this constitution and there have been compromises on all sides."
"But they have now produced a constitution that we hope will be a key building-block towards a democratic Iraq."
"In particular, the principles of democracy and basic human rights are, with Islam, the founding tenets of the new Iraq."
"No law can be passed that contradicts those tenets."
"All Iraqis are held equal before the law, regardless of gender or, indeed, of religion."
"Freedom of belief is protected in the constitution."
"All extremist groups are prohibited."
"The new Iraq pledges to respect its neighbours and its international obligations."
"The oil of Iraq is owned by all the Iraqi people and is to be exploited so as to maximise the benefit to the Iraqi people."
"The European Union will continue to encourage all Iraqis to play a part in the next stage of the political process by voting on the draft constitution in the October referendum."
"Broad public support for the constitution will help ensure a stable future for Iraq."
"The Iraqis have succeeded in drafting this constitution despite the actions of terrorists who are trying to destroy the country’s desire for that peaceful future."
"The Council recognises the many challenges still ahead for Iraq, particularly in terms of the security of its people."
"The European Union is working to build up the capacity of the Iraqi security forces and the judiciary through its integrated Rule of Law and Police Training Mission."
"On Iran, however, we are deeply concerned by that country’s unilateral resumption of activity at the uranium conversion facility in Esfahan on 8 August."
"This is in clear breach of successive IAEA Board resolutions and, indeed, the Paris Agreement Iran entered into just last November."
"The IAEA Board resolution, which was adopted by consensus on 11 August, is a clear and united signal from the international community of its wish that Iran return to suspending all conversion activities without delay."
"We also regret that Iran has chosen to reject, without serious consideration, the European side’s detailed proposals presented on 5 August."
"These are the most far-reaching proposals for relations between Iran and Europe since the Revolution."
"They would lead to a new relationship based on cooperation."
"I would like to reiterate that the European side is not asking Iran to give up its civil nuclear programme."
"The European proposal specifically offered support for that programme, but there is no civilian operational need for Iran to develop fuel cycle capabilities."
"Putting its fuel cycle activities on hold would not affect Iran’s ability to develop a civil power and research programme; yet allowing them to continue would bring Iran closer to the ability to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon."
"We remain committed to a diplomatic solution."
"We hope Iran will reverse its decision and re-suspend uranium conversion activity."
"The key to resolving this issue is for Iran to take the confidence-building steps requested of it by successive IAEA Board resolutions and restore the suspension."
"As part of our wider engagement with the region, November’s Euro-Med 10th Anniversary Summit in Barcelona will be a critical opportunity to help the European Union’s Mediterranean partners to meet the challenges of the 21st century."
"The Barcelona Process needs to modernise and move towards a more results-orientated process, with much more focus on reform."
"In other words, it needs to address the concerns of the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean."
"The 1995 Declaration was a landmark and much of it remains valid today."
"But it still requires much in the way of implementation."
"This includes the need to address obstacles to progress on governance, human rights, market openness and foreign investment."
"We want to see medium-term targets adopted at that Summit outlining the kind of region we all want to see in five years."
"We cannot achieve these aims without peace in the region."
"Without peace, we will not achieve the zone of stability and prosperity that is our shared objective."
"But lack of peace should not also become an extra barrier to progress elsewhere."
"We would do well to heed the demands of the people across the region for more transparent government, for economic reform and for social and cultural awareness."
"We believe that there is a new determination in the region to address the challenges facing its people."
"We are determined to work hard to ensure that the Barcelona Process plays a full role in addressing the challenges facing citizens across the Euro-Med region."
"The Summit would be a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate that our partnership is relevant to our peoples and can deliver results on the issues that matter to them."
"Our partnership can help achieve a step change in regional development and indeed modernisation, through action on good governance, economic reform and education."
"Delivering results in these key areas, against specific targets and commitments, will help drive forward regional progress."
". Mr President, honourable Members, it is my pleasure to be able to address you today on the Middle East peace process at a time when there is a renewed feeling of momentum and hope."
"After five years of the second Intifada, the past six months of calm have witnessed a downturn in violence and terrorist acts and the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and removal of settlers from certain parts of the northern West bank has passed off smoothly."
"The professionalism of both sides is to be commended."
"But real challenges lie ahead."
"By this I mean firstly putting in place the conditions necessary so that the Israeli withdrawal creates an opportunity for ordinary Palestinians to improve their daily lives."
"Secondly, the implementation of the roadmap in full, and thirdly, the creation of a viable Palestinian state at peace with its neighbour, Israel."
"The Commission recognises that for the recent disengagement to be considered a success it must bring tangible and immediate improvement to the lives of ordinary Palestinians."
"The Commission has therefore launched a EUR 60 million package as an immediate response to the withdrawal."
"This consists of a EUR 40 million infrastructure facility geared to labour-intensive, fast-disbursing projects to restore essential services in the West Bank and Gaza; EUR 12 million assistance to institution-building to help the Palestinians assume governance responsibilities following disengagement, and a package of EUR 8 million focusing on social services, as well as East Jerusalem."
"The Commission is also working closely with the European Investment Bank to identify common projects in the infrastructure sector."
"I would like to mention here the fact that we have already in place the European neighbourhood policy and that we have already agreed common action plans with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan and that the Commission is absolutely convinced that in the context of the European neighbourhood policy Europe can play an important and helpful role in overcoming the problems of the region."
"This assistance will not, however, achieve its desired results unless Israel and the Palestinian Authority tackle such important issues as movement of people and goods between Gaza and the West Bank and the outside world, the greenhouses, operation of the border terminals, the dismantling and removal of settlers' homes and movement of people within the West Bank."
"It is for this reason that the Commission is providing financial, political and human resources support to the Quartet Special Envoy James Wolfensohn, whose contribution to the disengagement has been remarkable."
"The Special Envoy has succeeded in fostering dialogue with the Palestinian Authority and Israel on each of these issues."
"However, only one – the greenhouses – has been settled in full."
"The Commission is helping in this."
"We are, for example, ready to fund a new presence at border crossings as a confidence-building measure, if the parties so request."
"The Commission is also keenly aware of the need to maintain the Israel-Palestinian Authority customs union so as to avoid possible trade disruption and to do what it can to promote interregional trade and investment."
"The second challenge for the peace process is implementation of the roadmap."
"The disengagement has clearly been traumatic for Israel, but it has not caused the much-feared rift in Israeli society."
"On the Palestinian side, President Abbas was able to keep the Palestinian factions in check."
"It is now for the international community to help move both sides forward in parallel, helping the Palestinian Authority to make progress on tackling incitement and the dismantling of terrorist infrastructure and pressing Israel to bring to a halt the creation of new 'facts on the ground', which threaten to undermine future final status negotiations."
"Settlement activity in and around Jerusalem and the route of the separation barrier are the two most pressing issues."
"The third challenge is how to promote the creation of a viable Palestinian State, for which the implementation of the roadmap is a necessary condition."
"There is already renewed impetus for Palestinian reform, institution- building, stemming from the intention of the Palestinian Authority to establish a medium-term plan for economic development and from the G8 political commitment to raise up to EUR 3 billion each year for the next three years in order to fund this plan."
"In the coming weeks, the Commission will be putting forward proposals for a comprehensive and coherent medium-term strategy for the European Union's relations with a future Palestinian State, including better coordination of EU positions and financial assistance."
"We need to see how best we can promote the political and economic viability of a future Palestinian State through targeted assistance in support of reform and institution-building."
"It is clear that efforts must be geared towards the promotion of human rights and democratic principles, the rule of law, improved security and increased effectiveness of public administration."
". Mr President, it has to be said that the evacuation of the settlements in the Gaza Strip is long-awaited good news, within a context in which the only news we have been hearing has been of hate, death, endless suffering and desolation."
"It now falls to the Palestinians – and I would like to mention their leader, Mahmoud Abbas to follow the democratic path marked out, to control the extremist movements and to consolidate their institutions."
"For its part, Israel should also cease building new settlements and together, by means of dialogue, they should seek to establish, as Commissioner Verheugen has just said, two viable States which are secure and have recognised borders based on the United Nations’ resolutions."
"Of course, other problems remain to be solved, and these are clearly laid out in the road map."
"I refer to the problem of East Jerusalem, that of the refugees and that of the conflict between Israel and Syria."
"In addition, all this comes within a political context in which we have seen the resignation of Mr Netanyahu as a member of the government in order to contest Prime Minister Sharon’s leadership of Likud, and also in which there are going to be Palestinian elections. A European Union mission of observers led by our fellow Member Mrs Véronique De Keyser will monitor the latter, and I would like to wish it all the best."
"I therefore welcome the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to the effect that the European Union must play a fundamental role, in order to achieve a fair and lasting peace in the region."
"The European Union is the main donor to Palestine."
"The Union is a partner of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and also of Syria in the future Association Agreement, so it is clear that it must play a fundamental role in the political and economic reforms in the region."
"Consequently, I welcome the initiatives presented by the European Commission as a first step regarding the package of EUR 60 million to rebuild the infrastructures of the region and consolidate the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip."
". Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you have pointed out in your speeches, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza was an important move in the right direction."
"We should have preferred it, however, if it had happened within the framework set out in the roadmap and with the Quartet playing a different role."
"In any case, it has shown that it is possible to make progress without violence on the road to peace and compliance with international law."
"We are not ignoring the tensions that have arisen within part of Israeli society and particularly in the political sphere in that country, especially in relation to the prospects that are now opening up and the further steps that have to be taken."
"An important factor in this situation is the commitment of the international community and the European Union to pursue the only feasible prospect: that of continuing the peace process until the Palestinian people’s right to have a sovereign state is realised, with peace and security for both peoples."
"The message that we wish to put across in this debate is very clear and is primarily a political message."
"The more nationalistic sectors of Israeli society, currently represented by Minister Netanyahu, must not think that they will find any space or understanding unless they comply with international law."
"Continuing the settlements policy will mean condemning Israel to international isolation and encouraging the most extremist sectors in the Palestinian community."
"At the same time, the proponents of terrorism must avoid claiming the Gaza withdrawal as a victory, since it was the outcome of the renewed prestige of the Palestinian leadership on the world stage."
"It is important, therefore, as you have said, that the Palestinians continue the process that started with the presidential elections."
"In that respect, we welcome the fact that the date has been set for political elections and we are in favour of pushing ahead with the reforms announced by President Abu Mazen when he was elected, relentlessly continuing the work of opposing terrorism and violence."
"For its part, however, the international community must still bear in mind that political terrorism of Islamic origin, which is also of such great concern to people in our own countries, will be dealt a decisive blow if we are able to defuse the main source of hatred and tension, which is the Middle East conflict."
"Mr President, ever since I was little, the Middle East has dominated news broadcasts."
"Unfortunately, the news has mostly been about misery, violence, war, oppression and ultra-conservative rulers."
"Nowhere in the world is the lack of freedom as concentrated as, specifically, in the Middle East."
"Half a billion people live under dictatorships there, with the Israeli democracy as the only exception."
"That is naturally a problem for the people who live there."
"They are entitled, just as we are, to democracy and human rights."
"It is also a global problem."
"If people can see no future, then frustration, fanaticism and fundamentalism thrive."
"Certainly, there are signs that the situation is changing."
"An example of this is today’s presidential election in Egypt."
"It is a step forward, even if Mubarak will, of course, be the victor."
"There is, in any case, more than one candidate."
"The development in Lebanon, whereby the Syrian occupying power was thrown out, is also very positive."
"The decision to allow women in Kuwait to vote next year is also an important step forward."
"As has already been mentioned in this Chamber, the evacuation of Gaza which, in spite of everything, went so smoothly, is an incredibly important step for the continued peace process and the establishment of two states."
"The forthcoming Palestinian election will be an important test of how far the reforms within the Palestinian government have gone and of how the process can progress."
"Iraq has a government, a draft constitution and powerful forces wanting democracy and stability, but the situation is of course incredibly painful, what with the daily violence that people are forced to live with."
"There are, however, an incredibly large number of problems remaining in the Middle East."
"The Presidency mentioned Iran and the mullahs there who, with their nuclear weapons programme, have now been mocking, and trifling with, the world community for several months."
"This is an issue that the UN must tackle."
"We cannot continue to engage in ‘pretend negotiations’ with Iran in this way."
"Its oppression of its own people continues unabated, which is completely unacceptable."
"The oppression of people in the region cannot be tolerated."
"The EU, together with the United States, international organisations, foundations and the opposition in these and other countries should therefore take a combined initiative and devise an international peace and democracy plan for the whole of the Middle East."
"It is precisely on democracy that the resources of the Barcelona process should be much more focused."
"Nothing would be better for peace, stability and the fight against terrorism throughout the world than if democracy were to triumph in the Middle East."
"We have a big responsibility in this area."
"Mr President, we see Israel’s departure from Gaza as very positive, and it must represent the beginning of a new process leading to peace in the Middle East. The European Union should guarantee that every possible effort is made to improve the quality of life of Palestinians in Gaza."
"The Union ought also to guarantee access to the economy and the opening of the port and the airport as soon as possible. In addition it should press for the development of other aspects of economic activity, such as connection and communication between Gaza and the West Bank."
"Nevertheless, in contrast to the hope represented by Gaza, we fear that the current Israeli policy in Jerusalem may slam shut the so-called window of opportunity just at the most sensitive and volatile point of the conflict."
"We are absolutely delighted that the majority of Israelis and their government appear to have abandoned the idea of a ‘Greater Israel’, but we regret that that project may possibly be replaced with that of a ‘Greater Jerusalem’ spreading relentlessly over Palestinian territory. So far, 164 km2 of the West Bank have been appropriated, to the north, the east and the south of the city of Jerusalem."
"This unilateral appropriation does not serve Israel’s interests, because it jeopardises any stable peace and security agreement, and is creating a worrying situation on the ground, from the point of view of demography and town-planning."
"The construction work would effectively amputate East Jerusalem from the West Bank and destroy the territorial continuity that is essential to any future remotely viable or credible Palestinian State."
"That is a recipe for disaster."
"The policy would leave the Palestinian cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah and East Jerusalem practically cut off from each other."
"The E1 Project, which plans homes for 15 000 people, hotels and industrial areas to the east of Jerusalem is of particular concern, and I hope the Council and the Commission will take due note of this. In reality, the project would complete the process of separating the north of the West Bank from the south."
"The European Union must aim to ensure that Jerusalem becomes a city populated by two peoples, two nations, and also the capital of two viable States living in peace."
". – Mr President, we have all borne witness recently to historic events in the Middle East of particular political importance."
"The implementation of Prime Minister Sharon's disengagement plan was a development which we cannot but welcome, because it unquestionably constitutes a positive development and an important step towards the peaceful resolution of the Palestinian problem."
"However, we must at the same time note that the implementation of this plan, which – I repeat – we welcome, cannot under any circumstances be the final solution to the problem."
"I consider that it is no coincidence that, while the implementation of the plan has turned the Gaza Strip into a free zone, the number of settlers on the West Bank has increased dramatically recently."
"Following the private meeting during the official visit between President Borrel and Prime Minister Arial Sharon last June, it would appear clear that the disengagement plan does not form part of a political process with the objective of an end to the occupation, the return of refugees and the foundation of an independent Palestinian state and I greatly fear that the of the occupation continue to exist."
"Israel still maintains control of the borders with Egypt in the Gaza Strip as far as the movement of goods is concerned and continues to maintain the right of strategic intervention in that it continues, at the same time, to control the coast, the airspace and the borders of the Gaza Strip."
"We, as the European Parliament and as the European Union in general, should continue to monitor developments in the area with close attention and, at the same time, to exert pressure on all sides to engage in substantial talks which will result before the end of 2005 in significant progress and, very soon, in a final solution to the problem, a solution which cannot but be the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and, of course, the demolition of the wall and an end to the occupation, so that the two nations can build a peaceful future which will contribute to peace and progress throughout the Middle East."
"."
"Mr President, ‘A political party cannot bear arms; this exists in no democracy’."
"Those are the wise words of Mr Solana, the EU’s High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, but do not square up with the truth in the Gaza Strip, on the West Bank and in Lebanon, for indeed, both Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic terror movement, and Hezbollah, its Lebanese strategic ally, serve a dual purpose at the moment."
"They are fully committed to day-to-day political life and perfect their military formations in the process."
"With this dual strategy, Hamas and Hezbollah not only bring the internal Palestinian and Lebanese political relations to a head, they also deliberately head for an armed confrontation with Israel."
"We will end up with either the Intifada or else persistent armed chaos in the Palestinian regions and the threatening prospect of a new Lebanese civil war – a sad outcome, indeed, of Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza."
"This is a true spectre for the Middle East, certainly if we take Hamas’ present media campaign seriously, for its war cry is: no pointless negotiations with the Zionist enemy, but continuation of the Jihad to liberate the whole of Palestine."
"Given this critical situation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I am very keen to find out the Council’s position in respect of Hamas and Hezbollah."
"Are these Islamic terror organisations – or why not just call them warring factions – quasi-normal political negotiating partners for the European Union?"
"I would much rather find out what concrete steps the Council wishes to take to dismantle the so-called military branches of Hamas and Hezbollah."
"The Council should give me this information on the basis of the UN resolution No 1559 with regard to Hezbollah and our own European list of terrorist organisations with regard to Hamas."
"This is the perfect opportunity for the European Union, the Council and Commission to fulfil its ambition of being a peace-maker in the Middle East."
"Mr President, the Middle East continues to be without equal as a crisis hotspot after the USA presented Iraq as its model example of how to democratise and liberalise the Islamic world, and as a way of, so to speak, solving all problems with a single stroke."
"It was an experiment intended to stabilise the region, secure access to oil and facilitate disarmament and demilitarisation, but it failed, and the war against terrorism, having driven a wedge between the European allies, is seen by the Arab world as a strategic campaign to secure oil supplies."
"Fanatics were able to depict the American occupation as a war on the Islamic world."
"Bush has not only left a country in ruins but has also created a breeding ground for more terrorist training camps."
"The American intervention was nothing more than a badly-prepared occupation, embarked on as a sort of solo act; they underestimated both the potential for resistance and the costs involved – the latter of which they now want their partners, such as us Europeans, to cover after the event."
"For the problem of Israel and the Palestinians, too, no real solution is yet in sight."
"Although the evacuation of the Gaza Strip and the seeking of a two-state solution appear to have injected some impetus into the peace process, which has dragged on for decades, its success will largely be dependent on the economic success of the new structure, and that is where Europe will, no doubt, have to help out."
"Most disturbing of all is the nuclear weapons race in this region, for which the problematic existence of Israel’s nuclear arsenal is always cited as a pretext."
"The consequence of this is that Arabs have become convinced that the USA, in any case of doubt, will always take Israel’s side, and nuclear weaponry has become more attractive as a prestige project."
"Where weapons of mass destruction are concerned, an inherent momentum has developed, scarcely capable of being held in check and spurring neighbouring states to acquire weapons of this type, so that the Middle East remains a region with the potential to threaten the world as a whole."
"Europe may well, at present, be outside the range of rockets from the Middle East, but our also becoming a target is only a matter of time."
"This means that the EU must redouble its efforts in the Middle East, but Turkish accession will do nothing to stabilise the region, one reason for this being that Islamists do not, whatever some Europeans might hope, accept Turkey as a mediator and channel for communication."
"Mr President, today is a happy day for Egypt because, for the first time in a generation, the Egyptian people have an opportunity to vote for a president and have a choice in that vote."
"I and some colleagues here in the Chamber who sought the release of one of the presidential candidates, Dr Ayman Noor, on 12 March will be particularly interested in the outcome, since it was our intention to visit him in prison, where he had been put by the Egyptian authorities, having declared his opposition to President Mubarak."
"It was in Cairo that the United States Secretary of State made an important statement on 22 June at the American University, where she declared that, in the Middle East, democracy was better than stability, overturning – as she put it – 60 years of American policy."
"There has been a degree of cynicism about this change of approach, but nevertheless it represents some sort of step forward in the relations between the United States and the Middle East."
"I believe that the European Union should try and reflect this shift in policy; not that democracy is better than stability, but that democracy and human rights are better than ‘business as usual’."
"One of the things that singles out the European Union’s approach to the Middle East is this conjunction of democracy and human rights."
"Obviously, I regret that the Commission is rather less than ambitious in its programmes of democratisation, and we hope to see that improve in the coming months."
"In addition, the European Parliament has a role to play, through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, in particular."
"I believe that the parliamentary dimension of the Mediterranean is going to be of increasing importance."
"The next elections in Egypt will be the parliamentary elections and I hope that this House will agree that we should send a mission to Egypt for those elections, whether or not we are invited."
"Mr President, should we or should we not see the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip as an indication that there will be peace in the Middle East?"
"I choose to believe this is the case even though I know that a glass half-full can be considered a glass half-empty."
"I therefore welcome this withdrawal from Gaza as symbolic of the fact that no settlement is a permanent fixture and that they can all be dismantled in the future."
"I also choose to believe that the wall, which the Israeli Authority has always declared temporary, will one day fall."
"I choose to believe that no extremist group will harm this fragile hope of peace with a terrorist attack and, above all, that no authority will take advantage of an isolated criminal act to carry out collective reprisals and ruin any hope of peace."
"The withdrawal from Gaza has been difficult."
"The Israeli Government has carried it out with courage and determination and the Palestinian Authority with a great deal of maturity."
"Yet the glass is sadly also half-empty."
"Continued colonisation in the West Bank runs counter to the idea of long-lasting peace, in the same manner as the encirclement of East Jerusalem and the way in which Israel is gaining ground there."
"The potential isolation of Gaza, which is over-populated and cut off from any possible economic development, makes it a real ticking time bomb."
"That is why I emphasise the need for Europe, while paying tribute to those who have secured this successful disengagement, not to be blind to these worrying signs and to continue to exert pressure so that Gaza has air and sea ports and access to the West Bank and to Egypt, thus preventing it from closing on its inhabitants like a trap, so that international law and humanitarian law are respected and regularly evaluated in this region and so that the road map is relaunched."
"Europe has always condemned terrorism and violence and has instead favoured political negotiation and international law."
"Even if progress is slow, it is not a pointless exercise to tirelessly repeat what are our commitments in the Middle East."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Alexander for his presence here this afternoon, together with Mr Verheugen, whom I left in plenary last night at 11.47 p.m. and who has covered a lot of ground this part-session in Strasbourg."
"To turn to more serious matters now, in January, the EU High Representative, Mr Solana, spoke to us about a window of opportunities, and better still, an avenue of hope, following a series of developments in the region which included, of course, the election of Mahmoud Abbas as President and his courageous remarks about the demilitarisation of the Intifada."
"What followed did not prove him wrong, as it has just led, as we know, to the disengagement from the Gaza Strip."
"Whatever may be our opinion on this withdrawal, however we may be divided and there is division on this issue we cannot but congratulate the Israeli authorities on the way in which they have carried out this operation; this is a human tragedy for the families concerned, a heartbreaking experience for the soldiers and a crucial test for Israeli society as a whole, which some people are underestimating in a slightly underhand manner."
"An absence of violence, of victims and of civil war, too, is a success story for which the Palestinian Authority can also take credit."
"Mr Abbas has spared no effort to facilitate the operations and, above all, to prevent any terrorist attack during the entire period of disengagement."
"At this point, you will ask me: what must be done?"
"It is a question of turning this military success into a political success, of harnessing this positive energy in order to return to the road map, since the withdrawal from Gaza can only be the start of a process."
"The major challenges awaiting Ariel Sharon as well as Mahmoud Abbas are on a huge scale: an end to the settlements, more substantial withdrawals, particularly on the part of the Israelis, and, of course, for the Palestinian leader the disarmament of the terrorist organisations."
"Following the destruction of a building in Gaza on Monday and the assassination of his security advisor only this morning, Abu Mazen has just demanded scarcely a few hours ago a plan for disarming Hamas in Gaza."
"We must provide him with the means to continue; we are all aware that the battle has begun between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas for control of Gaza and that the EUR 60 million that has just been released – and which the Commissioner has spoken about – will be a vital strategic support for the Palestinian leader."
"We thank the Commission, we rely on it and we will be particularly vigilant, I wish to say, in ensuring that stringent checks are carried out to reassure European taxpayers about how this significant sum of money is to be appropriated."
"‘There is a time to kill, and a time to heal, a time for war and a time for peace’, those are not my words, they are in the Ecclesiastes;"
"I was talking about hope just now, not naïve optimism."
"Yet, we are today experiencing a very special moment in time – , to quote Mr Solana – and we would like to see the parties concerned seize it with our help so as to progress along that road to peace."
"– The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains the question on which peace in the Middle East hinges."
"The Quartet is scheduled to meet on 20 September in order to relaunch the road map."
"How should this be approached?"
"To my mind, the answer is clear: it should be approached resolutely."
"The unilateral pull-out from Gaza has justifiably raised expectations."
"There has been a lull on the part of the armed Palestinian groups and legislative elections are set to take place on 25 January."
"This is a positive scenario, but one based on a particular set of circumstances, and the opportunity could go to waste."
"Europe’s position must therefore be a firm one."
"Some 8 000 settlers have left Gaza as a result of a decision by Israel – a most welcome development."
"Yet this event must not conceal the other side of the coin; between June 2004 and 2005, 12 800 new settlers moved to the West Bank and the President of Parliament in Jerusalem wants to set up another Jewish settlement in the ancient heart of the Arab city."
"This is not the way to go about making peace!"
"The settlers have left Gaza."
"This is terrific news, but the Gaza that has been handed over to the Palestinians urgently requires an airport and the Israeli authorities have an unacceptable veto over this project."
"Gaza has a border with Egypt at Rafa."
"Palestinians and Egyptians could run this border, but Israel insists on maintaining a presence in the area, as though it were another of its checkpoints."
"This must not be allowed to happen, because Gaza must not be a poisoned chalice, a prison that the guards have handed over to the inmates, in which they are not allowed to move around and in which their already fragile economy is rendered unworkable."
"The exit from Gaza is not the end of the story."
"This is the message that should guide the fresh initiatives by the Quartet."
"Peace is possible provided we do not waste this opportunity."
"– Mr President, allow me to start by quoting from the Iranian media: 'Thanks to negotiations with Europe we gained another year in which the Natanz project reached a stage where a small number of centrifuges could operate."
"The UCF in Isfahan is complete and UF4 and UF6 gases are produced."
"We converted 36 tonnes of yellow cake into gas."
"Iran began talks with the WTO."
"Iran was recognised as one of the countries with a nuclear fuel cycle."
"We managed to make far greater progress than North Korea'."
"That was said on Iranian Channel 2 on 4 August by Mr Hussein Mussavian, the head of the Iranian nuclear delegation."
"There is no military option; there is no regime change option."
"Economic sanctions will only create a much larger disaster than the one in Iraq."
"What can we do after Russia's expected refusal of referral to the UNSC?"
"We can only try to strip Iran of international recognition, immediately block its WTO entry, impose tough diplomatic sanctions, exclude it from international sporting, cultural and social events and the Olympic Games."
"Those are the only tools we have."
"As the head of Parliament's Israeli delegation, I wholeheartedly congratulate both the Israeli and Palestinian Governments."
"I also welcome the EU statement on this engagement."
"We promise to monitor daily the use of the EUR 60 million hopefully spent before the Palestinian elections."
"We all support the conditional Syrian association agreement as the last wedge to keep the door open."
"Egypt is the cradle of Middle Eastern politics."
"Clear, tough and immediate pressure for democratic conditions for democratic candidates in democratic elections will be more use than any Iraq-style military intervention."
"Nevertheless, legitimisation of the current process in Iraq is a must if civil war is to be prevented."
"Twelve months from now, the Middle East will be a different region."
"The threats to our security are enormous."
"We have to stop immediately making a distinction between external relations and our internal security, between cutting out the roots of extremism and counter-terrorism."
"Mr President, as we witness the Israeli disengagement from Gaza, completed in one-third of the time planned, with no casualties and with no wave of terror as predicted by some, I reflect on what the critics said when that disengagement was first announced."
"Then they protested."
"Today, with all the qualifications, they celebrated."
"Despite all the difficulties, hope succeeded over cynicism."
"In the wake of these developments, it is the role of the European Union and international community to keep open this moment of hope."
"I welcome the continuing Commission commitment, repeated this afternoon by our colleague Mr Verheugen, to economic reconstruction in the Palestinian territories."
"Gaza represents one of the most scarred and desolate corners of the world."
"The World Bank says that nearly half of the Palestinians there live below the poverty line."
"Freedom from fear must be matched by the freedom to eat and to work."
"That is why I welcome the President-in-Office's commitment this afternoon to work with Israel and the other parties on free movement, to facilitate the movement of 20 000 Gaza residents who work in Israel and to lift the blockages of borders of land, sea and air."
"Gaza cannot be economically viable otherwise."
"As a member of Parliament's Electoral Observer Commission, I agree with colleagues that we have a crucial role to play to ensure that the commitments made by the Palestinian Authority at the London conference on security, democratic reform and good governance are realised."
"However, the critics will continue to remind us that more new settlements have been built this year on the West Bank than were evacuated in the last month, that 8 000 settlers are left but more than 240 000 still remain."
"The differences on the 1967 borders and on the status of Jerusalem are as deeply entrenched today as is that much-disputed security wall."
"We cannot avoid these uncomfortable truths."
"The only hope remains the roadmap, endorsed by the Quartet, by this European Union."
"It is our responsibility to keep that hope and opportunity alive."
"Mr President, I welcome the success of the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza and from the four isolated settlements in the northern West Bank and welcome Mr Sharon's public assurances that these moves form the first stages of the United States-led roadmap to a two-state solution."
"The withdrawal has also been welcomed by the Muslim world as a first phase of a process."
"The significance of this development was displayed last week by the first public talks between the Foreign Ministers of Israel and Pakistan."
"The European Council, under the Presidency of the United Kingdom, must maximise its special relationship with the US to make joint efforts to add to the existing ties with other Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, to name but a few."
"Such political progress will have tremendous significance, not just as regards relations between these two states, but as a stepping stone towards a normalisation of relations between Israel and the whole of the Muslim and Arab world."
"Indeed, it will help in our very own action plan to face head-on the issue of terrorism within our own borders."
"However, worrying messages continue to come out of Israel."
"As recently as July, for example, the Knesset approved Amendment 5 to the Civil Wrongs Law."
"The amendment prohibits Palestinians from suing for damages for injuries sustained as a result of illegal Israeli gunfire; this is in clear violation of basic human rights."
"This week, there is a rare opportunity to begin rectifying these injustices."
"All this exacerbates Israel's persistent defiance of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July, which heavily criticised the illegal separation wall in Eastern Jerusalem."
"Incidentally, mention of the wall was noticeable by its absence from the UK Presidency's ."
"May I remind the Council that the ICJ's opinion articulates obligations incumbent on the whole of the international community to see that any impediment resulting from the construction of the wall to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end."
"Peace cannot be achieved without justice and it is justice for the individual – the men, women and children living this conflict on a daily basis – which is the key to lasting peace."
"It is these individuals' right to self-determination which must be secured."
"The EU, as Israel's principal trading partner, is in a unique position to utilise the human rights clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement and bring pressure to bear on the Israeli Government to comply, specifically with the ICJ opinion, and more generally to ensure that disengagement is followed by credible political process where outstanding claims for justice under international humanitarian law are resolved."
"In conclusion, if the European Council, under the leadership of the UK Presidency, is to play a significant and constructive role in the peace process, it must ensure that concerns of economic and political expediency are not permitted to override the fundamental rights of a people that has suffered enough."
"Mr President, it is now becoming clear to both sides that the use of force will not achieve victory: the Israelis cannot achieve their desired security, the Palestinians cannot achieve their independent state."
"The only process ahead is the political process."
"Political process and armed struggle cannot coexist: it is either one or the other."
"Both sides are now arriving at this conclusion, as demonstrated from the Palestinian side, with the democratic election of President Abbas, the mandate that he has received to negotiate peace and the fact that even Hamas is now slowly entering the democratic process; and from the Israeli side, with the Gaza disengagement, despite formidable opposition and the traumatic experience of the Israelis."
"Now is the time to consolidate these positive developments."
"The Council and the Commission – either through the Quartet or on their own – must discourage, firstly, those Palestinians who may consider that the Gaza disengagement is a result of their Intifada; secondly, those in Israel who may consider that this licenses them to proceed with further settlements or the continuation of the wall and, finally, encourage both sides, so that they avoid actions that strengthen the hands of those on the other side who oppose the peace process."
"Elections will be held in the months ahead in either Palestine or Israel, which is likely to create a sort of vacuum."
"Good management of this vacuum is required so that the momentum for peace is kept alive."
"Mr President, the withdrawal from Gaza was without doubt an historic course of action and will remain of historic significance."
"It will have no lasting effect, though, if we do not endeavour – together with the Palestinians and with Israeli support – to make Gaza a viable region, and if we fail, at the same time, to persuade the Israelis that more needs to be done in the West Bank as well."
"There will not be as many withdrawals as we in this House – and, above all, the Palestinians – would probably like to see, but, as Mr Kasoulides said, this process must continue if it is not to collapse and deny us many of the positive outcomes for which we hope."
"Secondly, I would like to join Mr McMillan-Scott and others in highlighting the importance of our investing in the whole region, especially in the development of democracy and civil society."
"One aspect of the war on terrorism, about which we have had a debate today with Mr Clarke is the need for development in the surrounding region, in particular in the Islamic and Arab world, and for that the right political and financial measures will be needed."
"That is something of which I would like to remind the Presidency: financial resources will, of course, be needed if we are to invest in Gaza and in the region as a whole."
"Making promises and committing oneself to this is one thing, but thought also has to be given to this when planning budgets."
"Finally, I will turn to Iran."
"We are deeply concerned about the way things are going in Iran, but they are a consequence of our toleration of the development of nuclear weapons not only by such countries as Pakistan and India, but also by Israel, and also of our inability to limit their general proliferation."
"Although action on our part is necessary, it has to be taken in consultation with all interested parties if it is to be effective."
"It is because unilateral sanctions will not be effective that this matter must be handed over to the United Nations in order for a common solution to be found."
"I hope that the British Presidency of the Council will go down that road with perceptiveness and clarity of vision."
"Mr President, it is not the small Israeli democracy that is the major threat to peace in the Middle East, but the big dictatorships."
"We now see a development that offers hope, consisting of withdrawals from Gaza, together with small signs of democracy in the Arab world."
"This means that the demands for a European Middle East policy must become much clearer."
"Iran is a country with the express political objective of obliterating one of the UN’s Member States, namely Israel."
"Iran is breaching the Non-Proliferation Agreement by developing mid-range missiles with a view to reaching targets in those countries we are now talking about."
"It expresses the same anti-Semitism expressed by too many regimes and groups in that part of the world."
"It cannot be acceptable to support terrorism, as Iran does."
"If the European Union wishes to be a power in the peace process, it must now support the active forces of democracy and peace."
"The EU must take action against those who do not accept international agreements and who consciously choose the path of violence."
"We must create both support and a structure for democratic development throughout the Middle East."
"There would be no better basis for peaceful and stable development in this part of the world than a breakthrough for democracy."
"We see the many different signs of democratic development."
"The EU must, then, vigorously support those who keep the flame of democracy and freedom alight."
"We must also ensure that the support we give the Palestinian Authority and other countries is combined with clear demands for democratic development."
"We have an opportunity to play a role in the interests of peace but, in that case, we must also show that we can strengthen democracy."
"Mr President, the departure of Israelis from the Gaza Strip and from the four settlements on the West Bank represents a fresh chance for peace in the Middle East and for the conclusion of an agreement between Israel and Palestine."
"It also represents a fresh chance to achieve security for the state of Israel and the creation of a Palestinian state."
"Ariel Sharon’s government should be given due recognition for its decision, as should the majority of the Israeli people for the backing they have lent to the evacuation of the Jewish settlements."
"I should like to take this opportunity to make particular mention of the Israeli people’s support for this process."
"Even though the Israelis are descendants of refugees, they backed the evacuation of 9 000 settlers from Gaza."
"This is proof of their desire for genuine peace with the Palestinian nation, and of the democratic nature of the Israeli state in the Middle East."
"The reaction of the majority of Israelis is also proof that the country is a worthy partner for the European Union in the construction of an international order based on respect for human rights and democracy."
"The fact that Israeli public opinion is in favour of the evacuation, and clearly opposed to anti-Arab attacks, can be taken as evidence that the modern world is not condemned to a clash of civilisations or to the victory of fundamentalist philosophies."
"The European Union should continue to support the steps taken by James Wolfensohn, the envoy of the Madrid Quartet, to coordinate EU funds with those donated by other sponsors, and to ensure that these funds are used as efficiently as possible."
"According to Javier Solana, the European Union could act as the third party in the field of border control and customs checks."
"The Gaza Strip must not descend into terror and anarchy, or turn into a new terrorist bridgehead."
"Europe must do everything in its power to ensure that the evacuation of the Jewish settlements in Gaza results in negotiations."
"The latter should at the very least tackle such problems as the continued withdrawal of Israeli troops, the demarcation of the border and the status of Jerusalem, and they should make it possible to implement the two-state solution."
"Mr President, the Middle East, as ever, remains of great concern."
"But there are also some grounds for optimism, as we witness the first multi-candidate presidential election in Egypt today."
"The ongoing terrorist campaign in Iraq, of course, still poses a serious threat to stability in the region."
"Iraq is about to have its first democratic constitution, which, although lacking support from the Sunni community, as least has on board the Shias and the Kurds, has avoided an Islamic theocracy, and kept women involved in the process."
"October may see a rejection of the constitution by the Sunnis, but they will then have to get involved in the resulting parliamentary elections and the next constitutional draft, or face a fragmentation of Iraq, in which they will eventually lose out."
"Syria must play a more responsible role in apprehending terrorists crossing from its territory into Iraq."
"Iran must stay out of Iraqi affairs."
"Having ended its nine-month freeze on uranium enrichment, it is now on a collision path with the United States and the EU, a case likely to end in the United Nations Security Council, where I hope Russia and China will also support tough, non-proliferation measures or sanctions, if need be."
"Israel is to be commended for its peaceful withdrawal from Gaza, which must now rapidly fall under the control of the Palestinian Authority, although the assassination of Moussa Arafat augurs badly."
"It is understandable that border controls with Egypt will require Israeli and international monitoring for security reasons for some time to come."
"Let us now hope that all the parties can come together to get the roadmap for peace back on the road."
"The Palestinian parliamentary elections in January will, of course, be telling."
"Lebanon, following Syria's withdrawal, seems to be settling after its elections and arrests have now been made in connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, apparently confirming the suspicion of the involvement of the pro-Syrian security forces."
"We all wish the United Nations investigator, Mr Detlev Mehlis, every success in bringing those guilty to justice."
"– Mr President, I should like to take my turn to thank Minister Douglas Alexander and Commissioner Verheugen for their speeches."
"However, I should like to ask them to read the interviews by the Israeli Prime Minister Arial Sharon in the Jerusalem Post, the and the on 22 April 2004, in which the real objectives of the unilateral disengagement of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip are presented."
"Mr Sharon speaks in these interviews about addressing the risk of demographic change in Israel and about addressing the security problems of the Israeli occupying forces."
"Mr Sharon points out that we have merely rid ourselves of problematic settlements while, on the other hand, both the illegal settlements and the construction of the illegal security wall are continuing, in violation of the resolutions of the International Court at The Hague."
"From this point of view, I believe that the declaration by the British Presidency on 25 August is excessively optimistic, as is the declaration by Mr Solana."
"I fear that these declarations do not reflect the harsh reality."
"I believe that the departure of the settlers, in order to be a positive step and a window of opportunity, must be integrated into the framework of the implementation of the roadmap, without any new terms or conditions from the Israeli side."
"Mr Alexander referred to serious problems in the Gaza Strip."
"I would highlight the need to open the airport, to open the port, to reverse the social and economic isolation of Gaza."
"The people there are wretched."
"There is a high rate of unemployment and poverty."
"We, as the European Union, bear a huge responsibility and I believe that we also need to exert pressure within the framework of the Quartet in the direction of the United States for an international peace conference with the participation of Sharon and Abbas."
". Mr President, you have just told one of the honourable Members of this House that you are terribly sorry, but it is time to stop."
"I fear that you may soon be terribly sorry because it is time for me to start the wind-up to this debate."
"Firstly, it has been an important and timely debate for Parliament this afternoon."
"I am genuinely grateful for the insights that have been garnered in our debate that reflect the experience and expertise of Members of this House."
"Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra began by echoing the points made by Commissioner Verheugen, recognising the hopeful signs that have emerged over recent months within the region."
"I can assure him that the Presidency is very aware of the key role that the European Union can play as part of the Quartet in advancing the peace process."
"Let me, however, at this stage reiterate a point that was made by the Commissioner in his introductory remarks in paying tribute not to a European, but to an American, James Wolfensohn, who has already made a tremendous contribution to the work of the Quartet and indeed to the successful withdrawal from Gaza that we have seen in recent days."
"Mrs Napoletano, in stating her abhorrence of terrorism, echoed sentiments that I am sure are felt by all of us in this House."
"That is why we recognise the importance of building on the momentum that has been established in the region in recent months and why I believe that there is a shared determination between the Commission, the Council and this Parliament to take forward that momentum in the weeks and months ahead."
"Ms Malmström recognised the importance of human rights in Iran."
"Let me assure her that we are aware that serious violations of human rights continue to occur within that country."
"The Council is especially concerned about the number of executions of juvenile offenders in recent weeks."
"The European Council is clear that our relations with Iran can only move forward if Iran takes action to address our political concerns in areas such as human rights, which she highlighted in her speech."
"Mr Hammerstein Mintz talked of Gaza representing 'a light of hope'."
"Let us all hope that that is what it proves to be."
"Our challenge now, as I have always made clear, is to continue to advance the peace process."
"Disengagement offers the prospect of Israel withdrawing settlements from Gaza and part of the West Bank for the first time in history."
"This is a real opportunity for progress."
"However, on the specific point made by the honourable Member about Jerusalem, the European Union has continually made its view clear on settlement activity, not just in the West Bank, but also in East Jerusalem."
"We have made clear to the Government of Israel that all settlement activity should be frozen."
"Mr Adamou described withdrawal as a significant step, but recognised the equally significant challenges ahead."
"I would simply reiterate that the long-term objective for the European Commission is assistance to support the creation, as was suggested, of an independent democratic Palestinian state."
"That continues to be one of our key objectives."
"Mr Belder quoted the High Representative, Javier Solana, when he spoke of his concerns regarding the activities of Hamas and Hezbollah."
"I can assure you that the European Union keeps the status of Hamas and Hezbollah under constant review and the European Union stands firm in its policy of not dealing with terrorists."
"Hamas is subject to a European Union asset freeze and European Union officials will not meet members of the Hamas leadership until it recognises Israel's right to exist."
"Mr Mölzer spoke on various points with which I find myself frankly not in agreement, both as regards some of the issues that he focused on and his characterisation of some of the other issues."
"Where we were able to find common ground was on the possibility of the European Union making the advancement of the Middle East peace process one of its objectives in an area where we can make a positive contribution."
"At least on that there was agreement between us."
"Mr McMillan-Scott spoke of both the Egyptian elections – as did Mr Tannock – and also of the words of the Secretary of State of the United States, Condoleezza Rice, at a recent speech at the American University in Cairo."
"I noted with interest the points he made regarding democracy and human rights, later echoed by Mr Hökmark."
"Mrs De Keyser raised the issue of the Israeli barrier."
"The best response I can offer on behalf of the Presidency is to quote directly to her the clear view of the June European Council on this matter: 'The European Council, while recognising the right of Israel to protect its citizens from attacks, remains concerned by the continuing construction of the separation barrier in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is contrary to the provisions of international law.'"
"Mrs Ries spoke of the need to turn the military withdrawal we have seen in recent days into a political success, expressing sentiments reiterated by Mr Portas."
"Of course, that is true."
"I agree that after disengagement, it will be important to ensure that momentum is maintained and that both Israel and the Palestinians focus on implementation of the roadmap."
"It will also be important for the Palestinian Authority to ensure that law and order is maintained in Gaza."
"Conditions on access and on trade must allow economic growth and stability for the Gaza economy, a point made by a number of honourable Members, but equally allow for Israel to have security from militant or terrorist attacks, which is its right."
"Mrs Hybášková raised the issue of Iran and in particular the issue of diplomatic sanctions being applied."
"It is important to remind this House that the IAEA board meets on 19 September."
"The European Union has said that it will support calls for Iran to be reported to the United Nations Security Council at that meeting, but we are discussing the next step with our international partners."
"It is therefore important to await the discussions that will take place first at the IAEA board meeting on 19 September and I would not wish to anticipate those discussions at this time."
"One of my colleagues from the United Kingdom, Mr Howitt, brought his experience as an electoral observer to his contribution to our debate this afternoon."
"He spoke powerfully, I would argue, about what he described, somewhat tactfully, as the uncomfortable truths that endure, even after the recent withdrawal."
"He is right to acknowledge the scale of the challenge faced by the region, as well as the scale of the achievement that has been accomplished."
"He recognised, rightly again, the contribution that we have to make and the responsibility that we bear as a member of the Quartet to make further progress and to sustain hope and banish cynicism, which has been too common in the past."
"Mr Karim raised the issue of the barrier, and I would simply reiterate the point I made in relation to the stated position of the European Council as recently as June."
"I would remind the honourable Member that Article 2 of the European Union-Israel Association Agreement states that: 'Relations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement.'"
"I can assure the honourable Member that where we have concerns about Israeli actions on human rights, we will raise – and have raised – those concerns with the Israeli Government."
"The European Union also uses the opportunity to raise issues of concern, including human rights, at the EU-Israel Association Council."
"We will consider in due course what issues to raise in advance of the EU-Israel Association Council scheduled to be held at the end of our Presidency at the end of this year."
"I listened carefully to Mr Kasoulides and I assure him that we will share the objective of maintaining the momentum for peace in the months ahead."
"Mr Swoboda spoke of the need for a coordinated approach to address the issue of proliferation."
"Although I speak today on behalf of the Presidency rather than the British Government, I would simply point out at this stage, as a serving minister in the British Foreign Office, that to date the E3 process has been a powerful affirmation of that approach, whereby a coordinated approach has been secured across Europe, which has strengthened our hand in the important and difficult discussions that have had to take place directly with Iran in recent months."
"Mr Pinior paid tribute to Israel's step in withdrawing from Gaza and I once again echo that sentiment on behalf of the Presidency."
"As well as discussing the issue of Egypt – of which I have already spoken – Mr Tannock raised the issue of the Constitution for Iraq."
"This is an achievement."
"Indeed, in the official briefing I received in preparation for today's debate, it was suggested that I should tell this august body that constitutions are never the easiest things to write."
"I need hardly make that point to the European Parliament in light of recent events."
"But, to be entirely serious, it is important to recognise how challenging the achievement of a constitution has been in Iraq, against a backdrop of nearly 30 years of tyranny and in the face of ongoing terrorist attacks on innocent people designed specifically to prevent them reaching agreement."
"In a country as diverse as Iraq, surely that is all the more so the case."
"It is important, therefore, that we remember those points, but also that this is an Iraqi Constitution, written by democratically elected Iraqi politicians on behalf of their people."
"It works to balance that country's distinctive traditions – which, frankly, are very different from our own within Europe – with its desire for democracy."
"It is a huge step forward for Iraq and one that should be welcomed."
"On behalf of the Presidency, let me thank all those honourable Members who have participated today, pay tribute to the contribution of the Commission earlier in the debate and express my gratitude for the points raised in what I believe will continue to be an important subject and focus of our work in the remaining months of our Presidency."
"The debate is closed."
"– In this debate on the Middle East situation, we must not overlook the fact that the territory returned to the Palestinian people belongs to them by right and that they have long been fighting for it. We must also try to clarify the real reasons that led Sharon to dismantle the Gaza settlements, when we know that he was chiefly responsible for devising and implementing the policy of the expansion and consolidation of the Israeli occupation, including the settlements and the wall that seeks to annex further territories on the West Bank."
"The first thing to note is that the policy of settling the Gaza Strip was a failure, given the small size of the territory and the massive population density – around 1.3 million people lived in an area measuring just 362 km2."
"This means that the 8 000 Israeli settlers living there (0.6% of the population) occupied 20% of the territory, thereby creating unsustainable demographic tension and pressure, leading to devastating consequences."
"Secondly, Sharon did this, yet continues to maintain the isolation of Gaza, which will remain surrounded – by land, sea and air – by the Israeli army. This will keep it as an enclave within Israel and land links with the West Bank will remain subject to Israeli control."
"The next item is the report (A6-0235/2005) by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on new prospects and new challenges for sustainable European tourism [2004/2229(INI)]."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, during times of economic difficulty we all have a responsibility to seek solutions, and to find ways of promoting progress and development."
"This is the background to our report on the future of sustainable tourism in Europe."
"When we talk about tourism in the EU, we are talking about one of our largest and most competitive industries, one that generates the highest number of jobs and that has the biggest growth potential, even in the context of a Europe suffering from economic slowdown."
"The bottom line, however, is that this is an activity that needs to ensure its sustainability in such a way that it does not destroy, among other things, its environmental resources, its landscape resources and its regional planning."
"We must seek to address one of the biggest difficulties facing the tourist industry in terms of economic efficiency: how can we combat the effects of seasonal variations on jobs and on the quality of services provided?"
"Our report puts forward guidelines and proposals for solving these problems."
"This is a broad overview of an economic sector with massive potential, from which we must try to derive maximum benefit, by promoting synergies, developing cooperation and enjoying the benefits of shared experience."
"At the same time, it should be understood that tourism is first and foremost a sector in which private initiative prevails and in which, on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, policies come mainly from the Member States’ authorities."
"This does not affect the Commission’s role of improving the consistency of its tourism-related measures with the Community policies that feed into it, such as transport, jobs, the environment and the internal market."
"From the point of view of the Lisbon Strategy, tourism is increasingly linked to new technology. It has turned the Internet into much more than merely an outlet for the sale of holidays – rather, it has become a key tool for use in the tourism sector."
"In this context, we must decide how the Community institutions can support the measures taken by the Member States and the industry aimed at developing tourism."
"The way to do this, to my mind, is to take practical steps that can help to improve these measures at European level and can enable us to be proactive in promoting the old continent’s tourist destinations."
"The most symbolic proposal on the table is, without question, that of creating outstanding European tourist destinations, along the lines of the European Capital of Culture concept."
"Also worthy of note is the proposal to set up a Community classification of tourist services, on a voluntary basis and with the industry’s cooperation, to be used in particular for the classification of hotel and restaurant facilities. The purpose of this scheme is to guarantee a more transparent service, and to protect consumers."
"Furthermore, we have proposed a registered designation of origin for non-food craft products."
"We also support the creation and development of the European Tourism Portal to which all national portals will be linked; after all, we must not overlook the enormous benefits that this tool could bring in terms of publicising European destinations."
"In order to meet the need to increase employment, training and skills in the field of tourism, our proposal is to set up a network of specialised training in tourism."
"In the area of security, we have proposed that a contact group be set up with a view to coordinating information on how to manage crises, such as health crises and acts of terrorism, so as to ensure a rapid response in the event of European tourists needing protection and to support tourist operators affected by such events."
"With regard to improving tourist facilities, we have put forward a range of initiatives to improve access for people with reduced mobility and to ensure that those working in tourist services receive special training for this purpose."
"We have stressed the need to implement new tourist activities and infrastructure to cater for the growing demand among the elderly, who, in the coming decades, will account for over 30% of the population of developed countries."
"In terms of business competitiveness, we have highlighted the need to maintain the competitive position of operators established in the EU in relation to third country operators for tax purposes, an issue that, I was pleased to note, was resolved this morning with the vote on the Becsey report."
"Provision has also been made for applying reduced VAT rates for certain services, along the lines of those in place for other services."
"We also endorse the proposal to create a ‘European Union’ tourism mark, characterised by the tremendous social and cultural diversity, high quality services and sustainable tourist projects in the EU, to be promoted via a suitable publicity campaign aimed at potential visitors from third countries."
"Lastly, in the area of transport, we have advocated the importance of investing in quality, by boosting the capacity and improving the accessibility of the various means of transport, by using integrated ticket offices to simplify ticketing systems and by establishing suitable links with air transport, which is the main form of tourist transport."
"Mr President, I should finally like to address the question of Community funding."
"Given that tourism is an essential sector for regional and local development, it should be placed at the forefront of the Structural Funds."
"This break in the talks on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 could and should present us with an opportunity to reintroduce the issue via the creation of a separate budget heading."
"All of this should be done in order to ensure that European regulations are flexible and in line with what is required."
"The work of operators will be made easier and they will be able to continue to offer high quality, sustainable services at an accessible price."
"In a Europe in which private initiative is at the forefront of growth and development, our role as public decision-makers is to support it and to ensure that it is an integral part of a journey that will hopefully be laden with success."
"To conclude, Mr President, I should like to thank all of those people who contributed towards this report with their amendments and their votes in committee, including, of course, Members of the Committee on Regional Development, Culture and Education."
"I hope that the debate that is about to get underway will match the quality of their contributions and the efforts that all of them put in."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to warmly thank Mr Queiró, Mr Costa and many others in this Chamber."
"It is very important that the European Parliament should keep revisiting this issue if it is not to be overshadowed by others in Europe, and that that state of affairs must prevail no longer."
"When I speculate as to which sectors of the European economy might, in the years to come, make an outstanding contribution to growth and the creation of jobs, tourism is the first that springs to mind."
"It is evident to all of us that this is an enormous market, with potential for growth, and that Europe needs to be able to maintain its leading position in it, but there are plenty of problems to contend with."
"We face increasing competition, and foreign tourism is influenced by more and more factors, ranging from the environment to transport problems, not forgetting issues of home security."
"What is called for, then, is an integrated policy of reviewing all the responsibilities and competences that we have in terms of how we can use the options available to us in such a way as to create the ideal conditions for tourism to flourish in Europe."
"As I have said on several occasions, this is a topic to which I attach an extraordinarily high degree of importance."
"Even though tourism is a field in which the Commission’s powers are not great, I do believe that there is much that we can do as part of the European Union’s growth and employment policy – that is to say, as part of the Lisbon Strategy – to support Europe’s tourist areas in their efforts."
"I would also like to point out that the character of tourism will change considerably over the coming decades, particularly in view of population changes in Europe."
"It will have to take far greater account of senior citizens’ mobility needs, pay a great deal more attention to public safety issues and be far more aware of the need to protect our cultural and natural heritage than it has been in the past."
"Tourism, in Europe, is not one sector among many; it has become a factor of people’s quality of life, and we have to take that seriously."
"The Commission is very definitely willing to cooperate with your House in every conceivable way in order to bring about the right sort of change in European tourism."
"I would like, then, to conclude by saying something that may appear rather surprising."
"Europe is the world’s leading tourist region; it is the most attractive tourist destination not only for its own tourists, but also for those from other parts of the world."
"That is capital with which we can work, and the Commission is ready and willing to do so."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate Mr Queiró on the excellent work he has done."
"I am pleased to observe that his report contains the greater part of the recommendations I had addressed to him as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development."
"I do not wish to go back over the difficulties encountered by the tourism sector in Europe and the challenges it has to face, since that has been thoroughly debated in committee, and Mr Queiró presents an altogether clear overview of this issue."
"Furthermore, I believe that we have all understood the role that tourism can play in terms of growth, job creation and sustainable development."
"I would like to look to the future by emphasising three points, which I do not believe can be ignored."
"First, it seems crucial to me that the Commission and the Council should revive the work on the proposal for a directive concerning reduced rates of VAT by also enabling all the Member States to opt for a reduced rate of VAT for costs pertaining to the hotel and catering industries."
"The wide variety of situations within the European Union itself is leading to unfair competition, and that is no longer acceptable."
"Secondly, I believe that it is altogether desirable to encourage the development of new types of sustainable tourism such as agritourism, rambling, bicycle touring, horse riding and so on and to remove the obstacles encountered by certain sections of the community that wish to travel but that experience difficulties in doing so owing to the absence of infrastructures and amenities."
"Mr Queiró and Mr Verheugen have spoken about this."
"I am referring in particular to elderly people and people with disabilities."
"Finally, my third point is that particular attention must be paid to regions suffering from natural and structural disadvantages: I am referring to the outermost regions and the island regions."
"With regard to these regions, we must implement an across-the-board policy, designed to encourage and promote these destinations, the greater part of whose economic activity consists of tourism, and thus encourage the development of an essential transport network servicing these isolated regions."
"The Commission could also provide for greater coherence between actions carried out to promote tourism and other related Community policies."
"I would like to conclude by pointing out that tourism still has no legal basis whatsoever in Community legislation, which is a state of affairs that I deplore."
"Let us hope that the progress contained in the draft Constitution will be resumed very soon indeed."
". Mr President, Parliament’s motion for a resolution on new prospects and new challenges for sustainable European tourism aroused a great deal of interest among the members of the Committee on Culture and Education."
"This was reflected in the opinion the Committee submitted to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which highlighted a number of issues in particular."
"These included the need to focus on the various aspects of sustainable tourism, including economic, cultural, nature-related and social aspects, and the need to acknowledge the importance of seasonal tourism."
"The opinion stressed that the development of tourism should go hand in hand with the protection of national, regional and local culture and with the protection of the natural environment, parks, landscapes, urban structures and architectural sites and buildings."
"It underlined the importance of tourism for economic development, job creation and the maintenance of individual physical and mental health, as well as stressing the need for the proper management of tourist resources."
"It supported the development of agrotourism, particularly in the new Member States, and the education of younger generations in the fields of nature, culture, science and active leisure."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted the majority of these proposals and incorporated them into the final version of the motion for a resolution."
"The end result is a fascinating document that gives due consideration to timeless values such as culture, nature and man’s natural environment, while prioritising organisational and economic issues."
"At the same time, however, the motion for a resolution either makes no reference or fails to give due weight to issues such as special-interest tourism, the protection of historic towns and architectural sites and buildings and the International Cultural Tourism Charter."
"It will be necessary to devote more attention to such issues during future work on the sustainable development of tourism."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will start with the warmest of thanks to Mr Queiró for his report, and for his enthusiasm and commitment to foreign tourism, to which it testifies."
"Commissioner Verheugen quite rightly pointed out that the rapporteur was right to describe tourism as something that can create jobs, for which it has enormous potential, but I would ask him to admit that tourism is a field that the Commission has neglected up to now."
"It is for that reason that I hope that he has read the report’s demands and will later tell us which of them he endorses."
"Let me list five things that are called for: the first is an international advertising campaign to attract more tourists from third states to Europe, one that would have to form part of a support package for tourism and be mounted in consultation with the tourist industry."
"The EU’s embassies overseas can help with this."
"Secondly, in order for consumers to be better protected and informed, there is a need for the classification of hotel and restaurant standards to be standardised across the EU."
"Thirdly, I believe there to be a need for the uniform application of VAT at the reduced rate to restaurant services in all the Member States; this is not something that should be done in different ways in different places."
"Fourthly, national holidays need to be synchronised in order to avoid traffic jams on motorways and overloading of holiday destinations."
"There needs – and this is my fifth point – to be better coordination of emergency plans between state and private organisations at both the national and European levels, to give tourist protection in the event of natural disasters and against health risks."
"Those are just five points that I have picked out of Mr Queiró’s wide-ranging report."
"Fine words butter no parsnips, as they say; it is no use saying that we will promote tourism and that the Commission is right behind the idea if nothing ends up happening, so, Commissioner, perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us something about all the initiatives by the Commission that you intend to support."
"It is you who have the powers, the Commission that can work within the framework of the industrial policy, it is you who can work within the framework of regional policy, and there are many powers and responsibilities that you can combine for the benefit of tourism, so, Commissioner, I ask you to do something about it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank the rapporteur very much for the excellent cooperation that has been established and the good work that has been done."
"Commissioner, my request is the same as the one that Mr Jarzembowski addressed to you just now."
"This own-initiative report has brought to the attention of Parliament and the European institutions the importance of a sector of the economy that is extremely significant, as you yourself have acknowledged, in terms of employment and production of the gross domestic product. It is also now in a position to grow in the wake of enlargement, and it can provide further jobs."
"Questions need to be answered, however, about implementation methods, the legislation to be used, funding, and the commitment of all the European institutions."
"The report states, and I agree with it, that, in addition to what the private sector and the Member States must do, Community intervention must involve promoting integrated and hence sustainable socioeconomic and environmental policies."
"That is the key point, Commissioner, which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would like to highlight."
"Europe must also promote innovation through novel measures."
"In fact, tourism, which has until now been funded indirectly and in various ways by the European Union, has all too often remained merely a way of consuming land."
"Faced with worldwide competition from other holiday destinations at prices that are now competitive, it is no longer enough to use sporadic European funding to alleviate the adverse effects of inept policies and land consumption."
"It is not enough to protect the environment: we have to make a quantum leap and promote a different model of sustainable use that aims at quality."
"Creating a suitable environment for businesses, which falls within Europe’s remit, as also defined in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, is a goal that should be pursued by encouraging the tourist industry to evolve towards making integral use of the country, as a driving force for local development."
"Tourism also requires the strengthening of the internal market, the gradual establishment of equality of treatment among operators, a Community-wide classification of facilities, and harmonised roles and professional profiles."
"We should aim at creating a ‘destination Europe’ that provides added value, promotes the richness of our cultural diversity and helps us to develop a European brand."
"The European portal may be the first – and necessary – measure."
"It is both right and important to finance pilot projects that can become models of good practice, but that requires the identification of a relevant budget line as well as a stronger, more explicit political will."
"Mobility and passenger safety are a necessary condition if our goals of growth, cohesion and convergence are to be met through the tourist industry as well."
"That is why we Socialists have tabled a few amendments that make this need more explicit, and I hope this House will adopt them."
". Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I have no intention of telling you my life story, but as an example of what we are debating here today, I will tell you that during the last decade, that is to say, during the nineties, I administered a metropolitan city of one million inhabitants which was experiencing a great depression and undergoing industrial restructuring."
"As Mayor and President of the Municipal Corporation of the City of Bilbao, I placed a lot of faith in the theories of a respected professor of marketing, Philip Kotler."
"He is the author of several publications, of which my favourite is entitled ."
"In it, Kotler says that a country, region or city that wants to offer its citizens opportunities for progress and well-being must pursue three equally important great objectives, namely to sell the goods it produces to the outside, to attract investments and to attract tourism. Tourism is understood to mean not just leisure tourism, but also business, educational, scientific, sporting, and cultural tourism, for example."
"Today, my city has famously increased its income as a result of the considerable increase in tourism resulting from its urban transformation."
"Bilbao has become a centre for services, trade, business and culture within its industrial hinterland."
"There is no need to remind you of the important contribution of tourism, which provides 4% of the European Union’s GDP, nor of the seven million direct jobs generated by more than two million companies, the vast majority of which are small or medium-sized businesses."
"I would therefore like to say to you that I openly reiterate my support for the proposal to create an adequate budget line within the Union’s budget to support the tourism sector, as well as the other requests or amendments introduced into the original text by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I have in mind the reduced rate of VAT for restaurants, improving the professional training of workers, the introduction of a European classification of tourist services and strengthening the rights of tourists and their protection as consumers."
"But there is one aspect included in the wonderful report by Mr Luis Queiró that I would like to stress."
"I am referring to transport as a necessary support to guarantee the mobility and the journeys of the millions of citizens who make up the base of tourism."
"In particular I would like to draw attention to the trans-European road transport networks. Every summer or holiday period these become jammed with kilometres of tail-backs of thousands of lorries and cars that have to stop repeatedly because of the excessive number of motorway toll points along a particular route."
"We frequently experience one example of this inefficiency at the Viriatu pass between Spain and France, where there are five toll stations within a stretch of 50 kilometres."
". Mr President, scarcely any other sector of the economy is as complex as tourism."
"I now want to concentrate on just one aspect of it, namely sustainability – to which the title of this report refers – and particularly to the dependence of successful and long-term foreign tourism on sustainable transport."
"No other sector of the economy is as dependent on the environment as tourism."
"Beautiful landscapes, well-kept villages, clean air, peace and quiet, good and healthy food, among other things, are the tourist industry’s real capital."
"Tourism and transport are closely connected, but, in many tourist areas, the means of transport are so inappropriate that we are slowly but surely wrecking the foundation of a sustainable economy."
"For example, the perversity of the way in which mass tourism has developed is apparent in many places from the gridlock that occurs on Saturdays in high season as tourists all arrive and depart at the same time."
"This report endorses the idea of further development of air travel, which is the worst form of transport from the point of view of energy consumption and damage to the climate."
"The second worst is the use of private motor vehicles."
"Railways, once much-loved, which played a substantial part in the first flourishing of tourism in the Alps some 100 years ago, are now generally forgotten, neglected and put at a disadvantage."
"If you are a tourist and want to go on holiday using public transport, it is an unfortunate fact that you will often find that, in many of the regions you want to visit, it is quite impossible to be properly mobile without a motor car."
"The main causes of this are the inadequacy of the public local transport on offer and the failure of many railway operators to make sufficient information and booking facilities available."
"If we really do want to promote sustainable tourism the length and breadth of Europe, we should give far greater prominence to these ecological considerations."
". – Mr President, an effort is being made to use an insipid wish-list about the development of tourism and environmental protection in order to bring tourism more into line with the anti-working class Lisbon Strategy."
"In a bid to increase profitability, the concentration of capital is being promoted through capitalist restructurings, public private partnerships, the selling off of the nation's wealth to tourist business groups and the exploitation by private capital of cultural and architectural heritage everywhere."
"Worse conditions are also being created for the workers in the tourism sector, which already has more than its share of problems due to seasonality and the unaccountability which prevails with the introduction of even more flexible forms of work."
"Nor could a policy which directly concerns the workers be devoid of an effort to make use of it to shape a European conscience predicated on the anti-communism which tourism is also expected to embody."
"The anti-working class policy of the European Union and of the governments in the Member States deprives workers and the working–class from taking holidays."
"This social need urgently needs to be satisfied and the workers will fight to achieve this."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Queiró, on compiling this comprehensive and detailed report, which I welcome."
"I believe that the development of European tourism is inextricably linked to the development of transport and infrastructure across the EU."
"As many of my colleagues have mentioned, tourism is a very important industry."
"Affordable travel has enabled us to move around more freely for business and pleasure."
"Air travel in particular has become cheaper and more convenient for everyone."
"However, small regional airports are finding it more difficult to compete with larger international airports and as a result there has been an imbalance in the regional development of tourism."
"This needs to be addressed."
"This imbalance is very clear in my own country, Ireland, and I would like to dwell on that for a minute, if I may."
"As an island, we are very dependent on air travel for both tourism and business and, as one of the most open economies in Europe, we have, over the past decade, reaped the benefits of liberalisation of EU regulations regarding air services."
"The low-cost model of air travel has been a huge success."
"More and more flights and lower air fares have improved Ireland's attractiveness as a holiday destination and Irish tourism is performing very well."
"In 2005 we saw a 4% growth rate in overseas visitor numbers."
"However, this increase in visitor numbers is masking an underlying trend, a striking regional imbalance."
"Figures show that visitor growth is concentrated mainly on the east coast of Ireland around the capital, Dublin."
"The north-west, the west and the Shannon regions are displaying the weakest growth."
"These regions have very major tourist potential, but they suffer because of lack of comparable access."
"The west, and north-west in particular, have long been at a distinct disadvantage, due to the limited number of flights and destinations available from the regional airports."
"Aer Lingus, the national carrier, does not serve any European destination except the UK from regional airports."
"Not only does this cause problems for commuters and tourists in reaching the west and north-west, it also makes it very difficult to access those regions."
"I would like any policy on tourism to try and address this question, because balanced regional development has been a priority in EU policy and I have always believed that this should also be linked to tourism policy."
"In that regard, I welcome the recent decision by Commissioner Barrot to introduce new guidelines laying down conditions under which start-up aid can be granted to airlines in regional airports."
"Mr President, the touristic landscape has undergone massive change over recent years, and Europe has been no exception."
"Competitors have bargains to offer, traditional holiday periods and habits are changing, and, not least, new trends are becoming evident."
"It follows that our own countries, far from being able to rest upon the laurels they won in the past, must go down roads that are new and innovative for Europe."
"Tourism is still, in many places, highly dependent on the general climate and day-to-day weather conditions."
"Although many sectors will therefore have suffered from the present continual rain, it may well be that the wellness sector, spas, and urban tourism have benefited from the bad weather."
"If Europe is to remain attractive as a holiday destination, there is a need for both high-quality products such as the wellness sector can generally offer, and also more alternatives for the periods of bad weather that are occurring more frequently."
"Developing such new schemes as conservation holidays in areas of outstanding natural beauty, all-in deals for cyclists or cultural tourists would certainly be worthwhile."
"What matters overall, though, where tourism is concerned, is that it should make good use of Europe’s natural landscapes and their cultural identity while at the same time protecting them."
"– Thank you Mr President, I would like to speak about the cruise liners sector, for which reference was made in the opinion of Margie Sudre on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development."
"Mr President, I shall not dwell on the importance of this sector for ports, maritime regions and islands in Europe, I think that the importance of this sector for tourism, employment and for the generation of economic activity is clear enough."
"However it seems that this sector is not being recognised enough in the laws that we are enacting."
"Indeed, instead of giving it due incentives sometimes we are almost encouraging it to leave Europe."
"Let me explain – for example in the sector of taxation such as VAT and Excise, the rules which we have, are difficult to apply to the cruise liners industry and are creating serious difficulties."
"I am referring both to the existing regulations as well as for the Commission’s new proposals regarding changes in the VAT regime."
"For example, if you are on a cruise and you are served from the ship restaurant, you pay VAT according to the country from where you left – this means that passengers pay different VAT rates on a cruise, according to the country from which they boarded the ship, and the company which manages the ship has to administer different tax rates according to where the passengers have boarded the ship."
"This is just one example, however, it is ironic that there is actually an incentive to avoid these problems."
"If the ship makes use of a port of a country which is not a member of the European Union, then the entire voyage becomes automatically duty free, without taxes and without the administrative burden to collect taxes."
"Therefore, instead of having incentives making it attractive for the cruise liners industry to stay in European ports, as we should have, we are almost encouraging it to leave Europe."
"I have no doubt that this is not the policy of the European Union and this was not the intention of the legislator, however we must admit that these anomalies exist and we must remove them."
"Thus my appeal to Commissioner Verheugen is, to address these anomalies, to give more attention to the cruise liner industry and to entice it to keep investing and growing in the countries of the European Union."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his magnificent work, his generosity and his willingness to incorporate everybody’s opinions. He also deserves to be commended on his enthusiasm for dealing with an issue such as European tourism, which although it is one of the Union’s most dynamic and expanding economic sectors, always seems to be the poor relation of European policies."
"Commissioner, we therefore need these framework conditions as soon as possible. We need an overall policy that helps to make the wealth and special characteristics of the European historical and tourist heritage more visible."
"Such a policy must offer an excellent base both for strengthening European identity and cohesion, and for publicising our potential, our European model, outside the Union. To this end, we have proposed creating a ‘European Union’ tourism mark or destination, to be characterised by the enormous diversity, high social quality and sustainability of the tourism it offers."
"Furthermore, we believe that it is important to support the growing medical and thermal tourism sector."
"It has significant needs and benefits, but requires sufficient provision and a suitable framework."
"We also think measures are required to strengthen the personal security of tourists, and protect both European tourists outside of the Union from risks such as prison or kidnapping, and tourists facing risks within the Union. This could be achieved by means of obligatory assistance insurance, which is called for."
"In addition, we are in favour of measures to promote itinerant tourism with caravans and camper vans, as a good example of more sustainable and less over-crowded tourism; and we are in favour of implementing actions to provide access for people with reduced mobility to tourist establishments and services."
"Facilities of this nature should be publicised sufficiently, because they often are not."
"Finally, I would like once again to urge the European Commission, and Commissioner Verheugen in particular, to explore and study existing and new formulae for dealing with the local and regional imbalances resulting from seasonal concentration in the countries of the south, such as mine."
"In that case, approaches or measures such as the moratorium or even ecotaxes, which are normal in the north of Europe, in your own country, on the beaches of the Baltic, could also be applied in the south."
"Mr President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Queiró on an excellent piece of work."
"Tourism is one of the fastest-growing industries in the European Union."
"In Ireland alone, tourism revenue in 2004 amounted to EUR 5 billion and it accounted for 3.9 % of GNP."
"From my own perspective, I am particularly interested in the promotion of sustainable tourism, for a number of reasons."
"First of all, tourism is an indigenous industry – it does not rely on inward investment – and it is not a mobile industry in the sense that there is no off-shoring or outsourcing of jobs."
"Furthermore, it is a labour-intensive industry and, as such, provides employment for a wide range of people."
"Therefore, it is fully deserving of support from the Commission and a budget line should be set up to promote the tourism sector."
"Tourism has the capacity to provide employment and generate economic activity in its own region and for its own region."
"This is of particular importance in rural areas, where numbers are declining in the traditional activities of agriculture and fishing."
"I welcome the comments of the rapporteur emphasising the need to develop farm holidays."
"With regard to rural tourism, there is a need to link projects together for the purposes of marketing and promotion in order to create a critical mass, and it is essential to decentralise tourism functions to the regions."
"The question of access by air, road and rail to the more rural areas is also vital, as the trend is for shorter holidays."
"That means that tourists will not spend two days of a four- or five-day break travelling to and from their destination."
"This is of particular importance in my region in the north west of Ireland."
"The short tourist season is a real concern, with the need to spread the demand outside the high season and promote tourism products for different tastes, different interests, different seasons and different age groups."
"I welcome the proposal to introduce a Community-wide classification of hotel facilities and the promotion at EU level of voluntary standards concerning measures to improve safety aspects in hotels and tourist services in general."
"Finally, having met a group of disabled people from Ireland yesterday and today on their Freedom Drive in Strasbourg, I was pleased to note that the rapporteur has invited the Commission to put forward an initiative to make tourism and leisure establishments accessible to people with reduced mobility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Queiró for including the ‘Iron Curtain Trail’ in his report."
"The Iron Curtain divided Europe for decades, and the trail will remind future generations of how this continent was divided and of how that division was brought to an end."
"The project already involves twelve EU Member States."
"The German Parliament has already voted unanimously in favour of preserving the border that ran along 1 400 km through Germany and of opening it up to environmentally-friendly tourism."
"This stretch of green runs from the Arctic in the north to the Black Sea in the south, numbers Mikhail Gorbachev among its patrons, and is a suitable means of promoting a European sense of identity."
"I rejoice at the widespread support for it in this House and hope that the Member States will now waste no time in joining with the Commission to complete it."
"It will be, in the truest sense of the word, an experience of European history, politics and culture."
"– In line with the subsidiarity principle, the responsibility for tourism lies with the Member States. That is how it should continue to be."
"Tourism should develop on a sustainable basis. It should contribute to balanced regional planning without damaging the environment, promote and derive greater benefit from cultural diversity and historical heritage, and encourage regional and local authorities, stakeholders and populations to become involved."
"If we are to meet the pressing need to combat the growing problem of precarious work and exploitation affecting workers in the sector, work must be appreciated, decent wages must be paid, the security and stability of working arrangements must be guaranteed and vocational training must be provided."
"We object to certain aspects of the report before us, and feel that other areas have not been given due prominence."
"We therefore tabled amendments aimed at reaffirming tourism’s role in economic and social cohesion, its connection with the reality on the ground, the need to guarantee high-quality jobs and the importance of preserving cultural heritage."
"We feel that the absence of a specific legal basis in the Treaties has not stopped specific measures and programmes geared towards promoting tourism at Community level in the past."
"Hence our proposal to create a Community programme for the sector, to complement the measures put in place by the Member States."
"Tourism is an important sector with huge potential which can offer added value to a country and fully develop its production capacities."
"Since I have long dealt with the issues of tourism, I appreciate Mr Queiró’s initiative."
"The proposal aptly illustrates the multi-faceted nature of tourism and the need to coordinate it at European level."
"The development of this sector of the economy stimulates not only the catering, hotel and transport services, but in the long run also innovation, culture, art and agriculture."
"This knock-on effect will undoubtedly boost the stagnating economic growth, speed up the progression of national economies towards becoming service economies, and reduce high levels of unemployment that afflict many European countries."
"The development of special types of tourism such as rural, spa or congress tourism would make it possible to overcome certain negative aspects of the industry, especially its seasonal nature."
"Well-known tourist destinations are often situated on the borderline between two or three Member States, and supporting tourism at the European level would thus also encourage the development of border regions that are often marginalized."
"I am of the view that it is not necessary to develop a new financial facility to this end, but simply to coordinate the existing ones."
"An additional task for the EU would be to improve the publicity for the areas that are visited less frequently."
"Besides the economic and social aspects, the cultural aspect is not negligible, either."
"Getting to know Europe’s cultural heritage will increase the awareness of history and help build a common European identity."
"It clearly follows from this report that tourism has a huge potential."
"For this reason, Europe should respond as quickly as possible and utilise this potential for its own benefit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague and friend Mr Leichtfried has unexpectedly had to go back to Austria, I will take this opportunity of airing a number of his ideas in this Chamber."
"It is heartening that this excellent report shows the European Union concerning itself with the issue of tourism and stressing its enormous importance in terms of growth and employment."
"Europe is the most important tourist destination in the world."
"The tourist sector in Europe can take the credit for creating over 7 million jobs and is among the sectors offering the greatest potential for the creation of new jobs in the future."
"The tourist industry is one sector of the economy in which services are generally rendered directly by workers themselves, and this makes it less entrepreneurial in character."
"It is for precisely this reason that it is necessary to focus more on the promotion of training for workers in this sector, while also paying attention to the conditions under which services are provided."
"It is now the case that there are regions in Europe where workers are recruited from far away because local people no longer feel themselves able to provide these services under the conditions offered to them."
"Here, too, there is a task for the European Union."
"As Mr Leichtfried himself has repeatedly said, it is encouraging that the issue of coordination in matters of holiday arrangements and of European monitoring of it has been taken up in this report."
"National and regional holidays need to be properly coordinated by the European Union."
"We know what that would mean in terms of the strain placed on our infrastructure and in terms of the services that could be offered."
"The rapporteur did very well to incorporate this idea, which merits our wholehearted support."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the thorough and thoughtful approach that Parliament has at last developed on the major topic of tourism."
"The structure of the Queiró report is excellent – I therefore congratulate the rapporteur – and I agree with the need to stand up to international competition by concentrating on efficient, quality services and better promotion of Europe’s tourist destinations."
"I personally believe it is essential to strengthen our commitment in the area of training tourism professionals, in order to offer genuine career prospects to operators in the sector, reduce the adverse effects of the instability of the seasonal workforce and guarantee services in tune with the new demands of consumers."
"In that respect, I have tabled some amendments, which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has accepted, in which I propose the creation of a tailor-made training network for tourism skills within Community programmes that are already in operation, such as Erasmus, for instance."
"In addition, I suggest we take further measures, seeking to gradually harmonise tax rates on tourism operators’ profit margins;"
"I also believe that targeted training for operators who receive and take care of elderly tourists and tourists with disabilities is necessary and should be mandatory, so as to guarantee equal rights for those user groups, who are increasingly inclined to take holidays."
"Lastly, I consider it indispensable to standardise the assessment criteria to be used in classifying hotel facilities and in harmonising professional profiles in tourism."
"I believe that today Parliament is marking an important turning point, in that the approach and the attention devoted to the major topic that is tourism will no longer be episodic, but constant and commensurate."
"Mr President, I will be no exception in this debate in offering my own congratulations to our rapporteur and indeed the shadow rapporteurs."
"They have all worked very hard to produce this excellent piece of work."
"I rise briefly to offer you some Scottish experience, particularly in relation to paragraph 36 on the need for eco-labelling in sustainable tourism."
"In Scotland we have been operating such a scheme for some years now."
"The Green Tourism Business Scheme is operated on behalf of Visit Scotland by a commercial – though not-for-profit – company."
"It promotes sustainability, provides practical advice to businesses and provides a level playing field, a certification to ensure consistent quality among its 500 member businesses, all of which are good-quality tourist attractions."
"I believe it is a model that would work very well when rolled out to other countries across Europe."
"I believe it has much to commend it."
"A tourist industry focused on sustainability will focus automatically on quality, which is ultimately what the consumer in this modern age demands."
"In Scotland we have had some success in this, although we also have some lessons to learn from it."
"This report provides a framework for the sharing of best practice and it has our full support."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my appreciation to Mr Queiró for the excellent work he has done."
"Tourism is a fundamental activity for my country, Italy, and especially so for my city, Rome."
"That is why his report is of particular interest to me."
"Tourism is an essential resource for creating strong growth in employment at a time of serious economic downturn."
"Europe has a natural vocation to be a tourist destination, not only because we are the richest continent in history, art and culture, but also because of our approach to tourism, which favours quality and respect for the environment and countryside: travel as a form of cultural enrichment."
"For the sake of brevity, I should like to mention two reasons why I consider that tourism can no longer be thought of as a policy that falls exclusively within the competence of the Member States, and that a European policy needs to be developed instead."
"First, tourism needs to be promoted within Europe as a form of exchange and a way of getting to know each other; secondly, economic stagnation and international challenges force us to think of tourism in global terms."
"We have to attract the new demand from China, Brazil and India, by proposing an integrated product and promoting the whole of Europe as a destination."
"We cannot afford to waste this opportunity, in a sector in which we have the greatest potential for growth, development and employment."
"This report offers a number of ideas around which intelligent proposals can be drawn up: tourist destinations of excellence, cutting VAT rates for operators, and promoting agrotourism, a very Italian form of rural tourism to encourage farmers not to leave the countryside and to promote traditional produce."
"In the light of recent tragic accidents, I should like to finish by pointing out that Europe needs to guarantee the safety of its tourists."
"In that respect, Parliament must adopt the blacklist regulation as soon as possible, as well as all the measures needed to be able to act swiftly to manage crises, as in the case of the attacks in recent months."
"The aims set out in the report are ambitious and innovative. Therefore, Commissioner, we call for careful attention and adequate financial support for an industry that is of vital importance for the whole of Europe."
"Mr President, as we all know, tourism can contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon Objectives."
"Europe is the world's favourite tourist destination, but with the emergence of new competitors, as has already been mentioned, we can maintain this situation only by creating better tourist facilities, higher quality services and information, and a high level of consumer protection and safety."
"This requires cooperation between the public and private sectors."
"Coming from a new Member State, I emphasise that all of us benefit from enlargement in the field of tourism, so future enlargements would give a further boost to the sector's economic weight and its importance to European growth."
"As Vice-Chairwoman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I am sure that the growth of tourism will lead to more opportunities, prospects and appropriate working conditions for female employees, who represent the majority of the sector's workers, as well as businesswomen in tourism and, most importantly, to more jobs for women."
"In developing tourism, we must not forget the socially vulnerable groups and people with disabilities, representing more than 10 million Europeans."
"I welcome the initiative to make tourist and leisure establishments, facilities, services and itineraries accessible to people with reduced mobility and disability."
"I stress that this is a great challenge for the new Member States, which will have to overcome huge disadvantages in this sector."
"Tourism still does not receive the attention it should in the EU."
"There is no tourism website on the EU portal and Eurostat publishes only a few tourism statistics."
"I therefore recommend that we have a 'European Year of Tourism', which would be accompanied by a wide range of events and programmes to highlight the social and economic importance of tourism."
"Experience of Member States' practices in this area is important and increased cooperation between Member States on best practice could be useful."
"Mr President, please believe that as a Spaniard and as a Valencian, I was extremely apprehensive about this report."
"I shall begin by saying that all my fears have been allayed by my colleague Mr Queiró’s report, and I shall therefore restrict myself to reiterating certain ideas, emphasising others and adding some new ones."
"The report starts by stressing the importance of tourism from the cultural and economic points of view."
"From a cultural perspective, and given that we have referred to our own personal experiences, I believe that the transition from dictatorship to democracy in my country was possible because we wanted to be like the other Europeans, and we knew what Europeans were like because of the phenomenon of tourism."
"In addition, thanks to the phenomenon of tourism, Spain was able to begin to leave behind poverty and take off towards a new economic horizon."
"This would have justified more emphatic treatment in the Treaties, something that did not happen."
"Since then, however, new developments have taken place, such as the increase in travel, in new technologies, in life expectancy and in incomes, all of which favour tourism amongst senior citizens. I would also like to say at this point that I entirely support the proposal Mr Yáñez will make in this field."
"I know he has not spoken yet, but he has been kind enough to tell me about it in advance — pure intelligence is what is required."
"It has to be recognised that the increase in tourism has caused certain problems in terms of sustainability, ecological balance, physical security, food safety, legal security in the field of delays, non-compliance with contracts, time-sharing and competitiveness. All of these have been emphasised here."
"At this point I would like once again to stress the importance of the issue of value added tax in the special system for travel agencies and the reduced rate, to which Mrs Sudre has referred."
"Commissioner, I would like to raise something new which is not in the report, namely compensation from the states of origin to the host states for health services provided by the latter."
"I believe this to be an extremely important issue."
"I shall end by congratulating my colleague from the bottom of my heart on his wonderful work. I take my hat off to you, Mr Queiró."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report."
"Sustainable European tourism can and must help to maintain high and stable levels of economic growth, especially in tourist regions, where it is the basic pillar of economic and social viability."
"The tourist industry, which mainly attracts women and young people, substantially strengthens the employment sector and is in keeping with the philosophy behind the Lisbon Strategy."
"However, these are highly critical times for the development of tourism on a global scale and this also directly affects our employment policies and competition in the industry, in which thousands of small and medium-sized businesses trade."
"Despite the fact that tourism policy falls within the competence of the Member States, the importance of this industry at European level is such that provision needs to be made for a financial heading in the Community budget."
"At the same time, better coordination is needed between the Member States so that we are ready and able to effectively meet the new challenges thrown up by changes in tourist trends and by economic and social changes at European and international level."
"The basic precondition when designing any tourism policy is an in-depth knowledge of peculiarities and problems at local level."
"In order to achieve this, we need to use scientific tools and methods, invest in research and development and create a European network of regional tourism monitoring centres to coordinate and transfer technical know-how."
"The response by European tourism to the current competitive challenge must include as a matter of priority competitive tourist businesses which will provide quality services, will not have an impact on the environment and will not change the local culture."
"European tourism must respond in a responsible manner, placing the emphasis on the Union's economic and cultural values."
"Mr President, the first point I should like to make is an obvious one, namely that tourism is not directly regulated under EU legislation."
"My second point is one that emerges quite clearly from the Queiró report, namely that we must not sideline, or even disregard entirely, such an important aspect of social, cultural and economic life."
"Many arguments have been put forward during today’s debate in favour of this approach, and I should like to add one more, which in my opinion is of no little significance."
"Tourism is also a form of interpersonal communication, since tourists not only visit monuments and tourist attractions, but also, and above all, meet new people they had not previously known."
"Any earlier prejudices, negative stereotypes or memories of unfortunate historic events fade away and disappear during the course of such meetings, and in fact personal contact with other people is the only way to change such attitudes."
"People who communicate with one another stop being strangers, which is a crucial lesson for the enlarged European Union, and in particular for young people."
"I therefore propose that the Socrates and Erasmus programmes be taken as models for the development of tourism schemes for young people."
"We should provide them with the opportunity to get to know the whole of Europe, from Spain to Estonia and from Sweden to Malta and Cyprus."
"This would promote a much greater degree of mutual understanding than has been the case to date."
"I believe that serious work should be put into schemes of this kind, and that neither time nor money should be spared on them."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Queiró on his outstanding work and to thank him for being amenable to accepting contributions from various Members of the House."
"As I come from Portugal, and from a region, the Autonomous Region of Madeira, in which tourism is one of the main tools for development, it stands to reason that I have a vested interest in supporting this report. I shall now mention some of the reasons behind my support and my proposals."
"In light of its importance at European, national and regional level, of the jobs that it sustains and of the number of businesses, the new technology and the innovation that it fosters, tourism can be considered as one of the areas in which the Lisbon Strategy can be taken forward."
"Tourism is also a means of diversifying the economy and of developing rural areas and regions with natural or demographic disadvantages, such as the outermost regions, remote or mountainous regions, and the most northerly, sparsely populated regions."
"The EU is the most popular tourist destination in the world and yet EU citizens visit tourist destinations outside the Union in the greatest numbers."
"Although tourism remains under the competence of the Member States and their regional and local authorities, it should, however, be subject to EU guidelines, policies and measures."
"The Union should support, coordinate and complement the Member States."
"There should be greater integration and cohesion amongst the actions of Member States and the Union in relation to tourism."
"In order for it to assume its responsibilities as regards tourism, I would suggest that the Commission confer on the Union more effective structures and adequate financial resources in the financial perspective, in order to promote Europe as a destination, and to set up mechanisms designed to foster greater cooperation and exchange of information between the Union’s structures, the Member States and the regions."
"Tourism should remain within European-level parameters whereby environmental protection, regional planning, the training of the work force and cultural traditions are guaranteed if all those responsible carry out their functions."
"In the area of the security and the rights of tourists, we feel that take particular account should be taken of ..."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by thanking my colleague Mr Queiró most warmly for his innovative report."
"I am from southern Baden, in the centre of which is the Black Forest and where many important jobs do indeed depend on foreign tourists; this is particularly the case in rural areas, which are doing a successful job of moving from agriculture to the service economy."
"I do believe, though, that there are many areas in which we do not necessarily need European rules and regulations, and, unlike many Members, I certainly do not propose to urge you, Commissioner Verheugen, to plan further regulations in this one."
"What tourists in Europe need most of all are railways and roads that work."
"I do not doubt that they also need airlines, even though some other Members of this House seem less than pleased with that idea."
"If we attempt to tackle the synchronisation of holiday arrangements, then we must make the attempt – which we did not do in relation to the sunshine directive, that was made slightly weaker this morning – to make it clear, in the long term and very politely, to the Member States that the directive was conceived in consultation with the interested parties and is not to be seen as something forced upon them by Europe."
"Something else that I believe will be of vital importance to Europe is the question of how the safety of facilities for tourists in Europe may be guaranteed."
"We have all heard from people who have had adverse experiences in them, and nine of the ten victims of the fatal accident in Sölden in the Tyrol came from my electoral district."
"It seems likely that tourism in Europe will suffer more as a result of accidents like that happening more frequently than from this or that part of the directive not being transposed."
"Hence my appeal to you, Commissioner, in the hope that we may be able to take such action in relation to safety as the European Union is able to take, and, moreover, may encourage diversity in European tourism, for therein lies its strength."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Queiró warmly on his wonderful report, and I would like to say to the Commissioner: ‘Günter, look at paragraph 28 of the report in which we call on the Commission to produce a tourism programme for senior citizens during the low season, to be known as ’Ulysses’."
"This programme has existed in Spain for 20 years."
"I am referring to the IMSERSO holidays."
"Find out about them via your services, because they have been a spectacular success’."
"The fourth involves promoting European citizenship, as in the case of the SOCRATES or ERASMUS programmes amongst young people. The fifth objective has to do with all this not being an expense but rather an investment, because the Spanish experience demonstrates that the returns exceed the sum budgeted annually by the government by 1.8%."
"We named the programme ‘Ulysses’ after the great traveller from Ithaca, but if you like, Commissioner, if it would please you, we will call it the ‘Günter’ Programme."
"Mr President, I would like to make three points."
"First of all, I think this is a very important area."
"I come from Finland, so I do not want to make this into a commercial for a mobile phone company, but it is the best way of connecting people."
"Karl Deutsch talked about it in the 1930s."
"It is a way of crossing borders: if you go to the Algarve, you fall in love with Portugal; if you go to the Marche, you fall in love with Italy; if you go to the Costa del Sol, you might fall in love with Spain, and if you go to Provence, you fall in love with France."
"It is as simple as that."
"On top of that, we get growth, GDP; 4% of GDP stems from our tourist industry, with six million people employed and two million SMEs in the sector, so it is a very important and, in many ways, a key area."
"Secondly, it is also an area of growth."
"There is real growth potential in the services sector."
"In that sense, it is an important part of the Lisbon process."
"We have an ageing population, a population with more money and more time, a population with more time to travel."
"All of that is good."
"Thirdly, I support the report that has been produced by my colleague."
"It is an excellent report."
"One thing I find unfortunate, but the rapporteur could not do anything about it, is that we did not get tourism into the treaty, because the Constitution has not yet entered into force, but I think the system of classification in the report is good."
"Finally, I hope that Mr Berlusconi and Mr Chirac read this report and become inspired to travel around Europe and taste different kinds of food."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since May 1 of last year the flow of tourists into the 10 new Member States has shown an impressive increase."
"This implies additional budget revenue generation and possibilities to explore and get to know the lesser-known States on the tourist maps, but on the other hand, it poses new challenges."
"In our countries we are lucky to have the opportunity to draw upon the experience of the older EU Member States and thus avoid repeating their mistakes."
"The growing tourist influx into Central Europe is expected to alleviate the pressure upon the EU regions currently suffocating from the over-abundant flow of tourists."
"The tourism infrastructure in the new Member States is still lagging behind that of the old ones, which therefore offers tempting new investment opportunities."
"There are abundant untouched natural resources in the Central European States, including Lithuania."
"Sustainable tourism is meant to preserve and protect nature, as well as the landscape, urban and rural infrastructure."
"Specifically promising areas in Lithuania appear to be rural, cultural, sport and medicinal tourism."
"Due to their low prices, these countries are attractive to young people, although the elderly also willingly come to Lithuania because of the healthy local climate."
"Tourists show interest in history, but the tragic, historically significant and even complicated events of recent decades should not be trivialized or presented in a Disneyland or kitsch style."
"The revision of the Sixth Tax directive with a view to introducing tax relief for incoming tourism is essential for all Member States of the European Union, and the new members in particular."
"By reforming the tourism industry, the EU is promoting economic growth and mutual understanding."
"This will also make a significant contribution toward the elimination of demarcation lines that have continued to divide Europe."
"Mr President, tourism is a journey and a voyage."
"In the past, voyagers were people who went out into the world in order to discover more about it, to learn something and to return home with new experiences and skills."
"During their travels across Europe, they also paid visits to the universities."
"This led to the emergence of a European identity, an awareness of European values and a Europe of universities, cathedrals and superb artists and craftsmen."
"Tourism nowadays has changed into the pursuit of instant pleasure."
"I still have frequent occasion to quote the slogan of the French Ski Schools, which says that ‘pleasure has to be learnt’."
"It is only when we make an effort to gain new skills or knowledge that we appreciate them."
"Unfortunately, modern tourism is very much like visiting a Europe-wide chain of supermarkets that all subscribe to the same principles, namely to be cheap, easily accessible and preferably identical in the majority of cases."
"People now travel at lightning speed."
"We have less and less time, and so we devour one tourist attraction after another."
"The tourist industry is adapting to this phenomenon by selling as many colour pictures as possible of the sea, the mountains and the swimming pools."
"The phrase ‘tourism creates jobs’ is repeated like a mantra, but the cost of such jobs is frequently the mindless breaking of visitor number records."
"The resort or attraction boasting the highest number of visitors is considered to be the best."
"This report is important because Europe must promote high-quality tourism and tackle the challenge of mass tourism."
"This is especially true because Europe is now lending its backing to the development of regional airports and cheap airlines."
"The words ‘travel’ and ‘voyage’ should regain their original meanings."
"Educational programmes must be put in place with a view to protecting the natural environment and historical heritage, and new initiatives are needed to promote sustainable tourism."
"We should not forget that love of world heritage, nature and the non-material stems from knowledge of the values of the world that surround us, or in other words from our own ‘small fatherlands’."
"Mr President, I would like to support Mr Yáñez’s proposal and stress what I believe to be one of the most interesting contributions made in this report, the proposal to create the ‘Ulysses’ programme."
"This is a very positive measure, not only because of what it means in terms of improving the quality of life of senior citizens, but also because of the benefits it may provide for areas of dense tourism, such as the Balearic Islands, the part of Spain from which I originate."
"To be able to extend tourist activity beyond the high season means more and better employment for these areas, and diversifies the tourism on offer, since it enables them to receive not just sun and sand tourists but also cultural and environmental ones."
"Mr Verheugen, it is very important that in line with the notion of sustainable tourism that is respectful of the land and of the environment and is described in this report, the Commission should promote actions obliging the authorities in tourist areas such as mine to ensure their actions comply with the principles laid out in the document we are discussing."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, today's debate on the future of sustainable tourism in the European Union is proving to be highly important and interesting."
"It is being held towards the end of the summer tourist season, of which we all have our personal experiences, and it is being held for the first time after the recent accession of ten new Member States to the European Union, which they enhance with their exceptional tourist destinations."
"In addition, with Mr Queiró's report, this is the first time that the multifaceted nature of economic activity in tourism has been presented, together with its repercussions throughout the spectrum of the economy, society, natural and cultural resources and mutual acquaintance between nations."
"It is highly satisfactory that the European Commission – as the Commissioner said – is targeting the leading role which European tourism can play in the future."
"However, particular attention and a serious strategy are needed for this, because we must not forget that the increase in tourism in the European Union in the first half of 2005 was just 5%, compared with 17% in the Middle East as a whole and around 10% in the United States."
"I should therefore like to emphasise in particular the added value which the European Union can bring to the policies of the Member States."
"Apart from the development of secure transport at national and trans-European level, other proposals contained in the report are also extremely important."
"I refer to cooperation and coordination on the conditions of entry of third-country nationals, cooperation on the flow of tourists in the high season, in order to overcome the imbalance between areas which are literally drowning and others which are seeking to attract tourists, on the promotion of tourist programmes such as the 'Ulysses' programme, on educational exchanges and mobility, so that we have certification of professional qualifications and, also, on the structured projection of Europe as a tourist destination with diversity and, of course, on the budget line for tourism in the European Union."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Queiró on his report and on the splendidly cooperative manner in which it was brought into being."
"It is, indeed, a very welcome development that an opinion on sustainable tourism should be worked out at European level."
"In the knowledge that most measures must be taken by the Member States, we have to establish that there are problems that Europe should take to heart."
"Tourism is, after all, a very important sector for the European public and also for our European economy."
"This is an ambitious report and that is why I am interested to know whether the Commissioner would like to say something about it and with which proposals and measures the Commission would actually like to tackle the job."
"This is not only a task for the Commission but also for the Council, for the report appeals to the Council to speed up the decision-making process on the reduced VAT rate."
"I have made out a case for this, because the reduced VAT rate is crucial for the tourism industry."
"Very many jobs hinge on it and the VAT rate should remain low for hotels in all Member States on a permanent basis."
"They should also be able to apply in a structured way reduced VAT rates for restaurants."
"It is unfortunate that the Council is not present, because I was actually very interested to see whether it expects to reach agreement on this by the end of this year."
"It may be possible for the Commissioner to comment on the report, and perhaps we as Parliament and Commission should bring more pressure to bear on the Council to finally force it into taking a decision, for these proposals are very important for employment, particularly in this economic climate."
"I endorse the request for quality indicators for the tourism industry, provided, though, that we fully utilise that industry’s expertise."
"Finally, let me say that this excellent report by Mr Queiró illustrates why our committee is not called ‘Committee on Transport and Tourism’ for nothing."
"Mr President, tourism is a real growth area across much of Europe; it is, above all, a sector that still relies on workers rather than machines, and that makes it an integral part of our Lisbon Strategy."
"We have not abandoned hope that there will be real action about this strategy rather than just even more talk."
"One thing I would particularly press the Commission to look at is something that is a matter of fundamental concern to my own country."
"As is well known, Austria is a holiday destination both in summer and in winter, and year by year, season by season, we have the same experience of a few weeks when the hotels and guesthouses are full up and there is gridlock on the streets."
"A lot of things would be easier to handle a couple of weeks later – that is, assuming the tourists were still there."
"If nations and regions – and here I am also thinking of the principal works holidays in your own country, Mr Vice-President, as well as in the Netherlands and in Belgium – were to synchronise their holidays better, it would have an enormous effect on Central Europe and would, in particular, really take the load off the tourist industry and offer it new opportunities."
"What we need here is not direction from on high or from Brussels, but we have learned, not least from the debates on the European Constitution, that a lot can be done by means of the coordination method, if it is taken seriously and handled properly."
"With that in mind, Commissioner, we can do no other than wish you much success and hope that European holidays will soon be better synchronised, that the tourism sector will grow and that tourists will benefit."
"– Mr President, sustainability concerns every one of us."
"It is of course not only an ecological, but also an economic matter."
"We must seek to enable enterprises to survive, and taxation is only one aspect of this; it is also important that enterprises be enabled to invest for the future, so as to create a sustainable supply of investment that is also reflected in global competitiveness."
"For this reason, I welcome the initiative in the Committee on Budgets by Mr Mulder – a specialist in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises – together with the European Investment Fund, aimed in particular at the provision, in future, of equity loans and other guarantees, the intention being to make sure that the risk and investment capital in tourism enterprises is secure in the long term, too, with a view to their sustainability."
"The fact is that negative equity is one of the main problems facing the tourism sector; a great many enterprises are going bankrupt, with the loss of large numbers of jobs."
"The debate on Basel II is imminent, and that debate, in particular, is a matter of life and death for tourism."
"After all, liquidity is a matter of life and death for every enterprise."
"I would therefore urge the Commissioner to keep up his commitment, particularly as regards the relevant programme for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"He has already done an exemplary job in this regard and, if we keep up the good work, we can succeed in doing what is best for tourism."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will take away from this debate a great many very important ideas and, above all, the impression of broad agreement on your part that tourism represents a dynamo for growth for Europe’s future, and must be given a higher profile in European policy as a whole."
"For this reason, it has already been agreed that a European Tourism Forum is to be held in Malta in October, where I shall be unveiling the key elements of the Commission’s future tourism policy."
"In addition, as I have already told your Committee, there are plans to present, early next year, a fundamental review of EU tourism policy to date in the form of a new strategy."
"I shall gladly incorporate into this all the ideas – and there have been very, very many of them – that I have been able to draw from today’s debate."
"I should just like to make one very clear qualification, which is that I am unable to raise the hopes of those speakers who, this afternoon, have called for protectionism, interventionism or subsidies."
"The Commission’s ideas will be far removed from any form of State intervention, State protection or, particularly, of subsidy."
"We shall most definitely not be launching a new subsidised sector, but instead shall create framework conditions using all the instruments we have for supporting the framework conditions for an economic sector."
"I should like to state equally clearly that I shall never accept the assertion that it is the Commission’s job to set up a ‘tourism and the elderly’ programme."
"If the tourism industry believes it should be doing something special for the elderly, then it should be so good as to do that itself; the Commission, at any rate, will not."
"We can propose it, but we shall not take upon ourselves those things that the tourism industry should be doing. Instead, we shall ensure that the tourism industry enjoys conditions conducive to development."
"It is for people themselves to run their own businesses; that is a function we shall most certainly not be taking from them."
"I think that we shall come to agree on this principle, and also, most certainly, on the principle that we do not wish to take the retrograde step of calling for more and more European rules, standards and regulations."
"I really was rather astonished this afternoon to hear the call for large numbers of new European rules, and my answer to this is an unambiguous ‘no’."
"For the Commission’s part, at least, there will be no European standards for hotels, inns or coaches."
"The last thing the Commission needs is to have to take on thousands of testers and send them to Europe’s restaurants to determine whether certain minimum standards of quality stipulated by the Commission ..."
"Yes, you did say that, and my reply is a clear ‘no’."
"Let the tourism industry agree on its own quality requirements."
"Where safety is concerned, however, it is a different matter; the appropriate arrangements are in place for this, but arranging and imposing quality standards in certain economic sectors is a matter for the sector itself rather than for the public legislator."
"I would also ask that Parliament finally show some consistency on this, and not criticise the Commission for excessive interference in economic matters, whilst at the same time repeatedly demanding that we take the industry’s tasks upon ourselves."
"This difference of opinion notwithstanding, though, I think that this debate has revealed a good deal of common ground, and I am quite sure that we shall succeed in arriving at a forward-looking common policy on tourism."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Dear Colleagues,"
"Good health is essential for physical and mental well-being."
"So equal access to health care services should be obligatory in the EU."
"There are serious challenges to be highlighted:"
"Women have specific health characteristics, their health status is also determined by socio-economic factors, like lower living standards, higher unemployment, lower wages."
"Many health problems affect women only or differently."
"Lately, many people have become aware that women and men are treated differently in those services."
"There is few information concerning differences in the effects of medication on women."
"Even those intended specifically for women, are normally tested on men only."
"Women working in health care outnumber men but are underrepresented in health care decision-making."
"I have to highlight the violence and abuse to which women have been subjected by men close to them, and through trafficking and prostitution."
"It causes serious physical and psychological public health problems and effects also children's healthy development."
"Mammography screening programs (to prevent breast cancer) exist in only nine Member States!"
"Poverty influences health."
"Poverty still has a woman face, 120 million women live in poverty."
"The situation is especially grave with Roma women in Central-Eastern Europe."
"– I should like to congratulate Mr Queiró on his excellent report."
"I shall confine myself to some brief thoughts."
"For years now we have all been aware of the important part played by tourism in developing local economies and creating jobs, especially for women and young people."
"The European Conference on Tourism and Employment, organised by the Luxembourg Presidency in November 1997, showed ‘the pulling power that tourism exercises on young people and women, to whom it often offers a first job opportunity’."
"For that reason as well, we in the Union for Europe of the Nations Group fully support the call for the Commission and the Council, when adopting the structural policy instruments for 2007-2013, to provide for an integrated approach to tourism, ‘allowing the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Regional Development Fund actions to be coordinated’."
"A further aspect that I must underline, which is something totally new, is the reference to itinerant tourism, represented particularly by camper vans and caravans."
"This is effectively a segment of the tourist industry that is active 365 days a year and contributes to employment growth in the sector."
"In lean times, that is no bad thing!"
"This segment therefore needs measures to encourage its development."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0330/2005)."
"We shall examine a whole series of questions to the Council."
"The EU's revised services offer in the Doha negotiations provides additional opportunities with regard to the movement of ‘highly qualified natural persons’ or ‘service providers’ which would allow persons from third countries to travel to the EU to provide services for a limited period of time."
"Can the Council provide a clearer definition of the term ‘highly qualified natural persons’ or ‘service providers’ and what is the Council's view in terms of the major repercussions this may have on the professional sectors of the developing countries and the LDCs?"
". It is a pleasure to be here once again to answer on behalf of the Council."
"I shall await the judgement Members of this House on whether it is a pleasure for them."
"In response to Mr Karim's question, a dynamic service sector is critical for the prosperity for any modern economy."
"No country, developed or developing, can prosper without one."
"It is therefore vital that we strive for an ambitious deal on services within the Doha development agenda negotiations."
"The European Union's revised services offer, tabled in Geneva in early June, contains a significant number of new commitments, including the 'mode 4' commitments which allow people to travel to the European Union to provide services for a short time."
"Under the terms of these commitments, overseas companies, with a contract to provide services in 21 important designated sectors, will be able to send skilled employees to the European Union to provide these services for up to six months at a time."
"As Mr Karim's question highlights, the contractual service suppliers in these cases must be skilled persons who enter the European Union for the purpose of providing a service associated with a services contract in certain defined economic areas."
"'Skilled' means they possess a university degree or its equivalent and have the necessary professional qualifications to practise in the European Union."
"They must also have at least three years' professional experience, or six years for independent professionals."
"In all such cases, European Union and national working conditions, minimum wage requirements and collective wage agreements will apply."
"European Union Member States will also continue to be able to refuse entry to persons that pose a security threat or are considered to be at risk of abusing the terms of their entry."
"The Minister can rest assured that this Parliament is equally as pleased as he is that he is here again today."
"Will the Council do anything to promote well-ordered international labour migration and, in turn, encourage EU Member States to set up mechanisms and provide incentives so that the expertise and experience gained by the service providers from the developing countries and LDCs can be applied in developing countries with under-serviced regions?"
". I am grateful for the gracious words of Mr Karim, the questioner, and I hope his faith in my performance will be vindicated in the minutes to come."
"On the more general question that he raises, as we meet today in this Parliament, the European Union Summit with India is taking place."
"The Indian subcontinent is one place where skilled migrant labour is already proving to be of mutual benefit."
"I have had the opportunity to travel to Bangalore and meet many of the service providers who are benefiting from the present proposals."
"I heard directly from the Indians that they considered there was genuine mutual benefit in having their employees working for a period either in the European Union or in North America."
"In Silicon Valley, for example, highly-skilled software engineers educated either in the United States or in India were able to gain experience in the United States and then either stay and continue to develop commercial contacts between the United States and India or return to India and establish businesses, which in turn do business with developed countries such as the United States."
"So I can assure you this is a far wider issue than simply the answer I provided on mode 4."
"It is a matter about which there is much discussion, not least on the close commercial ties that can be established between less-developed countries and the European Union."
"I am optimistic that there can be genuine mutual benefit both for the countries providing the workers and for the European Union, which benefits from their skills and expertise."
"I too am very pleased to have Mr Alexander here among us."
"I would just like to point out to him that we are not at Westminster."
"Could he wait until he is given the floor, for the time it takes to complete the translations for everyone?"
"This is by no means ‘Question Time’."
"That will come perhaps when we all have the same language in the European Union but, for the time being, everyone must have time to listen to your answers and to the questions posed."
"Mr Rübig had a supplementary question."
"– I should be interested to hear whether the mode 4 commitments also entail the security risk being assessed according to uniform standards in future."
"Will the Council be producing a definition of what is meant by ‘security risk’?"
". I am grateful for your guidance, Mr President."
"I certainly would not be as contentious in my appearance in Parliament today to suggest that there should be a single language for the European Union."
"In many ways our diversity has proved to be our strength in recent years."
"On the important point that the questioner raised in relation to security, of course there has to be concern given to whether we have specific strategic interests."
"That extends beyond simply the question of labour and individual workers, to cover broader questions."
"Before appearing in Parliament today, I read of the concerns over cyber-spying, which is now regrettably a feature of the modern world in which we live."
"It is essential, not just in our internal discussions but also in taking a broader view of this issue, to have an important and necessary regard for the security questions that the Member raised."
"As regards a single language, the key issue would be to know what language that would be."
"Let us avoid that debate for the time being."
"Mr Martin had a supplementary question."
"President-in-Office, to give effect to your mode 4 proposals, which I welcome, would the Council consider encouraging the Commission to create a database for the whole of the European Union that companies and countries from outside the EU could access, so they could identify potential skills shortfalls and opportunities to provide services?"
"This would extend the benefits from such access to include poorer developing countries, as well as countries that already have good intelligence about what is going on in the European Union."
". Mr President, as a fellow Scot, along with the questioner, I will resist the temptation to discuss the closeness of relations between the Scottish people and the French people over many centuries and instead direct myself to the question that was asked."
"I will certainly be happy to pass on to the Commission the point of view that was communicated to me this afternoon in relation to the merits of a database."
"In my discussions previously with, for example, the Indian trade minister, the urgency and importance of progress on mode 4 as part of the wider Doha Development Round was impressed upon me."
"The question is whether the European Union's institutions are best placed to be aware of the constantly changing commercial opportunities available in a rapidly changing commercial sector."
"None the less, I am happy to give the undertaking that I will pass on that suggestion to the Commission."
"Does the UK Government strongly support the need for an EU 'Third pillar' data protection framework to safeguard individual privacy through for example purpose restrictions, when information is accessed by intelligence and law enforcement agencies on a cross-border basis, or does it regard the 25 national regimes as sufficient, as a Home Office Minister has suggested (House of Lords European Union Committee Report 'After Madrid: the EU's Response to terrorism', 5th report 2004 - 5, evidence page 128 - 141)?"
". The Presidency is waiting for the Commission to introduce its proposals for a framework decision laying down data protection rules in the third pillar."
"As soon as the proposal is formally introduced, the Presidency will ensure that it is discussed by the appropriate Council body and forwarded to the European Parliament in accordance with Article 39 of the Treaty on European Union."
". That is a staggering reply, because it did not answer the question at all."
"We all know it is going to be introduced and we all know the Council and Parliament will discuss it, so you have told us absolutely nothing."
"What you were actually asked, if you will read the question please, is whether the Government supports an EU regime or, as suggested by one of your Government ministers in the House of Lords last year, the 25 national regimes."
"Which is it?"
"Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister, told Parliament when he introduced the British Presidency, 'I am a passionate pro-European'."
"He did not say another word back in the United Kingdom about it."
"Is this a case of being two-faced, saying one thing here and nothing back home?"
"Tell us the truth!"
". I should like to thank the Member for the characteristic grace with which he has directed his question towards me."
"It is not a question of being two-faced, but simply – and I hope he appreciates this point as a passionate European – a due regard for my position today, which is not to speak for the UK Government, but instead to represent the position of the Presidency of the European Union."
"– I agree with Mr Newton Dunn."
"I, too, am disappointed with the non-answer the President-in-Office has just given us."
"The British Presidency is very well aware of the difficulty of combating organised crime."
"That is why we are anxiously waiting to see something done about it once and for all: after all, crime has become globalised, and so that is what the fight against international terrorism and international crime needs to be too."
". I have been questioned on two substantive points in supplementary questions."
"The first supplementary question asked, 'have I read the question?'"
"I can assure you I have, and it specifically and explicitly states, 'does the UK Government strongly support the need for an EU third pillar data protection framework?'"
"It goes on to elaborate on that point."
"I merely reiterate for clarity that my responsibilities today are to discharge my duties on behalf of the Presidency, rather than to articulate the national position of the United Kingdom Government."
"It would be a disservice to this Parliament were I to do anything else."
"However, I think anybody who was present in this Chamber this morning and had the opportunity to hear the UK Home Secretary speak, again on behalf of the Presidency, in relation to data protection measures, would have a very clear understanding as to the importance that we attach to the service that can be provided by data protection measures, and the need for a transnational approach to tackling not just issues such as people trafficking and organised crime, but also the pressing threat of international terrorism."
"When will the Council next have an opportunity to vote on changing its rules of procedure to provide for it to meet in public when it deliberates on draft legislative acts?"
". On 23 June 2005, the United Kingdom's Prime Minister stated in this Chamber that, in the view of the Presidency, there is a strong case for increased Council transparency, but this is something we need to discuss with all Member States."
"As the Presidency, we have not made any formal proposals at this time."
"We are still considering measures and will be consulting with partners in due course, because, as I am sure the honourable Members will appreciate, this is not a matter that is entirely in the gift of the Presidency."
"That was not a bad answer!"
"I can vouch for some satisfaction with that."
"Does the Presidency-in-Office accept that the British Government, in some four months' time, will be coming back, trying to point to achievements during its period of holding the Presidency of the European Union?"
"Does the Minister accept that to be able to look at an example of having spread openness and transparency and having enhanced the ability of national parliaments to hold ministers to account would be quite a significant achievement?"
". I thank the questioner for his gracious remarks on my initial answer."
"Let me elaborate on that answer."
"As I said, the position of the British Government was stated by our Prime Minister and the strong case for increased Council transparency is clearly recognised."
"However, there is further work to be done, not least because a balance has to be struck between what I think are understandable objectives and desires on the part of the British Government and several other Member States and due regard for the decision by the European Council in June that a pause for reflection was necessary, following the decisive decisions in the Dutch and French referenda."
"As I said, I would not seek to close down the discussion that will no doubt take place in light of the correspondence in the London yesterday."
"I merely offer what I think should be regarded as a holding reply while consideration is given as to the best way forward."
"President-in-Office, I appreciate that this issue is very sensitive and I understand very well that the decision must be taken unanimously."
"However, what is the position of other Member States in the Council?"
"Perhaps some of them would agree that, in some special cases, it would be possible to meet in public."
". I am grateful for this supplementary question."
"The acknowledgement of the sensitivity of this issue is a helpful one."
"The question alluded to the fact that there may be division within the members of the Council as regards how far and how quickly we are able to proceed."
"Therefore, it is appropriate that, as the Presidency, we recognise the case and the strength of the case that was put so volubly in at the beginning of this week, but seek to work collaboratively at this stage, rather than making unilateral declarations."
"We are cognizant of our responsibilities and it would be to the disadvantage of everyone if division was to become the hallmark of this discussion, if there is an opportunity for moving forward together."
"– In this question on openness and transparency I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer."
"However, there is also another question, about Strasbourg itself."
"We are the only parliament in the world that has no say over where it sits."
"Can the President-in-Office comment on whether the Council will deliberate whether we can have our meetings solely in Brussels and not have to come to Strasbourg?"
". I am not sure whether the question of the location of the European Parliament is judged more contentious or less contentious than the suggestion that there should be a single language for the European Union, but suffice it to say that I will tread cautiously in replying to this question."
"I can assure you that I was asked a very similar question on the floor of the House of Commons by one of my Conservative colleagues, who asked whether, in light of our Prime Minister's speech to this Parliament, we were minded to consider a more efficient approach to the location of the European Parliament as a first step in negotiating the future financing of the EU."
"I have already been accused of not answering one question."
"I can assure you that I did not answer that question in the House of Commons either."
"I believe it is fair to say that there has been a long-standing debate on this matter and the position of Member State governments has been very clear for some time."
"I have to say, however, that I have listened very carefully to the point that the questioner made."
"She is certainly not the only Member of the European Parliament who has forcibly put this point to me on this visit."
"That is undoubtedly true."
"It is the case that we can debate the number of EU languages, but as regards the treaties, I believe that there is only one single version."
"Each and everyone one of us therefore lives with it, whatever our nationality may be."
"Question No 4 is withdrawn"
"In statements made to the Turkish press on 27 June 2005, the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Gül, expressly ruled out the possibility of the Turkish Government recognising the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate and made it clear that the issue of the Halki School of Theology was being examined on the basis of current Turkish law, which meant that the School would not be re-opening."
"In the light of the European Council's conclusions of December 2004 and the Commission's announcements of December 2004 concerning Turkey's progress, which contained an express reference to the religious rights of the non-Muslim communities, what is the Council's reaction to these statements by Mr Gül?"
". I have not yet read Foreign Minister Gul's statement in full but, under the revised Accession Partnership adopted in May 2003, Turkey is required to establish conditions for the functioning of non-Muslim religious communities which are in line with the practice of European Union Member States."
"However, as the European Commission indicated in its 2004 Regular Report, non-Muslim religious communities, including the Ecumenical Patriarchate, continue to encounter obstacles."
"Serious problems, in particular the legal status of non-Muslim communities, property registration and training of clergy, remain to be solved."
"New legislation, needed in order to remedy these difficulties, is still in preparation."
"In this context, a draft law on foundations is currently pending in the Turkish Parliament."
"The Turkish authorities have invited and received comments from the Commission on this draft and the Union expects the Commission's comments to be seriously considered."
"As the honourable Member of Parliament is well aware, the European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004, when reviewing whether Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria to open accession negotiations, clearly stated that the Union would continue to monitor closely progress of the political reforms in Turkey."
"I can assure the honourable Member that the Council continues to do so."
"– Mr President, the refusal by the British President-in-Office of the Council to comment months after the event on Mr Abdullah Gul's specific declaration, in which he refuses to recognise the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate and the reopening of the Chalkis Seminary, makes a very bad impression on me."
"Given that there is a clear common position on this matter, both from the European Parliament and the Commission and all the churches, I ask you directly Mr Alexander:"
"Is this continuing refusal on the part of the Turkish leadership a retraction from the Copenhagen criteria, yes or no?"
"I ask you please for a clear answer at long last."
". With the greatest respect, I shall choose my own words on what is an issue of great interest but also of great controversy."
"I think it is fair to draw attention to the clearly stated position of the European Parliament on the opening of accession talks with Turkey and the decision reached, as I explained, in the European Council."
"It also has to be borne in mind that discussions are currently under way through the Permanent Representatives of Council members, ahead of what we anticipate to be the opening of accession talks, if that process is taken forward, on 3 October."
"You have to understand the issue of Turkey in the broader context of what has been set out by the Commission in relation to not just the Copenhagen criteria, but the broader criteria for enlargement."
"At the recent Gymnich meeting that took place in the United Kingdom, Commissioner Rehn made clear that there were really three fundamentals that needed to be recognised in relation to enlargement: firstly, consolidation, secondly, conditionality and thirdly, communication."
"I would merely state, in relation to Turkey, that there is a very clear understanding, as I sought to convey in my answer, on the issue of conditionality."
"The opening of accession talks would represent not the end of that process, but the beginning of a much longer one."
"I think that, as the question showed, the way forward is not to identify a particular statement by one individual or another, but instead to uphold the important and rigorous process of conditionality which is expected not just for any prospective member aspiring to join the European Union, but which should apply to every potential candidate for accession."
"Given the interest in this matter, I am confident that Turkey will undergo this process in the weeks, months and, indeed, years to come."
"– Mr President, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether religious freedom in Turkey meets European human rights standards."
". Our standard of human rights is set down in the Copenhagen criteria."
"In that sense, the obligations which any candidate country has to meet are set out objectively and I hope, in the view of this Parliament, independently."
"It is therefore important that the Commission and others be given the opportunity to take forward that process of rigorous assessment, but I am cognisant of the strength of feeling, both within certain Member States and among representatives here in this Parliament."
"That is why we need to uphold the integrity of the process as we seek to move this particular dossier forward."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I, too, would like to ask a question about this."
"Over the last year, we have all seen serious abuses of human rights – and of women’s rights, in particular – continuing to occur in Turkey."
"That is why I insist that the President-in-Office answer the question as to whether the Presidency is prepared, in future, to discuss not only full membership, but also a different form of accession or association: a privileged partnership, for example."
". I am fully aware of the long-standing interest in, and concern about, the issue of Turkey expressed by certain representatives in this Parliament."
"While I am respectful of the views that they hold, I would respectfully remind them of the decision both of this Parliament and, indeed, of the European Council on the issue of opening accession talks on 3 October – recognising, of course, the work that is presently under way."
"On the specific points that were raised: firstly, in relation to women's rights, a package of major constitutional amendments was passed in May that confirms the equality between men and women."
"The new penal code significantly strengthens women's rights, removing sentence reductions for honour killings and abolishing the article that enabled rapists to escape jail if they married their victim."
"I understand that the Turkish Parliament has agreed to set up a 15-member commission to investigate honour killings in Turkey, looking at the causes and possible preventative measures."
"I am sure that is a matter which would find widespread support and would be welcomed by many Members of this Parliament."
"On the broader issue of religious minorities, which was the genesis of the question: it is also worth bearing in mind that the head of the Syrian Orthodox Church in Istanbul has said that, as a result of European Union harmonisation reforms, his community has found it easier to worship, and that attitudes towards them have changed in recent months."
"How does the British Presidency assess the current state of progress of preparations for Croatia's accession to the EU, and what steps are now planned, and within what time frame?"
". – The Council appreciates the keen interest that honourable Members are taking in the question of Croatia's preparations for accession."
"As for the next steps, the Council reiterated on 13 June 2005 that the intergovernmental conference to launch accession negotiations with Croatia will be convened by common agreement, as soon as the Council has established that Croatia is cooperating fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia – ICTY."
"As the Member is aware, a high-level task force has been set up with the specific objective of examining, in close contact with ICTY and the Croatian authorities, the measures taken and to be taken by Croatia with a view to reaching full cooperation with ICTY."
"In this context, Croatia has presented an action plan."
"In her letter to the Presidency, dated 7 June 2005, the ICTY Chief Prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, noted that, by implementing its action plan, Croatia was on the road to full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal but that more time was required to determine whether these further efforts had produced tangible results."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I did not ask you what happened in May or June;"
"I know that already."
"I asked you what the Council Presidency was planning for the coming weeks."
"Specifically, will there be another General Council before 3 October to deal with the commencement of accession negotiations with Croatia?"
"Secondly, how does the Council propose to keep the democratically-elected European Parliament informed about the work of the task force?"
"Is this task force actually working at all, or is it only being used to block the accession negotiations?"
". Let me seek to complete the story I began in my initial answer and hopefully address the points that the Member raised."
"In June the Council took note of this new element – that is, the task force – with satisfaction and encouraged Croatia to continue with its efforts in that direction."
"Indeed, the Council committed itself to continuing its examination of this dossier in July and, under the United Kingdom Presidency, the Council therefore considered this issue at its meeting on 18 July, following the task force meeting a week earlier."
"At the Gymnich just this week, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw made a commitment to seeking a further report from the Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal."
"It will be in light of that report that the task force will meet again in September."
"I cannot at this stage anticipate the conclusions of the task force."
"The Council will, however, then discuss the matter further in light of the task force's conclusions."
"– When comparing the conditions for Turkey’s accession with those imposed on Croatia, do you not see any difference in the treatment of these two States?"
"It is totally unfair to impose an individual condition on Croatia and thereby postpone the negotiations."
"In the light of the kind of problems currently being experienced with Turkey as regards its human rights situation and its past, what is being demanded here is a monstrous injustice."
"I really would ask you to keep to the rules of the European Union and apply the same standard to both of them."
". With the greatest of respect to the questioner, I find there is a curious connection between the first part and second part of his question, in the sense that I can assure him that there is an honest endeavour on the part of the Council to uphold the rules and that is exactly what we are seeking to do in the case of Croatia."
"Although I recognise that opinion in this Parliament is divided on the issue of Croatian accession, there can surely be few of us who would deny that upholding the international rule of law is one of the tenets of the European Union."
"In that regard it is important that Croatia is recognised to have upheld international law and its clear obligations to the International Criminal Tribunal under international law, not just in the interests of the Union but also in the more general interests of all of us who wish to see international law upheld within the western Balkans generally."
"It is also important that, at a critical time, we do not collectively resile from the very clear position on the steps Croatia needs to take."
"I find it curious, as a British Minister standing here on behalf of the Presidency, that implicit in the questions is a suggestion that Britain is somehow averse to the accession of a country such as Croatia, given Britain's longstanding commitment to enlargement and our determination that Croatia should be able to take its place within the European Union in due course."
"The bar to that is simply the fact that it is obliged to uphold the international obligations as set out by the International Criminal Tribunal."
"That is why I am keen to emphasise today that the ball is primarily in the court of the Croatian Government and I am hopeful that, in light of the taskforce work that is being undertaken at the moment, we will see further progress in Croatia that will allow accession to move forward expeditiously."
"I warmly welcome that last reply from the President-in-Office."
"Of course Croatia should not enter into negotiations with the EU until it complies with the International Criminal Tribunal's conditions."
"But will he accept that this is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition and that Croatia also has to address the question of the Krajina Serbs and other major issues before we can enter into detailed negotiations about membership?"
". As I have sought to suggest in previous answers I have given in the course of this Question Time, there are objective criteria which are set down for all potential candidate countries seeking membership of the European Union."
"They apply as much to Croatia as they would to any other potential Member State of the European Union."
"However, I would emphasise that, on this particular issue, which has attracted so much attention, Croatia's obligations are very clear, as is the opportunity that is available to Croatia if it meets those obligations in relation to the International Criminal Tribunal."
"– Mr President, in this House’s Rules of Procedure, Rule 166(2) states that ‘a request to raise a point of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak’."
"My request to speak is therefore perfectly justified."
"I should like to make a request to speak regarding Rule 109 ‘Question Time’, paragraph 4 of which makes reference to Annex II."
"Point 4 under ‘Supplementary questions’ in Annex II reads as follows: ‘Each Member may follow up the reply with a supplementary question to any question."
"He may put in all two supplementary questions.’"
"I have the Italian version, too, which says the same."
"If the official who has been constantly gesturing to me that I am not entitled to put a second supplementary question has this point checked by the competent authorities, he will find that I am indeed entitled to do so under the current Rules of Procedure, subject to your consent pursuant to point 6(a) of Annex II."
"We will, in fact, leave it to the relevant services to interpret this question."
"All the same, I, for my part, read in the annex to the Rules of Procedure concerning Question Time that it is recommended, as regards supplementary questions, that, as a general rule, the President should allow one supplementary question from the questioner and one or, at the most, two supplementary questions put by Members belonging ideally to a political group and/or Member State different from that of the author of the main question."
"It seems to me that to give an even more generous interpretation of this recommendation would lead us to profoundly alter the spirit of Question Time, which is designed to have a certain tempo and to enable a large number of questions to be put."
"It is not a matter of allowing those MEPs who might wish to do so to conduct a general policy debate."
"Let us take the example of Croatia."
"There might be 15 or 20 of you here who wish to proceed with the supplementary questions on Croatia, which would result in the subsequent questions from other MEPs never being put."
"It is in order to avoid that that the regulation was devised in such a way."
"Mr Ebner, you have said what you have said."
"The question has been sent to the relevant services."
"You will receive a more official response; however, I believe that the spirit of Question Time is extremely clear."
"Following the appointment of a new Director of EUROPOL, the positive impression made at his appearance before MEPs on the Civil Liberties Committee in June 2005, and a positive visit by MEPs to the EUROPOL Headquarters in April 2005, can the Council give details of how it views the future cooperation between EUROPOL and the EU Institutions?"
"Does the Council believe that current accountability arrangements between EUROPOL and the EU institutions are fully transparent?"
". The Presidency was encouraged by Max-Peter Ratzel, the new director of Europol's positive meeting with the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs back in June."
"We are working with both the European Parliament and Europol to improve the exchange of information between the two institutions."
"The Presidency is fully committed to making the system of accountability as transparent as possible."
"As Members of this House will know, Europol is directly funded by Member States and is directly accountable to Member States via the Europol management board and indeed the Council of Ministers."
"However, the Presidency hopes that Mr Ratzel will soon return to the European Parliament for further discussions."
"In contrast to Mr Newton Dunn earlier, I am more than happy and satisfied with that answer."
"Could the President-in-Office amplify or underline what Charles Clarke has been saying over the past couple of days, that in order fully to deal with terrorism, with cross-border crime – a far more difficult task than it at first seems to the general public – we must attempt to promote a Europol that functions to its true potential and operates as transparently as possible within the rules, within the new directive – which you have rightly said is an efficient and good addition to Europol – so that we can attack terrorism at its roots as well as organised crime?"
". I am grateful for those generous words by the questioner, and I would be happy to give him the affirmation of the point that he made in relation to Mr Charles Clarke's speech earlier today here in this Chamber."
"If I was to identify a single area where I found myself in absolute agreement on this issue with the Home Secretary, it was when he recognised that it is by greater cooperation, not by seeking to put up walls between us, that, collectively within the European Union, we will be able to meet the challenge of the truly transnational nature, not just of the issues of people trafficking or drug trafficking, but also of organised crime and the challenge of terrorism."
"What the Home Secretary was able to communicate in this Chamber today was the deep-seated belief within the UK Government – and, indeed, of the Presidency – that it is only by the kind of effective cooperation that we continue to support within Europol that we will be able truly to harness the potential of all the law enforcement agencies across Europe as, collectively, we strive to meet the challenge posed by the kind of threats that I have outlined in the course of my answer."
"The Colombian government has recently passed a law through Congress, with the resounding support of Members with links to paramilitary groups, guaranteeing paramilitaries de facto impunity and thus also enabling known drug traffickers to escape justice."
"This law has been strongly criticised by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights' representative in Colombia and by all human rights organisations."
"At Cartagena the European Union, and the United Kingdom in particular, made it clear that the continuation of aid to Colombia was conditional upon a legal framework for the demobilisation of paramilitaries."
"What stance does the Council intend to adopt towards the Colombian government following its decision in support of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity and which represents a serious attack on the rights of victims to secure truth, justice and compensation?"
"Does the Council believes that it can continue to encourage police cooperation with a country that makes such generous concessions to known terrorists and drug traffickers?"
"The Council has been informed of initial reactions to the justice and peace law by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who drew attention to insufficiencies of the law as concerns impunity, provisions on investigating heinous crimes and due restitutions or reparations for victims."
"To prepare a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the situation by the Council, European Union Heads of Mission were asked to produce for September a considered analysis of the law and recommendations for the European Union's policy, taking into account the Council conclusions of December 2004."
"In this context, they will consult widely, including the government, civil society, the group of 24 and the United Nations."
"As concerns police cooperation, the Council is convinced that training police in Colombia in accordance with the values and standards of the European Union will contribute to security and greater respect for human rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the answer seems very vague to me and puts off a decision ."
"What we have here is a law that in practice regularises paramilitaries, offering organised criminals and drug traffickers the possibility of turning themselves into paramilitaries and thus taking advantage of this law. By the way, the law was also severely criticised by Amnesty International, which says that the demilitarisation and demobilisation have not actually taken place."
"I therefore call for an extremely specific answer on the matter of funding: does the European Union still intend to finance this kind of project, which formally aims at demobilisation, whereas in actual fact it ends up providing support for the paramilitary groups?"
". I have listened carefully to the terms of the questioner's supplementary."
"I would respectfully suggest that if he is concerned about and desirous of a thorough answer, then that rather vindicates the point that I sought to make in terms of the need for EU heads of mission to prepare a very thorough statement in terms of what should inform the European Union's decision-making process."
"Of course it is the case that the Union is committed to helping Colombia to resolve inter-related problems of internal armed conflict, trade in illegal drugs and human rights abuses about which he is rightly concerned."
"The Council conclusions back in December underlined the importance of the establishment of a proper legal framework that addresses the issues of truth, justice and reparation for the victims of that armed conflict."
"However, I would reiterate the point I made in my initial answer, that we have a responsibility, given the need and seriousness of the issues that the questioner raised, to make sure that our decisions are informed by a thorough analysis of the true situation in Colombia at the moment."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether he agrees with the statements by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers of the European Union, Mr Solana, in support of the peace efforts by President Uribe in Colombia, and whether he believes that the laying down of arms by people responsible for horrendous crimes, such as the paramilitaries, is good or bad news. I would also like to know whether he is of the opinion that a decision taken by a democratically-elected body, such as the Colombian Parliament, could be illegitimate."
". I am aware that the European Union could be more formally involved through timely political endorsement for the ongoing peace process to which the honourable Member referred."
"But that would take place once the Colombian Government has set out a comprehensive legal framework."
"This position has not changed and the Union is currently studying carefully the new Colombian legislation, the 'Justice and Peace Law' agreed in late June, to gauge whether these conditions have now been met."
"President-in-Office, in dealing with a sovereign government, is it not important, unlike the initial questioner, to always keep a sense of balance?"
"In that regard, has the Council yet discussed and acted upon the disgraceful fact that three convicted international terrorists, who are fugitives from justice in Colombia, are now enjoying sanctuary in a European Union Member State, namely the Republic of Ireland?"
"Is the Council content with this situation and, if not, what action is proposed?"
". In the course of my replies to questioners this afternoon, I have already been clear as to the distinction that is appropriately drawn between those matters for which a reply can reasonably be expected from the Presidency and those matters which instead lie within the domain of individual Member State governments."
"The case to which the honourable Member refers, the so-called Colombia three, is a matter between the Irish Government and the Colombian Government."
"It is for the Irish authorities to pursue any extradition request with the Colombian Government if that is what they choose to do, but it is essentially a matter for the Irish authorities."
"In that regard, I think that is all it would be appropriate for me to say at this stage."
"Will the UK Presidency’s priority of better regulation include a drive to ensure a level regulatory playing field throughout the EU to eliminate the regulatory asymmetry that is beginning to develop in sectors such as the postal sector?"
"With wide discrepancies in the independence and effectiveness of national regulatory authorities, what initiatives is the Presidency planning to ensure that UK companies, which are subject to rigorous national regulatory regimes, are not disadvantaged in the face of competitors which have much more freedom in their home markets in such areas as pricing and performance targetry?"
". Improved communication and cooperation between regulators is vital to the smooth operation of the internal market."
"In its recent report on the application of the Postal Directive, the Commission has proposed intensifying cooperation and indeed benchmarking with national regulatory agencies, either bilaterally or within the framework of the Postal Directive Committee, in order to tackle the irregularities that may persist in this sector."
"As well as benchmarking exercises, we should also consider initiatives such as the Solve-it Scheme."
"Such initiatives encourage regulators to communicate directly with one another to solve problems."
"We also need to make sure that we review existing legislation to see whether it has achieved its objectives on the ground."
"With that in mind, the Telecommunications and Energy Council, meeting in December, will discuss Commission implementation reports in these relevant sectors."
"There are so many Scots in the Chamber that I think, if we are going to have a common language, it should probably be Scottish."
"I am grateful to the President-in-Office for his reply and it goes some way towards answering my supplementary question as well."
"He appears to be agreeing with me that there is not a level playing field at the present time, causing this asymmetry."
"Therefore, what concrete proposals is the Presidency planning to improve the coordination between national regulatory authorities in order to ensure that there is a genuine, free and fair internal market for all operators?"
"Mr Stevenson, I do not know whether we translate directly from Scottish, but we are probably obliged to go through another language that is spoken in the United Kingdom and that many people here speak."
". The last time I saw so many Scots gathered together was probably around the British Cabinet table, but I am not sure I would be brave enough to make that point back in London."
"As regards the point raised by the honourable Member, it is a matter of which I have had some direct experience, having myself been the minister responsible for postal services in the United Kingdom when I was at the Department of Trade and Industry."
"At that time I was aware of exactly the kinds of concerns he raised."
"I can assure you that there is an awareness of these issues, not simply from a Presidency point of view but in the context of a Member State."
"As regards the concrete steps to be taken on cooperation between national regulators, I reiterate the point I made in my earlier response."
"In terms of the application of the Postal Services Directive and in particular the report published by the Commission, the Commission strongly recommended that there should be intensified cooperation between national regulators, and that certainly has our full support."
"A balance has to be struck between the constructive oversight that the Commission can provide in this area of work and a greater involvement by national regulators themselves in what surely is of common interest to them, ensuring a level playing field."
"Does the President-in-Office agree with me that part of the problem is that different countries are proceeding with liberalisation at different rates?"
"The United Kingdom will soon fully liberalise, along with Germany and the Netherlands, which means that 60% of the market will be liberalised."
"Therefore, the key element will be the Commission's forthcoming report on the final steps towards full liberalisation in 2009, dealing with regulatory authorities, access arrangements, and also the differing treatment of VAT between the reserved and non-reserved sectors, which is a very sensitive issue and needs to be treated with due care."
". I find myself in concurrence with the points that the honourable Member raises."
"I can assure you that when serving as a British minister with responsibilities for the Postal Services Directive, these were points that were made very vocally to me by the Communication Workers Union, never mind by the Royal Mail and others."
"So I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed in a number of Member States in terms of the relative liberalisation of the markets that has taken place and indeed the extent of openness within markets at the present time."
"In relation to the specific point on VAT and regulatory asymmetry, the Commission has proposed amending the relative VAT Directive."
"The Council has not yet reached agreement on the proposal and understands that the Commission is currently exploring ways of achieving a common interpretation of the current framework."
"In that regard, we await the outcome of those further areas of work."
"Ten United Nations special rapporteurs on several human freedoms and rights issued a recent statement expressing concern about the ‘mass forced evictions in Zimbabwe and related human rights violations’ and raising questions about the negative effects on supplies of water and food, education and health care, including HIV/AIDS treatment."
"Will the Council give an update of the situation in Zimbabwe following the extended visit of the United Nations Special Envoy, Mrs Anna Tibaijuka, who is also the Executive Director of the UN Human Settlements Programme?"
". It is not within the Council's remit to report on situations following the visit of a United Nations special envoy to a country."
"The report of the UN special envoy Mrs Anna Kajumulo will be available through the usual United Nations sources, I am reliably informed."
"In the context of the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, the Council will, of course, report on the situation in the said country."
"President-in-Office, it is absolutely disgraceful that up to 700 000 people have been displaced from their homes, their houses and businesses completely destroyed."
"I understand that blood transfusion stocks are now almost non-existent."
"The United Nations is organising an international appeal for humanitarian and other aid."
"The international community has no option but to cooperate in helping these unfortunate people."
"Is it not outrageous that a regime led by what can only be described as a tyrant, along with his cronies, can carry on with the ruination of a country and its people with total impunity?"
". I find myself in complete agreement with the honourable Member in deploring the actions of the said government and the impoverishment of its people that has followed as a consequence of the misrule in that country for so long."
"The European Union continues to call on the Government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the international relief efforts which tragically have now proved necessary and to allow humanitarian assistance to be provided free from political interference."
"It is also the case that the European Union continues through sanctions to place pressure on the regime."
"These sanctions have the support of the democratic opposition and the non-governmental organisation community within Zimbabwe and they show that the European Union is determined to make its voice heard on human rights and the rule of law."
"I deplore the situation and hope and wish that it will change in due course and, in that regard, will take interest in the report that is being produced by the United Nations Special Envoy."
"The Myanmar authorities recently released 249 political ‘prisoners’ throughout the country, reportedly including two prominent journalists and a close aide of the still-detained National League for Democracy (NLD) leader Aung San Suu Kyi, which is welcomed."
"Does the Council agree that the Myanmar authorities should lift the remaining constraints on all political leaders and resume political dialogue with all parties concerned?"
"Furthermore will the Council use its office to call on Myanmar's military government to remove all constraints, starting with the end of her house arrest, on Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner?"
". The European Union pointed out that the releases of political prisoners mentioned by the honourable Member were a welcome step towards national reconciliation in Burma."
"The European Union has repeatedly called for the liberation of Aung San Suu Kyi, most recently on 17 June, ahead of her 60th birthday."
"On that occasion, the European Union hoped that this would be the last birthday she spent deprived of her freedom and urged the State Peace and Development Council – SPDC – to release her, U Tin Oo and all the other political prisoners immediately."
"The European Union is committed to supporting national reconciliation and respect for human rights and democracy in Burma and continues to call on the SPDC to enter into a genuine dialogue with the NLD and with ethnic representatives to find peaceful political solutions."
"Like Ann Sang Suu Kyi, the European Union supports an approach to resolving the long-standing political problems in Burma based on dialogue and non-violence."
"Consequently, the Union looks forward to the immediate and unconditional release of all remaining political detainees in order to enable all social and political forces to participate in that reconciliation process."
"The European Union has shared the above concerns with the Burmese leadership on several occasions, most recently on 6 May at a ministerial meeting held in the margins of the ASEAN ministerial meeting in Kyoto."
"At that meeting, the European Union handed over a list of political prisoners whose release was requested on urgent humanitarian grounds."
"At the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting and the ARF ministerial meeting on 28 and 29 July in Laos, the Union again voiced its concerns about the situation in Burma."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response and understanding that actions have been taken, words have been said."
"Is the Minister aware that the Indonesian Foreign Minister has recently taken up this case in a big way and is planning to make a presentation during the UN General Summit which takes place later on this year?"
"Could I urge the Council, and the President-in-Office in particular, to give support to the Indonesian Foreign Minister in ensuring the release of all political prisoners, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi?"
". I am sincerely grateful to the honourable gentleman for the question that he raises and pay tribute to his long-standing interest in this matter."
"I myself, before assuming my responsibilities as Minister for Europe, had responsibility for South Asia and South East Asia within the UK Foreign Office and I took the opportunity, anticipating in some ways his question, to meet directly with the ASEAN ambassadors in London, to press home to them directly the critical role that other Asian countries can play in bringing to bear a full awareness by that regime of the strength of international feeling."
"In that regard, of course, the European Union continues to support efforts, both internationally and in the United Nations General Assembly, to bring pressure to bear on the regime, to take forward the process of national reconciliation that we all seek and to address urgently the deep concerns we feel in relation to the unfair detention of political prisoners."
"According to a senior UN official, Under-Secretary General Jan Egeland, 'One medical charity has treated 500 victims of sexual violence in Darfur in four months and this is just a fraction of such attacks in the Sudanese province'."
"He also stated that 'women and children were being systematically raped and assaulted in the ravaged region'."
"Does the Council agree that the Sudanese authorities are turning a blind eye to these atrocities?"
"Furthermore does the Council agree that there is an urgent obligation on the international community to do more to protect innocent civilians from this type of barbaric behaviour and to put an end to a culture of impunity in Sudan?"
". The Council has, on various occasions, condemned the massive humanitarian rights violations taking place in Darfur, including the systematic rape of women, demanding that those responsible at all levels be held accountable for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law."
"The European Union strongly supported the creation of the International Commission of Inquiry on the violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in Darfur, which found that government forces and militia conducted indiscriminate attacks, including rape and other forms of sexual violence, throughout Darfur on a widespread and systematic basis, as well as the referral of the findings of the Commission to the International Criminal Court."
"The EU has contributed more than EUR 150 million to the humanitarian programme in Sudan, including funding for United Nations agencies and NGOs in Darfur engaged in protection issues and the treatment of victims of sexual violence."
"The European Union has also allocated EUR 92 million from its Africa Peace Facility to the African Union Mission in Sudan."
"The latest report by the United Nations Secretary-General states that, 'The presence of the African Union and its patrols directly resulted in a decrease in both sexual and gender-based violence and other violations of human rights.'"
"In its conclusions of 23 May 2005, the Council particularly welcomed the adoption of the Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in Sudan by the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which expresses deep concern at the situation of human rights in Darfur, including gender-based violence, condemns sexual violence against women and girls and calls upon all parties to the conflict to protect women and girls from sexual and other forms of violence."
"The Council urged the Sudanese Government to implement all the recommendations set out in the resolution."
"Human rights issues, including sexual violence, are permanently addressed in the political dialogue conducted with the Government of Sudan, most recently in June, on the occasion of the demarche conducted by the European Union Troika in Khartoum, concerning the arrest of two staff members of accused of disseminating false information on sexual violence in Darfur."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply and for the information."
"However, I hope that he would agree with me that these atrocities in Darfur, where 180 000 people have been killed in two years and more than two million have been driven from their homes, need more urgent attention."
"Would the President-in-Office not agree that the international community, including the European Union, should do more, because this has gone on for far too long?"
". There is of course a desire for urgency, given the scale of the atrocities that appear to have been perpetrated in that country."
"It is clear that there can be no immunity for the people who have committed those crimes and those responsible must be brought to justice as a matter of urgency."
"That is why the European Union strongly supported the referral of Darfur to the International Criminal Court and I think that represented a significant milestone in the progress that we still wish to see."
"We have also made it clear that there must be full cooperation with the Court by all sides."
"The prosecutor has already decided, on 6 June, that he has sufficient evidence of the scope and nature of the crimes committed within his jurisdiction to mount a formal investigation and he has reached this decision independently."
"That is why, although I recognise the strength of feeling there is about urgent action on this matter, we must respect the fact that the Court is now in its investigation phase."
"It will need the support of the international community, and that includes the European Union, if it is to fulfil the mandate given to it by the Security Council."
"I can assure the questioner that I am acutely aware of the desire for a speedy conclusion, but I am confident that the way forward has been found through referral to the International Criminal Court."
"I can assure you of the continuing support for the International Criminal Court in its efforts to ensure that no-one can commit such terrible crimes with impunity."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Questions Nos 13 to 37 will be replied to in writing.(1)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Svensson (A6-0250/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on gender discrimination in health systems (2004/2218 (INI))."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying thank you for the opportunity given to me to draft this important report on gender discrimination in health systems."
"I wish to thank all those fellow Members who have shown great interest in, and commitment to, the report and made valuable contributions to it."
"The gender with which we happen to be born is as important a health factor as social, economic and ethnic background."
"The UN conferences in Cairo in 1994 and Beijing in 1995 put gender-related discrimination in health care on the agenda."
"Unfortunately, not much has happened since in the way of action, whether it be in the Member States or at EU level."
"Women’s health is still often seen as synonymous with sexual and reproductive health."
"Naturally, women’s health is more complex than that."
"I want to mention a few examples of gender discrimination."
"Women with acute heart complaints are still forced to wait longer than men for ambulance transport."
"The same types of heart disease still lead to higher mortality among women than among men."
"It is still the case that more men than women with sight problems are given the opportunity of having cataract operations."
"Violence against women, which is a major public health problem, is still an almost invisible phenomenon in medical training and practice."
"Men still constitute the norm in research and the development of new drugs."
"This report focuses in particular on two different areas."
"The first area is about submitting proposed measures to combat gender discrimination between men and women affected by the same or similar diseases."
"The other focus area is women’s health from the perspective of so-called ‘women’s diseases’, that is to say diseases that almost only affect women, for example breast cancer, osteoporosis, eating disorders in the case of young girls and violence against women in all its different forms – physical and mental abuse, genital mutilation, sexual slavery, prostitution etc."
"Gender discrimination becomes very clear to anyone able to study the research reports that exist."
"For example, an analysis of the work done at a health centre in Sweden specialising in skin diseases reveals that men and women are treated very differently. Men are given the more expensive light treatment, while women are sent home with a prescription for skin ointment."
"The conclusion in terms of costs is that, if women were treated in the same way as men, the resources expended on women would increase by 61%."
"If, on the other hand, the intensity of women’s treatment is taken as the norm, the cost of treatment would decrease by 33%."
"I might also mention that, in the example I cite, the doctors who discriminated between women and men in issuing prescriptions were women."
"This shows that gender discrimination permeates thinking in the case of both men and women."
"In order to combat gender discrimination, researchers and others must have access to gender-disaggregated health care statistics."
"Without information and knowledge, we cannot substantiate how, in reality, gender discrimination operates."
"Nor, without such knowledge, can we do anything about the problems."
"It really is high time that measures were taken enabling us to talk in terms of fair and equal care."
"Gender discrimination in health care is just as important a determinant as ethnic background and social and economic factors."
"This is something of which we must take account in future in our work to obtain fair and equal health care."
"I also wish to emphasise that access to sexual advice, reproductive health care and family planning are important tools in the service of women’s health, as well as of women’s opportunities to participate in society on equal terms and of combating poverty and the ongoing feminisation of poverty."
". Mr President, I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, and of course the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for the very important job which they have done in drafting this report."
"It is a fact that, from the day I took up office and became involved in health issues, I realised that there is indeed a gender dimension – a difference between the two sexes – in health issues."
"There is, for example, the question of smoking, where it now appears that there is an increasing tendency among women to smoke, especially young women and especially on the basis of the false promise that they can use smoking to control their weight. We know society's problems as far as young girls' weight is concerned and this is now being exploited in order to promote smoking."
"Then there is the question of HIV/AIDS."
"Unfortunately, the number of cases is increasing in the European Union among young people, especially women."
"This is also one of the most worrying factors about this illness."
"Then there is, of course, the question of alcohol, consumption of which is indeed rising at the moment thanks to alcopops, which target and are mainly consumed by women, with the social problems that this can cause."
"Of course, that is why I consider the report to be very important and both I and the rest of the Commission will take very serious account of the proposals contained in it."
"Of course, I must say from the outset that many of the issues touched on in the report falls within the competence of the Member States."
"Nonetheless, we have ways, such as proposals, recommendations, the open method of coordination and guidelines, with which we can develop a common policy between Parliament and the Commission in order to persuade the Member States to apply it."
"I also wish to refer briefly to two or three matters: in both the 2006 programme and the new health programme we shall take account and promote the gender dimension, exactly as the report proposes; on the question of smoking for 2006, we shall focus our attention on young women."
